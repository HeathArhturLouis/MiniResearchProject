 Vanishing Voices does a good job of showing how larger languages are destroying smaller ones, and the methods of language death.  This is all pretty much common knowledge.  However, the authors fail in their attempt to give a reason as to WHY language death is something with which we should be concerned.  The only argument they put forth is in a ecological/enviromental analogy, which says that biological diversity is good and stable, therefore, linguistic diversity must.  However, they only go part way in their analogy and reject natural selection for languages.  They also show that linguistic diversity corresponds to environmental diversity, but state this has nothing to do with the inexcessiblity of the areas.  The violin-playing and loaded words are hard to stomach if you are looking for good social science.  I would not suggest the book unless you are an ecological activist wanting to try to link your cause with "saving cultures" or with yet another critique of the West 
 This is an impossible diet--unless you are a King and Queen or a famous person who can afford all the proceedures listed in the book (lies).  I believe lipo is cheeper than doing this diet 
 Don't get me wrong with the 2 stars some songs here are really good.  Traffic UR Adagio For Strings Nyana  Those songs are just great and the best off the album. But songs like  Walking On Clouds Sweet Misery Love Comes Again Forever Today  can only be enjoyed so little times but they are good though.  No song here is annoying in the beginning and I see a lot of 5 stars and either they are just suckers for Dj Tiesto or they wrote the review as soon as they got it.  Cause after months of having this you will see yourself skipping to songs just to hear the good stuff.  Dj Tiesto shows he does a good job working with vocals but for a number 1 Dj I expect to be hearing his stuff for a long time before getting annoying  Verdict: 2.8 out of 5.0 Not bad for the first 20 listens but damn I could have enjoyed it much more 
 Not a very good book on any level. Not horrific, but overall really lame. A whodunit that you could never predict, because there was nothing to predict. It's like the author wrote the book and then when it came time to publish it, chose a character at random that 'did it' and wrote the last 10 pages. So save yourself some time, read the last few pages and make up your own adventure 
 AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!!!  IT IS NOT WIDESCREEN AS ADVERTIZED!!!!  I have ordered and returned this product 3 times. It is not widescreen. There is no option to for viewing it as widescreen.  Amazon has no explanation for the mistake and unfortunately they will not correct the web page.  This leads to an interesting question.  Why does Mr. Leach state in his review that the disk offers a widescreen option when it doesn't?  Either Amazon is massively screwing up the order or he is not reviewing this actual disk from Amazon.  If that's the case, he should not be providing a review on it.  
 Castro et al. are to Cuban history what Comrade Stalin and company were to Russian history and Joseph Goebbels and friends were to German history.  The title by itself is laughable.  Who, except for Castro cultists, really thinks that the U.S. military could not have beaten Castro's forces if it had been given the go ahead to do so?  As it was, the defeat of a force of less than 1500 Cuban exiles left stranded by the U.S. on Cuban soil is really a testament to President Kennedy's poor judgement rather than to Communist Cuba's military prowess.  For a truly balanced, historical account of the Bay of Pigs affair, read Peter Wyden's "Bay of Pigs: The Untold Story."  Then, for a study in propagandizing and myth-making, read this book 
 Spain becomes grist for the cracked mill wheel of Cees Nooteboom's mind. The book isn't  really about Spain, it's about the author and his obsessive fixation with certain Spanish topics.  He does this with painfully long  rambling descriptions of  various Spanish cultural icons that have caught  his attention, drilling down to the time when they first caught his  attention and the many times since then that he has pondered them.  The  topics themselves are interesting but almost irrelevant to the self  indulgent dredging of  the author's own mind.  You would learn more hard  facts about these topics from a museum brochure.  The twin pillars of this  tortuously slow moving narrative are the painter Zurban and Romanesque  architecture.  He drops and picks up these topics at random, throughout the  book, and prattles on about them as if he is possessed with a reoccurring  fever.  He also slathers his book  with an impressive amount of trite  clich√©s about Spain, Spain the land of contrasts, Castille La Mancha the  land of desolate panoramas, etc.  He goes on ad nauseum. He also plays a  little fast and loose with the few historical facts he deigns to use.  He  states that the aqueduct in Segovia was used until 1974; according to  Segovia's municipal web site it is still in use.  He states that Pizzaro  left from Extremadura with an invasion force for Peru; Pizzaro left from  Central America where he had been established for some years.  Obviously no  fact checker touched this book before publication.  There are many  wonderful books about Spain.  This isn't one of them 
 With this book, I was expecting Zinn to go into more detail about America in the 20th century, but it is essentially the 20th century chapters of People's History of the United States taken out and labeled as a new and different book. If you have an older version of Pepole History of the United States by Howard Zinn, the Twentieth Century might be good because of the chapters relating to the elder Bush and Clinton administrations. The rest of the chapters are in people's history. However, recent version the people history of the united states do contain the extra chapters so if it would be better  to just get a later version of People's History of the United States instead if you don't have a copy yet 
 This home theater package, despite being attractively priced considering its apparent functionality, is ultimately very disappointing.  I'm new to HDTV and HDMI so I didn't know as much as I needed in order to make a fully informed decision.  I have a Sony Bravia XBR3, Oppo upconverting DVD player, Scientific Atlanta HD box and Nintendo Wii game console.  This unit only offers pass-through video, so you have to have separate video connections from the receiver to the TV for each type of input (HDMI, component, etc.).  For the price difference between this and other receivers that will convert to a single connection, you'll pay in extra cabling costs.  The HDMI on this unit carries video only - no sound - so you have to have separate cabling to carry audio from your DVD or cable to the receiver, and then from the receiver to your TV.  Again, major inconvenience and lots of additional connections.  The manual for this unit is beyond terrible.  I'm astounded that an international consumer electronics firm like Sony would provide a manual as difficult to use and just indirect as this one.  For example, there was a hum when watching TV that turned out was because the speakers while looking identical are not - some are shielded and some aren't.  Nothing in the manual about this.    There are probably just enough HDMI and component connections for the basic user like myself.  Plus side is that there is no DVD player with this, so I can use my own.  Given a chance to do this again, I would spend a little extra on a unit that converts signals to a single output 
 This is a load of crap, don't even bother reading this one. Obviously he was one of the intelligence community that was listened to and relied upon heavily by this Administration. And I'm assuming Hussein is connected to all of his B.S. too! I bet the war hawks and war mongers loved this one!  At least the intelligence community let him print this one. I'll give him that much..

 It is obvious that the authors had pretty sound experience managing and working in virtual teams, but the book would benefit immensely if at least some arguments were based on scientific research.    For example, one of the major points the authors are trying to make is that face-to-face meetings are not critical for virtual team's performance--they actually claim that the book itself was written virtually, with three authors never meeting face-to-face.  It tells: the argument is delivered by the authors lacking both credibility and consistency.    Authors start off the introduction expressing a strong opinion--merely an opinion, no research to support it--that face-to-face meetings are needless waste of time and money.  Then, nearer to the middle of the book, they express some reservations and limitations to that claim.  And then in the second half of the book they provide a transcript of an interview with another virtual team manager that expresses an opinion to the contrary, with a list of things he would only do face-to-face!  Only in the last sentences of the book the authors finally refer to one piece of research dealing with face-to-face interaction, which would be much better placed in the introduction.  Only if you are really keen, you will dig up the truly reasonable thought on the subject, hidden deep in the discussion, away from the highlights and summaries: "If it is new and we haven't done it before and it requires creative thinking and needs full engagement, you need face-to-face.  If you are already up and running, you can get as much out of the remote team." (Page 154 of the hardcover edition.)  In the beginning of the book, the authors describe the concept of "divide and conquer" as an approach to managing the virtual work.  It seems the authors did exactly the same with the book.  They approached writing it as a pre-defined project as opposed to exploring uncharted waters, which writing a good book should be.  They assumed they had all the knowledge they needed when they embarked on the project--a very immodest assumption.  It is good that the book is based on experience--I did pick up some interesting ideas for my virtual team.  In particular, team building exercises run in virtual environment, feel like a fresh one.  Most observations are valid, but lack of bibliography does not exactly make them original.  Truly original observations, even though they are there, are not given enough attention (face-to-face brainstorming, some may argue) to be developed into solid arguments.  Index of terms in harcover edition is useless: the terms just aren't on the page quoted in the Index 
 I found this book to be highly disturbing.  If you're looking for a sultry read I would definitly NOT recommend. I am about as open minded and sexually liberated as they come and usually I thoroughly enjoy erotica.  However, I could not get past the first chapter of this book.  This is the first and only book I have ever returned and received a refund for within two hours of purchasing it.   Within the first chapter, the author begins depicting sex games between an adult male and 10 & 12 years old girls! She then describes the main charachter raping his daughters and forcing sexual acts on his sleeping son.  How is this "exquisite" literature?!? Would it be okay to purchase a video or a photograph of this happening? Condoning imagery of forced sex with children is far beyond acceptable imagery.  By allowing these kinds of images to be glorified we are saying "it's okay to think about children in a sexual way."  Not only is that disturbing but its not EROTIC!  That is terrifying!  There are a great many things we adults may fantasize about doing to each other.  There are plenty of people in the world who think even consenting adults shouldn't be able to control their own sex lives.  I am not one of those.  I do, however, feel that children have NO PART of adult fantasies.  I'm amazed that this book has come so far with people glorifying such sad acts as "erotica."  
 Yet another fantasy book set roughly in the time of the middle ages, who's characters are all animals. This is really getting old. Brian Jacques already made this genre popular with his Redwall series. The genre is becoming more derivative, and boring.   Perloo the Bold is about a young, out of shape rabbit, living in troubling times. The queen is dead and he has been framed. The story follows our young hero as he tries to prove his innocence and retake the throne back for the tyranny that has taken it over, hardly an original plot.   The book is a very easy read and most of the time totally predictable. The book feels very mundane, and contrary to the situation, Perloo is in, it also feels somewhat light hearted. The book also feels corny. It's filled with cheesy line such as "It's your destiny".    If you want read a good fantasy book revolving around animals pick yourself up a copy of Brian Jacques' Redwall series . 
 This film pulls together all of the arguments in favor of wal-mart.  There is also a very interesting conclusion on the undeniable good work that the company did in summer 2005 in the Katrina-ravaged regions.  However, none of the legitimate concerns of critics are given any thoughtful review.  I say this as a concerned conservative, who wants to understand the enormous changes occuring in my country, and not a liberal.  On the plus side, it is hard to argue against the business model of wal-mart:  it offers everyday low prices, which the company accomplishes by incredible and continual productivity gains - by some measures wal-mart is responsible for 25% of the productivity gains in the US due to its use of new technologies! - as well as vast scale economies in particular with globalisation.  Regardless of what critics say, these factors are the basis of the company's success:  consumers chose to buy there because of the prices and convenience.  However, this is the point when the film becomes disingenuous.  Anything that critics say is summarily dismissed by either a single and simplistic example, by some self-appoined talking head, by employees who like their jobs, or simply by people passing by on the street.  I found this pathetically unconvincing.   For example, because wal-mart is criticised as a destructive force against traditional town centers, the filmmakers find one town that was able to renew itself as a tourist spot with boutiquie stores and then assumes that that can happen everywhere (but the site was in the Blue Mountains, not in the Oklahoma dustbowl).  No statistics are offered, no additional proof, and no counter-arguments are acknowledged.     Moreover, it is easy to find people to spout the opinion you want to espouse by looking for them - to be sure, wal-mart critics do the same, but there are some critics who act like journalists and try to see what truth there is in the arguments advanced.  This film does not.   At one point, the filmakers interview a group of teenagers who state wal-mart wages would  "enough" for them (none of them work there), as if that refutes the experience of single mothers trying to make ends meet on wal-mart salaries!  They also get a few people to state that they never get asked to work overtime wothout pay as if that eliminates the need to investigate the claims of thousands of others who are winning multi-million dollar class-action lawsuits against that practice in their wal-marts.  Finally, some of the talking heads make the most ridiculous arguments.  One of them dismissed all the arguments of critics who charge that wal-mart urges its workers to use the welfare system as "those who advocate government health care anyway" - as if that negates their arguments!  By glossing over the details, they don't even make the case in  favor of the wal-mart business model all that well, let alone consider how the intallation of a wal-mart impacts entire communities.  As such, this film is for the convinced, for those who want to have their opinions reinforced rather than challenged.  That makes it like Fox news at its worst:  you know what you are going to get before you switch it on - pure opinion and little reporting - so why bother?  It isn't for learning.  The costs behind wal-mart's methods are not even open to question.  The one thing I took away from this is the sincerity of some of the employees, who genuinely believed in the company.    Overall, I cannot recommend this film, except as a pure ideological view in favor of this controversial company.   This doesn't do anyone any good - there is no chance for dialogue in this approach, no acknowledgment that critics can make legitimate points.  Whether powerful companies like it or not, they do not automatically deserve our trust, but instead our critical and constant scrutiny 
 Not in a long time have i had such a dislike for a movie as i do with Freeway. I am a fan of dark comedies so i thought i might check this movie out, it has reese witherspoon after all, how bad could it be? Well, really bad. First of all on a good note, reese witherspoon is good enough in the movie, although her character isn't all that likeable nor do you empathize with her all that much. But Reese does a good job with what shes given.  My main beef with the movie is that i would not call it a dark comedy. It's more like a comedy that also wants to be dark, graphic and serious, or a dark graphic serious movie that wants to be funny. The result is that it's a movie that doesnt know what it is or what it's trying to do. Both the funny parts and the serious parts are horribly mixed together in a way that it feels like two different movies fighting for the screen.  But hey, if you find being shot in the neck, or stiff lifeless grandmas with their throats slit and a horrified expression on their face to be funny, you just might like this movie 
 I THINK IS VERY DIDACTIC FOR MI I DO NEED MORE PRACTICE ON  EVERY ITEM FOCUSIN IN EACH CHIL  PROBLEMS DIFFERENT KIND OF  EXERCISES WIL BE MORE INTERESTING FOR ME AND THE KID AND NOT TO BE MORE REPETING EVERY ITEM THANK 
 It took me a while to get through this book. I kept losing interest and I would just set the book down and pick it up a few days later to continue reading it. So Professor Nikki Chase becomes involved in a 3rd murder mystery. How believable is that? Why not introduce new main characters into the Ivy League Series who solve mysteries? And why does it always have to be murder? Anyway, this "mystery" was too easy to solve. Nikki was always either at the right place at the right time or she would ask suspects numerous questions and they would give her the answers she wanted without any suspicion as to why she was concerned. Nikki's relationship with Dante Rosario is getting old and stale and I see no point in their relationship. I predict the 4th book in this series will be titled "Brown Bomber" and Nikki will again be involved in a 4th murder investigation at Brown University 
 Anxiously awaited this very expensive box of cards mostly for the special insert cards but there was only the Autograph card and NO MEMORABILIA CARD. You cannot realize the disappointment one feels when this happens. You look and look, searching through the wrappers and identify each card hoping that you missed it somehow, but no. No Memorabilia Card as promised right on the box and in all advertised articles. Of course, the Topps Company doesn't have a website for me to complain to but this did turn out to be a surefire way to find another hobby!  Thanks.  
 The only reason I'm reading this book is for school reading. Otherwise, I  would have put it down a long time ago. It's just the author venting about  his dislike for technology and how he thinks that it's going to destroy  mankind as we know it. I realized that the computer boom has its bad side  effects, but Slouka takes it to the extreme, and her repeats the same thing  over and over again. I don't find much value in his book except for  disagreeing with him. Please, spare yourself

 This being the first book I read by Danielle Steel I expected more than what I got since I love the moive verisons of her book. The start gives it hope but near the end you can sense the direction that the book is taking and I like alittle unpredicatable stuff 
 I was disappointed by "Beautiful Evidence". It seems to me to be a medium primarily for the reproduction of many gorgeous drawings, graphs, and tables done by others and the author, and an opportunity to make a rant on PowerPoint. Yes, many bad figures have been created and Dr. Tufte has made valid points and good suggestions, but they are not as densely presented as one would expect from his own words.  One of Dr. Tufte's main theses is a good figure has high information density, yet his text descriptions do not measure up to this standard. They are regularly repetitive or shallow. He even misses an opportunity to take his own advice when he presents the cancer rate data on p. 174 and then re-presents it as a new table on p. 176 in a better format. If he had used the concept he presented through the Bumps chart on p. 56, allowing lines for the cancer types to cross according to the values of the rates so each column is correctly ordered, relationships would have been even clearer.  Although tables can be dense with information, it is the very density that makes them difficult to interpret and understand. A beautiful, but very complex, figure created from all of complex table is not necessarily better at communication even if it is interesting or pleasing to look at. This is why so often figures are made from subsets of tables. The challenge to the presenter is to find what is important in the data and clearly present it.  I often felt attempts were made to find something auspicious to say about a well executed figure when nothing more than the "beauty is apparent" is needed.  Although I don't malign PowerPoint as Dr. Tufte does, I am not enamored of it either. However, faulting the program as he does seems to me akin to faulting a hammer for the bent over nails driven into wood. A better hammer might drive nails more easily, but it is the person wielding the hammer who has the primary controlling effect. Handing out a copy of "The Table of Casualties" to an audience would certainly put more information into their hands, but it will get little into their minds. It is up to the presenter to find a means of communicating the meaningful information to those who couldn't be bothered to study such data. Whether PowerPoint slides or Word reports are used, the presenter must consider the audience and how to get important details into their heads.   Spend time enjoying the figures and know good data presentation is hard 
 If you love "A Prairie Home Companion," it is fun to watch top stars perform with Garrison, and I admired how subtly he wove Lake Wobegon stories into the dialogue. However, if you expect movies to have plots, this flick isn't for you. No discernable rising action or climax, and the resolution was limp, as if Garrison ran out of ideas to tie up the direction he took the material. I wish GK had instead presented his annual joke show. Don't let the movie fool you if you've never heard "A Prairie Home Companion." It is a 100% entertaining radio show. The songs in the movie are well-performed and I was impressed with the peformances. Woody Harrelson, Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin can sing 
 I don't want to say I hate this album but, I won't say I like it either. For as long as it took for this to come out, I figured something may be worth looking at. In my opinion it's kind of boring. Most of the start of the album sounds the same. Without going overboard and writing a ridiculous long review. It's okay for the completist to add to the collection but, nothing really stands out. It's just Type O 
 Writers like Arundhati Roy love to write about conflicts.... the left in general loves the idea of a class struggle... because that is how the society in the West was for many years and still is in certain ways.. India has never been about that.. what one sees in India at every turn is reconciliation.. the amazingly accommodating nature of India enabling us to accept people from all religions, from all backgrounds etc. I believe that the essential nature of India is love... sadly, very few people recognize this and this book is the result.. shallow and abusive... We no longer seem to have the awe and respect for beauty and greatness... the "everyone and everything is equal" philosophy has destroyed our understanding of the world.  As Adi Shankara says, we are all equal but only when our mind evolves to the stage where we can conceive of the world in that fashion.  A materialistic loony who has plastic surgery every six months is not equal to Adi Shankara no matter what anyone might say.  As they say in my hometown,  Kahan Raja Bhoj, Kahan Gangoo Telli 
 If you are at the top of your profession, totally successful, financially secure, surrounded by hot babes, driving a Porsche, AND you have a desire to stop drinking, this is your book.  Wait, on second thought, that is the whole book.  You can read this review or blow $12 and read the longer version.  Your choice 
 This book is simply unfortunate. Firstly, if this book is the first book you have read by this author, and if you are so disappointed by it that you do not want to read any of his other work you will be doing yourself a grave disservice. When Coelho writes from his heart and not his vanity he is an amazing storyteller. Thus, this book is not representative of some of his previous work, which is quite excellent. With this book it seemed that he felt that people love his books so much that they would also love reading about his process in writing his books, and not just that he uses the book as an autobiographical tale. Major problems for me with this book were that clearly the author and the main male character are one in the same. Coelho never admits this, but he has flagrantly made the character so similar to himself that it is insanely ridiculous that he is not recognizing this as an autobiography of some sort. Secondly, the characters are dreadfully and tediously boring, and mentioning the Eiffel tower, his success, fame, money, loyal readership, and open marriage a gazillion times doesn't change this fact. Thirdly, he somehow has convinced himself that breaking up with someone that you have spent a decade of your life with, and then thinking about them and missing them is obsessive instead of a natural part of grieving a broken heart, this makes the whole zahir story line quite ridiculous. Fourth, what has come across as bits of insightful wisdom in his other books seem forced and contrived in this story, because everything else in the book is so ludricrous. Lastly, the story of his missing/runaway wife made no sense to me, and no matter how much I tried to sympathize with something in the storyline I was not able to. If you are interested in knowing many details, however boring they may be, about the author's life this book will fulfill what you are looking for. Otherwise, I agree that it really is something to be borrowed, because paying for this book would be a sad waste of money, and you would already be wasting your time by reading it. Why waste both 
 This weight bench is too short and is almost impossible to use in a completely horizontal postion. You would have to be a little kid for it to work. After working along time to put it together I found neither me nor my 6'2" kid could use it effectively 
 Jeff Buckley sounds like what Marc Bolan would have sounded like if Bolan had taken Perry Como as his musical muse.  Seriously, think about Marc Bolan trying to sound like a '50's crooner and you'll know what Jeff Buckley sounds like 
 I wrote a huge review for this and don't know where it is but let me give you the short version.  They don't continue the story, that is until the end of the movie.  AND THAT WAS THE PART TRHAT RUINED THE MOVIE FOR ME. The movie is about this kid from the wudang sword school and he is going to get married.  Enter the Bride.  She of course doesn't want anybody to be happy so...  The story is not really worth going over, it is just injected and there are no real emotions.  Except of course for an ending that really PO'ed me.  The only reason this movie gets a 2 stars and almost gets a 3 is for Christy Chung.  Not only is she one of the most beautiful women on earth, she is a great actress.  So I know of 2 movies now that are only worth watching for her, this and Red Wolf.  It may be because the people she works with are so terrible, but to tell the truth, Christy Chung actually made me pop this dvd in for a second time.  Not a big deal since it was only like a 77 minute long movie.  
 Some of this book is good and normally I love Suzanne Summers but.... A few comments like " no wonder men leave us for younger woman". Like what is that about? Woman need to feel better for themselves not some guy. Does she not know men also have hormonal problems and aging? When I ran into a few comments like that in the book it turned me off. Woman need to feel good about themselves and look good for themselves first. I just felt the book was a push for the S Principle Book and to be hot for your guy.  Usually her stuff is good but I wasn't crazy about this one. Sorry nothing new in this book. Maybe helpful to someone else. Jud 
 We bought this gadget for our 2-year old. To risk sounding like a broken record--or faulty spinning plastic toy, in this case--I'll just add my vote to the design flaws:  1. Volume. Not only is the volume loud, it's unbearably so. Even my daughter grabs her ears when she's playing on it. The voice is a bit garbled as well, so when the command 'Ready..Spin!' sounds more like 'Wordy...SPEW!' I prefer to spare my daughter's hearing loss for live concerts in her teenage years, so I've disabled the on/off switch.  2. Spin quality. A Sit n' Spin should have a fluid, effortless motion (like a lazy susan). This toy requires enormous effort to turn. To add to my daughter's frustation, the handle's base gives a bit (even with screws tightly fastened), making for a tedious experience rather than the joy ride we loved as kids.   Spare the expense and the frustration of fitting this thing in the garbage can on collection day--buy an easel and finger paint kit instead. 
 This case is actually made for fourth generation models and although it is being advertised as being for the fifth, the case is too big for a snug fit. It works, but I didn't spend this money for something that was advertised as being made for the new Ipod. Real scam 
 I originally wrote a relatively favorable review for this book because it seemed to incorporate the best of the original Butler's Lives (a focus on meditating on the life of the saint) and the new calendar of saints (including many recent canonizations).  While it does do the second, I am afraid to say that it is woefully inadequate regarding the first.  In fact, it is probably just as bad as the Atwater/Thurston edition.  For instance, here is part of the section from January 27th on St. Angela Merici: "Accounts of her [St. Angela Merici's] childhood make her pious, rebelling against the fashions of the age, devoted to the legend of St. Ursula, and the recipient of a vision showing a great company of virgins and other saints coming down from heaven to her.  They included a dead sister, who invited her to form a great 'Company of Virgins,' which was what Angela had actually done by the time the account was written."  In other words, the author wants to point out that the story "must" not be true because it wasn't written down until after the alleged vision had been fulfilled.  Now, we are certainly not bound to believe all the accounts in the various lives of the saints, but I do not understand the point of drawing attention to the alleged falsity of a tale in the context of a meditative reading.  If the work seeks to be encyclopedic, it is much too short and you should check on the 12-vol. counterpart, but for a daily meditation (which it seems reasonable to assume such a work is designed to be), such statements are misplaced.  If the story is too absurd to be believed, just don't include it.  As a result, it is disappointing because it would be useful to have a modern Butler's that can be used for a daily devotional or meditation.  Instead, we are left with the old works that do not match the current calendar 
 As a piece of entertainment, this book falls flat. Way flat.  There is a story here, but mundane sub-plots (including the love story) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book.  I found myself skipping pages - lots of them - to get to the point.  Overall, very disappointing.  
 My main problem with this book is that the author makes sweeping statements and claims about the role of various forms of popular culture in various eras without providing any historical data or close analysis of any popular culture from those times. Instead, he promisciously cites a very broad range of theorists to back up his otherwise groundless assertions 
 I have Cherokee lineage and decided to learn our history, which was not passed down in our family, so I got this book to read in good faith.  The author makes us sound like a bunch of backward, bloodthirsty, superstitious people, and our women to be a bunch of promiscuous (...).  There is little in the book of the trail of tears, and much of what is written prior to it gets off into flights of fancy and imagination of the author, who believes he can mind read for people dead over 150 years.  When he does get around to the actual trail of tears (the last sixth of the book) he briefly accounts what facts or accounts there were, and gets into how not that many people really died, and the Federal Government is being portrayed in a bad light historically.  He also portrays the Cherokee Nation's history as rising and falling with the beginning and ending of his book, treating the Cherokee as a quaint, dead culture and people.  It saddens me that college students are being given this to read.  I learned nothing about my culture and our history from this book 
 I have found that most tribute albums are lame and why not just listen to the original.This one is just awful. But there are exceptions.  So when I first heard about the project of a tribute to Grover Washington , I thought how do you cover God, because Grover was like a God to contemporary jazz.  WOW! What an album! OK, nobody had to write any songs on this, but they all put their own spin on each song and did a fabulous job.  Jason Miles produced this fresh off two grammy nominees for his 2000 release tribute CD to Ivan Lins ( Sting won for his version of "She Walks This Earth" while Grover was nominateed for "Cameleo " ).  First the lineup is just stellar: Regina Belle , Gerald Albright, Russ Freeman, Ronnie Laws with Sounds Of Blackness, Herbie Mann, Tom Schuman and Jeff Mironov, Dave Koz, Everette Harp, Steve Cole, George Duke, Mark Whitfield, Richard Elliot, Jay Beckenstein with Dean Brown, Paul Taylor with Peter White, Chuck Loeb with Dave Mann, Chaka Khan, Greg Philinganes with the New York Philharmonic String Section, and Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, Joe Sample with Joey Defrancesco.  If you'd pick up an album with all of these guys on it and it wasn't all Grover tunes you'd buy it! In fact you'd probably have a huge grin on your face and tell half the store about your lucky find on the way to the cash register. So now imagine all these guys playing their version of all these great Grover tunes like: "Just The Two Of Us" , "Winelight", " East River Drive" , "Inner City Blues ", " Come Morning " , " Let It Flow" and more.  I can see you smiling and saying yeah I'd buy it and you should. " To Grover , with Love " is magnificent ! It's good. It's great.  It's deadly gorgeous !!  
 Mr. Patterson: Please demonstrate more discretion in selecting ghost writers for your pulp fiction publishing machine.  Ms. Paetro: Don't quit your day job.  If you are looking for character development, descriptive scenes, engaging voice and style, believable conflict, romantic or who-done-it suspense, balanced point of view, entertaining pace, and (or) suspension of disbelief, this is not a book deserving of your time or money.  If your idea of pacing is 146 chapters spread across 400 pages, or if the lame pet dog character foil trick works for you, be sure to buy this book at Amazon's used book prices 
 I bought this set for my daughter. The bedding is such a poor quality, that my daughter won't sleep in her bed.  She says the sheets are itchy.  The comforter is so hard it is like a big piece of cardboard.  I WOULD NOT RECOMEND this set to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 This books has lots of detailed information. However, I felt that it lacks code examples, explaining the textual descriptions 
 I do not know where these women got their credentials, but they are WAY off the mark!  DO NOT LIE ON YOUR RESUME!  No matter what this book recommends!  For instance, the authors state: "If your offical title is Tech Level I, you might be responsible for database administration, PC support, and webmaster duties.  If you're hoping to move into DBA, list 'database administrator' as the job title and as the first bullet describe your responsibilities in this function."  Wrong, wrong, wrong!  As a hiring manager and interviewer, if I discover you lied about your job title, especially when you were a Tech I and you claimed to be a DBA, I will wonder what else you lied about.  And believe me, I'll find out when I call your previous employers to verify your employment history.  No, instead, when in this situation, downplay, emphasize the job title you want, and even omit your job titles, and use the opportunity to emphasize your skills.  That way, even if you don't have the right job title, you can demonstrate to me that it doesn't matter.  But NEVER, EVER lie or deliberately mislead anyone.  Then they'll just feel like you were trying to trick them, which is NOT very impressive 
 So ... I now learn that the infertility problems I had for many years, which I always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were ACTUALLY due to the fact that I hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood. And my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood. And, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as Dr. Northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin.   There is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid AVOIDABLE problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural,  mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong.  
 This is worse than Kumbya over and over and over again. 
 I'm sorry, but this book went way over my head. Was this the plan, or am I just not up to all this 
 Koontz is one of the best writers of fiction today, but Cold Fire and Hidaway are two of his worst books in my opinion.  Not much there.  Readable but I would check these out from the Library before you add them to your collection.  Ironically I own Hard Cover copies of both of these books.  I made the mistake of buying them when they first came out because I was a big fan of his other works.  I don't own  much fiction in my library and I would gladly swap these two books for Hard Copies of Dragon Tears or The Bad Place.  I will trade both for a Hard copy of Swan Song by Robert R. McCammon 
 A few years ago, I read Carole Matthews' first big U.S. hit 'For Better or For Worse'. While not electrified by the humor or characters, I did enjoy it. I can't say the same for this attempt.  For one, the plot is ridiculously boring. It moves about as quickly as a snail on sleeping pills. After the initial revelation concerning her boyfriend's disgusting betrayal (he put nude pictures of her on the internet to help his failing web site), Matthews apparently decided to take a breather from the action and focus on... well, I'm not entirely sure. She introduced a lot of really unlikable characters and one nice but boring one. Oh, and she wrote a lot of scenes involving our heroine crying in her bathrobe.   Now, I love chick lit as much as the next girl; I wasn't expecting Shakespeare. But if you want a funny, sweet, entertaining beach read, then go somewhere else. My suggestions? For humor, try Elizabeth Young. For sweet stuff, try Cecilia Ahern.   Bottom line: Don't bother 
 In this book, Gladwell reaches the astounding conclusion that EXPERTS know more than other people. That if you spend YEARS doing something, or researching it, or training, you will be able to spot more details than others. A real eye-opener. 
 This is a filmography, not a biography. This book focuses almost entirely on Kurosawa's and Mifune's films, giving almost no insight into what their lives were like, or what they were like as people. The first half of this 800-page book is an interminable series of synopses of their early works -- films of significance today only as harbingers of much greater things to come. (Particularly annoying is the author's endless quoting of contemporary reviews from "Variety.") The second half still focuses primarily on the films and the minutiae of their production, but provides some substance about K&M's personal lives. However, it is not nearly enough to get a clear picture of Mifune and Kurosawa as real-life people. We, the readers, always feel like fans still observing the two legends from a distance, learning almost nothing of their personal lives. For instance, barely half a page is spent on Mifune's wedding, and essentially nothing is written about his wife, Sachiko.  In addition, although this is a dual biography-the justification being that Mifune and Kurosawa did their best work together-Mr. Galbraith fails to convey what kind of relationship, whether personal or professional, the two had. Rather, the book's focus alternates from one to the other between chapters. A glaring omission in this regard is a failure to examine their famous falling out. The overly cautious author only hints that it was due to Mifune's reluctance to be tied down by the perfectionist director's lengthy shoots ("Red Beard," their last film together, took 2 years to film), that Mifune, once he gained fame, preferred quick, easy-money projects to support his luxurious lifestyle. However, almost no anecdotes are given to illustrate this or any other aspect of their relationship.    In summary, the definitive English-language biographies of Mifune and Kurosawa have yet to be written 
 I've read all sorts of books throughout my educational career...from James Joyce to dry sociological texts. I've read books so dull I could feel them sapping my life energy. Never before, though, have I had to suffer through a book as mind-numbingly awful as 'Member of the Wedding.' Mere words cannot communicate how bad this book really is. It follows the pathetic, worthless existence of Frankie, the most unlikeable, irritating, sorry excuse for a human being ever to disgrace a piece of literature. This book reads like a bad Linkin Park video, and consists largely  of Frankie whining about wanting to belong, and wanting to travel with her older brother, who is about to get married. The ONLY thing I can say for this book is that it is relatively well-written...obviously, Carson McCullers was a good writer. But Thomas Harris wrote 'Silence of the Lambs' and the he wrote 'Hannibal.' 'Hannibal' is a god-awful book, and it STILL doesn't approach the level of putridity reached by this claptrap.  Of course, many reviewers would have you believe that this book is about the awkwardness/isolation/loneliness of acolescence. Bull. I was an awkward/isolated/lonely teen, and I did strange things, but Frankie's actions are downright bizarre, inexplicable, and only serve to make you loathe her further. For absolutely no reason, the author kills off a couple characters at the end, just to make sure that if you weren't suicidally depressed by the book by that point, you sure wouldn't have a reason to live after finishing the whole book. Like I said, think bad Linkin Park song: garish, whiney, needlessly depressing, and completely pointless. There is no message here except that there is no hope, no moral except that life is empty, pointless, isolated, and lonely. I'm a big fan of literature/music/art that emphasizes such themes as isoltation and abandonment...and thus, I tend to enjoy such works even if they're pretty lousy. This, however, was the bottom of the barrel in cheap, exploitative, pathetic, useless literature. If you want to read something that deals with isolation/abandonment/loneliness, read Eugene O'Neill's 'The Iceman Cometh' 'Long Day's Journey into Night' or 'The Hairy Ape' I promise you will find all much more well written and moving than this garbage. In conclusion, when I finished reading this vile book, I hated the main character, I hated the human race, I hated  the author responsible for my suffering; but most of all, I hated myself, for subjecting myself to this bloated corpse of a novel. Read it on the toilet, or better yet read something GOOD and save this to use as toilet paper. Consider it an appropriate afterthought 
 Intersting style of writing as previouse reviewer indicated and at the same time obviouse he had no idea of what an option was. For anyone with the slightest knowlege of options it becomes apparent that the main purpose of this book is to get one to purchase Mr Groenke's option software. With out it which he constantly referes to, his formulia's would result in endless hours of tedious calculations. After spending $29 on this book and finding it is really a primar for his software would be disapointing to anyone trying to get a basic understanding of how selling options works. His software may be great and worth the money but its a little misleading to promote this book as a stand alone. I'm not a reviewer, just someone that buys and mostly sells options and can't figure how anyone could give this 5 stars, or buy this book without understanding you really need his software to get any benifit from the book. That of course assumes your not a proffeser sitting in an office somwhere as opposed to really utilizing options 
 Warner television should have discontinue this title after releasing Season 10 which they didn't. although this Item had been in sale for a long period on amazon.com, but buying this even for 6 dollars is totallt waste of money cause all the stuff are available on season 10! It could be worth if it was a real limited or collectors ediotion, packed with some extra stuff such as slip cover, collectible booklet, journal or something like that. but it was so far not a limited edition though. It had even no insert card! I can see this brilliant LIMITED EDITION! I think there is over a billion copies that they beg people to buy it in lowest price possible and still they have copies to sell 
 Well, before buying this I had never even heard of bright eyes.  Just so you know my background, I generally dislike indie and Emo.  I usually listen to hardcore and Screamo.  But for some reason I became interested in this band.  (or person) Someone compared a CD of their's to A Death Cab CD.  Me being a pretty big Death Cab fan, I decided to go out and buy this EP to see if I liked this band at all.  This review is the result of that listen.  The EP opens up with the slow acoustic guitar picks of "a line allows prgress"...  A few seconds into the song I am greeted with with drums and an organ.  This song sounds like a slower Cursive song.  The guy's voice sounds decent.  I guess the vocal effects he uses are for emotional purposes.  Overall this is a pretty decent song.  It reminds me of hotel california.  Next in line comes one of my favorite tracks on here:  "a perfect sonnet".  I don't know if it's the simple guitar stum or the sense that his voice is going to explode any moment.  Seriously, the whole song I was thinking that everything was about to fall apart...but it didn't.  He keeps going and going.  It must be his voice that creates this mood.  This was also the point of the CD where I realized that it was a bit more than music I was listening to.  Bright eyes will make you feel moods that other music can't.  It's got a unique brand of emotion that is new to me.  It's too bad this song ends so quickly.  As I press on to: "on my way to work" I begin to get the feel for the CD.  He's almost whispering on this track.  There's an odd sounding guitar picking and a country sounding synthesizer.  Quite frankly, I hate this song.  It sounds like an offkey country ballad...  Who wants that?  The next two tracks are more or less the same feel.  A new arrangement provides better quality music than the craptastic on my way to work, but doesn't reach the level of A perfect sonnet.  Finally, the EP is ended with the techno atmospheric: Neely o hara...  I don't know what to say.  It's meaningless.  I don't see how you can like this.  It's just pointless.  Overall this is a half and half EP.  The first two tracks are good...  But the rest of the CD falls between failing and decent.  If Bright Eyes good churn out more tracks like a perfect sonnet, this band would get at least a 4 star.  Sadly thats not the case.  So I don't recommend this for anyone other than the really dedicated fans.  Perhaps the other CD's are better 
 like the other reviewer, i don't think i got the correct filters. i didn't open mine, but these don't look like the typical filters with the familiar monitor on top. i've heard rumors that the filters with the monitor are no longer being produced, but i hope not... i chose to return this item and purchase a dented box item which i hope are the correct filters. if PUR stopped making the monitored pitchers, i'm gonna be very upset...  IN ADDITION, the description on the box i received said that these filters are for water coolers and bottles - it said NOTHING about compatibility with pitchers, unlike the description.  UPDATE 4/16/2007: i contacted PUR regarding the filter compatility. the company says that all newer pitchers accept the CRF-950Z. however, since june 2006, the filters "no longer have the u-shaped life indicator on the top." and that SUCKS. maybe it didn't work well, but i suspect financial incentives for that elimination. the email came from [...] - we should all complain 
 Next to reading "The Man in the High Castle", I was prepared to read something as deep and as drawn out as that Hugo winning quasi-science-fiction novel from the same author. "Martian Time-Slip" is described as being similar in nature to that style of writing. I also discovered "Clans of the Alphane Moon", "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" (Blade Runner), "Ubik" and "The Simulacra", all of which are 5 star reads, "Martian-Time Slip" comes highly recommended because it is in the top twenty science-fiction books, Orion Publishers and the SF Masterworks series listing it as #13 in their collection. Unfortunately I was surprised by how little I enjoyed any of it and in fact I hated a lot of it, however the author should be credited and published for creating this world, but as for reading it... well that is a totally different matter. This is an oddity, more for collectors than readers. I am glad to have it in my Philip K. Dick collection.... However, it is at the back of his collection.  Mars is populated by settlers from Earth, starting a new world there, with Bleekmen Martians, like primitive man, selling trinkets to earthlings, who mostly need clean water, which is owned by the waterworks manager, Arnie Kott, who has acquired a former mentally ill repairman, Jack Bohlen, to plug into the mind of an autistic boy, Manfred, who might be able to see the future and tell him why the UN wants to buy in on Mars soil. Jack's father arrives from Earth, turns out to be a prospector and Jack ends up double-crossing Kott, over and over again in alterative universes, until he figures what is going on and by that stage you just don't care because there is no ending, there is no science-fiction, the politics and extraterrestrial real estate scams became moot long ago, the penetration of the mysteries of being and time totally abstract to the point of meaninglessness anywhere else except in Dick's mind, then we get his over-excuse for adultery neatly wrapped in a package "Sleep with other people so that you get to know what your spouse is doing right and wrong", Dick who happens to have been married five times, really doesn't come across as that faithful to his characters and his alter-ego chews through them, mostly sexually, and quite disturbingly, ending up in a Dick book that doesn't quite have the same panache as anything I have read from him before.  Even though "Martian Time-Slip" puts forward some very interesting notions that make you think ah, here it comes, the plot or the twist, it never really does. Instead you end up with an extended soap opera on Mars, not that this is a bad idea, Dick writes good soap into his science-fiction ("Clans of the Alphane Moon" does it well), but the soap here pretty much envelops any science-fiction under all the smut and suds that come out of nowhere around page 100 and continue to dominate the later half of the book with the theories discussed in pages 70 to 100, never going anywhere, after the huge 70 page opening, yes many of you will be wasting your time, characters are introduced far too slowly, jacked around half way through the story and replaced by new characters towards the end, meaning what you have covered so far has been lost to the warping and bending of time in the story, unfortunately not working out as a good read, but maybe as good writing, and certainly Philip K. Dick can not be faulted for his literature skills, dialogue or introduction of descriptions that should have occurred towards the start of the book, we don't mind all of this, but the story thus is boring, without centre and does not deliver on a payoff like the last two or three pages of "The Man in the High Castle." It isn't like that work at all. This is a self-serving science fiction rant to explain the author's own problems with mental health and infidelity.  As many of you know Dick can be more suggestive than fleshing out those suggestions. Here he makes a suggestion that quite frankly we are not in the least bit interested in because of the way he puts it forward, that some people's mental illness can be confused with people who really have special talents, but the story boxes this concept into replaying a scene a couple of times over again in variation each time, the Martian Time-Slip explained by changes in people's perceptions, this concept comes up in the middle of the book, then takes a back seat to more suds and soap about adultery... and never emerges again. I am glad to be free of this book. That is not a good sign.  It hurts me to say this but... "Martian Time-Slip" stinks. Only get it to see into the mind of a science-fiction writer beginning to question the depths of the mind and reasons for his own unfaithfulness. If you want to learn more about Dick through his work, then certainly this has lots of insight, but the story, not even close to what he is capable of doing.  I am going to move onto "A Scanner Darkly" next. Hopefully that will go a bit better than this one did. Five stars all the way and then this bumpy ride. Only get this Philip K. Dick if you have read everything else. Comes nowhere even close to #13 place that Orion SF Masterworks gave it 
 The 1 star is for Penguin, because the cover does not warn you that the content has been sharply abridged.  Darwin's thinking and writing are wonderful -- but grossly and unfairly cut to ribbons 
 This book seems to lack a voice. Considering that it is mostly quotes from other(and better) books about the german fighting man, it just didn't seem to flow well. The writing style reminded me of the terrible english papers I wrote for basic college writing. Besides that, it seemed like 50% of the quotes came from the Forgotten Soldier, making this book feel like a cliff notes version of Sajer's. In the time that it would take you to slog though this book, you could read two or three first hand accounts and form your own opinions 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 The advices in this book are very blend. This book is far inferior when compared to books like "Advice for a young investigator" or "A PhD is not enough. 
 I found this book a presumtious, hypocritical waste of tree. I found his ideas to be heavily influenced by patriarchal society. This man should not be allowed to quote Tillich but since he did he should have at least done the man justice. His attempt to define the role of sexuality in these instances were meager. See Thomas Moore for an excellent look into sexuality and human relationships. Use this book for a coaster 
 I have read all twelve of these books and hoping there will be more. The language is pretty graphic but they are so funny you can usually ignore those words. These books can cause you embaesment, since I read where ever I have to sit and wait and you burst out laughing people do stare and wonder if you are losing it. Please we would all like to see more of these 
 THIS IS NOT THE CD SEEN ON TV.........THIS CD CONTAINS ONLY 18 SONGS THAT ARE EDITED AND NOT THE REAL SONGS. I WASTED MY MONE 
 Definitely not for younger children.  Best for advanced readers and children with lots of years experience in coloring.  However, by the time most readers would understand the text, those same readers would probably not be that interested in coloring, so I am not at all sure what interest bracket this book would fall into.  
 This book is extremely well done and educational.  It is not, however, for anyone who does not favor macro-evolution (i.e. darwin's theory) or the "Big Bang" theory.  The book focuses heavily on these things.  Those who believe in "Creationism" - God created the world and all living things - should probably steer clear of this one.    
 Nostalgia struck me when I saw the book of Fractured Fairy tales from the Rocky and Bullwinkle show. Even though I found the stories  amusing, the lack of ANY pictures from the Rocky and Bullwinkle show ruins the book 
 I have been doing a lot of reading on Welles for a research project and while it is clear that Welles was no angel, this book seems to go out of its way to put Welles in the worst possible light.  There are too many flights of fancy and liberties taken.  For example, based on no evidence Thomson suggests that not only did Welles have sexual relations with Dorothy Commingore but that he practically raped her.  Perhaps the book reveals more about the author than it does about its subject.  There are some useful takes  on lesser known figures like John Toland but on the whole it is a book to take with several grains of salt 
 I, also, must second Mark Twain. This book is a waste of time! Why do teachers make us read it when we should be reading Tolkien, GK Chesterton, CS Lewis, and the like? Agh. Then, that could just be my wacky taste in novels...   But this was bad. Oh my gosh!!! The descriptions were ALWAYS needlessly long, the conversations ALWAYS needlessly long, the... blah, blah, blah, blah. That's what the whole thing was. Blah. The whole plot could have been totally condensed to a hecka short 200 pg novel and it would have been a million times better! Maybe even good! And I like long books!   This book is terrible. Listen to the warning of a fellow voracious reader and do not waste your time! 
 One Star is evidently the required minimun. This documentory, in my opinion, distorts the facts and does so for policical purpose and personal agenda.  If you are looking for the truth, you won't find it here.  There are people who, by exploiting the ignorance and stupidity of other Americans, spread mis-information for one or more reasons: for personal or political agenda, or both; and/or, in some cases, such action either aids or supports the enimes of our country. This is a prime example of the type of people who intelligent Americans consider Anti-American as evidenced by the nature of their words, acts, and reasoning. They have a right say their piece and present their documentary, regardless of their motive. CAUTION: Beware of those who intentionally spread misinformation as they have harmful ulterior motives! When a person, organization, or government wants to see America harmed and Americans dead, I, being an American, consider their comments as a serious threat to Americans, American interest and America's security. Americans who doen't consider such declorations as a threat are either stupid/ignorant people or my enemy; there is no third option.        
 I was very disappointed by the book.I wanted an explanation for Israels continuing occupation of Palestinian lands but got only apologistic rhetoric from this obvious pro zionist.Much of his writing I thought quite racist and certainly biased 
 There is no one in sports that I love more than MJ, being a Bulls fan since the 1960s.  I still love Michael, but this book was a supreme disappointment.  By and large, it is an all too detailed history of the design and sales success of his shoes and newer clothing line, peppered with Michael's passages about being determined and "driven", which all ring true, but have been stated many times before and in better form.  If you really want to learn about MJ, I would suggest Playing for Keeps by David Halberstam or The Golden Boys by Cameron Stauth, which profiles the members of the 1992 Olympic Dream Team.  The profiles on MJ and the other team members are probably the best I have read on elite professional athletes.  If you want some great photos and a book written by MJ, Rare Air is much better than this one.  
 If you read the dedication, you understand why she wrote this book.  However, she has placed too much emphasis on her agenda, and that really distracts from the hetero relationship of the book.  Like another reviewer below, I love her books, but don't think this is her best romance novel.  I really didn't care about either person in the hetero relationship, and was far too distracted by the other relationship in the book.  I understand that she may want to promote understanding and compassion for gay relationships, but I don't read romance novels to get schooled in liberal thought (and didn't need an education in broadmindedness).  I read them for hot, steamy hetero couples.  Frankly, I didn't like the setting for this one (a movie stage), either.  The last time she did a book based on acting/the stage ("Heart Throb"), I was equally unimpressed.  I thought the male lead was wimpy, which is why I'm such a fan of the Seal books she has done.  This Seal book is definitely a let-down 
 I was more interested in the essence of the idea of going without most unnecessary material wants for a year. Too much fill in with political opinions and off track non related pulled out of nowhere information. Very obvious the author needed more material to constitute a book 
 The actual bag itself was great.  However, the time frame it took to recieve the bag was not.  I ordered this bag and three weeks later it came.  I had to go buy a bag to take on vacation.  kind of defeated the purpose 
 There are parts of this book which are utterly engrossing.  Rosemont constructs a fine narrative of events.  Perhaps I should say "events", as it is at times researched like a eighth-grade paper.  Lots of conjecture, unsupported speculation, hearsay and other aspects of irresponsible scholarship.  Mr. Rosemont freely admits that there is frustratingly little concrete evidence about much of Hill's life, but he chooses to try and flesh out a lengthy book anyways.  This is exasperating at times as when one is forced to try and endure each and every tedious mentioning of the drawn or painted art of Joe Hill, despite the lack of much actual material (surviving anyways).  However, by doing this he touches on many peripheral aspects of Hill's life that have gone by and large unnoticed till now, but which are much easier to verify than the sketchy details about Hill himself.  Several mentions of correspondence, lives affected by Hill, and reactions to Hill's art, and many others tidbits of information are thrown out for more or less the first time in cohesive form.  Less cohesive, and downright teasing at times, are many starts and stops of several ideas that would be very interesting on their own.  The Wobbly influence on the beat poets, the slighting of the IWW by other revolutionary and pseudorevolutionary groups (rarely written about from a fellow worker's perspective), and others seem like promising beginnings for reading but then are waded into only ankle-deep.  At one point when abandoning a topic Mr. Rosemont even suggests that it would be a good idea for further research, by someone else.  All in all a fairly decent read but could have used prodigious editing and some fact-checking with standards higher than those of the NY Times 
 	I read this book on the recommendation of two close friends - both of whom are retired English teachers - and both of whom should have known better.  It is one of the most disappointing books I have ever had the misfortune to read.  Although other reviewers have commented on some of the same things, I think the book is so bad they bear repeating. 	The characters are so thinly drawn as to be stick figures.  The ambitious young professional woman, the used-up poet turned to drink, the insecure young wife, and the brother who main functions seem to be the guy who brings the boat and to be the near recipient of a "quickie on the rocks."  Who could possibly care about any of them?  Without anyone to care about, the author has no chance of developing suspense and eliciting an emotional response from her readers.  	Switching back and forth between two stories in alternating chapters can work as a plot device, but its success depends upon the two stories being brought together in some convincing fashion at the end.  This doesn't happen, and as if that's not enough, the present day chapters are further split by references to the 1873 murder scattered throughout them.  Clumsy and distracting are the best things one can say about the plot development. 	Even though this is a novel, its characters should behave within the scope of believable human actions.  Asking your husband when he first met the woman you suspect he may be having an affair with is believable; asking him the question when you're in the midst of trying to save yourself and family members in a violent storm at sea is not.  There are other examples of forced dialogue, but this is among the most outrageous. 	Lastly, subtlety is obviously not Ms. Shreve's long suit.  The androgynously named child, Billie, is the only one to suffer the consequences of everyone else's failings.  Gee, is this really the death of innocence?  It's about as nuanced as the murderer's ax on Smuttynose.  And how about the danger of  humorless puritans in the face of  real or supposed sexual variations?  Who would have thought it?   	So why has the book been as popular as it is?  It appeals to the world view of certain young moderns:  Sex is the driving force behind all human actions, the brooding woman is the most fascinating creature in view, and a civility devoid of human feeling is to be prized.     	The Norwegian characters in the historical murder prompt one last reaction.   In downtown Oslo is the Vigelund Sculpture Park.  It is populated with the large and brooding sculptures of Gustav Vigelund, a local sculptor whose work is appreciated almost nowhere else on earth.  If one spends anytime there, one comes away gloomy, perplexed, and with the certain knowledge that an afternoon has been wasted.  Save yourself the expense of a trip to Norway - read The Weight of Water instead 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again. 
 I bought one of these when I bought my Macbook to keep it in pristine condition, just a few months ago.  I just popped it off to clear out a little bit of debris that got caught between the cover and the Macbook and find that all along the cover has been scratching my Macbook.  They should at least have had the foresight to make the plastic in contact with the Macbook of a softer material, or created a design where it won't rub against the laptop.  Really stupid design.  It may have protected against some very minor scratches,but likely I'm worse off for using this cover (scratches on the outside of the cover are more evenly dispersed than those now on the macbook but both are of similar severity). I don't think in the long run it was worth $40, and I feel very misled by the marketing for this cover.  Given the choice again I would have either gone for another brand or just saved my money 
 Let me begin by listing all the great things about the movie. 1. It is incredibly beautiful animation 2. The music is amazing 3. I happen to like how the movie is darker than the tv series The Things I don't like about the movie: 1. The characters are not developed at all 2. You get the feeling your only skimming the surface, like a starving person being tost a crumb of bread 3. It almost seems that every seen in the movie was stopped half way through the writting process.  Ok you may have see that I gave this moive a 2 out of 5, well that is becuase of the story line and plot.The story line of any movie is much more important to me than the animation. The movie left me with a odd emptiness from begining to end. I just kept thinking there has to be more. But there wasn't. The best way I could describe it would be to say it was as if the movie were a lost child at the carnival that no matter how hard it looked it just couldn't find its parents. This movie is for the person who likes action and no character development fluff. But if you are the person who likes well developed characters and story line please don't buy it rent it first. I'm not saying its a bad movie by any means, just a bit empty for me.Just one more thing the Escaflowne series is very very good don't let any bad reviews of the movie discurage you from getting the series 
 Not happy ! I wanted to rate this item with zero star, if the system allowed me. 
 I started the Full series a few years back when I needed an Evanovich fix between Plum books. I loved the first 3, after that I can't say they have lived up to my expectations.  This latest is the worse of all, it reminds of the 180 page romance novels of the early 70's, you know the ones you'd 6 of every month in the mail? Juvenile and unrealistic, sorry Janet but this one is a stinker for those of us used to the great Stephanie Plum novels and even the Barnaby series. Lorelei King does her best, but even a great reader can't help this book 
 This book was horrible, one: because these books don't interest me at all, and two: why does there have to be a whole novel on this topic when there cold just be a summary sheet. Basically this book is just not my cup of TEA..hahh 
 I had a difficult time with this book. Having ready "Flags of Our Fathers", I had hopes this would be as well written and informitive. However, from early on this book came across as just another piece of "pagan liberal propoganda". The ethnic cleansing of American Indians by the United States was an early warmup of typical pagan propoganda and it headed downhill from there. The pagans liberals have a prospensity to always color whatever the United States does in the worst light and make the atrocities of our enemies to be minor indiscretions. This book is another pagan apologetic for what's wrong with the US and right with all nations who wish us ill. 
 If they use a song by an artist, especially to open or close the movie, then a deal exists somewhere, that the artist was paid for their song to be used and should be included on the soundtrack.  I was very disappointed when I couldn't find "Safe and Sound" by Sheryl Crow.  I didn't buy the soundtrack.  If you can't put the most memorable songs on the soundtrack, which evoke the feeling of the movie all over again when you listen to it, what's the point 
 It's a long, boring book about some old dirt farmer out in bumf&*k, Nebraska beating his wife and having kids he doesn't love.  The end 
 Very brief, short on content, and does not go beyond basic common workout and health knowledge. This book could only benefit those with no knowledge of PJ's and CCT's due to it's short overview of the programs which could be found by searching the Net anyhow. The workouts that are included are very basic and could be created by oneself with any knowledge at all of running and calisthenics. I am about to go into the PJ Indoc program, from my view the book would be a lot better if it went into the day-to-day lives of the PJ's and CCT's and offered more information and tips on prepping for the constant rigors they go through 
 Rainbow fish has colorful shiny scales.  He is shamed into giving them to everyone.  Sounds like a communist primer 
 I have loved this series from the beginning - great characters, fun stories, thrills and romance.  Very light, quick reads that are great entertainment.  This story was awful.  There were two mysteries.  One was wrapped up so quickly it was very unrewarding, and the other was so convoluted I didn't even get it.    A comment was made that one person, when convicted, wouldn't be around to hurt anyone any more. But this person wasn't even the perp for the big mystery.  And the epilogue? WHO was that person?  And how did they figure it out?  Too many holes for an otherwise easy read.    Finally, the characterization was off.  The normal comraderie between the girls was missing.  I felt no love from the original three for Yuki, in spite of her storyline.  If there's a sixth story, I hope it brings back some of the magic from the earlier books.  I'm giving this book two stars only because these characters are like old friends.  If I had just picked up the series with this book, it would be a one.  Sorry James 
 I am the captain of a walking team and I purchased several of these pedometers as incentives for my team members.  I wore my pedometer before giving the rest out just to test it.  On the very first day, the pedometer lost count of my steps on three occasions, and by the end of the day, one of the buttons had fallen off.  I do not feel comfortable giving these pedometers to my walkers.  I should have invested a little more money per item to get the best value for my money 
 From the very beginning, it is clear that the house project is a project doomed to difficulty--the builders were breaking ground without having a clear design, a price point, and a contract.    What I took away from this book was the absolute necessity of having *EVERYTHING* in writing.  If Bill (the architect) had provided completed drawings early in the process, the estimating would have been more accurate, there would have been fewer confrontations, and some of the change orders could have happened before the building started, meaning when it's still cheap and easy to make changes.  Of course, that would have taken away from the drama of the story.  Any project manager would have cringed all the way through this book--it was bound to be a train wreck from the very beginning 
 Actually, some of Farrell's citations did not lead to the 'facts' he claimed in his book.  This is the biggest shortcoming of The Myth of Male Power.  He should be more thorough in his fact-checking next time, because there were quite a few errors in the book 
 This is a good book for someone who has never delved into the subject.  I find that it follows the same track as others in making the golden proportioning system fit about anything they want it to.  Probably the most disappointing thing is the book's assembly:  there are numerous overlays in the book that are not aligned with the images they are overlaying.  The deviations are from slight to almost 1/4" - very bothersome to view. This is more of a problem with mediocre quality control and concern by Princeton Architectural Press.  It's good that the book is relatively inexpensive or I would have returned it 
 I think every organizing book out there has some good points, and this one certainly does, but,unless you are completely clueless and/or completely unorganized to such an extent that you don't know to give away something you aren't using, don't bother with this book!  Her clients seem to be completely clueless.  One guy didn't know to put his socks and underwear in a dresser, and she helped him with that.  One couple had 3 extra bedrooms but built on to their house because they thought of the bedrooms as bedrooms, and not offices.  One couple kept their children's play gym in their bedroom, taking up most of the space,even though their children had outgrown it!  She had to tell them to get rid of it!!!  Another lady didn't know what to do because her kitchen counters were full of things she used, but her cabinets were full of things she didn't use.  She had to be told to take the things she didn't use out of her cabinets and give them away, so she could put the things she used in them!!  I could go on and on, the book is full of stories like this.  I just thought most of this book was common sense.  Try "Organized from the Inside Out" if you are looking for a good orgaizning book 
 This writing discredits itself by the use of inappropriate quotations, gross generalities, and by lacking the ability to see the other side of her examples 
 It's sloppy. Interpretation not well thought through. Solti is a well known name, but I wasn't impressed. It sounds uninspired. Check out a different set of the Brahms' symphonies 
 Well, this book was a let down. It is a stereo typical book where all women are needy and all men sexed up and too blind to see anything..... The basis of this book seems to be affairs so if you don't need help getting past an affair, don't waste your time.... 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 This man lives in a world od distorted reality.  Economic equality and poverty is bound to exist reguardless of the mode of production.  Capitalism allows democracy, which is the most important issue to me.  He talks about Cuba in this book...  The have to give up freedom and live in poverty, but their literacy level is the same as our's; which system sounds better?  Tjis was a well written book wth ample information, so I probably should have rated it better.  However, I hate the message that it sends 
 I would give this book less than one star if that were possible. After reading the reviews, I eagerly ordered "Trust" and anticipated reading it.   Well....I read it and what a waste of time.  Stilted, unnatural dialogue and narration, a spoon-fed simplistic plot, robotic and one-dimensional characters, and clunky vocabulary usage made this book one of the worst I have read in many years.  The sentences "He stared into her eyes" and "He placed his hand on her shoulder" appeared four times in the space of six pages; then for good measure, the author throws them in several more times later in the book.  There is no context given; what do they imply--a threat, a romantic interest?  The writing is consistently shallow and superficial and the author sums up  and reviews the simple plot developments every two or three chapters as if the reader couldn't possibly remember what is happening from one page to the next.  In my case, perhaps that was true because  the poor writing and puppet-like characters that behaved inconsistently were laughably distracting.  I forced myself to finish the book and was just as bored and incredulous at the end as when I began.  Did the author self publish this book?  Please, sir, go to writing school and get an editor 
 Like the Donny & Marie and Donny companion compilations, this cd sounds just dreadful.  Like so many other recent reissues, the person doing the remastering tried to make these recordings sound as "modern" as possible, meaning that they have eliminated what little dynamic range was present to begin with on these recordings and also set the EQ so that the tonal balance is on the extremely bright side.  Donny's voice, for example, is thin and harsh sounding.  This is the worst sounding Osmonds collection I've heard, and I have everything Curb has issued on cd.  Avoid this one at all costs 
 This book would've been a "find" if I were in my early teens, but for any adult who considers themselves a bibliophile, this book is just too lightweight.  Yes, it is about books and literature, but the coverage is extremely shallow.  I would consider this to be something like the Reader's Digest Condensed Books form of Benet's Reader's Encyclopedia.  Buy that work instead of you're looking for a good reference work on literature 
 Buying the Complete Psionic was a lot like getting hit in the face with a custard pie.  Parts of it taste really good but I would have like the pie a lot better if the pie had been on my plate instead of in my face.  For those who don't know even though Bruce is listed as one of the two primary authors on the cover his was not the last hand that touched it.  After he wrote the first draft of the manuscript the material was handed off to a development team for further playtesting and refinement.  Then it went through final editing.  Somewhere in this process the proposed page count of the book went from roughly 190 pages to 160.  I'm sure Bruce had some input at various stages but I'm also sure that much of his material was changed substantially.  One example that he has admitted to was that he submitted only one "divine" class yet the final product had two, the Ardent & the Divine Mind.  This book has several major things going against it.  1. It is very poorly edited.  In addition to sloppy sentence structure and whatnot there are clear instances of where the development staff changed some of the original stuff.  If you look at the feat tables you will see that they indicate that some feats can be used "3+ Cha mod times per day" yet when you get to the feat text it's 1/day.  2. The errata changing Expanded Psionics Handbook (XPH) powers is poorly done and is mixed in with the new powers.  For example the Energy Missile & Energy Stun powers were changed so that the DC scaled +1 per 2 power points instead of the old +1 per 1 power point.  These were powers that had received complaints for scaling too quickly so this change was not entirely unexpected.  However, right there in the same section is a new energy power with the same old 1/1 scaling.  There are other examples where changes appear to be illogical.  But worst of all the things that seemed to most need errata, like clarification on the XPH Psychic Reformation power, were not done at all.  3. The content is very thin.  Only 8 Prestige Classes ... less than half of what appears in any other complete book & less than half of these are actually useable.  Only 6 new monsters and none of them are psionic constructs so the XPH feat "Craft Psionic Construct" is still unusable.    No fluff on running psi focused games ... unlike, say the Complete Warrior which has stuff on warrior focused games.  Lots of wasted space, for instance tables listing both the new powers in this book and all the ones from the XPH where all other Complete books just list the new stuff.  4. The "flavor" of Psionics is completely changed by this book.  In the XPH psi seems to be about "the power of the mind" and a psionic character is unique in that he is not dependant on outside forces or foci for his power.  His attack powers are based on creating an energy effect or affect the mind or body directly.  The Complete Psionic changes this radically.  Now some psychic characters get their powers from the gods.  They link to the inner and outer planes to create effects.  After this book there is literally nothing to separate a psion from a wizard, cleric, or paladin.  5. Many of the new powers, classes, and feats are underpowered.  For some reason the final product has an incredible focus on things that are useable once per day.  There are literally pages and pages of stuff that, if you take the class or feat you get something that can be used once per day.  This goes so far that they even mistakenly attribute some stuff in the XPH to be once per day when it is not.  With that said the book does have some very nice gems.  The Ardent & Lurk base classes are fantastically done and can be easily inserted into any ongoing game that has Psionics.  The Ardent in particular is a class that has wonderful flavor and enables one to play a "cleric" like character with a uniquely psionic feel.  The Divine Mind is mechanically interesting, being somewhere between a Paladin, Marshal, and Psychic Warrior, but the fact that they draw their powers directly from a deity disturbs me to no end.  I have no problem with a character who draws both on the power within and divine power, but I have a serious issue when WotC had deities granting psionic powers to folks.  Many of the feats are interesting and can find ready use in an ongoing game.  In fact this was probably the best section of the book for me in spite of the problems between the text and tables that I mentioned above.  Some of the new powers are useful, though plenty more are odd or seem out of place flavor wise.  The new race introduced by the book is very interesting, though I think that I would tend to use either them or the XPH Elan and not both.  I love the Erudite class & feel that it could easily be used alongside normal Psions instead of replacing them as the book suggests.  They have a fascinating blend of flexibility and restrictions that I find appealing.  I'm also big XPH Soulknife fan, and I have to admit that the Complete Psionic really delivers for them with new feats, Prestige Classes, and useful errata like the fact that dual Mind Blades can both be charged separately with Psychic Strike.  However, like the pie in the face, even though it has some great things going for it, in the end the Complete Psionic fails to deliver in a satisfying manner.  I strongly suggest actually reading some of the book before deciding to buy it.  In all honesty I would rather have had no new Psionic book rather than what was delivered in the Complete Psionic even though I will probably end up using bits and pieces of it ... and that's a hard thing for me to say since it was the psionics in the XPH that brought me back to DnD after a long absence. 
 First, let me state that I have been impressed by all the Canin I have read prior to starting "Blue River."  The problem with this novel isn't that it follows pattern similar to Canin's other works, most notably "For Kings and Planets," a far more mature novel, but that the protagonist is very hard to empathize with.  A successful California optimologist, the protagonist spends the too much of the narrative defending his materialism.  When he's not bothering with that, he's repeatly over-describing his less successful brother (After the first few times, I understood that the brother was violent and troubled during high school).  There's a good story here, but it's trapped under a poor, plodding narrative 
 i found this to be a very disappointing book from an author of steinbeck's quality. the characters are paper thin. what drives the protagonist from good to evil is unclear at best. yes his family wants more from him, but who doesn't face that. the interesting point is that as he turns on the townspeople, many of them, as a result of recognizing his goodness, begin to reward him. this particularly true of the two characters he damages the most. then, even after he learns what they have done for him, he appears to feel no remorse. only after his son shows the same traits does he overreact and attempt something totally unexpected. what saves him is the integrity of his daughter.  all of this seems contrived. i had no strong feelings for any of the characters. they are driven by greed with no regard for their fellow man. ethan hawley, who appears to be above the rest in the beginning, ends up the worst of the lot.  bottomline, this is low quality steinbeck. why waste your time here when you can read "east of eden", "the wayward bus",  "grapes of wrath", or many of his short novels. 
 This movie consists of a bunch of unrelated tragedies in Los Angeles, having nothing at all to do with the Grand Canyon.    The dialog consists of people exchanging meaningless comments at cross purposes.  Nothing happens.  Nothing is decided.  Steve Martin is totally miscast in trying to be a serious character. he is better off just standing in front of a tv camera and telling jokes.  It seemed as if this movie took about 12 hours.  There is no observable plot.    After a while the screen says "The End."      
 This is the most boring, unmotivating, uninteresting workout I have ever owned, yoga or other.  I am exceptionally disappointed, as it was voted best workout DVD of 2005 by Self magazine. I have only been practicing for a few weeks, having fallen in love with Fit Tv's Namaste workouts, I expected the same great music, flowing rhythm, and steady pace.  Instead, this is an incredibly slow-moving, dull workout that doesn't even challenge me, a true beginner.  I adore yoga, and wanted a longer, challenging workout--this is not it.  I'm back to my FREE FitTv Namaste workouts, until I can find somethng better 
 Not surprisingly, the AFTER DARK FILMS are weak or average...The hype is silly.  If you want a movie "too scary or whatever for general audiences" may I suggest Henry:Portriat of a Serial Killer, heck, even American Psycho pulled more intensity than these films.  The Hamiltons was Ok at best, The feature was what it was, low budget horror, fine... love them... but, I failed to see what was so impressive, it looked, felt & unfolded by the standard formula, like thousands of others released all the time...I suggest a rental even for hard core horror feinds like myself before buying it...  Worth a watch if you see nothing else on the rental rack, nothing more...nothing less.. 
 Much like Into The Sun, this had all the ingredients for a Seagal come back but yet again the producers of yet another Seagal movie miss the opportunity to deliver a great Seagal action thriller. The movie is again handicapped in the same manner as Into The Sun and Submerged by the recurring problem of what appears to be Seagals disregard of the script or perhaps due to the lack of a script where he seems to make up his own dialogue to fill out a scene. It's as if the camera is turned on and Seagal makes it up as he goes along, conversations involving Seagal and other characters make no sense or have any relevance to the story at hand. In Seagals recent movies there always appears to be a scene which is simply there to give Seagal an ego boast. "Walks like a Black man, breaths like a killer", what was that all about??  The main armored car chase scene is lifted directly from another film made 10 years ago and also the open scenes of The Order with Van Damme is used as the opening scenes in this. I also think though I might be wrong but all the aerial shots of the prison and the prison structure itself looked the same as those used in the Wesley Snipes movie Undisputed. Seagals body double is ever present as usual, Seagals line delivery at times is terrible, yet another muddled and confusing plot and character relevance to the story, Seagal love scene!, fake back drop special effects and bad acting from allot of the supporting cast members are all here present and correct as has become the norm with Seagal movies of late. However it's not all bad, this is a big step up from Submerged, there is no voice dubbing, there are flashes of the old Seagal when he sticks to the script and does his own fight scenes which the two while he is in prison appear to be all Seagal and he is looking in better shape than his last few outings. For me, it was worth the rental as it's not all bad but it did feel very flat and uninteresting while watching it. In Seagals post Exit Wounds years, for me Belly Of The Beast is the mark to aim for and his best since Exit Wounds,  with Half Past Dead, Out Of Reach and The Foreigner(<-- I know people may want to decapitate me for saying that but I like The Foreigner!) following behind. The worst for my viewing pleasure has to be Out For A Kill, Ticker and Submerged(although enjoyable in a it's so bad it's good, kind of way). I'd put Today You Die and Into The Sun in the same box as missed opportunities for two excellent Seagal movies 
 Academics are presumptuous.   This is not for the everyday reader.  Too bad.  The topic is interesting (being mixed heritage Asian Americans).  The book is boring --too academic.  This is not for the average reader who wants to read something for fun.   I would prefer What Are You? by Pearl Gaskins and the book, Half and Half (by biracial and bicultural writers) before I'd recommend this academic mumbo-jumbo.   The book's title is misleading.  It should be titled, "Academics Gotta Make a Project Out of Everyting, including hapas"  The writings are presumptuous 
 It's cheap, but I couldn't get it to work. It seems to be a problem with the drivers. I wrote to the company for help multiple times but couldn't pin them down on any clear instructions (e.g., they'd tell me to download the drivers from the internet, but when I responded that I allready did so and it still didn't work they wouldn't tell me where to go from there they stopped responding to my e-mails). I'm pretty computer savvy so if I was unable to get the thing working after several hours I don't think anyone else will be able to either 
 What more would you expect from a revisionist historian whose books read like novels, with no researches yet dressing up all half baked hypotheses as proven theses. Treat this book as some infantile rantings from an inadequate mind 
 What A Stinkbomb!  A cross between a video game & high school play, what were they thinking?  One blaring fault is that No One Smoked!  How can you make a film about WWI & not admit they smoked?  This bunch did & it really bothers me as it's playing the past - this is a trend I'm seeing in American productions about history - what else are they changing that young audiences won't pick up on 
 What a shame. This book seemed so exciting when I ordered it. But this author doesn't understand musical theatre. He doesn't really know the art form; he just knows a bit about it. So much of the book is so condescending and so dismissive toward a lot of oustanding musicals. And there are so many small factual errors that I have to wonder if he's really seen some of the shows he writes about. Was there no one to proof this book? Did no one reading it know that there is no Oscar for "best soundtrack"? And in addition to factual errors, Singer also fudges the truth from time to time to support his pre-existing conclusions. He doesn't seem to have much respect for the art form, and from what I can tell from his book jacket bio, he's never worked in the musical theatre, so he has virtually no interesting insights into how musicals work. Though there is a bit of useful info in the book, there are far better books than this. Don't bother 
 I bought this book on a friend's recommendation.  If I had been in a book store and could have read a page or two I would have known immediately it was not the type of book I would read.  I'm sure it's wonderful for those who like it.  I passed it on to a friend 
 This thing is horrible. Cumbersome to use and does nothing. I have to swiffer over and over again and crud is still on the floor.  It removes a little bit of dirt but doesn't actually clean a rug/carpet.  I'm giving it one star because Amazon won't let me rate it -0 
 "A Music Fan" says he only knew one of these songs?!! What cave has he been living in?? His gross lack of music knowlege is scary! You can do better than this compilation - Too few songs and chosen rather arbitrarily. The songs are classics though. Still can't believe previous reviewer didn't know "Sounds of Silence", "Pretty Woman", etc. --- How sad 
 The camera takes good pictures as long as you have a steady hand. Some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures.  Some pictures come out blurry - no stabalizer. This camera's randomly broke after about 1 year and I did not drop the camera (just like another reviewer).  I bought a Sony PDA and the same thing happened to that lcd - randomly broke - has a crack across the LCD. Of course, Sony said it was my fault and that I must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that PDA - after 1 month? Since the camera was out of warranty, I knew there was nothing they were going to do. So if you want a DECENT camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it! But if you want a great camera and a great company to support their products, look elsewhere. I used to be a great financial supporter of Sony products - monitors, computers, camcorder, memory sticks, etc. I am not buying anymore Sony products - I have lost the love for Sony and their products! Beware! Canon, here I come! 
 Her premise is spot on.  If you are going to expend the effort to bring up emotions, use them for courage: the courage to do incredible things that will inspire the audience.  I really liked the sound of that, so I checked out this book.  Her 12 step technique is pretty much a rehash of method techniques.  There may be some twists lent to them from her empowerment philosophy, but I didnt see many real, applicable differences.  I wasn't drawn in by her writing style either.  I have read some acting books that got me burning to get back on stage, and this wasn't one of them.  I will admit, I enjoyed chapters 9 (which talks about making the most out of business) and 10 (inner monologue).  I think it's because these are ways to get your impressions OUT THERE for people to look at.  Even though she says she is trying to get away from it, most of her technique is too internal and too analytical.  Ivana Chubbuck, like many others, preys upon the insecurities of actors, and their need to be "the best."  Don't fall into the trap of buying into yet another self-righteous acting coach/guru.  A technique like this is far too rigid, and will do more harm than good. You will end up wasting your time and/or money and hurting your acting. Trust me when I tell you, you DO NOT need this book to act with courage or act to win.   If you are looking for a modern, fresh approach, buy "How to Stop Acting" by Harold Guskin instead 
 I couldn't believe my ears! Now that's a dull cliche isn't it? Gladys Knight nearly put me to sleep!  I was expecting Ms. Knight to be MS. KNIGHT, not some scared little singer with no confidence in her OWN talent of interpreting songs HER WAY.  When Aretha Franklin was 20, she sang the Holy hell out of Billie Holiday's "God Bless The Child," but did it HER way. She even took Ruth Etting's "You Made Me Love You," and transformed the tune into an Aretha masterwork (she was 19).  Gladys, go back and pull out your Doris Day records.  Now SHE could sing this music in the way that an expert POP singer could.  I love you, Miss Knight, but somebody gave you the wrong advice here 
 If you are from planet Mars, you still wouldn't find this book useful.  The dumbest person I know, knows more than is in this book.  There is no code.  It doesn't tell you exactly how to do anything.  It just blah blah's on and on about useless info.  Design, Build, and Maintain a website title?  It doesn't cover any of the technical side of this like the title says.  Save you money and pay someone to start your online business for you.  It took a whole book to tell you this?????  Save your money 
 This was a very disappointing story. I listened to the unabridged version and fell asleep on parts of the story without feeling like I missed anything. It took quite a while to get into and understand what was happening with the mysterious blue light, which is never truly explained. Chance, who tells the story of the blue light, is not a character that you come to care about, he's one of many people with a confusing story connecting him with the blue light. The other protaganists did very little to help push the story along, and I could not figure out the reason for the antaganist, Greyman (who by the way was corny). Though parts of the book was interesting, the ending left me highly annoyed. It was over 9 hours of wasted time 
 Mona Charen cites nearly every example of demagoguery committed by social liberals from 1960 to 1996.  She didn't miss one.  She bashes liberal views of the Great Society of LBJ, the anti-war protests of the 60's, the welfare state, Clarence Thomas' and Robert Bork's nominations, and the crime wave that quieted in the 90's.  Unfortunately, Charen forgets the similar pandering and hypocrisy that has occurred by social conservatives during that same period, an omission that greatly detracts from her thesis.  Another failing is that she attaches exclusive causeology  of NYC's decrease in crime in the 1990's to Guiliani's get-tough policies, and conveniently forgets the complexities of improved economics, changing demographics and the "abortion factor" (as expounded by Leavitt in Freakonomics) as potential contributors.    She glibly assigns culpability to liberals for any number of social ills including unwed mothers, homelessness, violent crime, racial tension and conceiveably ring-around-the-collar.  Her references are numerous, but her arguments are not careful enough for a scholarly work, so the book serves only as red meat for the angry masses screaming about the same old problems of government waste associated with liberal government bureaucracy.  Charen conveniently avoids the huge government waste associated with the current so-called "conservative" government of GWB and the Republican House and Republican Senate.  Charen forgets to cite the Medicare Part D program as the largest social spending  program (inflation adjusted) in history.  She forgets to mention that GWB signed into law a bill written by fellow "conservative" Republicans that represented the largest farm subsidies (inflation adjusted) in history.  Charen neglects to mention that the current "conservative" government has rushed us into a war that will cost half a trillion dollars and has already lasted longer than WWI, WWII and the US Civil War; and Bush did this despite protests by previous Republican cabinet advisors and diplomats.     At the end of the day, this conservative prefers a government that wastes billions of my tax money on unnecessary and counter-productive social programs over one that spends trillions on unnecessary war and mayhem 
 While I agree with reviews indicating that the author has a beautiful style, I was tremendously disappointed at the lack of payoff in this book.  Yes, there are interesting situations, compelling descriptions... but the entire last third or so of the book fails to deliver anything worthy of the set-up prior to that. Did the author just get tired out?  Too committed to just tying up loose ends from the previous book?  This was quite a bummer as I wanted to like the book and had invested time and emotion up to that point 
 Depressing. J.D. Salinger pictured as he no doubt really is - a self centered jerk who has inappropriate attractions to younger women. Hard to enjoy his writing after reading this. I do admire her courage in writing this book- I just wish I hadn't read it 
 Just from perusing the online pages, the author is just babling.  If this is presented as fantasy, fine; otherwise let's have some facts besides the statement, "Sorry, guys.  That's the way it is! 
 I'm a very spiritual person and I was expecting this CD to provide daily inspiration and help me to remember the very few things that are important in life.  Unfortunately, for me at least, the CD is rather boring and not very inspirational.  I'm about 30 minutes in to it and have decided to stop listening to it.  Fortunately I have a Christian radio station that does a lot more for me. 
 This is an interesting premise (that's why I bought it) and an awful read. As characters, the saurians had no appeal to make me care what happened to them and, frankly, neither did the humans.  I was longing for Enya, the "26-million-year death-star" to reduce the whole bunch of them to a fine powder 
 Jane Fonda has apologized for her ignorance.  She has asked for forgiveness.  She has acknowledged being young and stupid and guilty of horrible judgment for her Viet Nam antics.  She has made a mistake and is sorry for it.  If we are all going to be held accountable for stupid things we've done when we were younger, none of us will hit the mark as respectable adults. This book is stuck in a time warp. The vets who continue to "blame" Jane Fonda for what happened to them in Viet Nam need to figure out who they're really angry at and come to terms with their anger and find a way to move on.  Jane Fonda didn't start the war, she didn't cause it and she didn't end it.  She was simply caught up in the Hollywood machine that perpetuated all sorts of opinions about the war at the time and her celebrity at the time had a lot to do with it.   I admire Ms. Fonda for the woman she is today, not for the mistakes she made nearly 30 some odd years ago.  She is sorry.  Let's move on and quit calling for her head on a platter.  In 2005, we have bigger fish to fry, and our county's current problems are no fault of Jane Fondas.  Let it go 
 The Amazon description says Vol. 1-3, boxed set, hardcover.  That is all true.  What they don't tell you is that there are actually six volumes.  The box in which it comes is clearly marked, "Volumes 1-3 (of six)."  That would have been a much better description for Amazon to have used.  If you have volumes 4-6 and you are looking to complete the set, this book is for you.  If you are looking for the complete set, look elsewhere 
 Stone Cold Steve Austin bellowing a song called "Where's the Beer?" WWE Originals stabs at hip-hop, rap metal, rock and pop R&B suggests comedy, except that it's not very funny, and, shockingly, much of it seems to be intended seriously. When the Dudley Boyz make Insane Clown Posse sound skilled and when Lita's fusion of Good Charlotte and Hilary Duff comes along as a relief, it's mighty clear that you're in the presence of what could already be 2004's worst album. 
 When I purchased the book, I thought it would act as a resounding inflection into the life and times of a woman struggling with the horrible aftermath of critical events similar to what I had gone through three years earlier.  I did not find that at all.  This book came across more as a wishy-washy love story than a tell-all "I'm writing to help others" book of caring and honesty.  Her husband must be one great guy!  I found nothing in this book that helped me fight my own demons or helped me deal with the personal strife that I've had to live with all these years.  I respect Deborah for her willingness to put this all out there, but in the end, her book was an arrow through my wallet and a major disappointment 
 Just plain common sense. There wasn't profound thought through out the whole book.  I finished in thirty minutes 
 When my husband and I first got our waffle maker, we couldn't believe how well it worked - at this price point, nothing could be better.  A couple of months ago the lock that holds the waffle plate upright while you're pouring batter and removing the waffle broke in the middle of using the waffle maker.  It slipped to the side and burnt the inside of my arm.  Three months later, I still have a scar and I can no longer in any way recommend this waffle maker.  I'm going to purchase something slightly more expensive (e.g., KitchenAid) that hopefully has more of a focus on ensuring that parts continue to work.  If you do choose to buy this, BE CAREFUL 
 This novel by G.K. Chesterton, starts very well, with a policeman so succesful in trying to infiltrate a group of anarchists that he is elected one of the bosses of the cell. Then things slowly becomes more muddled and the plot collapses halfway through the book, as it becomes more and more confusing and improbable and the author tries to feed on us too much indigestible philosophical baggage (Chesterton was a notorious political ultraconservative who seemed to find nothing worthwhile in the Europe after the Middle Ages). If you want to read a novel about early 20th century anarchists, I suggest instead you read Joseph Conrad's "The Secret Agent" 
 I had to read this book for a history course.  I would suggest to everyone who reads this book to do so in a quiet place with no distractions.  Keep a dictionary handy.  There is so much information that you should read this one section at a time.  For those of you doing a research project it is a good book to have.  Lots of interesting statistics but not fun to read 
 The default supplier for this item is Adorama.  They have sku numbers mixed up on the back end, so they will ship you the HP 6221 dock instead.  Will not work with the R series. They do not even carry the actual HP 8887 dock.   Huge hassles, so click on the new and used link and buy directly from Amazon.  It's a few dollars more, but at least you get the right item 
 The woman that wrote this work of fiction is not even an archeologist.  In fact she has never even visited the nation of Israel during an archaelogical dig.  It is not surprising that she is part of the Colombia University gang of Arab Muslims that attacks and attempts to delegitimize Israel.  When will they learn they must overcome their own fallacies instead of blaming Israel and scapegoating Jewish people for their troubles.  Read the critique of this book at campus-watch dot org 
 The first thing you should know about The Hurricane is that it was based on two books, one of which (The Sixteenth Round) was written by Rubin Carter.  The second thing you should know is that Rubin Carter is not a man of exemplary honesty.  The third thing you should know is that the other book (Lazarus and the Hurricane) on which this movie was based was written by two of the Canadians who bought into Carter's hokum, as have so many after them.  I will not go into a point-by-point list of the patently false claims that Carter makes in his book, since other posters here have already done a good job of that. Instead, I'd like to offer some reactions to those here who have given this movie glowing reviews. These are divided into three groups.  The first is composed of those who did not know they were taken for a ride. If you belong in this group, I do not fault you. Hollywood has a way of perpetrating some very repugnant deceptions on the unsuspecting public. But let me ask you this: if you were presented with hard evidence that this movie is just one big lie put forward by the title "hero," would you still rate it highly?  If your answer is "yes," then you belong in the second group, those who gave this movie a thumbs-up on the basis of its being a powerfully moving drama, and never mind the glaring factual inaccuracies. To this group, I have this to say: if a filmmaker wants to present a true-life story, he has a responsibility to see to it that he has his facts right. It's called integrity, and it means placing truthfulness far above profitability. You say this is a dramatization and not a documentary? Well, even a dramatization should be done with some integrity. I can go along with some minor embellishments here and there, but when a movie is based on a series of disgustingly blatant lies and tries to pass itself off as a true story, that, in my book, is unforgivable. And so what if it was a rival studio that went out of its way to expose this movie's dishonesty? Vested interest does not render their arguments invalid.  Finally, to the third group, those who actually believe that Carter is in fact a martyr-scholar, I ask you to please open your eyes. There is absolutely no documentation to support Carter's claims that he defended his friend from a pedophile, that he was a civil rights activist, that he was robbed of a crucial ring victory, and so many other proclamations aimed at propping up his hero image. On the other hand, there are reams of documents that present virtually irrefutable evidence that these very proclamations are a product of one man's delusional fantasies. You say that Cal Deal, the man behind graphicwitness.com, is a racist? Please visit graphicwitness.com /carter/racism.html. Also, know this: Deal went into the Rubin Carter case actually believing that Carter was innocent. It took just one interview for Deal to see the many glaring inconsistencies in Carter's statements. He went on to uncover numerous documents and testimonies that exposed Carter as a liar.  Many accounts today have it that Carter is a changed man. I sincerely hope this is a real change, and not just a show. But whatever the case, the fact remains that he owes it to the public to admit that his book and this movie are just a lot of hogwash.   I'm not counting on that, though 
 Why on earth would anyone review this book? It would be like reviewing "Madeline in London". Who really cares 
 Occasional insights obscured by thickets of doctrinaire Freudianism. Let the reader beware 
 If you're looking for country music, try LeeAnn's self titled release or "Something I Know".  These are both GREAT CD's.  She has a perfect voice for country music - strong with just the right amount of east TX twang.  This cd is for those Celine Dion fans who want to listen to adult contemporary music.  LeeAnn has learned how to sell music to the masses, and left country music fans longing for a return to her earlier sound 
 Should have known better than to trust anything with Black and Decker's name on it. I bought this book for information on installing hardwood flooring.The only mention of hardwood flooring in the book is to leave it to a qualified professional. Not vey helpful for the do it yourself types. If you have a wood flooring project do not waste your money on this useless book 
 As a long time Lowell fan I had looked forward to a new release and not just a remake of an old book, but this book was not worth the wait.  I found the characters shallow making it hard to relate or connect them within the plot. As for the plot, it wandered so I had a hard time remembering which side of the border the characters were on! I kept on reading hoping to see a glimpse of the Lowell found in the Donovan, Risk or Rarites series but that just didn't happen.  Was this just another case of an author "cranking out" books to make the publishers bottom line regardless of whether the book is worth the paper it is printed on.   
 "Untidy Endings" could be a description of many of the Jury books, this one in particular. It's not even close to a complete story, but rather a filler, to be resolved at a later date.  I'm getting a little confused with the setting in place and time. If Jury was a small child during the Battle of Britain, he would be in or near his 70's now. Is the timeline is running slowly, as in Sue Grafton's alphabet series, where Kinsey Milhone is still in the 80's?  Then some things would make sense, but other references would not.  Also, some Americanisms are present that should have been British slang instead.  These faults make for distracting reading.   Martha Grimes has written from a dog's viewpoint before to good effect, so that anyone who has a dog would be able recognize those past dogs, but Mungo's actions in this book are just a little too much.  And the recurrent cliche of "kid-jep" as Grimes herself classifies it herself in a previous Jury mystery, is becoming truly cliche.  This just wasn't her best 
 it is not obvious that this is a PC version - If you use a mac like me don't get this one. look at the tiny print on the cover 
 Oh, dear...this movie was an abomination.  Why must directors insist on picking up books and deciding not to read them and make a movie out of them instead?  I can see why they would change a few plot and character points to make the book's storyline more marketable to the target moviegoers.  But honestly...there are many elements in the book that would have translated well to film that they left out and replaced with something cliched and unoriginal.  And the film design!  Bleh!  Maybe it would be appealing to 5-year-old girls...but to me it looked garish, cheap, and...really fake.  The costuming was slightly better than our high school plays, and the sets looked frighteningly bright and animated.    I felt so much dumber after watching this movie.  I feel like I need an IQ test...or a good book.  Speaking of good books, Ella Enchanted is one of my favorites.  I don't know why I thought of that book just now.  I guess this movie vaguely reminded me of it...but not much 
 This book is about an individual who obviously has a lot of imagination. Unless you intend to consider this as a fantasy novel, I would strongly recommend against wasting your money on this piece of propaganda. 
 I just couldn't get into this book.  The writing just wasn't my style, and I didn't find the jokes funny...  Oh well 
 Boring, outdated ex-patriate story of life in Paris between the wars, focusing on a young American actress, a psychologist Dr. Diver and his wife, an American baroness with issues.  Lots of drinking and gossip 
 After reading the trilogy, I was left wondering what the hell happened? I have just read all 3 of the His Dark Materials trilogy and what was a strong start in book 1 and 2 is utterly demolished in this clunker.    Pullman allowed his eagerness to bash religion to completely destroy an engaging story - one of the most creative stories I've come across in 20 years of reading fantasy. There isn't even a remote chance of a sequel to fix up this mess. If you look up `anticlimax' in the dictionary, you'll see a picture of this book. From first page to last, time is wasted on boring characters, while all the good ones are either killed off, or just MIA for the entire book. Spoilers ahead.   What about Lyra and her parents? Somehow, she never knows what happened to them and after all she has been through is supposed to be content with going back to school like a good little girl? She never even confronts them to try and understand their motivations. And Will just goes back with Mary Malone to her apartment so they can figure out how to avoid the cops. Over a cup of tea, naturally. And that's it for him. In addition to all that, this book doesn't even seem to be connected to the first two. None of the characters resonate they way they used to and instead of being good friends, Will and Lyra fall in love and have sex at the tender age of 11 or 12 . . .  all in the last 30 pages. What happened to the story, for cripes sake?!  And what happened to the `temptation'? Was choosing not to stay with Will her way of not succumbing to it? The whole premise is just so lame to start out with. As an earlier reviewer pointed out all the windows that were opened for centuries didn't endanger the universe, why not leave one open for 60 or 70 years to give Lyra and Will a chance to know each other. The flimsy reasoning behind this is just as contrived as their sudden and immediate love for one another. Supposedly, they had more than gonads going for them, they survived death together!   Pullman didn't feel like thinking it through, he just wanted a gut wrenching ending. In addition to that, he wanted to mock the reader by taunting us with the `reality' of knowing that nothing they did in the trilogy has any hope or meaning. All of Will and Lyra's efforts are futile, kind of like - guess what? religion for the rest of us morons.   After having the reader go through endless pages on the mulefa-elephant aliens or whatever, ultimately the characters the reader wants to know about disappear with barely a whimper. Iorek Byrnison, Lee Scoresby - instead we get page after page about Mary Malone the Disaffected former Nun. Pullman all but pants in his eagerness to give the finger to anyone of us who believes in Him or anything for that matter!   This is NOT children's literature, it's a hate ridden manifesto that is more suitable for adults who at least have some way of maintaining some sort of perspective throughout this sloppy mess. It's totally dishonest to sell this as a children's book, or even as a competent work of fiction. All of the painstaking work of the first two books is undone with this one.   We never get closure on Lyra's parents. We never really understand what Dust is and where it comes from. We never see Will reunited with his mother. We get a lame battle where `god' dies and no one even knows why or how. Lyra and Will fall in love, but have to `sacrifice' it so that all the windows to other worlds can be shut forever, with only flimsy reasoning behind it. The mulefa and Mary Malone's work together amounts to nothing, everyone just goes home. Presumably, Will goes home, although we never see it. All that yearning after his mother and so forth . . .nothing. The major enemies are killed off too easily - and what about Armageddon? What happened to the Fortress and all the rebel angels and . . .you get the idea. It all just sort of disovles. Mary forgot to be the Serpent, or else I missed that in one of the countless pages on the mulefa.  Another reader pointed out: " Phillip Pullman could have written a masterpiece with this series. Instead, the story falls flat under the weight of the author's own agendas and mockeries. What a waste of time. I can't believe this book actually won awards. It stopped being thought-provoking and started being inane and silly."   It would have been better if Lyra had just awakened one morning and it was all a dream. Instead, relearning how to read the alethiometer will somehow enable her to build the Kingdom of Heaven in the course of her lifetime. Absurd. This was one of the most disappointing and infuriating reads of my life. 
 I like this type of opener very much, and wanted to replace another similar model that had lasted a year before failing.  So I opened the package, and tried to open a bottle of wine, but the corkscrew would not lock.  I'm not even sure I'll send it back given the warranty hassle, shipping costs, etc, given the price.  I just can't recommend this brand to anyone 
 T/F Huber Selby Jr. is a grounbreaking writer. True T/F The Room is his worst novel. True T/F The Room is the worst novel, period. True T/F You should read something else, ANYTHING else. True There you have it. Read "Last Exit to Brooklyn," it is a masterpeice.  Stay far away from The Room, okay?  If you just want to read a disturbing novel just to be, well, disturbed . . . than go ahead and give it a shot.  Its hard to know which is more torturing though, incarceration or reading this book 
 I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS "VERSION" OF THE MUSIC SCORE.  I HAVE FOUND THE ORIGINAL SOUND TRACK.  ORIGINAL IS PAINFULLY AND WONDERFULLY EMOTIVE.  THIS RECORDING FAILS TO CONVEY THE INTENSE ART OF THE ORIGINAL---REALLY FAILS.   IF THIS MOVIE IS SACRED TO YOU, DON'T SPOIL IT BY BUYING THIS WATERED DOWN REPRINT 
 I read this book only because it was lent to me by an unfortunate person who was lumbered with it for Mothers Day. It was the only BTB book I've read since "Woman of Substance" and I fine it hard to believe that it was written by the same writer! The dialogue was unbelievably twee and some of it was out of a Victorian novel---the heroine calls her brother --Brother mine!!!!!Oh brother! I finished it because it was so bad that it was funny 
 Every lawyer knows better than to simply say what they think, give an opinion, or offer unfounded advice. "Don't tell me what you THINK, tell me the LAW!" This book makes that error on a regular basis. You'll get lots of information on how to write and present arguments, but none of it is actually founded on anything. Indeed, much of it flies in the face of what psychology has told us of the effects of primacy and recency. Another lawyer's error that simply underscores how baseless this book is? No citations 
 I am really glad I checked this book out of the library. I would have been really upset if I had paid for it prior to reading it.  I had never heard of Nate until I happened to watch an episode of Oprah (which I hardly ever do anymore) and saw his decorating style. The show was touting his new line and new book.   Pros *	Nice blend of a kind of contemporary/modern traditional style *	Large font is easy to read *	Nice photography *	Like his color combination choices (not too out there or garish)   Cons *	MAJOR PROBLEM FOR ME: The "Before" and "After" pictures often did not gibe.  The "After" pictures were almost consistently of a different viewpoint than the "Before" pictures. I spent quite a bit of time trying to figure out what area of the room the "After" picture was shot. On page 68, the  "Before" picture shows two window on each side of a narrow wall with a picture. The left window is next to a counter/bar area. The "After" photo shows a room with one window. Is it the same wall or another wall in the room? I honestly could not tell, the bar isn't in the photo and there is part of a chaise in the "After" picture.   *	"After" pictures missing a "Before" picture or vice versa. On page 52, the "After" picture shows a beautiful room with a window...there is no "Before" picture.  *	Very little explanation of how and what he did to get to the "After" product. On page 99, there is a "Before" and "After" of a kitchen. The "After" description says, "Wallpapering the cabinet's recessed door panel gave...a custom decorative touch".  The "Before" pictures do not show recessed door panels! Did they put in new cabinet doors? Did they keep the existing doors and put a paneled edge on each of the cabinet doors after they wallpapered? What did they do?  *	The "Home Rules" are list of 10 "rules" that appear throughout the book - basically common sense or things you already know...but it fills up a page quickly.  An example of these rule (from page 141): 1) Make the bed luxurious... 2) Serenity is key, so keep wall color soothing... 6) Use an armoire or cabinet to conceal the TV when not in use; 10) Make your bed every day.   This book has definitely been hyped up, which is okay with me, if it lives up to the hype. With all the hype, I would expect this book to contain some useful, innovative information, it doesn't. I would suggest others check it out of the library and determine if it is something you would find useful. I determine whether to buy a decorating books based on if there are great designs, decorating info or photos that I would refer to again, this book meets none of that criteria for me.    I would recommend HGTV Before & After Decorating by Amy Tincher-Durik (even if you are not an HGTV fan) or Real Life Decorating: Your Life, Your Style, Your Home by Linda Hallam 
 I received this after much debate about the prior review. Had seen this item described the same on other web sites and figured it had to be an error for the other customer. So I bought it and sure enough had the same problem. Amazon was great, they sent me a replacement and still the same problem. My baby is due any day so I am keeping the first one, but sending back the replacement. It doesnt come as described, no blanket included, and I dont see how you could adjust the wedge. I am very disappointed with the product, but happy about Amazon's willingness to assist in the issue. 
 Found it to be filled with more history and statistics than what the title states is in the content of this book. The author threw a curve when he went on a rant about those who believe in the Trinity. I fail to understand how belief, or non-belief, in a triune God is relevant to the topic of end times or biblical prophesy 
 This man needs to look inward to see who the enemy is that will destroy America.  Christ would puke the Bushtians from his mouth as the new pharasies.  Pat is living proof that maybe he should "whack himself".  Also living proof that cousins should refrain from intimate moments.  This dated piece of tripe is proof that in 2005 the "enemies" he names are now the hacks he supports.  The reader would be advised to search to the Saintly writings of John Paul II to find the meaning of the Saviors teachings 
 I bought this anthology based on the two positive reviews from other purchasers. Four stars seemed like a pretty good recommendation. However, I received the book yesterday and was fairly disappointed. Many of the songs are quite poorly done, and all of them are much too simple. Big Yellow Taxi, for instance, has several chords that are clearly not correct and sound nothing like the "real" version. I thought Circle Game was the best rendition overall, but other than that, I wouldn't bother purchasing this. I have not bought any other Joni Mitchell book, but if this is the best out there, then I think I've just discovered a niche in the market....I'll be off writing my own, and accurate, version of these songs 
 If Mr. Alterman just watched a nightly news cast of CNN, which are full of liberals and how they blast any and everything that does not agree with their limited perception of reality, then he would know that this is standard for all news on cable and web, tear apart the truth and just form a limited perception of reality. Uneducated viewers eat this liberal trash up like McDonalds fast food, however those who know better, avoid it because it can be damaging to one's mental health, but then again Mr. Alterman just wrote this book for the money, even if he makes a fool of himself doing it 
 The drawings and illustrations are fantastic except for a few pages with women without tops (shirts). We don't feel that is appropriate for our grade school boys so we returned the book. We could have torn out the pages or tried to cover them, but felt that wasn't the best solution. 
 Should really be titled the true story of three men who ran away from the Nazis and hid in the woods.  Its true that they defied the Nazis but mainly just by staying alive.  No mean feat, certainly, and neither is the rescue of 1200 other humans.  But as a tale of war, or even resistance, it leaves much to be desired.  The story this purports to be remains to be told 
 This book provides an intriguing look back at a time when the Dot Com Boom was at its zenith, shortly before the crash. Interestingly, there is no sense of the impending doom that lies just over the horizon.  Lewis' "Liar's Poker" was extremely enjoyable, particularly because of the flash and personality of the central players. In this book, Lewis seems to have lost his way as he tries to wring interest from a much less compelling or likable chief character. The tone of the book is further weakened by the constant labels applied to Clark's disciples as the "smartest," "best," "greatest," and "most ingenious," individuals in their various fields.  What strains credibility, however, is the attribution of all Clark's successes to his incredible intelligence and foresight, while the fault of his failures is cast on the incompetent actions and short-sighted beliefs of others. History will probably not judge Clark as charitably as Lewis -- especially since most of the Clark's companies have either failed outright or remain but shells of their Dot Com era glory (most notably SGI, Netscape, and Healtheon).  Throughout the book, Jim Clark is touted for wealth that amounts to between $3 and $4 billion. The list of 2004 Forbes 400 Richest in America shows Jim Clark with an approximated net worth of $700 million. For a man who brags he will quit making money when his fortune eclipses that of Oracle's Larry Ellison, today Clark probably most regrets the loss of his favorite designation: billionaire.  
 You'd think the director of the original Japanese series could turn out a decent sequel. But nooooooo....   Instead, "The Grudge 2" is a detailed, shimmering example of why people loathe sequels, and how (with rare exceptions like preplanned trilogies) they are pretty much always bad. Overused spooks, lackluster acting and a plotless plotline are only a few of the things wrong with this croaking horror.   Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) learns that her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is seriously ill, and goes to Japan to fetch her -- with horrifying results. Karen's last warning: "Don't go in that house."   Other people aren't doing the same, since a trio of schoolgirls went into the house and are now being haunted by everyone's least favorite croaking ghosts, Kayako and Toshio. And an American family in Chicago is being slowly destroyed by visions of the ghosts, which have somehow transferred out of Japan and into the United States.   Aubrey and a reporter investigate the odd circumstances of Karen's madness and demise, going to the abandoned house that Karen tried to burn down. As the malevolent ghosts close in on them, Aubrey discovers the secret past that has turned Kayako into an evil force that cannot be stopped...   Ghosts, ghosts, everywhere, and not one of them is actually scary. Apparently Takashi Shimizu assumed that the more apparitions you put in a movie, the scarier it becomes. Sadly, it doesn't work that way -- Kayako and Toshio pop up for a cheap care every few minutes, and when they aren't around, OTHER ghosts are popping up for no good reason.   All those ghosts are mainly there to prop up a thin-as-paper storyline, with flaccid dialogue and a few cursory nods to the previous film. The schoolgirl storyline is completely disposable, and the Chicago one is a transparent set up for the inevitable (and dreaded) "Grudge 3," during which the horror rules get recklessly broken. So only a third of the movie has any interesting content -- usually a few minutes of exposition about Kayako.   It's rather sad that Gellar is the ruling force here, and she's only in it for a few minutes total. She's certainly more charismatic than the Tamblyn, who seems to be sleepwalking through her role. Ohga Tanaka and Takako Fuji provide some scares as the ghosts, even misused, but the rest of the cast is simply going through the motions of really tepid acting.   "Grudge" had its flaws, but it was a horror masterpiece compared to its disastrously pointless sequel -- it's all about piling as many ghostly appearances as possible into three thin plots. Cinematically, this is a curse 
 This book is a well-needed antidote to those who think Islam is a "Religion of Peace." Since its inception in the mid-seventh century, Islam has been on the warpath; it conquered half of Christendom (all of North Africa; also Spain, Turkey, and the Balkins). Robert Spencer has done a fine job documenting Islam's unremitting attack on Christianity, and Christianity's only aggresive reply, the Crusades. This book is heady reading, and necessary especially in this day and age. 
 In his frequent jousts with critics and reviewers, MacDonald always takes the stance that his books do not justify anti-semitism; they merely describe it as a scientifically understandable, indeed predictable, response to certain supposed Jewish traits that he has identified as elements of a long-term Jewish evolutionary strategy.  (Many of these criticisms and rejoinders can be found on his own website.)  In other words, he is claiming the neutrality of an investigating scientist, and always acts offended when people accuse him of racism or anti-semitism.  If that's the case, why is he a frequent contributor to The Occidental Quarterly?  That journal's own statement of principles says, first, that "the West is a cultural compound of our Classical, Christian, and Germanic past," and, second, that "race informs culture."  (You'll also find, under principle 4, the lovely statement that "the European identity of the United States and its people should be maintained.")  Case closed.  This is an educated racist who is dressing up his bigotry in pseudo-academic language; all he means to say is that Jews have brought on their own persecution.  And I'm shocked that he has taken in so many readers.  Shame on Praeger for publishing these books 
 I bought this album thinking that it would be good...boy was I wrong! Ms. McBride did not do these songs justice by the way she sang them. Rose Garden, for example is my favorite song, and is sung by Lynn Anderson...it was the most beautiful song ever and you could almost feel the Rose Garden as Lynn was singing. Marting sang the song like it was a meaningless song...no feeling, emotions, etc. The rest of the songs sounded crummy too. Save your money and buy the orginal artist who sang the songs. 
 I gotta give it to that little girl who plays Harriet in the movie. She did a great job. But, I found Rosie O'Donnell's performance really lacking. Which made the film a little boring to watch at times. 
 Written by a pinch-nosed social climbing snob who loves to describe her Parisian haut monde acquaintances, this essay is about as accurate a depiction of the French and French life as a Thomas Wolfe novel about New York city's upper crust. Some of the observations, of course, are pertinent, such as the way people look at you.  Some are absurd, such as the observation that the Fench don't smile. I have been treated with helpfulness, kindness and respect by the French for more than 50 years.  Ms. Platt has lost scads by not permitting herself to know the French 
 I usually love her work, but this book never took off and the two main characters were highly annoying.  Just eh... 
 I felt as though the camera was clamped to a paint mixer. After about 30 minutes it gave me a headache so I turned it off. 
 Sorry, Folks, same title, same author, same publisher - it must be the same book.  Ms. Paxson holds an honored position in the Asatru Community.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, this book does not reflect the standing in the Community that her previous works have earned her.  Bad Vibes greeted me when I first noticed this book on the store shelves. Thick, printed on cheap newsprint (the kind that smells) - the glued spine will not survive repeated use that such a book should be subject to if it is a good one.  For the price, 'Taking Up the Runes' is already in trouble.  On the cover, under the Author's name it reads 'Author of Ancestors of Avalon'.  Why do I care what a fiction writer thinks about using Runes in spells, rituals, divination and magic?  The bibliography lists Ms Paxson's books of fiction - apparently nothing from her work in the Troth or onIdunna or Hrafnar were applicable to 'Taking Up the Runes'.  The Rune working/meanings are drawn mostly from books by other authors, some way out of print, others not.  The Rune spells are more Wiccan than Runic.  (Wiccan in that they rely on invoking the appropriate diety, verbalize the virtues of the Rune involved, reinforced by tokens related to the meaning of the Rune - actions paralleling the Rune, not directly working with it.  Runic working would invoke the appropriate diety, the sound, shape, meaning, and number directly.)  If you teach Rune Working, this book will be a requirement, due to the author's credentials, not the content.  Name sells this book, not knowledge.    Sorry Folks, Ms Paxson is a forerunner in the Germanic Tradition - she is capable of better work than this.  
 This book is good for devoloping a litte more technique, but I gotta say that's about it....Example: the "chapter" on string bending is like one lick over and over again with some subtle differences. The same goes for the other chapters. They never go really in depth or give you a variety of playing material 
  I first heard about this book in a graduate level Latin American survey course.  I kept it in the back of my mind and finally got around to reading it years later.  The professor had described it glowingly and subsequent references to it that I came across were all very positive.  Consequently I really looked forward to reading this book.  I was extremely disappointed.  Published in 1938 I would say that overall the book has aged badly.  It is overly dramatic, even emotionally silly in parts. The plot is insipid.  The Mexican characters are not Mexican but European with a little Mexican airbrushing.  The indigenous people are portrayed as one-dimensional simians.    I read that prior to writing the book Graham Greene spent a total of eight weeks in Mexico.  It sadly shows.   He has little understanding of Mexico.  I can't understand the continuing hoopla surrounding this work.  If you want to read some decent fiction about early twentieth century Mexico try something by B. Traven. 
 I bought this book because I thought it would be a great Christmas gift, luckily I read this before I gave it to anyone.  It was so blah, it was NOT funny, in fact it elicited no emotions at all from me except boredom.  I decided I could not give anyone this weird, boring book for Christmas, so now I am stuck with it.  I usually have a pretty off-beat sense of humor, I can laugh at most situations, but this book killed any chance of laughter 
 This book is not completely without merit, but it's really one of those books that should have been damned with faint praise & allowed to slink off quietly & die.  I feel my primary responsibility here is to debunk Spider's slavish blurb praising this...novel.  And yes, it's supposed to be `funny,' & quite possibly supposed to be bad SF-if so, it's a success on some levels anyway.  Terry Pratchett fans may enjoy it, those of us who enjoy our `funny' novels a little more `funny' may be annoyed.  So:  1)	Heinlein wouldn't have loved it.  For SF published in 2001, the science sucks: a crime is committed, a crime for which no expense is spared in finding the thieves, flakes of skin are left behind at the scene, yet in this far future of space ships & psychic powers (which a few pages before they are introduced are pooh-pooh as bad science fiction), no one apparently is capable of analyzing DNA.  The discussion of radio-isotope dating shows no understanding of either current techniques (which it explains ham handedly), nor how the technology might evolve over thousands of years.  There's lots more. 2)	It's not so much like Heinlein's work that you might think he wrote it.  I have read every good work of Heinlein's (many several or dozens of times), and most of the crap he produced after he lost it.  This doesn't read like good Heinlein or even senile, sex obsessed old Heinlein, not even the page we are given that is `such a good forgery even the experts were still debating its authenticity after 4 years,' bares the slightest resemblance to anything he could or would have written.  It's bad.  It's just plain bad. 3)	Spider Robinson lost my respect a long time ago.  When he started out he was a Canadian hippy with his own voice, who also wrote damn good SF reviews & happened to like Heinlein a lot.  I read all of his reviews for years, and bought many good books based on them, I also bought his first several novels, which verged on brilliant, and possessed many of the qualities he assigns this minor piece of trash.  But then RAH got sick, and people started rightly questioning particularly the sexism of some of his works (and taking nothing away from his literary accomplishments, which are impressive) & then he died.  At this point, for reasons only Spider can say, Spider lost it.  He wrote diatribes defending Heinlein that while providing much good evidence in Heinlein's favor, made the serious mistake of ignoring the mounds of evidence that also supported his opponent's positions.  Additionally, & much more damningly, his own work changed over the course of a novel or a novel and a half into a third rate pastiche of Heinlein that magnified his faults, and left almost everything that does give RAH resonance & poetry & power far behind.  I stopped reading him, and his opinion stopped matching anything that fit into my reality. 4)	Lastly, though I'm sure both Robinson & Janifer will deny any malfeasance, the fact that both Spider's name & the name of his most famous character occur on the first page of the novel, strikes me as quid pro quo of the most bald faced kind.  This is not a horrible novel.  It's vaguely funny.  It's mildly interesting.  But it's no Robert Heinlein, nor is it funny as, say, Douglas Adams.  But it's not horrible. 
 The Charlie Moon series is getting more amusing and more "spiritual", for lack of a better word, as it evolves. Certainly, Moon has become a more interesting character.  He was always more interesting than the earlier protaganist in the series Scott Parris. I enjoy the series but it is not my favorite reading. I find hiding of clues and information from the reader irritating.  
 This novel began as a short story published in an anthology titled The Dragon Quintet.  It was the best of the collection and when I learned that Lackey had decided to use it as the basis for a novel, I was delighted.  Within a short time, I had a copy of the novel in hand and looked forward to reading it.  The reality was less than the anticipation.  The first 108 pages encompass one day in the life of Vetch, the 10-year-old boy who is the protagonist of the story.  Now, we all know how much energy children can have, but this lad accomplishes more in this one day than most people can get done in a week.  He also has the wisdom of the ages and tends to repeates himself incessantly, especially when he is judging others.  In this latter regard, good editing and tightening would have been of great benefit.  One does not have to get very far into this story to recognize the references to ancient Egyptian culture, history, and mythology.  Unfortunately, these references are neither strong enough nor slight enough to actually work.  Instead they are something of an irritant:  either be Egyptian or don't 
 Although I find this book very thorough in its coverage, it was not useful for me.  I am trying to build my own home and was looking to 1)understand the building process and all that is involved, and 2) by understanding more about the intricacies of building, be able to cut costs and save money.  It is assumed by the author that the reader is entrusting all of the work from start to finish to a contractor.  This is great if you have the resources to build a top-of-the-line custom home.  I don`t 
 This book is perhaps the most disgusting display of blatant prejudice I have ever witnessed in a work of fiction. I don't believe Mr. Caldwell could possibly have interacted on any personal level with any of the people whom he so cruelly and stereotypically portrays. As a resident of the South, I have had literally thousands of narratives of the Great Depression passed down to me through family and friends. None ever reflected anything in the realm of this book. "Tobacco Road" reflects a view that poverty equals inhumanity, and this could not be farther from the truth. As social parody this book is almost entertaining--but taken as seriously as the tone of the writing encourages, it is ludicrous.  
 I hoped after the rotten ending in book 3 that this would give us some sort of hope for a sequel so that Will and Lyra could be together again someday and maybe have more adventures. No, sorry. Not a chance. This is just a shameless way of getting another 10 bucks off the dumb reader (me) who hoped there might be some way that Pullman was going to go back to the world in His Dark Materials. To call this a teaser would be flattery. The story is only about 60 or so pages and frankly, not very good. It's as though Pullman is no longer comfortable with the characters in the Dark Materials trilogy. Lyra is almost a different person entirely and at the end of this teeny volume I was asking myself what was the point? The book is supposed to make the reader feel like they've stumbled upon papers and documents out of another world, a postcard here, a newspaper clipping there, but it falls flat. Ah well, he got me again. I bought this hoping for more that a flat short story about a girl named Lyra who in no way resembles the spunky heroine of the Dark Materials trilogy. Luckily, I was able to return this so I'm not totally ripped off. It's just a shame, kind of like the ending to the trilogy. Buy with caution or check it out of the library 
 DO NOT BUY THIS PUZZLE FOR YOUR CHILD! MY DAUGHTER HAD THESE PUZZLE AND THE SCREWS HOLDING THE ITEMS TO THE WOOD BOARD COME APART. THEY ARE VERY SMALL SCREWS AND NUTS THAT I ACTUALLY FOUND IN MY DAUGHTERS MOUTH. I CONTACTED COMSUMERS AFFAIRS LAST YEAR ABOUT THIS PUZZLE AND I CAN NOT BELIEVE IT IS STILL ON THE MARKET. I AM ONLY WRITTING THIS SO THAT AS A PARENT YOU WILL NOT HAVE TO GO TO THE SCARE I DID. 
 To be honest, I didn't read it all from cover to cover.  Of that which I read, I found it was a lot of psycho babble and I always found myself asking "How do you know that?" They did include references, but I found myself questioning the basic logic.  Also, I didn't find this book helpful in being a better mother, which is the reason I bought it in the first place. 
 The setting of this film is in the late 70s, just before adult movie theatres were driven out of business by the invention of the VCR and the subsequent explosion of pornographic VHS tapes.  Burt Reynolds plays a porno director who has the effrontry to try and be "artistic" in his craft.  Heather Graham plays his psycho-starlet, and Mark Wahlberg plays a porn star who is....well.....let's just say, endowed.  Wahlberg's character quickly becomes a huge hit and encounters success he would have never dreamed of. Wahlberg's character seems to be a sort of oblique allusion to John Holmes, although I don't know if the film-makers would admit as much.   At any rate, he becomes arrogant and begins to believe that he is loved for factors other than his "package."  This hubris leads to his un-doing as the world of porn coalesces with the world of drugs and LOTS of shady characters.  This sounds like it would be the framework for a good movie.  Well, it could have been, but all the way through there seems to be something missing.  There are times the film "seems" to try and convey a message, but I'm not really sure.     One thing I do know is that I quickly remembered why I've never cared for Wahlberg.  He has all the screen presence of a bowl of yogurt.   Also, I was expecting a LOT more skin than what the film delivered.  Given the context of the film, one would think that it would be an excuse to parade miles of topless women.  That's simply not the case.  In the end, however, the biggest problem of this movie isn't Wahlberg or the lack of nudity.  The difficulty is that it's just plain boring.  I have more than a passing interest in the history of porn, and yet this flick failed to grab me 
 I ordered this CD specifically for Red, Red Wine and the whole song isn't even on there!  I was VERY disappointed.  Best song they ever recorded and I wasted my money trying to get it.  Don't get this CD if you like that song 
 This book has great ideas for cupcake flavors and frosting/fillings, but the cakes themselves are lackluster.  In 3 attempts, I have yet to make anything better from scratch than I could make with a betty crocker mix.  Which is a lot of work for semi-satisfying results.  
 I bought this seat for my son when he was probably around 6 months old and just starting on solid foods.  Ten months later, I hardly ever use the darn thing.  It worked okay for us for a little while but it was not one of my better baby purchases.  My complaints with the product:  - Not particularly sturdy.  The backrest portion in particular seems to pop off way too easily. - The straps that secure it to the kitchen chair are annoyingly long and in the way.  Not such a problem when the seat is secured to the chair because you can just tuck the straps in somewhere.  However, everytime I remove the seat from the chair the straps prove to be a real pain in the rear.  And unfortunately it seems I need to unstrap and remove the seat after every meal to clean the bits of food that inevitably end up on the big chair to which this seat is secured (another complaint). - The second tray which pops on over the swing away tray (at least on my particular model) is very easily removed by my son.  He lifts it up and dumps his food on the floor.  The point of this second tray was to make food prep and cleanup easier but it fails miserably. - This seat is not at all sturdy or useful as a stand alone seat.  It HAS to be strapped to a chair or it will easily tip over.   The good things about this product are that it is relatively inexpensive and is a good spacesaving alternative to a regular highchair which sucks up so much floor space.  It is also fairly easy to clean due to the plastic design.    Overall it is not a bad product but not on my list of favorites.  If I had it to do over, I would have bought a similar type of chair but probably a different brand 
 The worst S.E Hinton book ever. I felt more compassion for Freddy vs. Jason then i did for the characters in this book. Motorcycle boy was a spokesmen for medication. His bipolar gave a new divination of metal illness. And worse was the losers who crowned him king of the streets. The film version was even worse. I thought the photography was down by spike the rugrats dog.   
 Brown's work is nothing save self-serving, poorly written, half-thought out tripe: I would call it pablum for the masses, save that this seems to overstate the value of the work.  There is naught of value here.  This marks nothing more, or less, than a voyeuristic/self-indulgent (depending, of course, upon one's point of readership) excursis upon a tragedy.  Brown does no service to the memories of those whose lives were senselessly disrupted.  Much of his writing is spiteful, presenting himself as a figure of authority, qualified to comment upon the role of violence in modern American society.    What credentials does the author present?  This I ask.. 
 this product is not what I expected.  I was hoping that my daughter would like to help me bake......  well she was afraid to touch the mat, especiall when my fingers were burned by it.  I did't like how it worked.  
 MUST READ REVIEW: The Free Speech Haters have deleted this review Three times, gotta love those lefties.  This book was written by two young university professors and comes off as an extreme ideological rant rather than a mature scholarly critique. Hacker and Pierson's main thesis is that the country has been pulled to the right by Republican extremists. HUhhhhhhh? Say What????? Are you Kidding me??? Please remember these are two very young, teachers, one at Berkley (can you say extreme left) and they are probably viewing their idea of history as 1980 on. The plain facts are that from the 1940's - 1980's, America was pulled brutally to the left. The Conservative Party was weak and simply capitulated to the powerful democrats. During the 1980's the American people realized this country's slide toward socialism, they also began to see that the policies were failing miserably to create the supposed utopia of the left. So starting from the 1980's to current day the pendulum has begun to swing back towards the center. The problem though is that the center now has been moved so far left that the republican party of today appear more like the democrat party of the 1960,s. Compare and contrast JFK's platforms with GW's you will be surprised at how many issues that JFK endorsed are considered exclusive right-wing positions today and would be anathema for the democratic party to uphold.  Starting with their flawed interpretation of the political landscape they make mistake upon mistake. Take for example the political theory that dictates that to stay in power a party must appeal to the swing voters and the middle. If any party goes too far to the right or to the left it will be penalized. Hello professors, this is exactly what is happening to the Democratic Party today. Those of us in the middle look at those in control like Howard Dean, or we see the mouthpieces of the democrats like Michael Moore or Al Franken and we are appalled. The message put forward by these people is simply nauseating to the moderates.  For example the average person hears Democrats claiming to be the party of working man. Books are written like Whats the Matter with Kanasas? Asking why middle Americans won't vote for the party of the working/common person? Never does it dawn on these talking heads that putting forward such lies are damaging their own causes. Most people know that the Democrats are in fact the party of millionaires. 64% of all contributions under $200 go to republican candidates only 35% of the common people's money goes to Democrats. But people who gave $1 MILLIOM OR MORE to politicians or parties gave 92% to democrats. We all remember Bill Clinton's tax increase that raised everybody's taxes except the top 400 taxpayers, hmmmm wonder why? And what about auctioning off the Lincoln bedroom, you see this buying of power and financing by the elites is aggravating, but it is the hypocrisy of the Democrats plays very unfavorably with moderates..  In the end the authors main thesis is so flawed that to debate the secondary issues is beating a dead horse. The facts are clear; the Democratic party has shifted radically to the left and has dragged the country along with it. We have been witnessing a swing of the pendulum back to the center. Moderates will continue to vote for Republicans as long as the extremist control the Democratic Party. Boot out the fringe left, restore some sort of moral compass and stop being hypocritical and the Democratic Party could make a comeback. As a final suggestion to the authors, get out of your leftist bubbles and talk to the moderates, you might find out the truth.  TO: MacDesinger. Why must you attack my factually correct statement and print lies? My email address is prominently displayed; you could have emailed me and gotten a education. Instead, it is you that is lying and trying to smear me. The numbers I state are for the 2000 election cycle. They are truthful and correct, it is you sir that is lying, shame on you. Next time check your facts correctly.  
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 this movie is part Canadian soap opera and part effective slasher movie. The plot is a ripoff of THE PROWLER, or vice versa (either way, the prowler is a MUCH better movie, go see that instead). It deals with a vengeful wraith promising to spree if a valentine's party is ever held after a tragic holiday party-to-blame accident in a coal mine left one survivor to resort to cannibalism and unemployment. Of coarse you know them crazy kids  go and party anyways. Basically, anything to do with the killer miner or the mine itself is great, but everything else is just plain tacky. John Stanley of the Creature Features guide gave it 4 stars...I've decided that anything he says is good is automatically bad. I can't believe that a Band actually decided to ripoff this particular piece of pop culture to sell records. Its not because they were on drugs but because they were in the imagination-less state of NOT doing drugs 
 I was very disappointed in the quality of this DVD.  I would not recommend anyone buying this DVD until the quality is back to that of a professional recording 
 This planner is pretty poorly organized.  For example, the section on announcing your engagement (which one might expect to be in the first chapter) isn't until Chapter 4.  Setting the date is in Chapter 3, after you've already read about selecting your wedding party in Chapter 2.  It doesn't make much sense to choose your attendants before you even have a date, so why organize the book that way?  There also wasn't much new information in the book that I hadn't read somewhere else before.  However, the checklists seem somewhat useful; I've only used the budget checklist so far.  There are no pockets to hold business cards or contracts or notes, a definite drawback. If you have State Farm insurance, you can get a special edition of this book for free through your insurance agent.  It sure beats paying 20 bucks for a mostly useless planner 
 This book is a great disappointment.  I forced myself to continue on thru the first 300 pages and now I am getting rid of it.  What of waste of my precious reading time 
 A nice-looking book and I'm sure the recipes are very good but they are just not conducive to everyday cooking.  I was looking for recipies to bring more fiber and nutrition into my family's lives. Though the beans will surely do that..the recipes often have many unusual or expensive ingredients that I don't even know where to find (e.g., whole black mustard seeds, nasturtium flowers, nigella seeds, Madeira, 'confit of duck legs-?? etc). Other recipes require things like toasted coriander seeds, toasted allspice,  etc. that take a lot of time to prepare. It's clearly written by a chef for other chefs or people who can afford the expensive ingredients, have access to gourmet food stores or to spend all day in the kitchen...not for the everyday cook. I gave it 2* - not because it's a bad cookbook...it's just not very usable to me...and unfortunately, will probably sit on my shelf unopened most of the time. =( 
 I usually can listen to the more Avant-garde side of hardcore and metal (things such as Blood Brothers (their older stuff), Plot To Blow Up The Eiffel Tower, and almost anything with Mike Patton in it) but i cant seem to get myself to like this. A friend of mine gave me this cd as a gift, and i've tried to like it, but it just wont grow on me. The music is good, its basically fast as hell over blast beats, and the songs are only an average of 60 seconds in length. Unfortunatly it never really draws me in. I am glad to see that there is still originality left in music but this isnt my cup-o-tea. 
 McCarthy is a very talented writer (read Blood Meridian and All the Pretty Horses) but he is also known for a very melodramatic style of writing, using many archaic words. Suttree is written is this style and one could say it is 471 pages of melodrama without a plot. Despite the novel's length it is very underdeveloped and the reader is not sure why he should even care about the main character. Certain chapters are interesting (the workhouse chapter especially), but these passages are few and far between. Also the violence at times is ridiculous and does nothing to advance his ever prevalent theory that the world has always been this way and will continue in this way. McCarthy writes about nature beautifully, but after finishing this book, one is left unfulfilled. 
 My professor gave us an assignment- read this book and write a review paper. Writing the paper almost caused me committed suicide. I would read million times of Emily Dickson's poetry and never feel tired.Never!!! But I can't stand Alice Notley's book. The only thing that I learned from her is she's a very self-centered person. And she made me get lost over and over when I was reading her poetry. My classmates said, "How I goanna write a paper about her. She's SUCKS!!!" And I agreed with them. I felt sorry for myself : spent $14 on her book 
 The narrator spoils the story right off the bat by telling you nearly everything that's going to happen.  It's simply a gorgeous looking movie with great performances, but any suspense of the story is removed.  Hell, the title alone "Ghost Wife" tells you more than you should know.  Imagine if you knew Bruce Willis was a ghost at the start of Sixth Sense?  A nice diversion from American films, but not very compelling at all.  Plus, this version of the DVD contains subtitles on top of other subtitles which is very confusing.  There's English subtitles for dialogue, but many location or transitionary text in the original language is not accompanied with an English one.  Just a sloppily thrown together DVD, that doesn't even have a menu.  Just starts playing the movie as soon as you put it in 
 I completely agree with the reviewer who deemed this novel "overkill" with regards to the puppy mill preaching.  Those of us interested enough in dogs to pick up this book and read it are already well aware of the puppy mill industry.  This choir member did not appreciate being preached at for 45 pages of a novel that would have been better spent with more plot development.  Also, I got a little weary of all the explanations of dog training and AKC show terms and slang.  Again, those of us interested enough in dogs to pick up this novel already know what UDX, CDX and OFA stand for.  Readers interested enough in dogs to pick up this book but do not know what BOB stands for, what "finishing" a dog means, or what an Open class is would probably take the time to find out.  I would have preferred a Patrick O'Brian appraoch in regards to the terms and slang.  Just throw 'em out there for those of us who know, and pique the interest of those that don't.  The way it turned out, however, is that one hundred and fifty pages of a 256 page novel were all either dog show terms explained, or extolling the evils of the puppy mill industry.  I am a bit amazed that Ms. Conant does not say anything at all about the average "backyard breeder" who knows nothing of breeding dogs and wants to do it simply because his dog has papers, who do just as much damage to a breed as puppy mills, if not more.  Go figure.  I have two other Susan Conant Dog Lover's Mysteries to read, and after this first, I am a little leery of even opening the covers 
 There were so many references in the business magazines to this writer that I was tempted to buy this book. But I must say that I was greatly disappointed. There is absolutely nothing new in the book. Peter Senge wrote a better book on mental models--one of the key ideas promoted by the author. No one can succeed in any manner by reading this book. Srikumar may be a good teacher, but it does not make him any authority to write on this subject 
 I will not elevate this book to the status of a legitimate work of intellectual inquiry by writing a detailed critique of it.  Suffice it to say that the author, rather than citing objective evidence in support of her conclusions, does nothing except make baldly conclusory statements which conform to her ultra-feminist world view.  If Ms. Adams wishes to be a vegetarian feminist, that's her business.  But until she can come up with objective evidence that her hypothesis is true, she comes across as nothing but a rambling mad-woman.  Using the conclusory technique employed by Ms. Adams, I could easily write an equally legitimate book claiming that vegetarianism causes oppression of men worldwide.  Any publishers out there interested 
 Do not read this book unless you have never even heard of the Human Resources profession.  The book covered such basic concepts that anyone with a little common sense could have figured out on their own.  I wanted to learn more about the laws that govern H.R., recruiting and sucession planning.  There was a simple introduction to a few of the laws that affect H.R. policies, but nothing in depth.  The section on recruiting was extremely basic and succesion planning was not even mentioned.  I have only been in the H.R. business for one year and this book didn't cover anything I didn't alreaady know 
 The author of this book tries to demonstrate that to avoid legalism and antinomianism we must look at God's redemptive program "covenantally". There are two major sections in the book. The first section deals with the major redemptive covenants in the Bible (Abrahamic, Mosaic, and New); the second section deals with how the "covenant perspective" affects evangelism, election, and regeneration. Shepherd's approach is unlike that of other Reformed theologians. He argues that the "prophets and apostles viewed election from the perspective of the covenant, whereas we [modern Reformed theologians] have tended to view the covenant from the perspective of election" (p. 83). The thesis of this book is alarming and can undermine salvation by grace through faith alone. By emphasizing "covenant keeping" at the expense of Christ's sacrificial work and God's electing grace, Shepherd has turned around and gone back to the theology of the Medieval Scholastics that the Reformers opposed. In his discussion of the Mosaic Covenant, he argues that the Israelites had to obey the stipulations of this covenant in order to receive salvation (p. 40). Most Reformed scholars argue that the Mosaic Covenant did not provide eternal life, but temporal life in the Promised Land. Shepherd states that the Abrahamic Covenant was conditional, yet he forgets that God is the ONLY One who passed between the torn animals (Genesis 15:17). Therefore, God will fulfill this covenant regardless of the faithfulness (or faithlessness) of His people. Shepherd also states that the New Covenant is not opposed to the Mosaic Covenant (p. 57). If that is the case why did God have to give a New Covenant in the first place (Jeremiah 31:31)? The New Covenant is unconditional, and those who receive Christ will have the Law written in their hearts forever. He also states that in "Jesus we are enabled to become the covenant keepers that God intended us to be from the beginning" (Ibid). This sounds more like Romanism (with its view of infused righteousness) rather than Protestantism (with its view of imputed righteousness). Romanists say that we are infused with Christ's righteousness so that we can persevere and be successful covenant keepers. Shepherd's chapter on the Great Commission is deplorable and one can easily detect his postmillennial bias. I'm sorry to say but the Messianic Kingdom in its fullness cannot arrive in the present age, it will come at the Parousia (Revelation 20). His chapter on election is also controversial since no believer can have assurance of salvation since he or she cannot know whether he or she is an elect until he or she has fulfilled all the covenant requirements. I would argue (like most Reformed scholars do) that we are in the covenant of grace (or New Covenant) due to God's election of us in Christ. His accusation that traditional Reformed theologians cannot give comfort and assurance to struggling believers can also be turned around and used against his own view. Shepherd's theology does not only undermine assurance of salvation by putting primacy away from election, but destroys assurance by insisting on "covenant faithfulness" to the very end. Another disturbing part of Shepherd's book is his insistence that baptism "is therefore to be understood as of a piece with the total transformation of salvation" (p. 102). Therefore, baptism is part of the covenant obligation that one must go through in order to be saved. If this isn't works-salvation, I don't know what is. He argues that baptism is essential because there "are no secret believers, but only baptized believers" (p. 101). Did Shepherd forget that Joseph of Arimathea was a secret disciple or believer (John 19:38)? If covenant faithfulness is necessary for salvation what about those struggling believers like Lot, Samson, Solomon, Ananias and Sapphira, the Carnal Corinthians (1 Corinthians 3:1-3), and those Corinthians who died for abusing the Lord's Table (11:30)? Paul did not condone their behaviour but he knew that Christ's sacrifice covers all sins. To argue that we are not saved by works, but we won't be saved without them is double talk. The typical believer will assume a works-salvation mentality regardless of how you phrase the demands for works. Between antinomianism and legalism, Shepherd's view will make people slide down the hill of legalism. The Biblical way of looking at the relationship between salvation, covenant, and law is to subordinate covenant under Christ's sacrifice just as law is subordinate to the covenant. To put Christ's sacrifice, the covenant, and the law on an equal footing will undermine Christ's work on the Cross and lead believers into a Romanistic or Judaistic mentality. For those who think this book is such a great breakthrough in Reformed thought should think again. Shepherd's view sounds eerily similar to the Judaistic notion of covenant keeping by strict obedience. In fact, Shepherd does throw the Old Covenant into the New. The only positive thing about this book is that it will show the average believer where "ultra-covenantalism" will lead if left unchecked and gives readers a good understanding of unorthodox covenant theology 
 One hell of a waste of money! if you are expecting alot of the same charectors from the first movie like I was, you are in for a hell of a disappointment! the only reason why I think the first one was bad ass is cause Vin Diesel was in it, and yeah it was totally bad ass! I'll tell you one thing that this damn thing has in common with the first movie is that the only real cars were destroyed, in this movie you get two real cars this time, a 1969 Camaro SS, and a 1970 Dodge Challenger r/t and they both get destroyed! who in their right mind would destroy those sexy cars! God all mighty! Don't waste your money on this movie, I wouldn't take this disappointment if it was given to me! if you are wanting to buy a kick ass movie, buy Frost bite! you won't be disappointed 
 I enjoy Jackie Chan's films but this was an exception.  It would have been fine to have cast this movie with just Jackie Chan and Fann Wong.  These two actors were great as a team.  Adding Owen Wilson to the mix was unnecessary and spoiled an otherwise excellent plot.  When he wasn't tedious, Wilson was boring.  Why was he even cast in this film?  This was a movie I won't be in a hurry to see again 
   I see several rave reviews with which I don't agree.  What I find absolutely incomprehensible is that almost all these reviewers make use of this book in Judeo-Christian religious formation.  Please be assured that this book is not only without religious or theologic value but will confuse your children or thoroughly misinform them.     Some heretical concepts which Marc Gellman advances through his book include: - creation which pre-existed God (denies ex-nihlo creation) - repeatedly points to God as limited in power, unable to complete creation,  - presents the fall of man and original sin as an act of ultimate love which God approved and found joy in.     The writing is cute and very creative, but cute doesn't count in what must be treated as a serious topic even for small children.  And "creativity" has no proper place here either.  We do not create.  We attempt to understand, explain, and imitate what God has created and revealed.        Don't waste your time or money on this book, and keep it away from your children.  A good alternative for stories in the bible would be... The Bible. 
 The book concentrates on only a few scholarships and if you are not targeting one of these scholarships, the book is a waste of money 
 This is another case of a rap group gaining fame because the media made them their darlings. If you listen to this album it really is just plain mediocre. The songs are very weak and the lyrics are lame. They piggybacked off the success of Aerosmith and are really overrated 
 Reading Reclaiming God's Original Intent for the Church  reminds me of panning for gold in a river; there is allot of useless mud and dirt but every once in awhile you come across a tiny gold nugget.  Overall I was incredibly disappointed with this book. I felt like I was simply reading another polemic against The Purpose Driven Church, or two men whine about what they dislike about the "modern" church, instead of really pinpointing what God's intent is.    Three things really aggravated me about this book.  The first was the tremendously poor church history that is implored.  The authors contrast some magical perfect pre-Nicaea church that never existed, against this tremendously flawed corporate "Christendom" that was birthed by Constantine. Their claim, that if only we can shed modernity and get back to our early-church roots is a complete farce, because it fails to understand that the church throughout the ages, yes even the early-church, was made up of sinners.    Secondly, I was offended by the broad generalizations they made.  As a former youth pastor I was insulted by their claim that many youth ministers leave there ministries because they are looking to climb that corporate ladder (118). I don't think the general statements that the authors make in this book are part of God's intent for the church.    Finally, the chapter entitled "It's About Listening-Not Just Preaching" was awful. The authors are correct to say in counseling and evangelism Christians spend way to much time talking instead of listening.  However, they have gotten good counseling confused with good preaching.  As a matter of fact I would argue that one of the reasons the church has become so irrelevant is that there are very few gifted preachers in this country. Romans 10:17 say "faith comes from hearing the message." I would contend that preaching is central when it comes to reclaiming God's original intent for the church.  I will say that I did appreciate their point: that the role of pastor is about a calling and not a career.  I believe there is something to learn from the church of Antioch; that sent people of proven maturity and effectiveness to new areas. I would claim one of God's original intents for the Church is to send young pastors to our modern day Antioch parishes (large and stable churches). And dispatching our pastors of proven maturity and effectiveness to unchurched areas, instead of vice versa.   This book is a quick and easy read; however it does not come close to effectively reclaiming God's original intent for the church!       
 Maybe it was me, but I kept wanting this book to work and it just never grabbed me and I had to put it down.  It was almost aggravating 
 This is something for a new manager with little experience in not only systems administration but supervision.  This book may give a clue to someone who has just stepped into such a position but provides little depth and direction.  Unfortunately, there isn't any one book out there as management is a very complex role that encompasses many disciplines, any one of which would be a volume in itself.  I was very dissappointed and I find the other reviews misleading 
 I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$ 
 To my surprise this is a live recording rather than the orginal songs.   For instance the "London___Blues" is not GP Nunn but JJ himself.   Not all bad but certainly not what I expected 
 Eve Dallas is a cop in the future, chasing drug dealers, killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general. Her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of Eve's rich husband and ends up dead.I hated this book, the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags 
 Don't waste your time reading them...  They tell you absolutely nothing.  Each entry contradicts the other.  Remember, humans write these things 
 There isn't anything new here unless you want to fall asleep reading about cheese and whisky.  Dr. Weil gives examples of how some cheese's and whisky get better as they age as if this is supposed to correlate to people.  I love Dr. Weil's other books and his website but I was disappointed by this book.  If you want to read a good anti-aging book read Roy Walford's 120 year Diet.  An excellent read.  
 For those who have never read "new age" mystic like Deepak Chopra or L.Ron Hubbard, or views on the merging of the eastern mystics with christianity, this might seem like a new book. But to most SF (speculative fiction) fans, we've seen this done too many times.   It wouldn't turn a head at the Nebula Awards or even make it as a serial in Fantasy. It's been done so much better by people like Philip K. Dick, Isaac Asimov or Alfred Bester.  OK, what's wrong with it. Stop me if you've heard this one. Well the premise is from Fail Safe or maybe Dr. Strangelove. The out of control super-computer, with the mind of a maniacal would be world dictator. And the US military is out to blow it up before it can saturate the planet with nuclear explosions. But guess what? The computer is on to them...Oh My...Lions tigers and bears OH MY...we're not in Kansas any longer. (Where are the singing Munckins when you need them!)  Whose going to straighten all this out???? Well, Dr.Tennant, that's who...doh ti dah, dotid di dot ti dahhhhh...able to leap all religions in a single bound, more powerful that quantum mechanics...look up in the sky, it's SUPER DOC! or is it DOC the Christ, Jesus, this was ridiculous at some points.  There is a fine line between profound and unfounded, and Iles has done a great job of tripping over the line. I have read other Iles books, notably "24", and found them interesting and well written. But why do I think if this manuscript was submitted under a nom de plume, it would have been laughed at. Probably because it was past plausibility.  Characterization belongs in a cartoon...mean evil general who beats his daughter, daughter who grows up meaner than daddy, frightened Indian neurologist, stylish eccentric englishman, persevering psychiatrist (and jewish to boot), noble palestinians and mosad (israeli) agents. Our hero is more resolute than James Bond, tougher than Jackie Chan, a better shot than a trained sniper, able to survive on land, air and on the sea....oh and don't forget the crazy billionaire computer genius who wants to have himself downloaded into the mega-computer so that he can live for eternity.  One word, UGH. 
 This book is total crap.It proves one very hard and frightening maxim:those who do not understand history are doomed to repeat it.The world did not, would not act on the Nazi threat, and the second world war was the result of the world's cowardice.It is a cop out to place blame on the Pope Pius XII, or the Catholic Church. In fact, one of the main reasons the world,meaning,most of europe,England,the USA,did not act was the huge amounts of Nazi sympathizers in those countries. Now we are in a similar situation in the war on terror.What will be the result 
 I also saw this on Oprah and was excited. Was a let down...I was hoping it would be more Christian based and not so superficial.  I would recommend "300 Questions Every LDS Couple Should Ask Before Marriage-- Alder.  It's for mormons but most of the questions are christian based if your looking for something with that slant 
 In this book you'll read about a love story. Pathetic but at least a love story. You'll read about New Orleans, a nurses's life, a hit man that blunders once and again. But what about the main plot? Why everybody was interested in Karen's life? Why, you'd read about that at the last 50 pages or so. So if you only read the last pages you'll save a lot of time.  I think LH can write better than this. 
 I tried this and it didn't work. To this day I still am a smoker 
 This could have been a very exciting book if it had been written by someone such as James Dodson instead of by Mr. Palmer.  Although he shares with us information about many exciting moments of golf matches and  facinating individuals, the book becomes incredibly boring because of all  his first person I-Me-My references 
 If you want to be scared and paranoid through your first pregnancy, then this is the book for you. This book has no insight on anything. It is vague. It doesnt explain anything in detail. It talks about every possible thing that could go wrong but probably wont. Each chapter lists all the symptoms you might be expeiriencing, but that is as far as that goes. Its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more! You might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor. It has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high-risk pregnancy 
 === quote   Pay no attention to the negative criticisms by those who are obviously Moonies. This is should be required reading. Nansook Hong had the courage to endure and to finally escape the clutches of this dangerous cult led by the Korean flake who thinks he's God.  === end   Funny, so people should not listen to the story of those who are still within the UM, why is this?   Also Rev. Moon himself doesn't claim to be God, this is always said by others, Rev.Moon stresses the point without God he would be nothing... 
 This book is way too wordy - passages that could take one or two sentences to set up are given a longer paragraph.  The storyline is predictable, and the characters not deep.  The storyline takes too long to develop - I was tempted to toss the book about 1/3 of the way through, but buy the time I got half way the book finally got my interest.  As an American reading the book, I found several English words/phrases that I didn't understand.  I picked this book up in an airport bookstore thinking that anything that they would carry would have to be good, but I was wrong.  
 My second disc, side one, skips, pauses, rolls back -- tell me how can I right this 
 Neoliberalism was born on September 11, 1973, when a US-backed military coup murdered the democratically elected President of Chile and ushered in the tyranny of General Pinochet who murdered and tortured thousands, closed parliament, and outlawed political parties and trade unions.  If that doesn't give you pause about the compatibility of neoliberalism and democracy, read this book.    In Hayek's model of an ideal constitution each citizen is given one vote per lifetime when they reach the age of 45 (page 113).  Then, Hayek decides that's probably too generous, and calls for an "indirect method of election" where the legislature would appoint regional delegates who would appoint new legislators, without any popular vote at all (page 114).    Neoliberals hate democracy, in both theory and practice, and are much more comfortable with an oligarchy 
 I like a guidebook with lots of pictures and detailed maps and this one lacks both.  Knowing exactly where I am when I'm driving is probably my number one necessity.   For armchair traveling and tourists with time to read this 400 page book provides interesting background 
 I worked in an independent outpatient facility in the early 1970's, when Al Lowen was publishing, which ought to give you some idea of the focus involved.  Bioenergetics had something to commend it, especially in the 70's, and still does, for people who are experiencing day-to-day stress (so what's new?).  But I do not see where the long-term benefit can be had for someone who is really ill: anorexic, paranoid, or psychotic.  As with a volcano, venting helps yet doesn't solve the underlying turmoil.  As a daily anger (or other) management tool it may be a bandaid but I do not believe it helps in the long run. I can personally testify that bioenergetics did nothing for me, although admittedly my exposure was not consistent. 35 years after the fact, I'm in conventional therapy as well as pharmaceutical treatment for issues that arose while I was working at the facility, aa was my tormentor 
 Barber's trenchant jargon updates slogans for class-warfare and utopian proletarian dictatorships. The rhetoric relies on emotion to bridge logical leaps, hides a distain for cause and effect relationships and sidesteps questions about human nature.  Instead, Barber carelessly brews a mix of hip buzzwords and mass marketing clich. If you read this tome, be prepared for endless repetition of 'the capitalist is dangerous, but united the people cannot be defeated':  Repeat the following 5 or 10 times and you have the book in a nutshell: "Jihad pursues a bloody politics of identity, McWorld a bloodless economics of profit. Belonging by default to McWorld, everyone is a consumer; seeking a repository for identity everyone belongs to some tribe. But no one is a citizen. Without citizens, how can there be ..." {fill in the blank with any utopian quality: justice, happiness, equality, etc.}  The central problem for 21st century Marxists is updating the logic of class struggle.  In the first half of the 19th century Marx taught a strict evolutionary progression from noble-savage to slavery, from slavery to feudalism, and from feudalism to capitalism.  Within a few years, Marx predicted, capitalism would collapse and the unavoidable socialist utopia would emerge.  Of course, the collapse didn't happen and Marxist have been rationalizing ever since.  Lenin had to add the Imperialist phase.  21st century Marxist need to show imperialism mutating into  global consumerism.   Towards this end, Barbour argues: 1. Capitalists have shed their 'nationalist' identity, finding it easier to enslave the proletariat via media manipulation. 2. Media manipulation (global consumerism) seeks to replace indigenous cultural identities with slavish loyalty to global products.   3. 'Wild Capitalism' promoting global products causes criminal damage to indigenous communities, and threatens environmental catastrophe.  4. Protecting these indigenous communities (victims) will require violence (socialist revolution).  Hidden beneath this victim-oppressor dualism lies the traditional Marxist faith in central planning or 'government by intellectuals.' Democracy can be dismissed because the 'means of communication' are held by the multinational capitalist elite.  And, Marxist don't need an elections, as intellectuals they already know what is best for everyone else. Thus, Barber spends the second half of the book describing the failures of democracy. Barber asserts that "the epoch on whose threshold we stand -- post communist, postindustrial, post national, yet sectarian, fearful, and bigoted -- is likely also to be terminally post democratic."   Time has not been kind to Barber. His 1995 predictions of post-democratic cultures has failed to materialize.  The 90s were not a decade of American decline.  Despite his attempts to be hip and techno-savvy, he entirely misses the dot com craze and  blogosphere. Further, failed to address the rise of Islamofascism.  He calls commercialism all sham, but relies entirely upon its rhetoric.  Consider the cover photo, why is the girl wearing so much makeup behind a chador?  How is she getting the Pepsi through the chador to here lips? The book has nothing to do with Islam, it is just a marketing sham about marketing shams.  In the end, it sell 'Barber, the hip international intellectual' and little else 
 I ordered this book having loved some other for dummies books.  Thank goodness I ordered several other saltwater tank books.  As I was picking through each of them I noticed that the for Dummies book contained information that completely contradicted the others!  I was so angry at the wrong information in this book that I sent it back at a $5.00 loss.  I'm actually considering checking some of my other for dummies books for errors.  Yes, the language is simpler than in other books, but the amount of wrong information is not worth the cost of the book.  Buy this if you want to kill some fish 
 The back cover advertises live performances of several songs. What you get is an hour-long interview "set against" a few seconds of songs here and there. I don't recommend this, even for die-hard fans. The interview footage is just slapped together and isn't particularly interesting or informative. Spend a few extra dolllars and pick up their concert DVD or video compilation 
 Road Trip - USA returns you a time when America was much, much slower paced. I purchased this book because I am interested in motorcycling some of these roads in the near future. Preferable, U.S.-50. A well written book that touches on the main points of interest across, and up and down America.I am looking forward to traveling some of these roads 
 After reading how many people said that this book presented a balanced examination of the "mysteries behind the da Vinci Code" I looked forward to reading this book. I was especially interested in what all these "experts" in diverse fields had to say. If you are looking for a mix of pro da Vinci code and anti da Vinci code people have to say, a sort of balanced presentation and response, you will not find it here. Only after I spent my money did I think to google the various contributors. Some are legitamate scholars. Elaine Pagels for example is a true scholar of gnosticism. (Some of her assumptions about gnosticism can be questioned for example how can a derivative work by gnostics written 500 years after the New Testament was written be a better source of Christian history. The standard approach is to put more weight on earlier documents than later - but I digress)The same could be said for mathmaticians, and some of the others, but they all are somewhat out of the left field. Others of the "scholars" are anything but scholars. I suggest you start googling names and make up your own mind. At any rate this is not a diversity of viewpoints as others claim it to be 
 The only good thing in this movie was Ms. Howard's performance, she is innocent and believable.   I can't understand how good actors like Weaver, Hurt, and Phoenix would let themselves be wasted on this. The 'plain' dialogue among the 'elders' is painfully numbing, choppy, and stilted.  And the directing drove me crazy, especially since M. Night...insists on filming group scenes as is he was just passing through, or following them without ever bothering with close-ups. These scenes make me feel like they were done by an amateur filmmaker with a his first video camera.   If you like the back of William Hurt's head, you'll get plenty of it in this film, the camera seems to avoid his face like the plague; which is too bad, since when he finally has a good speech, we are deprived of the anger I imagine was in his eyes.  I agree with others, I would have worked better as a 30 minute Twilight Zone episode.  Rent it first before you buy, and save some money for a classic thriller, like Psycho 
 First person history is one of the better ideas to come out of the historical community in decades.  Instead of the "Big Movers" picture, this movement looks into the actual "little people" who make up the bulk of those involved in history giving one an idea of life in such times....However, this book does not live up to that ideal.  Far from it, the short stories are just that, too short tales of hard times overcome and their participation in the War.  Much is colored by Brokaw's political bias (glowing descriptions of his progressive heroes,a large percentage of those portrayed) and poor history (the old saw about FDR saving the nation rather then his actual fault at causing most of the Depression's problems...)  There are likely better books out there on the subject, take the time and look as this will likely disappoint anyone truly wanting to learn about these times and the people involve 
 Shallow and pointless. Some of the commentary was cutting-edge ... a hundred years ago. 
 After reading his last few book with "co-authors" I wonder if he is even writing at all or are all the sub-par novels being churned out under his name coming straight from the "co-author". I have been a fan of Mr. Patterson since my first Alex Cross novel almost 10 years ago. While I still enjoy the Cross books, I find them more and more out of character as each new book comes out. Alex-vs- the vampire cult??? Kyle Craig a serial killer??? Alex joins the FBI??? Give me a break. I can only hope from the description of Cross X the series jumps back over the shark and gets back the glory it deserves 
 I expected to love the book.  I love horse racing.  I ride horses.  I'm not troubled by slow, dense, books.  So I'm very disappointed to find that this book did not engage me, and I have to throw in the towel and put it back in the stack.  I've read quite a few horse books including Horse People: Scenes from the Riding Life, but Michael Korda, and some by Rita Mae Brown - the Virginia Fox hunting series, and of course, Seabiscuit.  This is a character driven, rather than a plot driven book.  Nevertheless, I didn't find that I enjoyed any of the characters, particularly Al and Rosalind - whose marriage did not float my boat.  As I forced my way deeper and deeper into it, I found myself saying - I don't Care about these People!  The setting didn't grab me.  I didn't feel the 'feel' of the racetrack, the feel of the saddle under my seat, the smell of leather, the rumble of distant hoofbeats.  Even the environment of the working class/hired people didn't provide a compelling 'atmosphere' for the story.  I did like that the horses and animals were given page time.  The animals were more enjoyable than the people.  I'm sure its just me.  Maybe if I wait a year then I'll pick up the book in the right mood to have it take hold of me.  But for now, I can't read it, and I'm passing my thoughts along in case there is any body else out there like me 
 Get this set if you plan on having a bad time.  Barely will you be in to 'Good evening' when the lessons quickly turn to "Stop thief!" or "He stole my watch"  or better yet, "I want an attorney"  -- all of which are phrases I have NEVER used in France.  Fodor's should have had the good sense to give practical lessons first,  etiquette, directions, service, culture etc. before launching into rude commands and pick-pocket paranoia 
 Never have I read a bigger load of prententious, meaningless nonsense, for want of a stronger word! I cannot believe somebody actually got paid for having produced these words thrown together between brand names, which for a non American mean little. Dreadful 
 I got this album because Obie Trice did some great stuff on the 8 Mile soundtrack, so I figured I'd check out what else he'd done.  This album just doesn't live up to that.   
 I refuse to believe that some apprentice intern ghost writer didn't really write this.  I will try to describe him or her.  Definitely a vegetarian - possibly a member of PETA.  Dry writing style (well, Crighton is dry even when he's excellent).  It bothers me how many unrealistic characters Crichton uses - it seems every character in some of these books earned a PhD from MIT by 16, was an alternate on the olympic swim team, a top researcher, an accomplished pilot, beautiful or handsome, and wealthy.  These people do not exist in nature.  They also have an annoying habit of speaking in complete, complex sentences, quoting research in casual conversation.  But at least MC has a gift for crafting believable, plausible sci-fi - much like Isaac Asimov.  But this is so beneath him, I refuse to accept it 
 As all the other reviews are positive, I will add a much needed critical perspective.  The central argument of this book is that:  "The combination of Indian predation and environmental change decimated the bison" (Isenberg, p.3).  As such, this book contradicts massive amounts of primary historical sources that show, un-arguably, that the destruction and near extinction of the Bison herds was a direct result of Anglo predation in a direct attempt to destroy the resource base of the Plains Tribes in order to force them onto reservations.  As the other reviewers have pointed out, it is true that the Plains Tribes were not nomadic hunters for all of their history. It is true that the Tribes adopted nomadic hunting as a primary subsistence strategy only after being forced to do so by Anglo aggression and encroachment.  But from that truth, Isenberg moves on to a series of unproven theories based on questionable ecological assumptions that are rooted in the "new ecology" - an ecological theory that describes nature as a disordered, chaotic and individualistic struggle for survival (For info on the "new ecology" see my review of "Discordant Harmonies:  A new ecology for the 21st century).  For example, Isenberg bases one of his arguments on the un-proven theory that early Tribal Peoples, thousands of years ago, hunted to extinction many species of large land mammals.  But the story of the Bison is not a pre-historic story.  It is a story of modern history and Isenberg presents no historical proof that the Tribes were responsible for the near extinction of the Bison.  Rather, he makes subjective philosophical arguments against "romanticizing" wilderness and Native American cultures.  From there Iverson uses these arguments as a backdrop to a series of environmental statistical analyses.  Basically, Iverson lays out an exponential statistical model where by he argues that, given the estimated number of Bison deaths necessary to sustain the Plains Tribes, eventually the Bison would have been rendered extinct by the Tribes at some point in the future.  The problem is that this can never be proven because it never happened!  What happened, and it is documented in massive amounts of printed primary historical sources, was that the Bison were deliberately slaughtered by greedy Anglo hunters for their skins and tongues.    The United States Army was in on it as well, as is documented by many sources showing that the Bison herds were decimated in a deliberate attempt to make it impossible for the Tribes to remain living free on the Plains.  Isenberg's book is one that must be extremely comforting to those forces that continue to destroy what wild animals and lands we have left here in North America. 
 I enjoyed his other books much more, but that's probably because I have less patience than most. Too much running around in circles here for me 
 This is the book we are currently using for my post-pchem inorganic chemistry class, and I am not a fan of it.  It seems to be an easy read, and for the most part, it is, but the diagrams, examples, and problems at the back of the book are not good at all.  In my class, we get assigned the problems at the ends of the chapters, and while the first few are feasible and are similar to the examples shown in the book, after about the fifth problem, they become incredibly difficult.  Some of the problems I am not quite even sure how the authors expect an undergraduate to solve.  The diagrams so far have also been mediocre, especially in the chapter on molecular oribtals.  Some of the molecular orbital diagrams were not labeled and not to scale making the energy differences in molecular orbitals very deceiving.  This is not helpful when trying to understand the chapter.  I think the book would be great if it covered more examples and covered more difficult examples, but without those, it's nearly impossible to fully grasp the concepts of each chapter 
 Nothing innovative or exciting. Anyone who does not know this stuff should not be in business or in a leadership positio 
 Take the lamest Nine Inch Nails album and splice it with the best Linkin Park album,(or I guess any Linkin Park album will do since they all sound the same) and what do you have? Korn. Enough of these substanceless, mainstream, sell-out high school rock bands like Korn, Linkin Biscuit and Hootie Blew my Fish already! Bands like Razed in Black, Psychopomps, and Biopsy all make Korn look like N'Sync singing a Shania Twain song 
 Granted, it must be challenging to be a writer when one's father is Arthur Miller. This book was receiving raves and I was so surprised to discover it was basically downright bad! Unreadable, frankly. I forced my way through the stories. They were full of cliched and vague descriptions, bland dialogue, and too many oh-so-quirky characters. More than one story had flashbacks ( one story had two: A 4 years ago flashback within a  1 year ago flashback). More than one story had a character recounting her dreams. Boring!!!!  Save your money and your time. 
 What a waste. Sacco could reach a much wider audience if he had written essays. But, wait...does he have the talent to write essays? Being "cool & edgy" apparently has more meaning to him than making a legitimate difference in the world, in general, and in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, specifically. Additionally, he is both biased and sexist in his writing 
 Like some of the other reviewers, I ordered the Illuminator but was sent the Dynamo instead. I ordered the Illuminator because I had seen it in a store and know the quality. I am not at all satisfied with the substitution that I received! With the Illuminator you have the option of turning on one light or all three. When you push the button on the Dynamo it clicks like it should be turning on the light but it takes 3 "clicks" to get the light to turn on!! I have never had a problem like this when ordering through Amazon but would recommend looking elsewhere if you are specifically looking for the Illuminator, because that's not what you are going to receive 
 Frustration is how I sum up my experience with this product.  On the front cover, and with the directions on the back, there is a photo of a key that locks and unlocks the magnetic lock.  However, after opening the packaging, there was no key.  There were four locks, alright.  And, lots of little screws in case you felt like screwing the lock in, despite the product's claim to be the only child lock that doesn't require tools.  With how the packaging is designed, I don't even think there's room for the key.  Which makes me wonder...do you have to buy the key separately?  I'm returning this product and am bitterly disappointed for the wasted time and energy 
 At times our constitutional jurisprudence has fundamentally changed without a constitutional amendment.  Bruce Ackerman tries to expalin this.  He offers the theory of a constitutional moment that occurs when the public  makes it clear that it is time for a new constitutional way.  The problem  is that only Ackerman knows when that moment occurs. This arrogance does  violence to serious and meaningful constitutional interpretatio 
 I read a lot, and more than a few books by academics. But even though I was keenly interested in the subject of this book, and what Fenster would have to say about it, I found the reading so utterly dry and boring that I couldn't get even a third of the way through the book. I put it down and came back to it several times, trying to bring a freshness to it. But each time I was drugged to catatonia within a few pages. I gave up trying to read it straight through, and tried skimming and jumping around to get some key points. It didn't help. The author appears more intent on scholarly notes and quotes and references, than on making a clear and readable narrative. Unless you are an academic doing research, or a lay reader with an iron stomach for this kind of material, I would find another book 
 If you have Kids or Grandkids, who think about politics & like "SF"; give them this book!  It was One of the many Heinlein Works that helped ME grow up.  It is the BEST & MOST IMPORTANT of his "for KIDS novels".  I ment to give it 5 Stars!!!! 
 This book is a sensationalized report of the Iran-contra affairs.  Its author seeks to shock the reader of the government's misconduct.  There is very little historical, methodical, or academic virtue to this book.  It's for sheer shock and awe, which can easily be taken from serious book like Theodor Draper's A Very Thin Line 
 I love "This American Life". I love "The Incredibles". I hate Sarah Vowell. She is rude and mean, and I wonder what gives her the right to think she is so much better than all those mass-cultured, uneducated people she scorns so much. I'm a 20-something, college educated, art-loving female punk musician from New York City (have I impressed you yet, Sarah??), and I am certainly unimpressed by Sarah Vowell's ability to randomly name-drop and brag about the artists, musicians, and authors she likes. Her condescending tone and mundane analyses of life leave much to be desired. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who actually knows a thing about art, music, or life 
 This book wasn't what I expected. I was searching for a book about all types of intimacy - friendship, family and romance. But this just focused on romance. Also, the religious quoting and writing throughout the book made me uncomfortable. 
 This book was not what I was expecting.  I am quite fond of Dee and consider him to be a highly interesting individual.  However, I feel this book misses the mark.  The author knows a lot about Dee, but goes about it in the most haphazard way.  The writing style leaves much to be desired.  It is choppy and hard to follow.  The chapters range from just 2 pages to many.  If the book were edited properly, it would be worth your time 
 I am a huge fan of EFT and am always eager to learn more, but this book was a complete zero for me.  I haven't been this disappointed in a book from amazon.com in a long time.  The authors are more concerned with self-promotion than helping people, which gets in the way of their communication.  The content is vague, diffused, and very limited.  I would recommend instead Gary Craig's free manual, or Energy Tapping by Fred Gallo 
 Almost unbelievably bad, except I saw the remake of 'Shaft,' which should have been a forewarning.  This is like a comic book for filmgoers.  No, not a graphic novel adapted to the screen.  More like a comic book for kids, that you'd be embarassed to own at any age.  Doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack, a travesty to the nth degree.

 I never received the product I ordered and need a refund immediately 
 It's sad what has happened to some of the kids who were victims of no medical treatment when they need it. I'm christian so I pray when someone I knows sick so I'm not totally knocking that Christian Scientist belive in healing . The real problem is their view on Christ. Mabye they should read Christ's words in the Bible instead of letting they're interpritation governed by Marry Baker Eddy. Who stole the idea from Professor Quimbly then claimed to have a revelation. It truly upsets me how many lives her lies have ruined. 
 Only reason I am giving two stars is i bought this on the premise i was going to learn about making wine with grapes which is popular in the New York/Ontario area where i live. The author is more in love with wine from fruit. I have to admit it intriqued me, but, I think the title should be Making Fruit wine or something like it. Out side of that good book on basic wine making tips, I learned alot, just not about making wine from grapes.  This is more of a book for apple wine or berry wine, than for Merlot or Cabernet... 
 Benford is one of those writers who wax hot and cold.  He is acclaimed to be a science fiction writer's "scientist" in that he deals with a lot of "hard" science.  In this case, the result is pedantic and - the ultimate sin - boring.  The main character was not exciting nor interesting - just smart.  The great experiment and the result were so-so.  I kept waiting for something - ANYTHING - to happen but soon realized that this was it..a globe that was tested, studied and explored. I am reminded of the poem..."this is how the world ends - not with a bang but with a whimper.&quot 
 The carebears big wish movie was horrible.  THey never should have used CGI to make what use to be a wonderful show.  I'm scarred i'm scarred for life there is just no other explination for it.  They killed the carebears!  The carebears big wish move is on disney right now and it has gone CGI.  WTF they ruined it.  They really killed them there colors are all wrong( cheer bear isn't even pink and tenderheart isn't brown),the only facial expressions that they can do is open and close there eyes and mouths, Carealot looks like a barren wasteland instead of warm cuddles of clouds and joy,and the stars look like demon monsters.  I hate it.  What have they done!  Carebears are suppose to be cute and fluffy and cuddly and not look like emotionless statutes.   I hate CGI with cartoons i prefer animation.  sure live action special effects use cgi but leave my cartoons alone **crys**  WHAT HAVE THEY DONE 
 I actually went through three of these phones.  Each one that I had would just turn off in the middle of a call...not just drop the call I mean the phone shuts off! Then I would try and start it again, no go! So I had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it. Half of the time it would start and say invalid battery and I would start the entire process over again. I complained so much to Tmobile that they exchanged it for a Motorola V360 which has all the same features, except BETTER reception and an MP3 player.  I wouldnt reccommend this phone to anyone....  p.s. My husband has the silver one and the same thing happend to his 
 I have lived in El Salvador now for over eight years.  To visit El Salvador for three days and continue to make a profit on those three days -past- seems completely immoral to me, especially since the book remains in print and continues to influence the world's opinion of El Salvador.  I find this completely unfair.  Would it be possible for Joan or Oliver or anyone else that enjoyed an income from the events of 20+ years ago to come back and revise their assesment?  It would probably cost them all of two or three thousand dollars for the trip, but of course, it would stop the thousand if not million dollars in sales of these recollections which were wish fullfilling fantasies to begin with.  All of El Salvador suffered during this time, why perpetuate the suffering?  And what about any three days in any given city in North America?  Could'nt the "glass is half empty" scenario be drawn to horrify any sensible person from every wanting to visit there, simply by selectively clipping the daily paper?  I think so. 
 I bought this product for my aunty. I tried it immediately after I received it. When I tried to plug in the battery, the wire connected to the battery cap just came off. I also tried to put on the mask, I didn't feel comfortable with those nail heads pushing against my face. Honestly I don't know whether this product works to make you look younger, but the design looks really unprofessional and like those cheap toys you can get from any pitch for 10 bucks 
 It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing.  It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends?  I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something.  
 Hello to all those who have read this book.  After reading your reviews abour this book i felt i must say something.  WHy are you so set against God and Christianity?  One of you said this book was what made him rejest Christianity.  Christianity is not some weird religion,  it is the faith that Jesus Christ died for all humans, who He loves so much.  Where are you going after you die?  Christ is waiting for you to call to Him and ask for eternal life.  The Bible isnt some whack job scribbling stuff down, it is God inspired.  There are more manuscripts and texts to prove the Bible is real and written by those who claimed to write it.  there are more manuscripts than that of Homer's The Odyssey, yet we regard that as true.  So the Gospels werent written right after the disciples were with Jesus, but they were written at a time when those people could still remember their times with Christ.  I am going to wrap it up now, but if you want to hear the real TRUTH, read God's Word.  If you don't believe that, there are so many books that so the incredible evidence for the Bible.  The Age of Reason was written by a man who hated Christianity.  PLease do not just accept his writing without looking at the BIble.  Jesus Christ loves you, and he longs for you to accept Him so He can change your life and give you the awesome gift of eternal life with Him.  Thank you 
 I received this a few days ago and was disappointed in the quality. Today I saw a donut kit for 5.99 at AJ Wright. It had this same pan of equal quality, a filled donut pan, a mini donut pan and a filling injector. Yep, I bought it too. I'll keep this pan only because of shipping and restocking fees 
 I was dismayed to find that this audio book is simply a laundry listing (in an "advice o'the day" format) of tidbits of wisdom. The wisdom offered is good, mind you, but if you are looking for something to stimulate and entertain you (eg on a long car ride) you will likely be disappointed. I can only listen to about 4 or 5 tidbits before I lose interest 
 See the title. If you've read this book, you'll know what I'm talking about. This is mostly an embellished tale of Jolly Jack's life 
 The publisher must have thought that anything Puzo wrote was gold as this  appeared a few years ago and rightfully disappeared.  The main characters, Francis Xavier Kennedy, his friends and staff are completely unconvincing and cardboard cutouts. The assassination of his daughter holds no suspense or regret as she is a cardboard character like the rest of them.  Needless characters and unnecessary plot lines appear to confuse the reader. Remember that 1/3 of "The Godfather" was junk about  Jules the doctor and his love affair with Sonny Corleone's lover. The movie thankfully cut out the waste and was the better without it. "The Fourth K" is all fat and no meat. They are re-releasing it to coincide with  "The Godfather Returns" and terrorists assaults on US soil.  Avoid  this book!  
 Although informative, the author needs almost 400 pages to say what could have easily been said in well under 100 
 if you want the evil truth about Dr K and how he undermined the 1968 peace talks, read "No Peace, No Honor: Nixon, Kissinger, and Betrayal in Vietnam" by Larry Berman.  This book explains how Nixon and Kissinger illegally colluded with SVN and Nguyen Van Thieu - he was told by Nixon via Anna Chenault to "hold on, we are going to win" and "you will get a better deal with us". So Thieu says he won't talk peace, Nixon wins, Kissinger openly changes sides after working with the Democrats, and together they crank up the war.  The point is: The War could have ended in 1968 if it were not for this man - Dr Death himself, Henry Adolf Kissinger 
 Yet another tiresome volume devoted to post-everything pseudo-disciplines. Poster has almost nothing original to say, but that doesn't stop him. Read on, if you must, to be regailed yet again with clueless francophile jargon  about our postmodern, post-colonial, post-structurlist, post-disciplinary  society and you just may go postal 
 I was excited about this cd...then I started listening to it. If I wanted Beastie Boys I would have bought Beastie Boys. Its nothing but lame 80's rap loops and a few butt rock tracks. Nothing like the Bloodhound gang of old. What happened to the techno/pop? What happened to somewhat punk? The only good song on the cd is Kids incorporated. I would consider this their joke cd since about half of the tracks are garbage and only 40 seconds long. One word...lame 
 Does anyone know if there is a real PG-13 version of this film?  I've been told it came out as a PG-13 and then was changed to an R film.  Pretty strange way to deal with a science fiction film that kids would want to see.. 
 This book tries to be a personal memoir, a self-help guide, and perhaps an academic treatise on the psychology of mother-loss (though the author does not appear to be qualified, relying instead on others). It fails on all fronts. If you want to read personal accounts of women's experiences of mother-loss, Hope Edelman's books are better-edited. 
 This novel deserves 5 stars.  I was given 44 Scotland Street as a Christmas gift. I assumed it was a "detective story" given the author's previous well known work. I was very pleasantly surprised to find the book was like nothing else I have ever read.  I have lived in Scotland and have visited Jenner's department store in Edninburgh, as well as some of the other landmarks mentioned in the book. I can assure readers who have not been to Edinburgh that the descriptions and the characterizations are very real, for example, the rivalry between Edinburgh and Glasgow.  Although it may be difficult for non-Scots to fully appreciate certain elements of the book, the characters can be found practically anywhere and in any time. For example, the narcissistic Bruce and the class-conscious Sasha. I would highly recommend this book to anyone and especially homesick Scots.  I can hardly wait for the sequel 
 The author here has an agenda and it is not to tell the truth about the CIA or the politics surrounding it.  This book is very poorly done.  There are many other books far superior 
 Image, a book about a famous artist, will all kinds of information, but ZERO pictures of either him or his paintings. Other Pollock books are better.  If you must have every book about this artist, ok, get it, but put it at the bottom of your wish list 
 had to switch bands , standard band had patent leather look to it. scratched from day one. i can't understand why a $150 sport watch would not come with a mineral crystal face . i've had $50 nike watches that were scratch proof. after changing the band the watch is pretty functional and cool looking, but still can not replace the convenience or functionality of a mounted computer for biking 
 A randy and bibulous middle-aged author with writer's block who lived in Greenwich Village had a glorious inspiration: to write a novel about a randy and bibulous middle-aged author with writer's block who lives in Greenwich Village. (Excited yet?) Then, because he's such a swashbuckling modernist, he buried this threadbare conception under the thickest compost of stale literary in-jokes and mincingly precious archaisms that you've ever mucked through. The result is like being cornered at a cocktail party by a garrulous drunk with artistic pretentions who simply will not shut up, no matter how disinterested you act 
 This was the first Hard Case publication book that I have tried.  It won't be the last, but I was hardly impressed with King's story.    I don't so much mind having a story with no ending (I got the point even without the author's afterword that was obviously meant to propitiate his regular readers who he correctly feared would be disappointed by this latest work), but couldn't King have given more of a mystery?  That is, after all, what is expected of a crime-mystery book.  I can't believe that I was asking too much.  Instead, I was treated to 178 pages of "Welcome to Maine!"   
 I agree w/ T. Morrey's review "Worst publishing I have ever seen, February 7, 2005".  I haven't even read the book yet, so this isn't a review of the content but rather the quality of the "publication" itself.  The book I received -- and paid $20 for -- appears to be a crude copy of an original publication, so far as I can tell.  I very much doubt that the copy I received is true a HarperCollins publication.  Looks more like a photocopy.  I'll be trying to get my money back for this one 
 When I got this product out of the box (I hadn't seen one in a store before), I was surprised by how lightweight and cheaply made it appeared, particularly at the price they charged (about $80 at the time).  The box I received was also missing the insert for the iPod nano, and the nano won't sit securely in the iPod socket without it.  I returned this product, and for about the same price, I got a much more solid--and better sounding--boom box with an auxiliary input jack that allows me to play songs from my nano (though admittedly without the remote that allows you to scroll through your iPod songs).  This wouldn't be a bad iPod speaker set if you could get it for $20, but at $80 it's dramatically overpriced 
 They should stop milking it with crappy film franchises like the texas chainsaw massacre. This series should have been killed off by now. The first was not even worth watching! Stay away from this whole movie series 
 The movie is one of my favorites, works on both a romantic level, and a comic level.  But where's the widescreen?  Todays consumers are more educated (THANK GOD) and they've almost stopped asking the stupid question "Why watch widescreen, you lose the top and bottom of the movie?!"  They finally get that you are seeing MORE of the movie with widescreen and not less.  So how can I be expected to buy this DvD?  It is for all intents and purposes "Incomplete".  Who's going to pay for all of something and be satisfied with only getting some of it?  Buy this movie as soon as WS version becomes availible 
 ...but it seems like Grant himself, whom I respect, didn't know how to wrap things up. This TPB is the MOST disgusting one , considering splatter put in the story, and, sometimes plain boring. End is unclear, and reminds me of what Arthur Clarke said once : 'I don't explain anything'. Puzzling ending for my fave characters, could it have been better? 
 I didn't make it very far through this one - cynical in its tone and rather ignorant in it's portrayal of the characters in Mexico.  If you want to learn about latin american consciousness or life, pick up a book by a respected latin author, not this joker.  I found it disturbing, but not because of some profound events in the storyline, but rather because of the mental condition of the author, whom I found rather perverse. 
 Three things make me better than Sean Hannity: 1) I was actually in the US Military 2) I graduated college, unlike Sean 3) I don't believe that everybody who votes a certain way is a loser, or hates America. Sean Hannity is a bunch of hot air. Just watch him on FoxNews, or listen to him for one hour. He is yet another of the current line of conservative commentators who believes that all people who vote Democrat hate their country and hate all Republicans. Sean - stop labeling everybody. Every American has their own opinion 
 Not sure what to make of the movie but it is definitely not one of the best movies and not sure if it is even a movie 
 I really wanted THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES because I thought that the story of the Mothman would be fascinating reading, a really intriguing narrative of the sightings of the tall, grayish man with wings and red eyes who could take off in flight straight up off the ground, an interesting examination of the myth and the legend. There is something to me very frightening about this type of legend, and I was eager to read the exploration of sightings around Point Pleasant, Va., in 1966 and 1967 before the Silver Bridge collapsed and nearly 40 area residents died in the tragedy. What a great tale could be told, I thought...  I am still waiting. This book is not well structured or told. It seems to be the dumping ground of every otherwordly event Keel has ever seen or heard of. There is little narrative arc here or suspense. Keel has the mistaken notion that loading the book with every bizarre occurence he's ever been told or witnessed gives him credibility, but it is actually the opposite. He and his "colleagues" saw so many UFOs and strange lights in the sky in West Virginia (and other places across the country) in the late 1960s, that one simply cannot believe that there isn't more corroboration of these sightings.   Keel does say that he doesn't believe in beings from other planets, but rather beings from a dimension outside of our own who like to make trouble for us, find things out about us, and sometimes warn us of things that are going to happen. Because of their inexperience with earth time, they often use out of date slang and drive old cars that are in mint condition and still smell new. For some unexplained reason, the "people" from this other dimension seem always to wear thick-soled shoes.   Keel as a true believer is a poor writer of a convincing book, as he often justifies a witnesses credibility by saying that they are respectable people, or some such qualifier. He anticipates, then, no need the reader might have to be convinced that thousands of sightings of UFOs and Mothman may need some evidentiary backup. This lack of the writer's disbelief and proof, the lack of any plot or arc and the muddled content of the book make this work a solid disappointment. Someone needs to let me know if the book that can be written about this ever is written 
 I look for Linda Howards books as soon as they come out but was dissapointed with this one.  An unbelievable plot can be entertaining but this story was to much.    
 this vaccuum bottle is horrible!  perhaps i got an irregular one, but it keeps my water hot for only about 2 hours.  
 Every book by Jodi Picoult grabs you by the heart and doesn't let go. Mercy stands out from all the rest. You will not forget this book or the people in it for a long time 
 Unfortunately, many so-called "rock journalists" are nothing more than sociology majors who let their devotion to an artists or group cloud their vision of unbiased criticism.  In this case, we get a bit of that from the contributing writers as well as a bias toward progressive "rock," which is in most cases nothing more than classical music composer wannabees who don't want to miss out on the fabled rock lifestyle.  Perhaps "Understanding Irrevalent Prog Rock" would have been a better title. And why would anyone analyze a four-minute song in 20 pages?  Does any true rock song need more than a couple of paragraphs?  This ain't Mahler, y'know 
 I gagged my way through The Notebook but thought I would give Nicholas Sparks another try.  I read about 1/3 of the book and decided it was a waste of my time.  
 The novel, A Northern Light, by Jennifer Donnelly, is a very realistic portrayal of the life of a teenage farm girl, bound for a great future.  Jennifer Donnelly relates to Mattie Gokey, the lead character, in a way that they bother grew up in rural side of New York.  Donnelly attended the University of Rochester before she wrote her three novels and one children's book. Her novels include, The Tea Rose, The Winter Rose, A Northern Light, and a children's book, Humble Pie. All of her novels include a very popular romantic theme and her book, A Northern Light, has also been introduced in Europe under the title A Gathering Light. 	A Northern Light reflects a lot on the issues of wealth, education, love, and murder.  The combination of those themes makes for a novel that anyone is able to read and relate to.  As you read this book, you feel like the main message is the traditional clich√© of following your dreams no matter how hard they are to achieve. But as you read further, you realize that it's a lot about hardships, strength and love.  On the first page of the book, Mattie is imagining a perfect day at the Glenmore hotel before she so disappointingly tells herself, "I believe these things. With all my heart.  For I am good at telling myself lies".  From this quote, you can see the type of person Mattie is, and it gives a foreshadowing to the events that would take place throughout the novel.  The events typically consist of let down after let down for Mattie and her hopes for her future.    	This book is written from Mattie's point of view which really helps the reader to get to know her better.  It adds a different element to the book that wouldn't be there if it wasn't written from Mattie's point of view.  It lets you get inside Mattie's head and feel the emotions that she's dealing with along with her true thoughts and feeling towards situations.  Mattie is truly troubled girl who works so hard toward what she wants and yet there is always something holding her back. She's stuck in a farming town where education isn't as important as having a prosperous farm and a family. As you read this book, you just want to tell Mattie that she needs to take her own future into consideration and stop worrying long enough to have some faith.  She is a selfless giver who is willing to do anything and everything to keep her family and her farm doing well.  She deals with extreme guilt for wanting to leave her father after her mother died.  She has to learn that the promise that she made to her mother to always take care of her family includes taking care of herself as well.  Royal Loomis enters Mattie's life at a very unconventional time when Mattie's unsure of what she wants to become and she has to chose between his love and the life she's always wanted.  Mattie deals with her teacher, Miss Wilcox, leaving town.  Miss Wilcox was Mattie's role model who was living the life of an independent poet with a car and a royal lifestyle.  The life Mattie wants.     	This book is intended for a female audience because it deals with issues that sometime only a girl could understand.  It's a fairly easy read so it is more for adolescents than adults but not for young children.  The issues that it deals with are issues that children may not be able to appreciate as much as teenagers who are about to go to college and leave their families.  A Northern Light is full of valuable lessons, but most of all it's just a good book to get lost in.   		  
 The author is probably a great guy personally, but his writing falls very short. The book does not even address Paul's views on the role of women, or on homosexuality--two areas where people of our times need guidance. It seems as if the author wanted to be "politically correct" and not offend anyone.  He doesn't even address, with any authority, the conflict between Paul and Barnabas over John Mark. He just basically says they should have worked it out. I was completely disappointed in the book. 
 I often wonder if some if not most of the people writing rave reviews, 5 stars, are really paid, biased, professionals pumping up the movie for increased DVD sales.  
 I should preface this reveiw with the fact that I am an accomplished home cook.  I have been cooking for 25 years and own more than 500 cookbooks.  I do not buy commercially prepared products like breads, crackers, mayonnaise or salad dressings.  I make these items myself.  I suspect that I am not the target audience for this publication.  The May/June 2006 issue is 32 pages in length in total.  Given that there are only 6 issues a year, I was expecting a little more than a mere 32 pages.  The May/June 2006 issue contains the following information:  Simplifying Moroccan Chicken Bringing Home Fish and Chips Grilled Tomato Salsa Grilled London Broil Main-dish Vegetable Stir-fries How to cook pasta Foolproof Veal Scaloppini A new Twist on Chicken Salads Garlic and Olive Oil Mashed Potatoes Utimate Turtle Brownies Best Strawberry Cream Cake The Scoop on Vanilla Ice Cream A review of tongs  If you are an experienced cook their isn't much about cooking in this issue that will be new to you.  This issue contained not a single piece of new information for me about cooking.  However, I enjoyed the equipment reveiws and did find them informative and useful.  This magazine would be helpful if someone is an inexperienced cook.  Bottom line, I will not be renewing my subscription unless future issues have a little "more meat" in their content.  I think that this magazine is overpriced for what you receive.  I would suggest saving the price of the subscription and buy their "Best of" cookbook instead.  It costs about the same amount, contains many more recipes, has many of their equipment reviews and is bound in a hard cover so that it will hold up longer.  Additionally, check out an issue of "Fine Cooking" which is another test kitchen type of publication, just with more depth.  
 Martin believes we are on a non-sustainable course - the population is too large, enormous new consumer societies are growing, and technology is becoming powerful enough to wreck the planet.  The 21st century is becoming an age of extremes - wealth and poverty, terrorists acting in the name of religion, experiments that scientists want to perform, etc.  During this century we will either right the world's course, or commit it to increasing negative feedback loops.  Every year we lose 24 billion tons of topsoil and create 15 million acres of new desert.  We are using about 160 billion tons moe water than is being replenished by rain.  Global warming will bring more severe weather and lower crop yields in many of the world's poorest countries.  Meanwhile, in the U.S., the desire for short-term  benefits by government and business overwhelms the desire to solve long-term problems.  Negative Feedback Loops:  Artic ice helps reflect sunlight; however, its melting leads to more absorption of sunlight and greater heating.  At the same time much permafrost contains methane, a powerful worming gas - its melting also creates increased heat absorption.  The oceans help by absorbing CO2, but there is a limit, and the warmer they get, they less they can hold.  We have depleted the Grand Banks fishery to the point it is now closed.  The Black Sea has deteriorated to near uselessness for fishing or as a resort because of pollution and the invasion of an American jellyfish.  (The "good news" is that governments have recognized the problems - hopefully the areas will recover.)  The world is running out of natural capital.  Yet, we spend about $2 trillion/year in perverse subsidies worldwide - agriculture (both to grow, and not-grow), gasoline.  As for overpopulation (the basis of all problems), one strategy is offered by the high correlation between female illiteracy and the fertility rate.  Birth control methods also help, as do jobs for women, and interesting/challenging jobs help even help more.  Over one billion people spend about 70% of their income on food, and the growing water shortage threatens to increase this.  Saudi Arabia increased wheat production 20X from '80 to '94; when the aquifer nearly dried up production fell by half within two years.  Over 12% of crop land in India has been damaged by salination.  Changing crops would help - eg. wheat typically produces 50% more calories/water unit than rice, and meat uses water very intensively.  (Japanese men eat about one-quarter the meat of Americans, smoke more, and live about 8 years longer.)  Improved cultivation using genetically modified seeds would also help - about 40% of crops are lost in the fields to disease, insects, and weeds, though Martin also states that increased crop uniformity also increases long-run vulnerability.  Hydroponics and fish farming offer other good improvements in water usage.  The U.N. lists 49 Least Developed Countries - they have 11% of the world's population and 0.5% of its GDP.  Martin sees hope here though through the lens of DeSoto's observation about titles.  He has found that a majority of homes in 3rd-world and ex-Communist countries are held without title, meaning they can't be used for business collateral.  Yet, DeSoto believes that the savings accumulated in these same countries is 40X the foreign aid received since '45.  In Lima, a demonstration on obtaining authorization to build a house on state-owned land took 6 years and 11 months - even longer to acquire title to the land.  All told, 207 steps in 52 government offices for the first part, and another 728 steps for the latter.  Setting up a one-man cake shop in Cairo and making it legal requires 500+ days.  In other areas (eg. Rwanda) the rule of law has completely broken down.  Martin also notes that in 1960 South Korea and Ghana had nearly identical economic conditions - since, South Korea has bloomed, while Ghana's GDP/person has fallen in half.  Another promising development for the future identified by Martin lies in pebble-bed reactors to generate electricity - impossible to explode, and highly efficient.  At this point, "The Meaning of the 21st Century" goes downhill fast.  The book is basically a collection of other people's work and the first part does provide a useful summary of their findings.  However, the latter pages offer little of use 
 after reading glowing reviews of the DBTs I picked up three of their cds. While some of the lyrics are strong, the songs have no melodies whatsoever. Most of the arrangements consist of guitars blaring over a terrible singer. They're reputed to be carrying on the tradition of Skynyrd and the Allmans. But those bands weren't just loud guitars...they had memorable tunes and great singers. DBTs are a huge letdown 
 I bought this for my 3 year old son. He was not intersted in all the talking by "Laurie Dash". Too many jokes that aren't funny or related to the hero and not enough action to keep a young child interested. The "There goes a...firefighter/hero/police officer...series is much better. There is a host but also lots of action to keep a young childs attention 
 Information you already know, mixed with the same retro style as a dozen other books you can buy more cheaply. YAWN 
 I came across this book when advising a friend's college-age child who was researching careers and was using this book.  On the plus side, the book does contain info on basic job search skills.  I would say that most (if not all of it) is now widely available via the internet.  Very troubling was the inaccurate guidance regarding specific careers - some of it was just outdated, but some of it was inaccurate to the point of being "dangerous" for a reader with little knowledge or experience, and who would choose to spend time/effort pursuing a career based on the info in this book.  I would have to recommend against using this book as a key source for making a career choice 
 I bought this CD.  I listened to this CD.  And then I listened again, and again...ad nauseum.  I get jazz.  I love jazz.  I "get" spiritual jazz.  This music is a load of crap.  It is boring, goes nowhere, and I fail to see why, when so much brilliantly done spiritual oriented jazz has been created, one would rather kneel at the alter of such mediocrity.  That Coltrane may have advanced the modal boundaries of jazz/sax does not a great (or even good, evidently) album make.  Trance-inducing offerings by Szabo, Tjader, Byrd, Hubbard, Hancock, Hutcherson, Horn and many others actually DO achieve the accolades unrightfully heaped upon this monotonous drone of a squak, so forego the lip service paid this and pursue those players for genuinely moving soul food if you, too, are able to listen to the MUSIC with your ears, instead of the hype.            
 This was truly a let down. I know after so many years it's hard to keep a strip fresh. But Jim Davis shouldn't let Garfield get so watered down. I've loved Garfield since I was a kid, and own all the books (Number 14 being my favorite), and all the other books Davis has released. I could pick up this book, and go through it without finding a joke that was new, or funny, which of course is a huge let down. Garfield is not Snoopy, where Charles Schultz made the Peanuts Gang interesting and funny as long as he wrote it. After reading this, you get the feeling that Jim Davis was out of new material 10 years ago, and he's just trying to milk the series for all it's worth. Cats don't usually live well into their 30's, so I believe it's time for Davis to start thinking of how to let Garfield ride into the sunset with a scred of dignity left. If you must purchase this book, stop in your local bookstore and leaf through it, to see if you still like it. I love Garfield as much as the next person, but not this way 
 This book should be titled "Perversity, Gossip, and Women's Issues in the Late Medieval Period."  It has nothing to do to with covert operations.  Perhaps it is the only way the author could sell the book.  Imagine spending $50 and expecting a serious discourse on medieval espionage, sabotage, spies, and assassins and receiving instead some feminist diatribe about gossip, sodomy, and other perversions.  Unbelievable waste 
 One of the things I like about the McGee series is the strange authority MacDonald brings to it.  He had a very strict, intelligent mind and a disdain for shoddy work that rivaled Hemingway's, which often gave his descriptions and depictions a shrewd authority.  Even when you may not fully buy what's going on on the page, you can buy that the author and the characters believe it, which is often enough to go on.  But with "Free Fall in Crimson," the authority is a little flimsy.  The book, published in the early 80s, is the first McGee that just does not convince on several key levels.    Most of that has to do with McGee's brief dip into California outlaw biker culture in his attempts to track down a murderous Hell's Angel named Dirty Bob.  Nothing about the scenario -- not the crime McGee investigates, not the people he meets along the way, not the stilted dialogue he engages in, not the situations he encounters -- feels convincing.    A millionaire goes to buy a little hash and takes gold Krugerrands to purchase the drugs? McGee is made an honorary member of a bike tribe ("The Fantasies") and given a special pin to use... if he ever needs it?  A character on the run who needs to hide his identity suddenly gets a terminal illness that allows him to drop 100 pounds in two months?    The second half of the book -- McGee's visit to a debauched, coked-out 80s-era film set, where a Dennis Hopper-esque auteur is having a big budget meltdown as he tries to make an existential thriller (about balloon pilots?) -- is a little more convincing than the biker stuff, but the dialogue still smells too much like exposition, the film crew's lines sound transposed from research.  I did enjoy the nightmarish riot that begins the last act; and I liked the creepy section in which McGee slowly, gradually figures out that his prey has turned around and is coming after him; and, oddly, I was completely convinced that McGee could survive a leap from a runaway balloon hovering 50 feet off the ground (just remember: land on the balls of your feet, tuck your chin, roll forward with your right shoulder out and down, hit the ground running....)   But as far as the series as a whole goes, this is probably one of the weaker entires I've read.  But, should I ever fall or jump out of a hot air balloon, I seriously think I'll know what to do.  
 Don't buy it, I'll sum it up for you...give 10% of your earnings to God or in doing God's work and then watch the bucks roll in. 
 If you're a commissioned sales rep calling outbound biz to biz, this book is NOT for you. Nothing new or original here.  I suggest you read books by Art Sobczak, Bly or one of the best books ever written on the subject.  Telesales Tips From The Trenches by Joe Cata 
 This is not the first book as the editorial says. Paul Scott wrote on this subject years ago (His is an excellent book) 
 i can not get it to work. i have e-mailed and asked for help with no response. so i guess i will be returning it.  if i get it to work or the seller helps me i will amend this post.  as it stands though i give it 2 stars.  they did ship it quickly and it was packaged well 
 I gave the guy a chance.  I saw his stand up and some of his skits.  Recently, I saw him on that pompous show, "Inside the Actor's Studio."  They showed some of his "classic" bits.  Throughout it all, not one laugh shook my tummy.  The racist, sexual, and political material he makes fun of is more easily and hilariously skewered on MAD TV.  Just because a black man screams the "N" word a bunch of times, it does not make him a brilliant comedian.  The most annoying thing about Chappelle is his willingness to don the mantle of "suffering artist."  For a while, he was avoiding Comedy Central's offer to renew his contract by supposedly hiding out in a mental ward.  False modesty aside, he clearly enjoys his own hype.  Chappelle should change his name to Chapeux and sell hats 
 Please note the "ages 9-12" reading level information. I wasted $26 on this book. It's a children's book about typhoid, which seems about as bizarre as it comes. I think what really threw me off were the words "leather bound," which made me assume, along with the sophisticated description, that this was a medical-level text. It's not leather bound, by the way. Just a typical cardboard cover. 
 John Dean is older version of Joe Wilson.  Media hacks who will do or say anything if it will get them invited to the next Washington Post cocktail party.  It is just so hard to take this guy seriously.  He is not a serious thinker, his book is laced with presumptions and ethics projections to the point that it sounds like a conservative wrote it trying to make fun of a liberal 
 A few years ago I spent nearly a year travelling around Australia, and returned curious about some of the strange things I had seen there.  I  asked for this book for my birthday because of the good reviews it had  received on Amazon.com.  However, when I finally got it none of my biggest  questions were addressed.  Previously, most of my knowledge of these  subjects came from reading the little natural history bits in my Lonely  Planet Guide or by watching certain T.V. documentaries. I wanted a source  of information that went beyond these and revealed some of the underlying  explanations and science involved. I wanted to know the origins of some of  the famous landforms such as the Bungle Bungle or Ayer's Rock.  I'd also  wanted to know what shaped the dry interior.  I heard it was the bottom of  a sea at one time.  What the book does talk about in the geology section is  the split up of Gondwana in multi-paged depth, and gives no more special  attention to Australia than other continents.  None of my questions were  addressed, and the facts listed were not interesting to me.  In the section  on animals the author gave no real overview on their origins, and just  listed a number of the most popular species and gave a little  characterization of each.  In many parts of the book I found that my  tourist's range of knowledge actually included some things the author  didn't mention, such as how aboriginal burning shaped the ecology.   Also,  it often seemed that the author did not thoroughly know his subject matter,  but was just quoting from one of his sources. Eventually I began to loose  confidence that this book was written by an expert on the natural history  of Australia and more by a publication-hopeful writer (this is my opinion  based on his bio)who compiled an incomplete list of facts from numerous  sources, some of which were pertinent, others more randomly picked. The  book read like one giant research paper where the student sits down with a  stack of books on his subject and quotes pieces verbatim from all of them.   It also reads like an almanac.  That said, this book does list a thousand  things previously unknown to me, just not exactly the things I was after 
 war books are not my favorite, but even so this book sucked. i will admit when i am wrong about a book but i was not wrong about this 1. from the moment my prof. assigned it, i knew it would be like pulling teeth to finish and it was! this is notttttttttttttttttttttt a classic or anything close to 1. spend ur ten dollars on a pillow cause you are going to need it 
 Can we say, "money making ploy?"  WoW.  I, like many others, have grown up with Disney.  Perhaps I simply do not understand why kids of any age would listen to this garbage as opposed to the actual movie songs?  This is not like "Kidz Bop" or anything related to that which "kidifies" music - these are timeless movie classics that did NOT need to be redone - and as a further insult, they are poorly redone.  I am very, very let down by these "Disneymania" albums. :o( 
 The foil is abrasive and can cause razor bumps. Also the shave is not close and will missed areas around my rear jaw line that my Remington gets fairly easily. Overrated and overpriced eurotrash. 
 This was the first book by Danielle Steele that I have read and it will be the last I read by her. I was truly disappointed and believe she is a highly over-rated author. The story was VERY drawn out and I caught myself dozing off a few times because the book was so boring. If you want to fall asleep quick then this is the book for yo 
 This doesn't include Rude Mood in either studio or live version, Travis Walk, Riviera Paradise, or any of his other unbelievable instrumental guitar workouts.  This compilation is a serious waste of money.  Virtually any album he put out would be better by itself than this compilation, especially Texas Flood or In Step.  Better yet by far, though, would be to get "The Essential Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble."  It's bargain priced, and contains every song you could want or expect, including the excellent, posthumously-released acoustic blues song, "Life By The Drop."  SRV is a guitarist worth discovering, but this compilation won't show you anything 
 I have used this commentary in my personal study of the book of Acts. Though Bruce is a good scholar, he does not do a good job here. He avoids the crucial issues that automatically sufaces when one reads the text.  Often he just restates what the text has already said. I suppose this shows  the difficulty of writing a commentary on a historical book, compared to a  "teaching" book.  Put your money on Marshalls Tyndale commentary  instead. He has a remarkable ability to forecast which questions the reader  will have 
 Although it looks the same as the HG Wells story and the 1960 movie, this bastardization of the source material turns a frightening story about man's nature into a mildly fun sci-fi outing. Alexander's motivation for building the Time Machine is entirely different, and what he learns 80,000 years in the future could have been deduced by a more probing scientific mind (that is, if it was used to dealing with less than scientific cinematic time-travel paradoxes).  So the first half of the movie wreaks havoc on the source material and pales in comparison with the fabulous creativity of the George Pal version. We don't even find out anything about what we are about to see!  But things get worse is in the distant future. Although the writing tries to dance around the fact -- they have de-fanged the harsh reality of the Eloi and softened the horriffic underpinnings of their naivete. Instead of unknowing sheep, they are new-agey world-culture pluralists. The dichotomization of the human race really makes little sense. And there is no Rod Taylor running about castigating the apathy of his hosts.  The only reason why I give the film two stars is because it is one of the only genuine sci-fi films in years, and I found some of the special FX (the moon) and Jeremy Irons, cheesy as they may have been, fun 
 this book was crazy and disturbing.  when frightful has to leave, alice and sam go out and find a goshawk because they can't have a falcon.  it was really horrible because the parents of the goshawks were all mad and stuff.  i hate how frightful is trained to do all that stuff and how she wants to obey sam and stuff.  frightful's mountain was a really bad book.  don't read it if you are really in to the animals staying in their natural habitat thing.  
 could have been a truly interesting film, just plain simpleminded and annoying 
 Someday someone will write a real expose of women's magazines and how they kowtow to advertisers. But that person isn't Myrna Blyth.  Women's magazines, with but one exception, are loaded with articles on painful and/or expensive fashion and makeup. But that's due to advertisers, who use insecurity to sell everything from cosmetic surgery to lipstick. You see the same preying on insecurity with men although it takes a different form (e.g., buy this car or drink this beer or the babes won't love you). So why is this liberalism's fault? In fact, remember that one exception? That's ad-free Ms. magazine. Now that's a magazine that really is liberal. So much so, that it's off Ms. Blyth's radar screen.  Ms. Blyth is far enough to the right that centrist magazines seem liberal. If women's magazines really were liberal, we'd be reading about single-payer health care, fully funding special education and ending homelessness in Elle, Jane and Ms. Blyth's own Ladies Home Journal. Instead, you read about $1,500 blouses in Vogue, $400 dresses in Elle and clothes that would cost my daughter a year's allowance in Seventeen. Is that due to liberal bias? If it were, Ann Coulter wouldn't be a walking advertisement for couture.  When you examine Ms. Blyth's evidence, it just doesn't hold up. Once again, it's the Fox News view of the world, where the center is seen as bolshevism and liberals are blamed for anything someone sees as undesirable. I can't wait to read the tome on how liberals are causing all these hurricanes 
 this books chapter titles were random as hell and so was the book. its so weird.  there is no plot whatsoever. i hated it, don't buy it cuz it sucks major balls 
 I know you shouldn't submit a review until you finish a book, but I read about a quarter and got fustrated with plot line development.  I decided it would be best to put this book down for awhile and read a couple other books that I'm interested in... maybe I'll pick this one up again, but I wish that I would have checked it out from the library instead.  I really liked the first trilogy, but the characters and environment that appealed to me were eventually killed and destroyed, so I've struggled to find things that I like about the other books.  Additionally, I'm not really fond of the main character in this particular book 
 This book was great.  I especialy liked the chapter where Bill sticks a falafel in his co-worker's hoo-hah.  Priceless 
 What a load of garbage.  Equating a camera with a gun and the act of photography with a violent crime, is so ridiculous it does not even deserve to be discussed.  She has no idea waht she is talking about 
 A terrible product. Extremely difficult to use. Way too easy to accidentally change the combination, and when that happens, it's useless. The only reason it gets one star is that the rating system does not allow a zero or a negaive number. Don't waste your money on this product 
 Having enjoyed LOST IN TRANSLATION, I thought I might like this one, which seems to have some sort of cult reputation-- why I can't fathom. The entire plot is self-serving, shallow, and unrealistic. I guess it's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values, and while I don't condone those, the film lacks clear characters or any motivation. A lot of people have buttoned up parents who don't get it, and it doesn't mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded!?  Since the writer-director gerw up in Hollywood, she may not be aware that you can't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason-- social workers and what not come after you. So the entire premise is false.  Romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it-- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers-- could actually encourage the act. It's not caring, not real, and not responsible.  But I guess that wouldn't bother the rich, overfunded daughter of a Hollywood genius out to make a name for herself. 
 I first read A WALKER IN THE CITY as an adolescent, and the book impressed me, in that mysterious way that things that we know "should" impress us can do.  I re-read WALKER as an adult and, by modern standards, I think that it is overrated.  It is long and rambling and self-indulgent.  By rights, A WALKER IN THE CITY should have resonated for me, since my own father had grown up in Brownsville, exactly the same neighborhood that author Alfred Kazin describes, and at virtually the same time.  Yet I found little about Brownsville in this dreary memoir; it simply explores the rather maudlin sentiments of the young Kazin. Swifty Lazar, the late literary agent who was renowned for representing men of letters, as opposed to being a man of letters himself, had offered a far more compelling description of life in that same Brownsville in his own memoir.  No, WALKER only is about Kazin and his adolescent imagination, his theories about those who lived in places other than Brownsville (to wit, "the city") and about his personal (and intensely idiosynchratic, if not peculiar) yearnings.  There are points in which he uses Yiddish without offering a translation, and even a section in which he lapses into high-school French, again with no translation. His use of language often seems strained and self-conscious, such as using the word "plash" as--I think--a synonym for "splash."  Insofar as much of the book had been printed in contemporary magazines as essays, the format here has cobbled together several essays into a memoir. In consequence, this memoir could have used better editing, since things that are fully explained on their first mention do not need the identical explanations further into the book; such styling would be reasonable in a series of magazine pieces, but not in a volume offered as a cohesive work.  I cannot help wondering whether A WALKER IN THE CITY, first published in 1946, would be as enthusiastically received if it first saw print today. It strikes me as the literary equivalent of the Emperor's new clothes 
 Fukyama, Professor of Political Economy at Johns Hopkins, has managed to take three obvious conclusions that most Americans have already reached - absent PhDs or expensive tuition - and create 240 boring, useless pages.  These conclusions are:  1)The Bush administration wrong made preventive war the central tenet of its foreign policy.  2)It also badly misjudged global reaction.  3)The Bush administration's third error was failing to appreciate the difficulties involved in establishing a successful democratic government in Iraq.  The fact that Fukuyama was a neoconservative supporter does not change the triviality of the conclusions; it does, however, demonstrate that, unlike President Bush, he is open to accepting contrary information.  A total waste of time, money, and paper 
 I just received a first-time correspondence from Kids Discover threatening referral to a credit agency for copies of a magazine that we didn't order and haven't received.  There is no telephone number to call and only a p.o. box to correspond with.  I suspect many people just pay the bill in order to avoid any trouble.  I sent a notice to the Consomer Complaint agency in the states involved in order to get this fraud on record 
 I worked in an independent outpatient facility in the early 1970's, when Al Lowen was publishing, which ought to give you some idea of the focus involved.  Bioenergetics had something to commend it, especially in the 70's, and still does, for people who are experiencing day-to-day stress (so what's new?).  But I do not see where the long-term benefit can be had for someone who is really ill: anorexic, paranoid, or psychotic.  As with a volcano, venting helps yet doesn't solve the underlying turmoil.  As a daily anger (or other) management tool it may be a bandaid but I do not believe it helps in the long run. I can personally testify that bioenergetics did nothing for me, although admittedly my exposure was not consistent. 35 years after the fact, I'm in conventional therapy as well as pharmaceutical treatment for issues that arose while I was working at the facility, aa was my tormentor 
 don't buy it.  If you have the first two, stick with them.  They contradict themselves in this one buy using nothing but technology, the same thing that they shun in koyaanisqatsi.  A lot of the scenes made no sense.  Again, it is a complete waste of money if you are expecting anything like the first two 
 Leo the Late Bloomer occupies a dusty, terrifying shelf in one of the furthest reaches of my memory.    To a child who is already depressed and uncertain, Leo offers no solace.  I found him pathetic, and because I was like him, I found myself pathetic all the more.  Leo is the prisoner who escapes while the others languish.  He proves only that salvation is possible, but he offers no guidance for how it will come about.  It's nice for Leo that he "bloomed," but the child is still miserable.  You think I am kidding.  I wish I was.    I do not blame the book per se, though.  With kind, insightful parents, it could help a child talk about his hopes and dreams, and with their encouragement they might come true.  But read alone, on the floor of an otherwise empty room, with no one to translate the allegory, it only tightens the noose.  
 ... but doesn't really touch anything the new digital shooter would be interested in.  If you're shooting film and you're looking for a simple primer on low-light, it's not too bad. Be warned, however- it's a pretty basic book.  Apart from a good few pages on tricks with flashlights, and one or two truely stunning photos, it's a generally pedestrian take on the subject.  Digital shooters are advised to look elsewhere 
 If you enjoy a good, tightly plotted thriller -- read something else. This flabby, clunky and completely unbelievable story labors to its silly ending wheezing and gasping like an overweight commuter trying to catch the 8:45.  All of the characters are two dimensional and if you don't figure out the ending hundreds of pages before it arrives you are unconscious.       
 I was all set to purchase this bag but wanted to try it out first.  I had great difficulty finding one locally but finally after many many phone calls I located one bag and asked the merchant to hold it till I could get there to try it out.  Firstly, the bag is nice but doesn't hold as much as I thought.  It still could have worked for my but for one thing: this bag is not designed for those with a, er.....womanly build.  It was the most uncomfortable bag I have ever tried out and looked absolutely ridiculous on me.  So glad I was able to take it for a test drive before purchasing online.  Just a word of warning to the ladies;- 
 I am studying for an M.S in software construction in Denmark and this textbook was assigned to a course covering Software Engineering this last semester. The semester at the same time was focusing on teaching the theory of compilers and computation complexity.  Being from Denmark, english is not my native language and I must say that the verbose language used in this book sometimes had me pulling my hair. It seems I am not alone when i say that. Most of the reviews here tell about problems with the overcomplex language used.  I am not sure why the outher finds this necessary. There is also much use of references to other (somewhat outdated) books about the subject. I am not sure how many several authors I have read when i finish this one - it must be several. The left-margin is used for key-points, little advices, web-references which is a great idea. But they do take away the focus of the main text.  I cannot say whether or not it presents the material correctly or if something is missing or the information is outdated or whatnot - I just do not like this book. It seems it was written for software engineers already in the field (it is the practitioner's approach) and the only thing they really need is a (grown up) presentation of the methods used in modern software engineering. And this book does contain that - indeed. Atleast it seems like it.  This book is not for students which at the same studies technical courses like compilers and complexity theory. The intended reader for this book was perhaps never meant to produce source code but instead do the management of these chaotic projects. Though, this I am not sure of, since I an not a practitioner - but a hardworking student seeing myself reading this while coping with the immense culture shock it is for me to realize that I do not know anything about developing software.  The book does manage to give away information (if read carefully) and from one perspective it is not just a waste of money. One usefull feature are the examples of dialogs between members working on a fictive software project. They are very informative.  But to use it like is has been done in my situation is just a clear misconception of the reality which lies in the study of the conceptually hard areas of this kind of education.  Bottom-lines:  - You like programming, mathematics, theoretical studies and understand that careful planning and execution of software projects is a requirement - get another book on software engineering. Perhaps the one by Sommerville or McConnels's Rapid Development are good bets.  - You have been working in the field of software engineering for several years but haven't really gotten the touch of programming or have had ups and downs managing software projects, buy this book indeed, you'll cope with it just fine 
 This wasn't a bad CD, but it was NOT what you typically think of when you think of Manheim Steamroller music.  I was expecting electronica patriotic music.  I got a kinda old trucker country sort of music.  No wonder it's so cheap compared to the other MS cds.. 
 This book could have been written by the "the N.I.C.E" from C.S. Lewis' That Hideous Strength.  This is quite simply the most cynical book I've ever read. There are no positive messages or characters. The Heart of Darkness, an exploration of evil in us all, is cheerful in comparison.  The setting is a religious (Catholic) school called Trinity. The teachers and administrators are called brothers (Jesuits?). The brothers are all either completely corrupt, complicit or psychologically weak. The main character who fights for his own road, in the end, recants. His friend, the only other marginally moral character is portrayed as both weak and unwilling to go against the group, no matter what the cost. The other characters are either portrayed as amoral (Archie) or unwilling to stand up to the promptings of their conscious.   I guess this last point is the most disturbing yo me. There are many characters who are prompted by their conscience to act against some kind of wrong, they all ultimately FAIL TO ACT ON IT.  The main message: Life is pointless and filled with selfish and hateful people. Trying to fight against this (no matter what your conscience tells you) is futile. Those who are the most self-serving and manipulative triumph in the end.  I found this book fully out of touch with reality. I have been down some dark roads in my life and in 42 years have yet to meet anyone as selfish and malevolent as Archie or Brother Leon. The sheer numbers of bad and weak-willed in one school is just absurd.     
 I think all this stuff is from California. I could be wrong. But it's pretty jewish, anyway. Ooh, I'm so kult/dangerous/initiated.   Anyone who drops money on this book, any like it, or anything remotely associated with Feral House and its pet charlatans, is a bloody fool. People who liked this also bought: Marilyn Manson's last album. Should tell you something about the level of culture here, no? Such folks want the allure of "badness" like rats want crack. No substance, pure ego trip. 
 The main problem with this book is that the content is totally unrelated to the title. The title puts forth that the book will discuss how marketing has affected American culture, but the book constitutes no such treatise. Instead, the reader is assaulted with a series of the author's autobiographical vignettes. Despite Seabrook's best efforts to tie these together with the occasional sentence or two about marketing, the tales remain disjunct. Further, they're totally uninteresting! I kept reading in the hope that the book would match up to the promise of its cover description, but it never did. What a waste of money and time. 
 I used Stryvectin religously for two months and one week - more than double the recommended time to get some results - and it has made no more difference to my skin than regular moisturizer. I used it for fine lines on my face and thicker lines on my neck and forehead. To determine if it really worked, I decided to use it experimentally by applying it to the left side of my face only - every day as suggested on the packaging. After all this time, I cannot see the slightest difference between the left side of my face and the right side, and nor can any of my friends. I got better results on my neck when I was using Shiseido neck cream which is a third of the price. I would not buy Stryvectin again 
 Miwon Kwon's writing is extremely wordy and very hard to grasp. You'll inevitably spend more time looking up her obscure vocabulary than actual reading. I found her writing hard to comprehend even after reading chapters multiple times. I'm a college level reader, and have experienced few problems understanding other art related readings. Her sentences are incredibly redundant and very hard to understand. Honestly, I would ONLY recommend this book to College Professors or anyone with a PHD; otherwise save your self the time and pass this one up. You'll be happy you did 
 I am very disappointed in this product. I purchased the Blue Logger to use with a new Dell Axim X51v (which I purchased to use with the Blue Logger). I found that I could not make a Blue Tooth Connection between the Blue Logger and the handheld computer. I contacted Delorme & was told "At this time we do not offer any support or updates for Windows Mobile 5.0.  Hopefully in the future we will be able to offer updates for compatibility but currently there is no timeframe." What a ripoff. Delorme has a product that is not even compatible with the present PC Handheld operating system.   I have also found that I cannot upload routes created on Street Atlas 2006 to the hand held. Basically I have a little electronic map with no functionality. 
 This is Microsoft's most stable OS yet, but ridiculously over- priced.  I'll admit, I'm no fan of Microsoft, but I've very few problems with my desktop once I upgraded from Windows me 
 I thought this book was totally mean-spirited and filled with sadism that would certainly scare any child.  In fact, I believe that there is little, if anything, positive to say about this book.  Children look up to the adults in their lives, especially to their teachers, and this book portrays the teacher as cruel and nasty. This book was deeply disturbing for both myself and more importantly, for my son 
 After an amazing season 3 culminated in tragically hopeless catastrophe, I had such high hopes for season 4. Episodes 1 - 6 are dark and interesting, but season 7 is the beginning of the downward spiral. None of the characters are likable or interesting after that point.   The story line was leaden. After growing into a self-less champion for good in season 3, Cordelia acts like a depraved moron until she is revealed to be little more than a body suit for a dark force...except it takes *FAR* too many episodes to reveal this. Much of the final 15 episodes are made up by long, boring, circular talks between Cordelia and Connor (yawn). In the words of Buffy: "Alright! I get it - You're evil!" The blah blah Oedipal/Modred weirdness of the whole season is just not appealing or well-written enough to be intellectually stimulating. Would that Cordelia had never come back for season 4, because it's just too awful that her sassy-yet-big-hearted self was nowhere to be found.  Connor and the Cordy-suit have a baby - a goddess figure named Jasmine...who is kind of like a cross between LaFawnda from Napoleon Dynamite and a New Age yoga instructor. A full five episodes are filled with long, dull scenes of people being adoring acolytes of this unimpressive villain. Connor's character doesn't develop...period. Sorry folks, but he doesn't get gone until the final scene of the final episode. In a word, blah.   Some good stuff: The gang releases Angelus for interrogation purposes and he goes postal, of course. It's well-played by Boreanaz and highly entertaining (Oh, and Angel's hair is slightly shorter and darker, which is a nice change). Faith returns for a few episodes, the best of which is Orpheus. Faith and Angelus share flashbacks of Angel's good deeds ("Dude, you just saved a puppy!"), while guest star Willow works to restore Angel's soul and give guidance to floundering Wesley. 
 The first X-Men movie was fantastic. The second movie sent chills down my spine and was even better. This third movie was absolute trash and I will never buy it 
 "Belle de Jour" is widely acclaimed as a masterpiece. I would like to know: by whom? Certainly by nobody with high self-esteem. If art's highest purpose is to project life as it ought to be, then, according to this film's creators, life ought to be seen as dispensable, drab, meaningless, and amoral. What is virtue? "Belle de Jour" doesn't know and doesn't care. What is coherent plot and characterization? "Belle de Jour" puts on a blindfold and pins a tale on neither. What sort of role best suits a stunningly beautiful actress? "Belle de Jour" says let's stick Catherine Deneuve in a pillory of an ugly, thankless role and spit at her as a self-loathing, self-deluded prostitute. What is "Belle de Jour"? Worthless 
 You can't write a mystery without a solution and call it "pulp" or "noir" in my book.  Those of you who are fans of King's writing will find this readable, but hardly enjoyable.  Those who are not would do well to stay away.  We're halfway through the book before we're even introduced to the "mystery", and we're finished the book before we're told that there's no solution to it.   And worst of all, none of this seems to bother the Downeast characters narrating the tale 
 The song that is played in the background while Paul Walker is driving his red pickup truck towards Torreto's deli is called "Deep Enough" (Remix) by the band called "Live".  The album is called "V".   [... 
 i have to say that i enjoyed this book  it was a good read, however i just found that it was not what i was expecting.  some useful point, and some simple truths, yet not what i was expecting and i found much of what others had to say misleading.  a good place to start though 
 This book is a piece of defecation.   It is difficult to believe this long piece of bad luck came from the same mind that brought us "The Executioner's Song".  Clearly those with a vested interest in hiding the truth have bought off Mailer, and he has been entrusted with the mission of creating an exhausting work of fiction.  After drudging my way through this unfortunate slime I have lost all respect for Norman Mailer, and will never read another word he has written.  The only thing that would be longer than this utterly pointless rant is the enormous mountain of known facts he must ignore to come to these delusional conclusions.  Out of a possible 5 stars, this book owes the scale 3.  Wretched. 
 This textbook relies on more handwaving arguments than my Quantum textbook! Griffiths seems to be under the impression that he is an astounding mathematician and the reader can barely integrate. The "proofs" of almost every key concept are either fleshed out in "Well suppose... then this might happen..." or altogether left to the reader. It was a fun challenge to actually write a proof for a lot of them, too... maybe Griffiths should have tried it when he wrote the book. If the reader does every single problem in the book, he or she may have a mid-undergrad level understanding of basic E&M. Very little relativity, and no Quantum mechanical aspects are covered (if I remember correctly) 
 This film angered me for the same reasons that have made it so I can no longer watch American television news without feeling like I am being deliberately misled by a media that doesn't think I will catch on.  This film is a perfect example of the sort of Orientalist discourses based on cultural stereotypes that have permeated the mainstream of American mass media.  The film completely ignores the dynamic history of Iran, and how the Islamic Revolution was welcomed by many who were disheartened by the effects of globalization in their region.  As Vincent Canby so aptly put it in his review of the film for the New York Times: "The Iranian revolution appears to have taken place mostly to make life miserable for the insufferably superior Betty" (Canby, "Sally Field, Fervently." New York Times. January 11, 1991).   Furthermore, the film describes and interprets all events exclusively from Betty's Western perspective, and neither Islam nor the people of Iran are allowed to respond to her criticisms.  The film (though probably not intentionally) takes to heart Jameson's view that cultural stereotypes are an inevitable consequence of two disparate cultures coming to terms with one another, and proceeds to builds an entire movie around it.  Finally, the film oversimplifies Moody's character, denying any and all internal conflict that might have existed as a result of what could be described as a postcolonial understanding of self, in order to set him up as the despicable Middle Eastern foil to Betty's admirable Western ideals 
 Dissapointing after "image of the invisable". The rest of the disc is slow. I understand an artists right to make the album the way they truly wanted to with time taken to get it just the way they invision it, which is explained in detail with a booklet with the cd, but I'd rather they have had the deadline pressure and made another Artist in the Ambulance or Illusion of Safety.  Did they have to include a piano intro in almost every song on the album?  Maybe the songs will grow on me, but they will never feel like the good old stuff 
 Love the matching sugar bowl that comes with this butter dish, and the butter dish is very pretty, however it is too small!! or short rather.. you put a standard cube of butter in the dish and it squeezes the top of the butter and gets stuck. The lid does not touch the bottom of the dish  until you have used most of the butter. Also it has to reach room temperature, so it becomes molded to the shape of the lid better, which in turn makes a mess. Really, very unusual and it drives me nuts. I do not recomend the butter dish, sadly 
 If I could give it a zero or negative rating I would.  When VIBE was introduced, it was a relevant, interesting magazine that exposed me to new alternative, r&b and hip hop artists.  The mag featured all kinds of artists not just who's hot right now, it also featured hard hitting expose articles that were relevant to not only the hip hop community but the world.  Lately I've noticed that it's nothing more than a fluffy version of The Source.  I hate a lot of new rap music that's out and didn't appreciate mags with rappers I dislike on the cover. And is it me or does it seem like since Mimi took over, all of the female r&b singers' covers and stories are HORRIBLE (we won't even discuss that disgusting Brandy cover)!  This magazine SUCKS now and the only time I check it out is while I'm in line at the grocery store.  Yes, the subscription rates are cut to the bone now but that is because the quality is supremely lacking.  I'd advise the curious to check issues out at newstands or where ever before wasting your hard earned money on a subscription 
 I remember liking this book as a child and I thought I could get this book for my daughter.  The board book has been so abridged that it lacks a lot of things that I thought were funny.  AND what about that "climatic ending" where the apples all topple - Not there! I wouldn't even recognize the wording in the board book as Dr. Suess's 
 Why does this cd not appeal to me? Well, it doesn't have what it takes (in my opinion) to reach inside of me and make me tap my foot to the beat. His previous songs did that. Sure, Will is growing and I hope he continues to grow but this cd was a disappointment to me. I expected more. Should you buy this cd? Sure! If you're a fan of Will then go for it. If you want a totally different style of Will then give it a bash. If you're looking for some upbeat music that will make you bop your head at a party or while driving then I suggest you pick another cd 
 This book would not be helpful for children of faiths other than Christianity 
 I was given the Fisher-Price "Doodle Pro Glow" for my son's birthday.  Although the concept of the Doodle Pro Glow is unique, the product itself fails to live up to its expectations.  The pens that came with our BRAND NEW Doodle Pro were used and didn't last more than a couple of days.  The screen is extremely hard to clean and I had to resort to using a window cleaner to remove the gunk that seems to get caked on.  The product comes with an "eraser" which is no more than a piece of cheap dishwashing sponge that disintegrates after a few wipes (not to mention that it doesn't get anything off in the first place!).  The eraser shown on the packaging is false advertisement since it is NOT the one you get with the product so Fisher Price should really change its advertising to reflect the true product.  Fisher Price has always been a brand I've trusted and enjoyed so I was very disappointed at how shoddy this product was.  Needless to say, after a couple of days I took the Doodle Pro Glow to my nearest ToysRUs for a full refund 
 the product was received on 6/18. When I tried it on I found it to be too large, Utilizing the return form included with the order I completed it and returned the item via UPS on 6/20. I'm still not sure about the return policy! When I hadn't heard from The Uniform Company after about 2 weeks I called them. I was informed that they did in fact receive my return but the size that I needed, Large, was not in stock and it would be 4 to 5 days before it could be shipped. I'm still waiting! When I get the product I can properly review it 
 Being an engineer in the aerospace industry I was highly interested in this book based on my experiences from the vantage point a "hard industry." I personally believe that it's in our long term interests to maintain a strong manufacturing base because that's the foundation of real wealth, not legal services or newswires. So this book sounded like the perfect source of information to explain our current economic situation, give an assessment of how bad or how good it really is, and suggest ways to improve it. Oh, how very, very wrong I was . . .    This book started off strong, . . . for about four pages. After that a litany of tortured logic, un-sourced assertions, facts taken completely out of context except for the author's subjectively added adjectives, Orwellian double-speak, sleight of hand arguments, flat out ridiculuos statements, contradictory assessments, and even emotional vitriol coalesced not so much into an argument for industry but one for eighteenth century mercantilism with perhaps a sprinkling of far left George Soros on top to serve as an update for the twenty first century.   Even a broken watch is correct twice a day though, so there were some good points in the book which buy it the 2 star rating. These include:   - Manufacturing provides a large source of proprietary knowledge which both improves productivity and serves as a barrier of entry, creating an industry with a large base of high paying jobs, provided it's run right. (A big if.)   - High wage nations can still compete effectively with low wage nations in manufacturing by being capital intensive.   - Americans need to save more and our education system needs to produce more engineers and technically oriented graduates.   - There is some excess in the financial services and managers of publicly traded companies take too short term a view, leading them to sell the company upriver in the long run because of a personal temporary short term gain. (i.e. Enron)    A scholarly, fair, and comprehensive book that focused on the above would be extremely interesting and useful. This is not what you'll get in this book though. Instead you'll get:  A begining section about postindustrialism, things like the internet, information technology, financial services, etc., the things that make the services based economy. In three chapters the author simply sets up straw men by taking the worst examples of post industrial advocates, instead of presenting a comprehensive picture of the post industrial argument. Not being satisfied with this he proceeds to beat the straw men, set them on fire, and piss on the smoldering remains. This is where vitriol even comes out, where he equates the post-industrialists to people incapable of even thinking. If someone has to go to this extreme to make their argument, they probably don't have one. Most telling he leaves the final assessment of the value of the internet to a feminist. To me, this would be like leaving the final assessment of how good a bicycle is to, oh, I don't know, let's say a fish.  A middle section extolls the virtues of manufacturing. This is a bunch of hand picked anectdotal stories and there's no overview of manufacturing in the world or its real impact on economies at large. This is the kind of subject that screams for reams of data, charts of GDP growth over time, pie charts of the breakdown of economies into services, manufacture, agriculture, etc. You will get none of that. There's little value except in reassuring the obvious, high wage nations CAN do manufacturing. Many of these cherry-picked anectdotal examples still don't quite dove-tail with all his claims about manufacturing though! You also know you're being left in the dark with a plethora of CYA disclaimer statments like "while Industry_X has certainly had its share of problems recently . . ." at the begining of a section.     A final section basically amounts to an attack on laissez-faire, free markets, and the concept of free trade. George Soros and a bunch of other lefties, with Pat Buchanan thrown in for "balance", should be listened to instead.   The worst part of this book is the author's lack of an ability to make any sort of coherent argument. Examples of twisted thinking abound:  - A post-industrial "industry" grows five times over in a certain period. The author then goes onto explain how this is not really real growth but something that in reality is bad. Later he proves how great a manufacturing industry is because in the same period it grows a whopping 60%! Self contradictory evaluations of the performance of services vs manufacturing is common and always falls down on the side that the manufacturing industry is far far better than the service industry even when all the standard economic indicators suggest otherwise. The author's challenge to the reader seems to be "who are you going to believe? Me, or your lying eyes?"   - He rips into American post industrial industries as being labor intensive and vulnerable to low wage nations because Americans are no smarter or more creative or more anything than laborers around the world. Later he talks about how great German manufacturing is because Germans are so much more diligent than the rest of the world's workers.   - The only facts he presents - and they are surprisingly thin and overwhelmed by mere assertions - are always modified by his subjective opinion and never put in context. When describing service industries "paltry" $50 million revenues, "only" 60,000 jobs, "disappointing" 24% of revenues from foreign sources is common. But when describing manufacturing "a very high" $6 million revenues, "a good mix" of 1,500 jobs, and similar glowing assessments are inevitable despite the number to follow. A number in and of itself means nothing. The fact the author leaves out any head on, direct comparison between industries is telling.   - Official figures are the ultimate source of information when they agree with what the author believes. When the official figures don't agree with him, he finds some loner who does and then barely explains how this time around the official figures are somehow wrong. When attacking his straw men though, he accuses them of ignoring official figures and quoting some loner.    - Gems of Orwellian double-speak sentences include examples like "Solar is already a fully competitive source of energy in remote areas that do not have grid electricity. (pg. 184)" I.e. it's competitive where there is NO competition! And "Even in Singapore, one of the freest societies in the East, the savings rate was successfully boosted by a system of forced savings . . . (pg. 229)" That's not very free if it's FORCED is it? (His defense of solar is one of the most hilariously pathetic eight pages I've ever read and really is worth the price of the book. He capstones it with the "most encouraging" observation that solar cells have gone from producing one third of the energy used to make them before they wore out - that is consuming more total energy in their manufacture than they eventually make!- to now producing three times as much energy as required to produce them before they wear out. Wow, what an achievement. Any ACTUAL power source converts many thousands of times the energy used to manufacture it before it's internal workings wear out, but whatever . . .)  - Americans are dumb and the only successful American companies basically blundered into monopolies on standards. The American economy, despite the statistics, is in bad shape. The Japanese instead are eight feet tall, can read people's minds and see through lead. The Japanese economy, despite the statistics, is in really great shape. This type of persistently biased characterization makes you question everything he claims, and eliminates any value or truth he might actually have in his arguments. The author basically can't get out of his own way.    - He always attacks opponents of his viewpoint by claiming that they don't put numbers into context, are using twisted logic, making mere assertions instead of quoting facts, etc., apparently oblivious that these are the very same tactics he himself uses!  - He claims Boeing is no longer a good company because 30% of components in a Boeing aircraft are now made abroad vs. 2% in the 1960's. This is actually because foreign manufacturing for those components happens to be better and cheaper. America isn't doing that badly in aerospace by the way. The author fails to mention that 50% of the "European" Airbus is made in America. This is an example of free trade actually distributing production to where it is most efficient.   The list goes on and on to ridiculous proportions. You'd have to buy the book to see them all because there's at least one thing an alert and critical reader can find highly questionable on each page.   All in all, this book was way off the mark and a highly squandered opportunity. It's really a mercantilist argument, and the only common thread that I could see in all the author's cloudy reasoning is that nation's should do everything in their power to export more than they import no matter what. It's NOT, unfortunately, a book about how to revitalize American manufacturing in a globalized world. 
 This book offers nothing to someone remotely familiar with environmental issues.  It might be a mediocre read for a beginner, but if you're already familiar with overpopulation, mismanagement of resources, etc, you will get NOTHING out of this book.  It is incredibly repetitive and it lacks insight and depth.  Don't waste your time.  
 she forgets to mention shesonq or jesus christ in her book and she lacks many things like kenneth kitchen findings about joseph being sold 20 pieces of silver matches the prices of slaves during that period, she would need to  read jeffery shelers book is the bible true 
 I know that this book has a bright pink cover and, therefore, from the get-go, doesn't raise extraordinarily high expectations, but I was extremely disappointed in this read.  This book has almost no plot.  The characters are bordering on absurd, and they come and go as they please.  The book jumps around chronologically, leaving the reader with little sense of what is happening when.  The fact that Amy, the narrator, is a "private eye" is nowhere near as exciting as it's played out to be on the back cover - the most exciting thing that happens to her is she spends a lot of time on the phone, uncovering "secret identities" and packing her prose with a lot of esoteric lingo. I assume that this is meant to sound smart but really just makes the book difficult to wade through for those of us not in the PI profession.  Additionally, Amy's guy "problems" are incredibly repetitive, I don't think she deserves a boyfriend.  Every time she gets a guy, she finds one little thing wrong with him.  She dumps him, wallows in self-pity over how insane he was, and then meets a new guy, who is of course The One.  At least until he does something crazy.  And so the cycle continues.  This book had potential: otherwise I never would've walked out of the library with it.  But once I had finished blowing through the text in about three hours, I was incredibly greatful that I hadn't spent ten bucks to buy it.  
 while I appreciate what Tipler was attempting to accomplish, he fails miserabley both from a theological and a scientific perspective.  skip this one! 
 I've owned a Magellan Meridian Gold GPS receiver for 3 1/2 years. It worked great until last week when it got wet and stopped working. It is supposed to be waterproof and sealed to IEC-529 IPX7 standards - but apparently it isn't. Magellan charged me $126 to have it repaired.  I ordered the Explorist XL as an upgrade and for use as my primary unit with the intention of keeping the Meridian Gold as a backup. But I returned the Explorist after learning how difficult it is to use with the MapSend Direct Route map software. Also, the map software will only work with one Magellan GPS receiver at a time. So, you either have to completely uninstall and reinstall it each time you want to use a different GPS unit - or you have to buy another copy of the software and install it on a different computer. I don't mind paying for a second copy of the software, but who wants to buy another computer!  Until Magellan addresses these issues, I recommend buying something else 
 Spends more time promoteing the authors instead of teaching you how to actually design 
 I had reservations about it when my small group decided to give this book a whirl, and although I was game and tried to like it, I just couldn't.    Liz's overfamiliar style, her judgemental tone, and pandering to churchy already-good-girls reads like a book that reinforces smugness among the churched.  I especially did not like the way she glossed over the difference in 21st Century standards for women, and instead just judged them against today's free-er women's options and opportunities.  I will say that we had many good conversations because we read the book, but in the end, we were all severely disappointed in the book itself.   Examples of what I mean:  some of the "bad girl" scenarios seemed like she was stretching to fill pages, "bad for a good reason" - what?, or nattering on and on about David's sin with Bathsheba - wait, he's not a girl! 
 I read this book with high expectations that a lot of people equate business/ selling with warfare, and I'd like to see if someone can actually draw the correlation.  Unfortunately, while there are a lot of tips on selling, which could have been covered within Selling 101, there is minimal coverage on Sun Tzu's military strategies here.  The book cover also mentioned abt Customer Relationships, which is not substantially covered in the book as well.  I guess by marketing it as what it's not, it's bad for customer relationsips too 
 Sorry for the sarcasm, but I can't help thinking just how uninspired this book is.  Imagine a counter to this book.  This book would promote "hate", "dishonesty", "immorality", "ignorance, "ingratitude".... you get the picture.  This Mormon leader's great contribution to world is to say we should be honest?  Now that was profound!  Sadly, Gordo and his wrinkled cadre have this bad habit of taking the basic decency of the members of the church and attributing it to the implausible myths they peddle to the world.   As an avowed atheist, I encourage everyone to be honest, moral, learned, and all the things Gordo promotes in this book.  There is nothing wrong with promoting these and they have nothing to do with Mormonism.  But this book is written for children and sheep.  Promoting this book among the various books that seriously discuss morality, ethics and other serious issues is like watching a high school team play the New England Patriots or comparing a Janice Kapp Perry vapid song to Bach's Mass in B minor.    Mormonism is declining in real terms because their leadership does not have the capacity to address and provide any illumination to the relevant issues of the 21st century.  This book should confine itself to the children's section or to the local Deseret Book store.   
 This not a terrible book -- it's a decent book with a poor title.  It should be called something like "A Random Walk Through Web Programming with PHP." There's certainly nothing advanced about it.  This book would be ideal for someone who has  just learned PHP but lacks any real knowledge of computer science 
 Having never read a Koontz novel before I was looking forward to my first one. So I picked this up. Boy, what a disappointment. For 469 pages all I kept asking myself is what is going on? Why is this happening and what's the point of the entire book? In short, I felt the entire book was a big mess. Koontz co-wrote this book with someone else and it reads like it. It seems that these two guys were locked in separate rooms and wrote two different stories and never bothered to talk to one another while they were writing.  Characters pop up and storylines are laid out that lead to nowhere. One character, who happens to be autistic, can only walk while he completes imaginary crossword puzzles in his mind. Sounds interesting but his story has no plot or ending whatsoever. I have no idea how this characted is connected to the other characters in this book.  For almost the first 50% of this book deals with pieces of what I was hoping would be a much larger, more coherent puzzle. I was waiting for something to happen but it never did. If Frankenstein is still alive than only a few people were murdered and it seems no one actually cared except two cops. Hardly what I would call earth shaking considering who the killer(s) could be.   I think I'll pass on any further Koontz novels for now. I was never a big fiction fan but friends of mine talked me into testing the waters with Koontz, Patterson, Brown, etc. I think I'll go back to by non-fiction books for awhile and save this tripe for the beach 
 This is still an okay book on baseball, but it is not the great book it once was.  Where before it had mostly accurate information, it is now chock full of errors provided by the error prone Stats organization.  The pictures are also gone and so is the information on the coaching staffs and managers.  A better book is Baseball America's Super Register.  (I have Baseball Registers going all the back to the the 1940's, so I can see exactly how far this great book has fallen. 
 This book is easy to read & sympathetic but it didn't work for me. Staying with my baby while he was supposed to self-soothe (as recommended) did not help him or reassure him in any way. He cried continually, stopping for no more than 2 mins at a time. It worked better for me to leave him, returning every 10 - 15 mins for very brief periods of reassurance. He still cried but less & less each day. I think there are babies for whom the stay-with-them style could work, but not all, and alas, not mine 
 My mother recently ordered this book by Mr. Chopra and was urging me to read it. She spoke very highly of it and told me that he used science to prove God and such, etc. Allow me to be upfront. I am a skeptic, and a firm Atheist. I do not believe in the backward illogical concept of God that most religion would scare you to believe in. But I decided to keep an open mind, as I always do, and I read Mr. Chopra's "How To Know God" from cover to cover.   First of all, Mr. Chopra does not speak of the God that most religions speak of. He in fact urges the reader to rethink their concept of God, the first chapter is called "A Real and Useful God". Here Mr. Chopra describes a God that all of us can reach directly, and he also describes most people's general view of God and how he is a supposedly unattainable God until death...etc. He then devises 7 Stages of God, that match our human emotions and says there is a God for each stage. He continues to say that whenever we feel this or that, we are experiencing the God of that stage. This is where I begin to have a problem.   Mr. Chopra begins this book with his own concept of God, that is neither supported by scientific evidence or any sort of rational thought at all. I was unable to get anything out of the following pages because I could not help wondering why I was not given any evidence into Mr. Chopra's thought process. He simply creates his own idea and flies with it, assuming the reader will just go along with it and not apply any sort of thought. This is weak and misleading. But I continued to read. He then begins to talk about three versions of reality, the material reality (the material world), virtual reality, and quantum reality (God's world outside of space-time). He then says that there are many arguments in the material world against God, but none of these can be applied because God is not in the material reality, he is in the Quantum reality. Absolute garbage! Pure assumption! I was outraged by this statement, and saw it as a poor way of denying the logical and rational arguments against God. Mr. Chopra once again maintains excellent continuity by not supporting his claims with any sort of scientific evidence. How can he say that God is in a different reality? What makes him think God isn't in the same reality that we are in? How does he know there is a virtual reality? These so-called "realities" seem very fabricated to me. They are a clever way of escaping arguments against God, if you put God outside of this world then you can't apply any arguments from our reality to his, according to Chopra. I do not buy this, and feel sorry for anyone who does. I am impressed though. That is a clever trick, and nothing more than a trick. Mr. Chopra seems to be exhibiting "wishful thinking" here. He acknowledges that the mind is in search of God and needs God (with scientifc evidence), I believe Chopra's mind is just like all other minds and wants to justify God and find God, so he will by all means attempt to do that. He wishes for there to be a God, and so there will be. He can change his reality as he pleases. This sort of wishful thinking is dangerous when explaning or proving a point because it makes Mr. Chopra incredibly biased and unreliable.   While reading this book in its early pages I was almost assured that Mr. Chopra was speaking of God in a purely metaphorical sense, but I later found (much to my disappointment) that he was speaking of God in a very real and literal sense. Many will claim that Chopra uses "science" and "quantum physics" to explain God and how we can reach him, but that is a misconception and perversion of the truth. Mr. Chopra does indeed make clever points using theories and stories involving quantum physics, but they do not relate directly to the existence of God, or our ability to reach him. They seem to just be random tidbits Chopra throws in so he can say he proved God and our ability to reach him with "science." It is an absolute mockery.   I did find Mr. Chopra's ending chapters on the paranormal (telepathy, esp, clairvoyance, synchronicity) to be interesting, but once again not supported by anything and pure wishful thinking. Mr. Chopra just plays the God card everytime he is faced with a dilemma that is unexplainable or difficult to understand. The God card in this case is more like a Joker, it serves no purpose and is just a laugh.   Mr. Chopra does have good stories to tell, but they serve no relevance to God or finding him. His writing is not bad, but it is also not very good. I find Mr. Chopra to be a very weak thinker who ignores all rational arguments and ways of logic and reason to further exonerate his wishful thinking and enforce the idea of God in his reality. If you are interesting in a book relating Science and Spirituality I would recommend Amit Goswami's "The Self-Aware Universe". I do not recommend this book at all, especially to other skeptics. Mr. Chopra not only seems to have a rather negative and close minded view of skeptics but he completely shuts them out and addresses them in a rude manner.  I have kept an open mind in reading this book, but Mr. Chopra has not, in fact he hasn't shown much evidence of an intelligent "mind" at all.   This book receives two stars just for effort and a few interesting tidbits. 
 It appears that John Jakes likes to write about conflict.  This book is comprised of conflict in war, conflict in relationships etc. etc. To me his characters do not seem real.  Also, I don't like the way he creates situations where he reverses right and wrong. It is a book that lifts immorality as a good thing. This was my first and last John Jakes book.  
 Although I applaud the author for researching the shroud, simple math eliminates his hypothesis for Da Vinci as the author because the shroud can be 100% proven to date back to 1357-Da Vinci wasn't born until 1452. 
 I really wanted to like this book. I bought it to read with my 9-year old because she and I are so interested in Pirate stories. I am also a fan of Dave Barry and so thought this would be fun for both her and I.   However, like many parents, I decided to read some of it alone to make sure that it was appropriate for her age and her sensibility. My husband and I are not prudish by any means. But we do feel a need to preserve childhood for our kids as much as possible and shelter them from that which they do not know or need to know at such young ages.   And I am so glad that I read a few chapters before sharing this book with her as it is HIGHLY inappropriate.   For example, there is a Captain Slank in this book that at one point is flirting with a governess named Mrs. Bumbrake. It is innocent enough at first. He meerly gets excited at seeing a flash of her naked ankle. But later Peter (Pan) hears the two engaged in the following:     "Oh, Mr. Slank!" she was saying. "You are the devil!" "That I am, Mrs. Bumbrake!" boomed Slank. "And you know what they say!" "WHat do they say, Mr.Slank?" "They say," roared Slank, "the devil take the hindmost!" Then Peter heard Mrs. Bumbrake emit a very un-governess-like squeal, followed by what sounded like a slap, followed by some thumping, then more squealing, then more thumping, and then much laughing. From the sound of it, Peter figured they wouldn't be breaking up the party any time soon.  OH MY! I don't think they were playing checkers! And I am certainly not going to put myself in a position of having to explain this to a 9-year old ...(which is the suggested audience age for this book, by the way)... nor do I think it is appropriate or necessary for a book like this. It is published by Disney for crying out loud!  So, for parents who are pro-active in securing a nurturing, peaceful, unsexualized childhood for your kids, stay clear of this book. It was only on page 55 that I found this inappropriate scene. I imagine there are more 
 These boots were the worst ever!  They were grossly missized and not as depicted.  The back of the boot had a tape with embroidery up it that was mysteriously not pictured when ordering. When returned, the company refused to reimburse shipping even though they acknowledged that this was deceiving. Never again 
 We went to see this at the time when we went to see any horror flick, much less anyting with Jamie Lee Curtis. It came out just about the time when every holiday was getting a horror movie named after it. Whether the movies promised to be good or bad, we went and had fun with them either way. This one we had fun in how bad it was. This was one of those, "picked on, pencil necked geek gets pushed over the edge by a cruel prank, only to come back with genius killer skills, somehow attained super strength and the speed of the Road Runner to get from one end of a train to the other to pull of impossilbie kills aided only by clever camera play." In short, there's nothing to be believed in this stinker. LIke a "Friday the 13th" flick, you merely wait for the kills, and try to outguess the next guy as to how it ends, and pray for that to come as soon as possible. The movie pulls out the stops, giving us Curtis for eye candy and David Copperfield to amaze us, perhaps even toy with us as to him as a possible suspect. But in general, this movie insults the viewers intelligence and lures you with a hope for a "Halloween" type thriller. There's too much stupidity from the victims, oh, until one genius finally puts 2 and 2 together. There's too much "not acting on a possible emergency situation in unison." And given her presence, there's just not enough Jamie Lee to make this crock worth sitting through. We had a gas picking this movie apart in the theatre. It made us callous for the impending onslaught of slasher flicks to follow in the 80s that got worse, more predictable, and far too numerous to maintain our interest. This movie got that ball rolling. Don't waste your time. You'll get more excitement out of watching Jamie Lee's finger nails dry for a couple hours 
 I loved "The Incredibles," so I was excited to play the game.  I've only been playing video games the last couple years, and only off and on, so I'm really just a beginner.  Perhaps that explains the enormous difficulty I've had with this game.  My boyfriend is a long-time video game player, and he was able to do things in one or two tries that I labored for hours over.  Even using cheat codes did not really help me all that much.  I was surprised when I read the review that said the game was too easy.  I almost cried.  LOL  But seriously, unless you are a good gamer, you're probably going to be more frustrated than challenged by this game.  As for me, I guess I'll stick to action RPGs 
 I read the book and saw the movie, which other than title and major characters, have little in common.  I can't say I really liked either.  The book is a little funnier. My major learning from the whole project was when "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" taught me about "roman a clefs", of which "Devil" is one.  Perhaps if I had more interest in the fashion industry, I'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that "Devil" provides.  Meryl Streep is very good as the apparently soulless Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, but somehow she's never quite devil enough.  Anne Hathaway is passable in her second (or third) "made over princess" role.  The minor characters, including the wonderful Tracie Thoms as "best friend" Lily, are mostly wasted.  
 James Spader was supposed to be in the last season of DINER. That would be my only reason for buying it. He is certainly not in this one! So where is he????!!! Are there no Diner videos or DVDs with James Spader? 
 Early on in this interminable narrative, the three items of my subject line are referred to as unified. Mailer does labor mightily to bring this monsterful novel forth as a masterful tale. In the opening pages, describing death and pain, in the set-piece battle with the Hittites, in his description of being within the bowels of a tomb, in other descriptions of being within another's bowels--here, he succeeds. Like it or not, the excremental theme manages to connect the mud, the fecundity, the slime, the stink with carnal and practical and spiritual knowledge through power. I wonder if Foucault read this before he died?   What's disappointing, then, are the stagnant patches you must slog, or more likely skim, to get to the energized portions. Nearly 650 pages, and probably no more than 150 of them reward your effort. The characters of the little queens Honey Ball and Heqat, big queen Nefertiti, the main pharoahs, and the Hittite princess do manage to leap off the page. But you miss others that needed to be drawn more distinguishably--such as the wife of the Hebrew that the protagonist marries for fourteen or so years--this whole "lost weekend" episode could have been much better written. This whole lacuna in the story sags, as if Mailer had to have the narrator pass a few years in exile in order for the rest of Egypt to move forward to catch up with him.  As a result, the bracing plunge Mailer does give you into the mentality of an entirely alien way of faith, cosmology, and ethos manages to immerse you for long periods, only to be irritable when, as in the final stretch of the book, the care taken in parts falls apart and the story lumbers to an indifferently conveyed conclusion. As the pages go on, the narrative design of the book weakens, and the whole shift from one life to another seems to be--as in many time-travel stories--wobblier and less convincing. The ability of characters to drift in and out of each other's consciousness is an excellent device, yet it too is applied almost at random rather than with care.   I suppose the hours I spent with this book entertained me, but the investment of time paid off with less consistent rewards than the decade Mailer spent upon its construction would lead you to believe. 
 Allright, listen:  I will break it down for you country simple.  There is very little actual literature in the world and most of that is not recognized as such.  Why?  Because most of the people who set themselves up as arbiters of literary art have no discernment and bad intellectual character and so are easily bamboozled by writing that reflects to them their own dishonesty and narcissism.  Cobroc McGonigle, or whatever his name is, is one of the writers who will be ballyhooed to the skies by the taste frauds who cannot tell what makes good writing and what makes bad writing.  They just can't tell the difference.  And so they are suckered by pretentious, narcissistic phrase-making and word molesting.  Like for example inventing new words like "candleflame"  And churning out lots of copy.  With pretentious and asinine titles like "All the Pretty Horses."  This is the kind of title a teenager with no talent for writing should have come up with in the process of getting an F in high school creative writing.  Basically, the same people who cannot see through William Fakener will be unable to see through Comrod McDougal, only more so.  William Fakener may as well have been reincarnated as Copran McViegle.  He wrote the exact same type of tripe, complete with pretentious, meaningless titles like "Intruder in the Dust."  You intrude in any dust lately?  Oh, I forgot, I'm just not with it enough to swing with the hip literary fast set.  You know, the fast set that is composed of (not "comprised" of , that is a pretentious mis-usage) middle-aged women with vague but rather humble pretentions to art appreciation who join and promulgate book clubs.  They know they're too dumb to "get" why this stuff is so great.  What they don't know is they are actually smart enough to see that the emperor has no clothes.  
 I suppose I should have realised that if I hated "L'Avventura", I would probably hate this, too. Just wish I'd thought of that before buying it. Ponderous, slow, self-consciously arty. A milestone in cinematic history, and all that, but terribly off putting and, in some instances, terribly obvious in its ennui. There will be much eye-rolling on your part. You probably only need to see this if its part of a film studies course. Really.   Good package by Criterion, though. 
 Sorry folks, this is not a serious book by any standards. Much of what Shenkman has to say is either unproved speculation or purposeful misunderstanding of events and indeed of history itself. Please do not take this as a serious effort. It is not 
 what were they trying to teach me?   this book is intermittently funny, more often highly and dryly pretentious and snobbish, but more than anytyhing I find it very very creepy. Towards the end when things start to fall apart for Aimee, Dennis/Waugh achieves a combination of callousness and feeble wit that is so offputting to the sensitive reader, I can hardly believe the book made it to press without a major rewrite of the last few chapters. It would be one thing if it were much much funnier, but most of the "comedy" is of the "lost in translation" variety: nothing but xenophobia and looking down on those beings from a different culture and therefore certainly inferior that populate certain parts of the globe. haha those silly japanese persist in speaking their own language/americans women are all completely interchangable unlike our English roses! Didn't this guy also write "Brokeback Revisited" anyway?  I was totally embarrrased to be seen reading it in public when I took it to dinner with me one night at the little thai place!  the movie is interesting cause john waters certainly got the idea of edie the egg lady from this film (and not from the book. mom is quite different onscreen as conceived by terry southern and c. isherwood.( also liberace is fun, rod steiger is A M A Z I N G.                            
 I move around a lot so I always enjoy reading books like this.  I've been using the Places Rated Almanac for years and was excited when I found this book, but unfortunately it's not the magnificent piece of work that I hoped it would be.  I will mention one very good thing about the book and that's the "introductory sections" for each city, where the authors write a short description about the city and list a few "pros and cons" of living in that particular city.  These introductions usually give you a good overall impression of what the city is like, and you can learn things that you wouldn't be able to by just looking at the statistics.  That's about the only improvement over the Places Rated Almanac that I can think of.  Now for the bad stuff.  This book is very politically correct.  One of the ways that this is obvious is that they consistently list "low ethnic diversity" as one of the "cons" of living in a particular city.  I suspect that when the authors were trying to decide which city should be ranked number one, they automatically eliminated from consideration any city that had a very high percentage of white residents.  They say that Charlottesville is the best place in the country to live, but in the most recent Places Rated Almanac Charlottesville wasn't even ranked in the top one hundred.  This politically correct bias is sometimes evident in the way the authors describe crime rates.  Take a look at the three Jacksons, one in Michigan (MI), one in Mississippi (MS), and one in Tennessee.  Keep in mind that the average U.S. violent crime rate (VCR) is 456, with a higher score indicating more crime.  Jackson MI is 95 percent white and has a VCR of 555.  Jackson MS is 54 percent white and has a slightly higher VCR of 561 (and a much higher property crime rate).  In the introductory section for Jackson MI the authors specifically mention a high VCR, while they don't say anything about the crime rate in Jackson MS.  The other Jackson, in Tennessee, is 74 percent white and has a super high VCR of 905.  Nothing is said about the high VCR.  Meanwhile, two other cities with much lower VCRs, Knoxville (554) and Indianapolis (587), both get specific mentions for high violent crime.  Knoxville and Indianapolis are both about 90 percent white.  Now let's compare two cities in the same state, Florida.  Jacksonville is 77 percent white and has a VCR of 867 and a property crime rate of 4986.  Fort Myers is 91 percent white and has both a lower VCR (651) and a lower property crime rate (4147).  In the introductory section for Fort Myers the authors list a high crime rate as one of the disadvantages of living in that city.  What do they say about crime in Jacksonville?  Absolutely nothing.  And finally consider Savannah GA, which is only 66 percent white.  For "cons" the authors list summer heat, performing arts, and air quality.  They fail to mention, however, that Savannah has one of the highest overall crime rates in the United States.  The worst thing about this book is that it contains a huge number of errors, contradictions, and discrepancies.  Other reviewers have already pointed out many of these mistakes.  Here are some more.  For Los Angeles the authors say that "air quality is the worst in the nation by far".  But on the air quality table on page 96, there are five other cities listed as having worse air quality than LA.  On the same table Tucson is listed as having almost the cleanest air in the country, but when describing Tucson the authors say that the city has poor air quality.  They say that Sarasota has high unemployment, but according to their own statistics the unemployment rate is only 3.7 percent, compared to a national average of 6.1 percent.  For Shreveport they say that the crime rate is "by far" the lowest in the state.  But according to the statistics, Shreveport has both a higher violent and property crime rate than two other cities in Louisiana, Houma and Lafayette.  On the table on page 100, which lists the cities with the highest violent crime rates, the rate given for Jackson MI is actually the rate for Jackson TN, the rate given for Florence AL is actually the rate for Florence SC, and the rate given for Jacksonville NC is actually the rate for Jacksonville FL.  And on the table which lists the highest overall crime rates, on page 102, the rate given for Springfield IL is actually the rate for Spokane WA, and the rate given for Sharon PA is actually the rate for Savannah GA.  Keep in mind that this is by no means a complete list of mistakes.  What would happen if someone checked every single statement, fact, and statistic in this book for accuracy?  I don't know how many total mistakes you would find, but it would probably be enough to write a whole separate book about! 
 I admire Vollman's ambition in this novel.  He is a thinker who seems to be attempting to tie together aspects of religion (Buddhism, Christianity, and Paganism . . . ); commentary on the differences / similarities of love, lust, and addiction; Capitalism versus Marxism; racism between all colors of all people; classicism; reality and fantasy; misogyny; unions; child-love or child-molestation depending how you look at it . . . the list goes on.  And this is exactly the problem with it.  The connections are vague--not subtle.  Fragments connected by tiny threads that fray as the book continues leave us suspended in a kind of weird sickness--ready to fall.  If I were Vollman, I would have let this book sit for a while and then returned to it in an attempt to clarify and condense . . . maybe map out this Royal Family to make it worth his while and worth our while as readers.  His characterizations and insight about human fraily are immaculate.  I don't advise giving up on him yet.  He has potential.  But I don't think spending days reading this will get you anywhere but depressed and tired 
 I bought this for my daughters 6th birthday. The lips on the doll didn't work and there really isn't much to do with it. She was bored almost immediately. I was hoping for much more out of this toy. In my opinion you shouldn't waste your money 
 It is not the Wonderful Twinings Earl Grey you have come to know and love.  They have pulled a "new coke" blunder and now the best Earl Grey tea ever is available no more!  This tea is weak and tasteless. I hate stupidity, especially from corporate marketers 
 I am amazed and mystified that most of the reviewers herein found the movie to be excellent!! As for me, I made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay. The fault in order of importance: poor screenplay, poor cinematography and poor performance by Pacino, who seems to be vying for the most over-the-top performance. The film was absurd in many ways from the outset: the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans. Close-up after close-up conveying no meaning, Pacino overacting like Jack Palance in one of his not-so-famous European pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies, an utterly dumb plot with Pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops.   First example, they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that; then, instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound, they storm the stairs and Pacino stands right in front of the door yelling "Police, you're under arrest."  They kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source. Of course, Pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream, having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort.   Cut to Pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog, glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog. Stumbling around further, Pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from, we must assume, his quarry. Did the screen writer forget that Pacino's colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit, too?   Inevitably and apparently not, because Pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him. As I watched this scene unfold, I became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what I knew already, that Pacino has fired on and killed his partner. It was then that I decided that I had had enough.   By the way, the European version, with Stellan Skarsgaard is infinitely superior. Don't waste your money or on-line rental queue on this Hollywood drivel. Ditto for the other Pacino junk I rented at the same time, The Recruit, which I could only stand for about a half hour too 
 Having heard so much about how this woman was the queen of conservatives I decided to give her books a try. However after reading this, I will say, if this is how conservatives are then I feel ashamed to call myself one. She touts on and on in the book about money, and how its every mans right to it yet no mention of how greed is one of the seven deadly sins. she goes on and on about how ALL liberals lie and how they insult each other. A many conservatives and liberals alike have lied however I see her being hypocritical (As well as childish) as she throws petty insults around in this book non stop.  she speaks of how horrible people who choose abortion are and yet when people seeking an abortion see conservatives they see people trowing bombs at doctors and protesters yelling insults, not a gentle person to turn to for support and alternatives. No wonder they don't look our way for help! All the souls I have encountered and helped in this area are not people "just looking for birth control" but people who are confused, made a mistake (though jesus forgives our sins most cannot forgive themselves) and are in need of some guidance.  Whats worse is she puts everything as a generalization of the whole entire section. ALL liberals, EVERYONE. No type of people are ALL the same, no matter what term you may group them under, and this just shows more of her predjuidcice to spread hate. ALL liberals are not the same and good thing ALL conservativies are not the same as her.  Sharing your wealth and helping the poor is just as important as personal behavior. To turn  your back on the hungry is just as much a sin as anything you might do.  Luke 12:33. "Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves purses which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, nor moth destroys."  What ever happened to "thou shalt not kill"  Jesus chose non-violence, even as people threw stones at him he did not lash back, he did not return the stones, or attack others. Jesus said "love thy neighbor" he did not say for oyu to judge and hate your neighbor, God will do that as each soul reaches the pearly gates.  I don't know where this woman gets her blind sighted views but they seem more damaging then helpful. This woman is only spouting hate and making a bad name for us, I'm sure God will judge her fairly and she won't like where she is going. Until then I suggest you save your money on a better book. 
 The novel features totally unbelieveable plots, cardboard cutout figures whom it is hard to identify with or sympathize with, the strangest motivations masquerading as realism and an off-the-cliff ending that is not satisfying. The sex is near-pornographic and not believeable to the point of being almost funny. The main character has the behaviour of a robot and seems to have no inner life or feelings.  The author hates liberals so badly I think he would personally like to go out and kill them bare handed; this axe to grind gets in the way of the development of a coherent plot. On the other hand, much of the writing is good in a technical sense, in spite of the often angry and sarcastic tone.  Many scenes are very interesting and well-written; the whole work just does not hang together, especially when you consider it is written by an experienced writer with a background at the CIA. This is not Ludlum, or Le Carre and I enjoyed Clancy more.  I like being entertained and told a nuanced story, not beat over the head by a heavy-handed piece of agit-prop so favored by the late unlamented Soviet Union.  However, the author does manage to tell what is on many levels an interesting story. He needed an editor to intervene 
  A flimsy, repetitive and disjointed book that manages to mildly entertain at first, before the ennui sets in.  It's a series of vignettes rather than a narrative, and whilst I don't think Marion herself would have made any grand claims for it, the editors (whose presence is constantly felt) seem to be trying to elevate Marion Davies to a level of literary and historical importance that just isn't justified. 
 I saw Malkin on TV and I couldn't believe that a professional political analyst could sound ike such a fool. What could be worse? Her book! I give this two stars because she tries, but that's just being generous. If you must read, use your public library 
 The author spends the entire book pontificating about how eBay has and will change the way consumers buy and sell things. While he has this general trend correct, and this is interesting to ponder, the author uses the book as a platform to conveniently mention and promote (by name) his own auction dropshop business.   Further, he states that soon auction dropshop locations will be as prevalently widespread as Starbucks. I think not. In fact, the auction dropshop store that opened in my neighborhood closed due to lack of interest after just a few months.  The fact is eBay and other online auction sites are changing things because they eliminate a middle man and wonderfully facilitate consumer to consumer transactions. That the author is a middle man himself is telling. And that he seems to believe that these dropshop businesses will thrive is way off base, and demonstrates a clouded lack of understanding of the marketplace based upon his own ulterior motives.  The book is not well-written either. Each chapter seems just like a re-read of the last chapter (like filler) and it doesn't really progress any new ideas that weren't already made early on in the book.    
 This book is well written, but is very slim and hardly worth the time of anyone who is a student of the goings on in the current administration and Congress.  Better to spend some time with John Dean's book, WORSE THAN WATERGATE 
 ...then perhaps all men should read 'A Women's History of the World', now called, I believe, 'Who Cooked the Last Supper...' (for another look at how facts can be cherry-picked, warped to suit any argument, and sweeping generalizations are made from singular statistical data, and correlations are based off presumptive conclusions demonstrating no adequate causation--hmm, only from a woman's point-of-view and a whole lot more unapologetic in tone...I believe Rosalind Miles came from that era of "bitter feminist"--the male-bashing years...   Why I'm even wasting brain-cells on this is beyond me, but what the world didn't need was yet one more book--'The myth of Male power'--(you'd do better to read Joseph Campbell and discover the true beauty of myth and symbolism, and some archetypes of masculinity)--that attempts to present the answer to all men's problems (and women's apparently) rehashed once again by misconstrued statistics, sensationalized news contorted to astound and astonish as opposed to making one think, all fit into a pattern of fallacy so apparent, this could be used as an exemplar for intro to logic texts.  Someone in an earlier review stated how disturbing it is so many readers seem to respond favorably to this work without realizing how simplistic the 'facts' proposed are, taken out of context and construed as 'deep' research. What I find even more disheartening is how easily duped most American readers are into not being able to recognize 'pop'-culture hysteria books when they see them and analyze/critique accordingly.    As a case in point, citing men's suicide rates exceeding women's as they go through adolescence into their 20's and 30's, writing the numbers off as a tirade of 'man-the-victim-of-vicious-masculine-stereotypes-see-how-fragile-we-are-damn-the feminists-who've-made-us-suffer-for-demasculinization". How Sir Warren uses these numbers ignores complex issues of familial, socio-economic, ethnic, racial--along with gender--(and even geography) factors.  This statement is not made in negation of a consistently documented trend of higher rates of suicide amongst men over women--all anyone needs to do is go to the CDC website  http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/factsheets/suifacts.htm to see that. To say this trend is happening because of feminism's cancerous influence upon the wider arena of modern society however, thus demonstrating the victimization of men, the subsequent hacking-away of the male-coping mechanisms in terms of cognitive and behavioral health demonstrates one of these sweeping generalizations, and a lack of correlation/causation.    As noted from the CDC website, women are three times more likely than men to attempt suicide (though not carry through on it). Thus, the prevalence of suicide ATTEMPTS amongst women v. men (if we're talking victim v. victim here) is higher for women; men happen to carry through with their attempt on the first go as opposed to women.  Did the self-destructive tendency come about as poisoned offspring resulting from feminism's damaging influence to masculine development/mental-health/social identity through adolescence? What about the damage feminism has done to women? After all, I'm 3 times more likely to try and kill myself, because I've obviously been conditioned by my XX chromosome to be manipulative and attention-seeking, and in my journey to evolve into a more self-directed and empowered individual I've suffered a crisis in my feminine identity (assertiveness warring against my more natural tendency toward passivity and submission).  So, where men I guess blow their heads off 4 times more frequently than women, women are 3 times more likely to slit wrists and call 911.  Hmm, I don't know, seems to me masculinity is fairly intact--purpose-driven and determined straight to the finish.   I don't honestly believe the above statement, but can anyone see where this sort of reasoning leads? The broad sweeping blame on one civil rights movement (of which feminism ought to be included) attempting to effect societal progress for a discriminated populace elicits a backlash of accusation, wherein feminism is touted as the reason men have lost their identity, self-confidence, jobs security, social security, effectiveness in combat, desire for combat, now experience role-confusion, etc etc...all  in 21st century America.   Has the male ego become so fragile over the last 50 years that it would allow itself to be debased by such clap-trap argumentation and conclusions as to be found in this book? Are men's identities really so fragile in this country, or in the world, that in trying to reclaim the 'masculine-aura', men must segregate themselves and allow themselves to be defined by one more author espousing post-modernist biological determinism obscured by seeming "deep-research" and profound insight into the male psyche?  If anyone is interested in how the world thinking operated in terms of men and women and gender roles in the era prior to "2nd Wave Feminism", [...] If anyone believes this was a better world, then I invite you to continue looking through rose-colored glasses.   For others, especially Sir Warren Farrell, what is it about feminism that has frightened so many, and disgusted so many others? Not to quote a bumper-sticker, but "feminism is the radical idea that women are people too", doesn't seem to scream femi-nazi.   Indeed, I think one review from "Fire in the Belly" had it right on--if you're looking to reclaim your masculinity, you'd do better to rent a John Wayne movie or watch Gladiator or The 300. Now there are paragons of masculine ethos and heroism--even for women (to enjoy on so many levels).  Ultimately, a purpose driven life isn't defined by gender, nor on self-victimization.   On the other hand, as one of my favorite authors once wrote, "It's only stupid, conventional men who like stupid, conventional women," (ah, G. Bradshaw).    I can only wonder at the kind of history with women a man like Sir Warren Farrell has had since he obviously claims to have the answers as to society's ills with them 
 Not only do I disagree with his opinions, but some of his facts are blatently false.  On page 106 he refers to violence agains Native Americans by European settlers as "isolated instances" and not planned nor calculated.  Had to read it for a class and it was less then enjoyable 
 Charlotte Church has such a beautiful voice, & it's sad to see her sink to this. I'm not against her doing pop, but couldn't she have done good pop instead of this drivel?  I don't know why she has allowed her voice to be drowned out & disguised on this massively overproduced album.  Basically, it could be anyone singing. 
 I just threw this book away.  Not even worth trying to re-sell. Wish there were negative stars for ratings ....   I got this book when we decided to give IVF a try and maybe my mistake was getting this book after 1 1/2 years of infertility treatments.  The information in the book was very dated.  Reading through the author's experiences was extremely traumatic for me, but after spending a day upset over 'how bad' the book made the IVF process seem, I realized that a large part of the author's bad experiences came from her having doctors who might have been the best medical doctors ever but who had little compassion for their patients.  And then reading through her incessant whining about how much she hated needles .... Infertility is a medical condition, but no one was forcing her to take shots nor was her life riding on that medicine (unlike many people who have to take shots of life-saving medicines every day).    Even her bluntness was annoying sometimes.  Her "sorry, but that's the way it is" writing style might truly reflect her experiences, but my 2 years of infertility treatment experiences have not been like that.  There are many different types of infertility treatments and many different styles of REs/doctors.  You do not have to put up with competent but uncompassionate medical care.    
 This machine was okay, but I thought I could do better for my money.  The noise of the disk running was so loud when it was sitting on my lap, that I had to turn the headphones all the way up.  That did not seem like a good, long-term solution.  Also, the swivel and the case were very cheap plastic.  It felt like it would not last long.  In the end I returned it and bought a more expensive, but hopefully longer lasting Sony swivel screen.  So far it is heads above the Coby.  
 If I was Steve Miller, i would have been appalled with the way the record company edited down all of these great tracks. What the heck were you thinking Capitol? Every song is edited even the classics like "the joker" and "jet airliner". The best part of "jet airliner" is the awesome opening guiitar solo, well thanks to Capitol Records they edited most of it out.It sounds terrible. Don't waste your money on this highly edited album. If you want Steve Miller Band's greatest hits, I suggest you get Steve Miller Band "young Hearts"-the complete Greatest hits. Yes It might cost you a few bucks more BUT you get the full length versions of all songs and it is digitally remastered in stere 
 After reading his last few book with "co-authors" I wonder if he is even writing at all or are all the sub-par novels being churned out under his name coming straight from the "co-author". I have been a fan of Mr. Patterson since my first Alex Cross novel almost 10 years ago. While I still enjoy the Cross books, I find them more and more out of character as each new book comes out. Alex-vs- the vampire cult??? Kyle Craig a serial killer??? Alex joins the FBI??? Give me a break. I can only hope from the description of Cross X the series jumps back over the shark and gets back the glory it deserves 
 I picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it, and absolutely loved it! It is so smart, funny, and heartbreaking, without ever being sappy. So, naturally, I was curious about the movie too. I figured that because Ephron had written the screenplay too, not much could go wrong. And while the story line followed the book more or less, the movie turned out terrible. I could not have been more disappointed!! First of all, Jack Nicholson is completely miscast, because he essentially plays himself (as usual), not the *interesting* guy that Mark is supposed to be. He is the opposite of charming, funny, tender, lovable, i.e. somebody that the character of the wife (Rachel) would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely. You suspect all along that he is a cad; therefore, Rachel's utter shock at his betrayal doesn't make sense. Besides, he is too old for the role! Meryl Streep is annoyingly twitchy, but much better in her role as Rachel. Still, she can't carry the movie alone, and her love scenes with Nicholson are flat; there is no spark there. I wonder how happy Ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel, and whether she really did write all the scenes. The wedding scene, where Rachel has doubts about marying Mark and spends what feels like 5 hours in a room alone agonizing, while the wedding guests wait, is out of place, not to mention boring, not to mention heavy handed. A total dud 
 I have little to add to what's already been said by other reviewers other than I can't believe she seriously holds these views.  I admit that I only read parts of the book while at the bookstore, but no one who is educated, and I presume she is, can really think that evolution is unproven.  You might as well say that the Earth is flat, or square, or whatever.  She writes this drivel because it targets the far-right and gives them what they want.  Apparently this works because she churns out this trash about once a year 
 While well-written and superbly organized, this book poorly met the needs of a recent graduate looking for work outside corporate world. A downright depressing read for those looking for a first job (treated as a "special need"), this book seems primarily designed for experienced sales and marketing professionals looking to move up in the corporate world. Those considering government work, having special needs other than "too much experience", or with a short work history should consider a different guide. (Incidentally, while the book left the impression I was unemployable, after ditching Resumes for Dummies, I was called for an interview on the first job I applied for.) 
 I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled "This is a racist book disguised as a work of art."  It seems that I didn't explain well enough my objection to Styron's co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, "The Confessions of Nat Turner," by T.R. Gray.  Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.    Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married.  Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional.  So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt.  In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.  Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction?  Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented.  Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die.  That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause.  What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero.  Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.  If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of "Confessions."  But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia.  Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself.  His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching 
 The author clearly knows their topic. It is a pity they are unable to develop a clear and compelling narrative to the life of Henry II.  Details, then details within details, thicken this soupy "read" until all sense of pleasure and color in reading about the life of Henry II evaporate. This is not a book for the general reader, even one with much background in the Middle Ages.  Instead, "Henry II" is for scholars in search of finely woven exposition about the history of Henry II who do not require a flowing, interesting narrative 
 I've heard everyone go on and on about how wonderful Clare Naylor is, and I was hoping to be entertained. Yeah, well, I wasn't.   Liv's fianc dumps her and to heal herself, she takes time off her job and goes to stay with a friend (who's living in a rich-boyfriend-who's-never-there's house) in Sydney, Australia, where she has amazing, chick-litty adventures with gay men and single guys who want nothing more than a shag. Same ol', same ol'. She meets up with her very first love, Ben Parker, who is dating the Girl Everyone Wants, Amelia Fraser. He starts to fancy Liv, who then follows the advice of her gay friend James, to treat men like dogs and they'll always be begging for more. Throw in the prerequisite chick lit twists, and voil, the story.  There was a lot going on at once in this story, and it made me weary reading it. I didn't even really look forward to reading it that much once I got into it, but I wasn't going to waste all that valuable reading time, so I slogged through. I've read better 
 I teach Statistics for a living, and this book replaced the book by Wiers, a move that I have berated the folks that do our purchasing ever since. The other Stats lecturer felt the same, and we have ended up using old copies of the prior book. For example, the book gives a miserly single page to explain Quartiles, and has very little in the way of examples that are helpful. If you HAVE to have it because your school dictates, you have to have it, but if you want to buy a book for the purpose of teaching yourself Stats, look elsewhere 
 I usually really like Anne Tyler (and I do like her consistency in telling stories about characters that are real, but not necessarily likeable) but this was my least favorite book I've read by her.  I could understand how the main character felt marginalized in her life, and to some extent how she could make the decisions she made, but she just seemed to lack depth.  In a story that was mostly about stepping out of her life and creating a new one, this character seemed to shrink and lose depth when it seemed she should be growing.  To me the main character was difficult to identify with, and I found her choices often disappointing.  I've found Anne Tyler's other novels to have odd characters that were often nothing like me, but I could still identify with them on some level.  There are many other Anne Tyler books that should be read before (or instead of) reading this one 
 bratz  socks because they big head and will pop her head and they are slutts dont hite the sexy my scenes because they are sexy then bratz and  dont talk about the my scenes okay thank you stupid people 
 My wife wants to have her filling pulled because this idiot says so. Why do I call him an idiot.  Here are two examples. Coral Calcium: he says a goverment agency won't let him publish anything about it--so he refers you to his website where you can find out more if you subscribe!  Hey, Kevy, there are no apriori restraints on the press in the USA. Pigs:  He says you should not eat pork because pigs eat thier own excretement.  He thinks that is disgusting, thus not healthy.  Well pigs and rabbits can eat their own. There may be many reasons not to eat pork, especially in third world countries.  but Kevy sure didn't bother to research them.   Why do research when you can make up a stupid reason.   Given his pork logic I'm surprised he doesn't say not to eat anything organic as the compost used to grow things contains animal excrement 
 I bought this book immediately after we found out I was pregnant and was really expecting it to be "the guide" to pregnancy.  Basically, it gives pretty accurate and complete information, but every time I pick it up, I am quite turned off by the condescending tone (i.e. if you eat a slice of white bread with butter, vs. whole grain with nothing, you are probably not fit to be a mother sort of notion).  This book doesn't even make me feel guilty...just irritated that an authority on the subject could be so demeaning.  As a first time mom, I would advise you NOT to get this book.  I know I am not alone either because every time I see used pregnancy books for sale or for free, it is among them.  Many of my pregnant friends have gotten rid of this book for the same reason.  In terms of getting good info, the internet is great and of course there are many many pregnancy books out there.  It is really unfortunate that this is considered to be "THE" pregnancy book, when it is such a disappointing read.  If you insist on buying this book, check a garage sale or Goodwill.  There you will probaly find an abundance of rejects.  
 I can't agree any more with the reviews that have pointed out the poor writing in this book.  As a fan of stories about Chinese Americans and of historical fiction, I was sorely disappointed with this novel; what could be emotionally-moving scenes just aren't because of the "see jane run" kinds of descriptions.  There is no skillful subtlety in this novel.  I normally don't like to be this publicly critical, but this is one of the only times I've felt this strongly about something 
 I was disappointed by the lack of mammalian studies in this book.  I was overloaded with avian studies, which are interesting to a point, but the book is permeated with them.  On the whole, I would not reccomend this book  to those who enjoy animals such as whales, tigers, other mammals 
 The book "Child of Fire," by Scott O'Dell is not a book I recommend to young readers. This book deals with topics that readers who are not mature enough might not understand. For example violence and drugs  are strong topics dealt with in this book. There is also a part in the book  where the topic of abortion is mentioned. This happens when Manuel's  girlfriend Yvonne tells him she's pregnant and wants three hundred dollars  for an abortion. It ends up being a lie, she just wants Manuel's money.  Either way it is still a topic that should not be exposed to young readers  in a book,but if possible by their own parents.  The book is basically  about two young boys no older than sixteen who are both leaders in rival  gangs. These two boys, Manuel Castillo and Ernie Sierra, compete against  each other to see who is braver.Manuel's way of showing bravery is by  jumping infront of a gate when the bull charges out of the tunnel.Luckily  he does not get killed but risks his life just so people can see how  "brave" he is. Ernie Sierra is a drug dealer who exports drugs  from USA to Mexico using pigeons, like the ones used to send messages. Ben  Delaney is Manuel's parole officer, who is also the narrator of the  story.Throughout the story Delaney tries to keep Manuel out of trouble. I  guess the best human concern developed  by the author is courage. Not in  the part of the two boys because killing people and selling drugs isn't  being courages,but by the parole officer Delaney. Sometimes he had to face  danger just to try to keep the two gangs from fighting.For example when he  goes to Ernie's house to prevent Manuel from killing Ernie, he is risking  his life by being caught in the middle and getting shot. Delaney is afraid  of getting shot by Ernie, but he still tries to stop him from harming  others.  Throughout the story these two boys both commit acts that are  unappropriate for children their age. Like I stated before Ernie sells  drugs and also harms anyone that gets in his way. Manuel ends up in jail  for causing a mutiny on a ship he was working on, and ends up escaping from  jail. At the end of the story Manuel Castillo ends up getting killed by a  grape picking machine. Not by accident but by displaying what he thought  was courage or bravery. He jumped in front of the machine, (just like he  did before with the bull) and did not move when it came towards him. The  machine ended up squishing him just like if he were a grape.This story  shows young readers the wrong idea of being courages, and is therefore not  a book I recommend to young readers 
 If this is supposed to be a satire, then the author forgot the key element...wit. This waste of wood pulp lacks intelligence and humor, and only the most ditzy of flakes would be able to stomach reading more than halfway through. Here's a little advice for the author; take thirty-five cents out of your coin purse, drop it into the nearest pay phone, dial the number of whoever told you that you'd make a decent author, and inform them that they have made baby Jesus weep 
 I have laughed and shed tears over all of the authors books. Im am completely dumbfounded as to what he was thinking when he wrote At First Sight.  Like me, you probably loved all the characters in his previous books.  He makes every character in this book NOT loveable! I kept asking myself, who am I rooting for?  Do I care if things go well?  The best part were the medical issues but only a few pages in the book - could have been a story in itself.  I miss the old spark. 
 This book goes into the hearts and minds of the ancient Greeks led by Odysseus and Achilles, who are guided by their gods. The Trojan War is brewing for the Greeks and thoughts of slaughtering their enemy, The Trojans are very strong. Can the Trojans survive? Will they all live to tell the tale of the Trojan War or will they all be killed?  On both sides, it's life or death on their minds. Have you ever heard of the Trojan horse and the victory for Odysseus? This book includes the story of Odysseus and why his son set out to find his father. The journey of the ancient Greeks to the Trojan homeland is included. Will they return or will they lie in the blood stained desert of the Trojan homeland? The book also includes Odysseusis treacherous journey home past a six headed serpent and right across an evil king's door step. Will he survive?  Personally I didn't like the book at all. The way it was written it didn't really pull the reader in very well and the battle sequences are O.K. but not the best. Personally I don't really enjoy some types of myths and legends. I think if you are just about to branch out and read Greek myths you shouldn't read this book first because it really turns you off to Greek myths in general, so don't think all Greek myth's are like this.  	 	 	 
 Your book is very biased. It only applies to those mothers and pregnant mothers all of whom have never experienced Infant or Pregnancy loss. Ask any mother who has experienced Infant or Pregnancy Loss and they will tell you that their first concern is just that they will bring this baby home alive. As a mother who already had two "normal" pregnancies and delievered 2 healthy babies, when I lost my third son at 20 weeks and 5 days due to SPROM (spontaneous premature rupture of membranes), I joined an exclusive club with a membership that I didn't ask for or want. I joined the community of Infant and Pregnancy Loss. I like so many others joined the club of parents who have experienced the loss of a child. I was shocked that I was also forced to grieve in silence and find underground communities where I could get support. It sickens me that in the year 2005 it is more acceptable and understood for people to grieve for someone they never even met...Elvis, Princess Di, JFK Jr., but that I am told to move on and get over the loss of my child. There is something really wrong with that. Yes, there have been great strides to bring awareness to Pregnancy and Infanct loss, we have October 15 and we have our online communities and support groups, but what we want most is for others to acknoweledge our losses. I have spoken to 100's of women that have experienced a first, second, or third semester loss and they will all tell you the same thing... that they just want to bring a baby home ALIVE. I had two "normal" pregnancies that gave me my two beautiful boys prior to experiencing my loss of my third son. My boys were 5 and 10 at the time and they to were forced to realize that not all babies come home. When they hear of another family member getting pregnant they ask will this baby come home or will this baby go to heaven? When I sit in my OB's office after my loss, I listen to the petty concerns of pregnant women that have not experienced a loss. They complain about their backs, having to get up to use the bathroom all night, that their husband doesn't have the nursery done, what sex the baby will be, when their baby shower is, etc. I just want to scream that NOT ALL BABIES COME HOME, however, I have to understand that they haven't lost what I lost and what so many other women have lost. I lost more than my son when he was born. I lost the ability to take things in life for granted. I too was once like those women in my OB's office. I had 2 healthy and normal pregnancies before my loss and until I experienced Pregnancy Loss first hand I too didn't know that it does and still happens in the year 2005. When I first lost my son, I needed support more than anything and at times even after almost 2 years after my loss I still do. It hurts even more that finding the support was so difficult. There are no cards at Hallmark for our kind of loss. You can buy a card for someone who lost a dog, but try to find a card for someone who has lost a baby! There are hundreds of moms that will panic and will continue to worry until they get to bring a baby home alive, not if they should pump gas or use a cell phone while pregnant. Why not write an book about that! There is no such thing as a "Fearless Pregnancy" to a mom or dad that has experienced Pregnancy and Infant Loss. Your ignorance is dangerous to women that might or even will experience a complicaion or a pregnancy loss. I never thought I would having had 2 "normal" births before. I assumed that I would get to bring another baby home. I am sick to my stomach that you are doing such a disservice to women everywhere and that you are making money from it. I also supposed that had your pregnancy not gone so well that you might have written a different kind of book. Maybe you should check out a pregnancy and infant loss community and read the stories of our losses and then maybe you can understand the Fear of pregnancy. 
 The back cover of my copy of Stranger In A Strange Land has a quote on it from the Washington Post.  It says that it's "the best of (Robert Heinlein's) many books".  Well, if this is the best Mr. Heinlein can do, then I won't bother reading any more of his books.  Stranger In A Strange Land is one of the most disappointing "classics" I've ever read.  If you think you'd like a book where the Muslim character is nicknamed Stinky, the women are called "wenches", and one of the female characters says the following, "Nine times out of ten, if a girl gets raped, it's partly her fault", then this is the book for you.  I could probably overlook these missteps if only the rest of the book wasn't such hippy-dippy pseudo-intellectual garbage.  Stranger In A Strange Land may have been a classic in the Sixties.  Now it's little more than an embarrassment.       
 I have enjoyed following Fairstein's Alex Cooper mysteries but this one has started a tedious note to them. First, it seems Fairstein/Cooper is getting a tad high-handed in the way she treats others and comes accross as being snooty in this book. I was so hoping for another ending that didn't develop (those of you who've read the others know what I'm talking about.) Will give her next one another shot and hope for the best, if not, I'll pass on the rest of her 'formula books.' As an aspiring author, I know how dangerous getting into this rut can be. Linda, you're better than this. Go back and give me 200,000 words of CREATIVITY 
 I am completely unimpressed by this book.  It doesn't provide enough information, gives too many anecdotes, and will not help.  Look somewhere else for a better book on this subject 
 Difficult to criticise such a book. Nonetheless, the accumulation of sometimes small, sometimes big inaccuracies casts a shadow on the value of the work of Mrs.Hamilton-Meritt.  There is strong evidence of massive -to  the Laotian scale- use of toxic agents against Laotian opponents to the  present regime, including voluntary targetting of civilians. This book is a  useful testimony of the suffering of a population extensively used by the  US governement and then quietly abandonned. But it is maybe not as  clear-cut as exposed. Opium is an issue altogether avoided. The French  actively promoted its cultivation to take advantage of the smoking habits  of some Indonchinese. French Indonchina was a net importer of raw opium,  and it certainly was not for 'medical uses'. The hill-tribes continued  their ancestral cultivation of the poppy during the various conflicts and  still do. All sides found a profit there, either because of a direct  involvement in the traffic, or more beningly in perceiving a tax on the raw  opium or ensuring its safe passage in their zone of control for a fee. Not  a word of this in the book. Similarly, posing the Neutralists as straight  allies of the Communists is rather surprising, at best. Finally, the Hmong  were not alone, some Laotian officers and soldiers were brave, and the  Thais also played a major role in MR2, with up to 16 infantry battalions  and 3 artillery battalions in the field.  The reality has a few more shades  of grey than this book 
 Functional is the Word in my opinion. I did not think the selection of bracelets in this book equals the other 500 items books. The book publishing, the physical part and the photographs are fabulous. The editors selections leave some doubt in my mind as to their abilities in selecting items. I think a bracelet is to be worn as an accessory or an adornment not to be a dangerous object such as a bracelet of lighted birthday candles- A big paper wheel you can stick your arm through  also stretches the boundaries.  I cannot stretch my imagination enough to consider some of the selections in this book as a bracelet 
 This was a much anticipated and very disappointing reading experience.  Ms. Forrest is an excellent writer, but this latest effort should not be listed as a lesbian novel, nor as a romance.  It reminds you of the 50's when a lesbian character is thrown in for attention.  If Daughters of an Amber Moon had been the first book, then Daughters of a Corral Dawn would never have had to be written as a sequel because no one would have cared about the other group of women.  This is mainstream writing making money posing as lesbian literature.  The fact that Ms. Forrest is a lesbian does not make her writing lesbian.  In the last few years, her books have become more and more mainstream sanitized.  Daughters of an Amber Moon proves once again that you cannot buy a book just by the author's name.  Characters are not well developed and no one the reader identifies with or gets close to emotionally.  Writing skill is good.  Subject and characterization is not.  I would not buy this book again, nor recommend it to my friends 
 A professor highly recommended this book to my art history class. I  was disappointed in it. I had hoped it would offer some useful advice but instead it merely outlines the things anyone writing on a college level (and the book seems to be aimed at college students) should already know. Perhaps it would be better suited to high schoolers 
 The only reason I gave this book one star is because there is no zero level, as far as I can tell.  I was disappointed. I was annoyed. I was bored. I was irritated. Then I was impressed because if this could get published, ANYbody can get published.   There are, theoretically, two plots in this book. Neither plot ties in with the other. The second plot is so secondary that it is forgotten for chapters at a time by the author. I only wish we could have forgotten the main plot, and I use the word "plot" only as a point of reference.   ESP, mysticism, ghosts, real magic; a protagonist who could be a woman, or who could be a woman who can magically - yes, magically - turn into a man. Or really, we aren't sure. It's like at the end of the book, Coulter looked up, realized "gosh darn, end of the book already? I'd better slap together an ending!" and that's what we have. I actually wondered if my book had lost some pages, I was that confused and bewildered.   Also, we meet a character in this book who will return in another book in this series, a cousin of the serial killers Tammy and Tommy Tuttle (Tammy, of course, maybe being Tammy or possibly Tommy or Timmy or magically changing into Tommy or Timmy; we aren't sure and trust me, eventually you won't care). In the later book, this cousin is nice and we are empathetic with her. In this book, I didn't care if she got killed or drowned on her way to Bermuda. In fact, I wouldn't have cared if the whole cast of characters had drowned on the way to Bermuda or been killed by the weird ghosts that the Tuttle siblings feed with blood from victims.   That's "ghosts" as in real ghosts, by the way.  My complaint is that the rest of the books in this series are mostly based in factual, believable actions. This book - I have no idea what happened with this book. Probably one of the worst plotted books I've ever tried to read. And that's sad, because a good Coulter FBI series book is a page-turner and a joy to read. 
 Maybe that's because it was given to me for free while I was in the hospital... by someone who was happy to give it away.  For that matter, as soon as I got out of the hospital I passed it on to a friend who was in a car accident and can't walk.  There was no suspense of disbelieve.  I have more faith in the existence of santa claus than I do in the circumstances surrounding the pseudo-characters found in this novel 
 this is a horrible cd. fat boy slim has for a long time corrupted our music with his mainstream whorthless crap and ive had enough.  i sat buy idly until he remixed smells like teen spirit.  he ruined a perfect song and runed it into a worthless funk song. i think the populace should boycote his junk to purge the airways of tthis low level crap 
 A compilation of few interesting ideas and very hard to see illustrations. Poor quality reproductions.  No measurements at all.  Furthermore the contact information in the back was not cross-referenced with the designs & listed no phone or web contact, just mailing addresses.  Seems like the authors took the cheap and easy way out with a good idea.    Taunton Press's "The Cabin" is a much more inspiring & informational book.  I do not recommend this book.  
 I purchased this matt to protect my laminate flooring from the weight of my heavy elliptical exercise machine. Unfortunetly, the matt is not thick and compresses to paper thin under the weight of the elliptical. I would not recommend this to anyone with anything more than very light exercise equipment 
 I can't believe that Amazon has the gall to be associated with people who will sell $4.99 toy for triple the amount or more.  These items are toys for kids.  I am personally disgusted 
 The contenet of this book was fine -- exactly what a Jackie Collins fan would expect.  However, the ending is so disappointing, it made me angry!  It seems more like cliffhanger than an ending.  To tell you the truth, I'm still half expecting a sequel!  Just when you're getting to the book's climax, IT ENDS!  It is absolutely unnerving!  This may be due to the facts that it was Ms. Collins' first book and was written back in 1968, I don't know.  But I do know that of all the books she's written, this has got to be the worst 
 This book is soporific.  I fell asleep every time I picked it up.  The opportunity for a meaningful and dynamic book was there but the promise was never kept.  Boring!  It is unlikely that I will read anything else by this author.  Give it to someone you don't like very much 
 The only part my 2 year old liked was the ending when everyone was back together again.  He wanted me to fast forward through the arguing and the ice breaking under Scoop.  Scoop needs a big spanking if he were such a spoiled bratty kid in real life.  This is for much older kids I reckon, not for pre-schoolers.  And the YODELING got on my nerves as well.  I did like the two bonus episodes, those we watched more than the movie.  Though in the end I zapped it in the microwave oven and tossed it in the trash LOL 
 I started reciving Vibe magazine in the mail announced and unexpected. This wouldn't be the first time this happened, turns out my Grandmother bought me People magazine as a gift and the copies were sent to my house. I figured that somebody had got me this magazine as a gift. Next thing I know a charge for the magazine appears on my bank statement.  I called Vibe immediately and asked them what had happened. They told me that there was nothing they could do and that their company didn't directly deal with the payment issues and subscription services. They gave me a toll free number that I was too call from an outside company that handled the payments. When I called this company, it was completely automated service, could not speak with an actual person regardless of what extension I used.  I eventually had to go down to my bank and find out what I could do. Turns out Vibe had illegally gained my bank account number and had been charging me for months, but I had only just recently started to recieve the magazine. I had to close down my checking account and open up a new one, which resulted in me being charged by my gym and other other companies that had access to my account in order to subtract monthly bills. It was as if I had written them a bad check, something that I had never done in my life and now greatly questioned my credibility.  Please do not support these people, they are theives and on top of that the magazine is terrible and uncredible. I seriously hope that my review will help deter any and all people from subscribing to this magazine 
 Having read books 1-6, I can confirm that these History books are quite terrible. Often events are told out of order, especially in the stories of the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. The faulty chronology is very confusing when reading the books. Furthermore, the series are intended for elementary or middle school students, and making it available for such a wide spectrum makes it seem very condescending for those at the higher age range. For example, when describing latitude and longitude, she says to think of the world as a big fat man with a belt around his waist (i.e. the equator). Hakim weaves multi-culti fables, saying that the Americans got their ideas about what to put in the Constitution and the Articles of Confederation from the Iroquios League. That is absurd. Our system of government is based off of Athens, the Roman Republic, English law (minus that whole monarchy business), the republic of Venice, and the United Provinces of the Netherlands. She states that "some historians" think there may have been as many as 75 million indians (beg pardon, "The First Americans") pre-Columbus, but fails to give a bottom estimate, giving the impression that Europeans wiped out all the Amerindians. All in all, the books are inaccurate, misleading, and demeaning 
 I bought this watch because of the stylish looks, the reported reliability, and the fact that it was a watch that would never need batteries.  There were also other functions advertised that appealed to me.  I have owned Casios before and they took extreme wear while still maitaining their function.  This watch I have now will not allow me to go more than five days without the solar battery running out - usually at inopportune times where I really need a watch!  It has become very unpredictable.  Please do not get me wrong, it is a nice watch, I have gotten many favorable comments.  But I want a watch I trust to work day-in, day-out and not one I am constantly worried about.  I guess for someone who has the time to set the thing out in the sun on a regular basis, it would be a good purchase 
 Engh has, apparently, made a good living in the field of "environmental portrature" -- people in their own natural surroundings.  Unfortunately, when all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail; and it seems that Engh's advice is for his readers is that their only chance lies in adopting the exact same approach.    In Engh's view, there is only one type of photo sure to sell:  one which shows, in front of an appropriate and uncluttered background, a person involved with a symbol of the subject matter in question.  He even reduces it to a formula of "Photograph = Background + Person + Symbol + Involvement."  Anything else, according to Engh, is merely a "pretty scene" with little or no commercial potential.  Now, that may or may not be the case.  However, I can't help but notice a glaring discrepancy in Engh's book.  Just after enumerating his "P = B + P + S + I" formula, he gives a case study of "John," who goes through the book's recommended program of determining one's areas of marketable photographic interest.  At the top of "John"'s list is gardening, and Engh notes approvingly that there is a highly-profitable market in stock photos for gardening magazines and books.  After reading this, I decided to research some of these gardening publications.  What did I find?  That the vast majority of photos in these publications were of flowers, plants, and scenics -- the very subjects that Engh advises his readers to avoid!  Furthermore, no matter how many such publications I checked, I failed to find even a single photograph fitting Engh's "Background + Person + Symbol + Involvement" formula.  Given this, I can't help but suspect that Engh's approach might be a little too dogmatic.  Finally, I would note that, although this edition of the book is barely three years old, it is already quite dated in terms of technology.  Engh is (was?) dismissive of digital photography, asserting that photo buyers will only consider submissions shot on film.  Hence, any coverage of digital is restricted to providing quick previews of film-based work, and much time is spent discussing concerns such as the filing, packaging, and labeling of transparencies.  Judging from the most recent Photographer's Market, this film-only approach is no longer the standard with publications, and Engh may wish to further revise his work with digital photographers in mind.  But perhaps not.  Somehow, I would suspect that an approach as rigid as Engh's when it comes to subject matter may well extend to not being able to see any other methods of doing business, either 
 Books are suppose to be an escape from reality not a morbid dose of it. I found it difficult to get through and the whole time I kept wondering, "When does the love story start?" There are many better books out there, don't waste your time with this one. 
 If you are looking for a touching and turbulent portrayal of the madness of artists in love, of a tempestuous relationship between two brilliant poets that destroyed one's life and reputation, then keep looking.  If you are looking for something to replace the Rocky Horror Picture Show for a good campy laugh, this is your movie.  The entire thing was beyond ridiculous.  There was no chemistry between DiCaprio and Thewlis, no hint at what would have pulled these two together in an age when the very hint of such a relationship could have been, and in fact was, the ruin of the elder Paul Verlaine (Thewlis).  The anorexic appearance of both actors (and let's face it folks, when is the cinematic world going to get it that they must never let Thewlis remove his clothes on camera?)and the scene of intimacy between them bring to mind the words brutal, abusive, sadistic and horrific.  That having been said, be prepared to move quickly from being appalled to laughing riotously at all the wrong places.  From crawling around imitating goats (yes there were real goats there too) to the frequent frontal nudity displayed by DiCaprio and Thewlis, there are giggles aplenty.  I must admit this movie has some of my all time favorite lines.  Poet 1:  "Just shoot me."  Poet 2: "I can't you stupid **** you just blew a hole in my hand."  And lest we forget... Poet 1: "My wife has not been well."  Poet 2: "Perhaps thats because you keep setting her on fire."  Poet 1:  "I'll have  you know I haven't set my wife on fire since Thursday."  Bottom line folks this one is just too painful for words.  Even the actors admitted in interviews that instead of method acting they engaged in method drinking to get through the making of this movie.  According to those interviews they were well oiled each day of filming.  So much that Thewlis admitted he doesn't remember making the movie.  Now if only we could all forget he made it. 
 I can't remember if Doctor Wallach is mentioned in his book or not but the other day I came across this man's site, promoting his book. He had a listing there about Doctor Joel Wallach. Within the first sentence he said that Wallach claims that all diseases are a result of mineral deficiency! Amazing...this is how he calls Wallach a quack? With a complete and total LIE. That's right. See I have Wallach's books. My family takes his supplements. I am part of Wallach's company email: Ekowal459@aol.com to discuss it further if you're inclined, etc. Now, I have also listened to DOCTOR Wallach's seminars in about 20 different variations and have health successes of my own as a result of him. Never once does Dr. Wallach [BS,DVM+ND] or his Wife Dr. Ma Lan [A Microsurgeon MD with a Masters in Science and liscensed Acupuncturist], ever come within the neighborhood of saying that all diseases are caused by mineral deficiency! This is insane and completely untrue. Furthermore he discredits Wallach for calling himself a physician by the implication that a Naturopathic doctor is NOT a physician on the grounds that he is NOT A MEDICAL DOCTOR. Once again a moron who can't understand how someone who's primary means of health care for patients is not pharmaceuticals can be a legitimate Doctor. So by his standards Osteopaths are not Physicians? No one can heal anyone else unless they dispence pharmaceuticals? Oh that's right, Naturopaths can dispense pharmaceuticals in state's which allow it...like the one Wallach trained and worked in...interesting. And Wallach does recommend some pharmaceuticals where prudent...he's not a lunatic. He talks about what an outrage his claims are? Such an outrage... I have one of his seminars on tape where he is speaking to 200 DOCTORS. Why would they even show up? This man tries to discredit Doctor Wallach and that which he says which aren't lies are just foolish arguments that make him look like the con artist or just plain ignorant of his subject [Wallach, Naturopathy, Health...etc. Don't waste your time on this man's books. I won't even talk about the positive points in this book that actually have merit because as far as I'm concerned his ranting about Doc Wallach on his site... and in the book, I seem to recall, discredits everything else period.

 I do not think this is a very good book for a book report on Rosa Parks.  Despite the fact the title is "Rosa Parks", I received more information on other things that were happening at the time and about other people than you did about Rosa Parks.  However, this is a good book if you are doing a report or want to learn about African American History in the late 1800s and 1900s 
 I was HORRIBLY disappointed in this book. I look forward to Debbie Macomber books because she has a gift for presenting everyday problems of likeable people and allowing these people to solve them realistically.   Not this time. Chrissie was a pain in the neck, and the way Susannah handled her relationship with her daughter (allowing her to whine and blackmail her) almost forced me to stop listening to the book in the mddle. Her mother's sudden change of heart concerning her move to assisted living was almost laughable, except that this is a very real problem among people of my generation and I would have liked to have read a little more believable solution.  There is hope, however. Susannah is buying a flower shop on Blossom Street in Seattle. Could it be that she and Lydia Hoffman (The Shop on Blossom Street and A Good Yarn) will meet and appear together in a future publication? If so, I hope it's better than Susannah's Garden 
 How can I review the movie "Second Chorus" when I have never received it 
 I was very excited about the series of books being written focusing on Clerics of FR, however my enthusiasm was effectively terminated after reading this first installment. This is quite possibly one of the worst-written books I've ever read. Apart from the numerous grammatical errors, the book is written like one of the adventures the author usually designs. The characters are fairly original, but the story focuses not on the cleric of Talona as the title would suggest, but on the party sent to destroy him. Overall, a disappointing story that I found very hard to enjoy 
 David Mamet let me down with this film -- even though I picked this DVD up for $2 at my workplace's DVD library sale, I felt rather ripped off after I watched the movie. From the very first scene, I began to realize that this was not going to be an 'intelligent, gripping political thriller,' but a rather hastily made B-movie that charades as something worth watching.   The depictions of secret agents, of soldiers, of political schemers were all the stereotypical (and pretty much ridiculously contrived) cutout figures for crappy action movies throughout time. The political 'thrill' is cut short by the quick injection of 'action' scenes; however, these action usually amount to about three muffled gunshots and a brief spray of blood. I don't demand flashy effects from all movies, but if you have to resort to these kinds of scenes to rejuvenate your bored audience, for God's sake, make them ACTION scenes. Don't just throw in some tinny pistol reports for effect whenever you think 50% of the audience has fallen asleep.   The plot meanders through various recycled action locations -- the seedy bar, the rural gas station, the mysterious house, the dangerous foreign lair... but nothing really interesting or stirring happens. Minor protagonists die, but you don't really ask why or even think about it after the scene changes, because you already saw it coming half an hour before it actually happened. 'Bad Guys' die without being established as bad guys... they're just there, and Val shoots them or stabs them, and they die, and then you forget about them.   A lack of any real plot drive, bad scripting (including some of the worst one-liners ever), mediocre cinematography, a limp musical score, a highly predictable sequence of events and locations, and an overall feel of hokey 'we made this as quick as we could so we wouldn't have to think about how awful this project really was' compel me to rate this movie 2 stars 
 Triple bottom line (3BL) accounting promises to keep score of "people, profits, and planet" -- meaning that it enables a company to measure not only its financial results, but also its environmental, and social impact as well.   It is, to be sure, a very good idea for companies to pay attention to their impact on the environment and to the contribution they make to their community and to society at large. And in business, what gets measured gets done -- so what is not to like about triple bottom line thinking?  At one level, there is nothing not to like. It is a minor fad and a fairly low nuitrition fad at that. There is nothing wrong with the occassional bite of ice cream -- but that hardly recommends it as a diet.  There are two problems with 3BL, and this book glosses over or ignores both of them. The first problem is one of measurement. We can measure financial result with standard accounting tools. This is not pure science and as with any performance measurement system, some people cheat -- but we know what cheating is and what results we are trying to measure. Moreover, we have a common unit of currency -- money.   There is no comparable way to measure environmental or social impact. Quick example: a company that is passionate about its 3BL principles recently explained to me how they were avoiding dumping excess product into landfill by donating it to needy Africans. They proudly gave themselves environmental credit for avoided landfill and social credit for a donation. Problem is, the Africans don't want this stuff, so they dump it in their own landfills. The program is completely wasteful, but the company tells its employees and customes that it is a 3BL business.   Social and environmental accounting are in any case not new. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the SA 8000 from Social Accountability International, the AA 1000 from AccountAbility, as well as parts of various ISO standards are all efforts by international agencies or accounting firms to report non-economic aspects of company behavior. 3BL contributes nothing to this beyond packaging -- and occassionally misleading packaging at that.  Andy Savitz seems like a capable and well-meaning guy. But his book is built on a caricature of the corporation as a greedy, self-interested monolith. Unfortunately, the new thinking he brings to 3BL isn't very good -- and the good thinking isn't very new 
 I had a difficult time with this book. Having ready "Flags of Our Fathers", I had hopes this would be as well written and informitive. However, from early on this book came across as just another piece of "pagan liberal propoganda". The ethnic cleansing of American Indians by the United States was an early warmup of typical pagan propoganda and it headed downhill from there. The pagans liberals have a prospensity to always color whatever the United States does in the worst light and make the atrocities of our enemies to be minor indiscretions. This book is another pagan apologetic for what's wrong with the US and right with all nations who wish us ill. 
 I purchased this book looking for information on specific methods of financing my pre-startup with little of my own money.  I read the book in it's entirety and here is what it is:  A wonderful personal story of winning and losing in business.  It shows that creativity can be used to overcome lack of cash, but gives few useful ideas.  Like I said, it's just a nice story, not a business resource 
 This proves the cynics who say that Groucho was always the funny one to be correct. Not only did I fail to laugh once at his dismal attempt at humour, I also failed to understand what most of the words meant. Avoid 
 This book is the first one you will reach for if it is your first pregnancy. Save your cash and get it from the library. Then read something that expects you to be a thinking woman, not a child taking orders or information without question. If you want to go through pregnancy, labor and birth, and have no say at all or learn anything useful, then stick with this book; i.e., go to the hospital, have an epidural, episiotomy, then finally the c-section that 'must' have been necessary, this is it.   Beyond that, read Ina May Gaskins, Henci Goer, the Sears' books, and "Childbirth Without Fear." Read a broader selection - many of which you can also get from a library or spend a night thumbing through at a bookstore.  I am a mother of 4; have had healthier, more positive birth experiences than anyone I know. This book is misleading and negative.  Make it the joyful event you deserve 
 Let me first say that I am an unlikely reviewer to be so hostile to this type of book; I am extremely committed to healthy food choices, environmentally sound policies, and all the basic values Gary Null ostensibly embraces.  I have no problem with Null's basic premise that we should consume a fresh, non-processed, plant-based diet(although some studies have concluded that those who supplement their food with some fish and dairy products are healthier), buy organic food when at all possible, and avoid toxic household products.  But I am totally outraged by Gary Null's voodoo nutrition approach to these legitimate issues.  I bought the book and promptly returned it because it was so filled with woozy-new age drivel and devoid of reliable references to support the more controversial points.  We don't need any more evidence that a plant-based diet low in trans-fats is healthier than eating at McDonalds.  This book adds NOTHING legitimate to the basic health information you can obtain from any reliable print or internet source, and is far inferior to, for instance, "The Food Pharmacy" by Jean Carper, in which virtually every statement of fact is supported by one or more scientific references.  Save your money and buy some nice fresh organic produce 
 We live in a man's world. Women are raped, abused, beaten and generally regarded as objects for male gratification. This is an epidemic problem, and Christian men are just as great of offenders as the general population.  So here comes another book on male sexuality, for Christian men. The idea is good: rein in the beast. But the major defect, which sinks the book, is the self-centered nature of the remedy.   Christian men are given a toolkit to not look at booty. What we are not given is a concrete understanding of compassion. It's all self-centered. Who cares if the world is just as dangerous for our wives, daughters, and loved ones? At least I'm "sexually pure."   Surely sexual purity includes overthrowing the sexual aggression in society at large? This is a life and death situation. We will be successful according to the goals we set. It is not enough for men to stop lusting. We need to fundamentally change the sexual ethics of our society - ethics that aren't greatly concerned with women's well-being.   If you're only concerned with your own thoughts, this book could be useful. But what about the sense of security for the women in our society, who have to live with sexual aggression, cat-calls and "hey-baby"s? This book sets shamefully low standards for the church's role in reshaping society, even as it sets admirably high standards for individual men's thought-lives 
 I read A is for Alphabet years ago and did not get pulled into the series.  Years later I read S is for Silence and was hooked. I started to read the series--backwards at first and then jumped to the beginning.  I have really enjoyed the books and felt a connection to the heroine (and forgiven Ms. Grafton for making her weigh 118 lbs on her 5'6" frame).  However, I agree with the other readers who feel like this is not Grafton at her best.  You just can't believe that Kinsey would put herself in these ridiculous positions---belting a police officer to endear herself to a woman she is investigating, remaining in an incredibly (and unbelievable) dangerous situation, to name a few.  The dialogue is weak,the sexual situations seem gratutitous, and there is a fair amount of stereotyping of hispanics.  But even with these issues, I did finish the book.  Grafton at her low point is still a good read 
 I am a Lee Child fan and have read all his preceding novels to Echo Burning.  This book never gets off the ground until the last 100 pages.  What a huge disappointment.  Skip this one.  
 Robert A. Heinlein, a leading writer of science fiction, wrote "A handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read: realistic speculation about possible future events, based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world, past and present, and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method."  In Stranger in a Strange Land, we're introduced to a human who has magical powers simply by virtue of being raised on Mars. These powers, as of page 333, are not explained. There is hardly any conflict in story, and the conflicts that are presented are written with little skill or passion. Smith dispatches enemies in the action scenes by making them disappear without effort. During negotiations, Smith's lawyer steamrolls the opposition. Most of the prose is spent on the author's pontification. At this point, I'm cutting my losses and shelving the book. I'm going back to Asimov to read some real SF 
 Marilyn Manson is a very good lyricist. Anyone who listens to him knows that. This album was a good idea about how there are deeper messages in things like willy wonka than our parents would like us to know. Unfortunately, it was a failed attempt. It manages to merit a few good songs like dope hate, get your gun, and lunchbox, but that's about it. The album sounds like a cheap underground metal band, and there's a lot more to them on other albums. IT also seems really cheesy with all the child references. I can't blame it for sucking, because it was thier first album, i just prefer the other albums, especially Holy Wood 
 For many years Crews has been one of my favorite novelists; his personal life is an astonishing example of how endurance can conquer tragedy.  Futhermore, the early '90s books, BODY and THE KNOCKOUT ARTIST had him back  on the track he had cut with the early novels.  Unfortunately, the same can  not be said for this near travesty.  MULCHING, as an idea, has great  promise, but the work reads like a rough draft.  The author wants so badly  for the audience to embrace the bizarre protagonists of this book, that he  sacrifices plot and often sense to accomodate them.  Rather than a scathing  sendup on American business, MULCHING becomes a parody of its own ideas, a  product without substance 
 Is there an option for zero.  The worst I book I have ever read.  He contradicts himself in his points, hoovers over stealing pears (and other evil things) and puts me to sleep.  I don't see how this piece of garbage could make anyone a saint, it should be burned. ZERO STARS 
 If you're not a geologist, forget it, this book is not for you. Apart from some trivia things, like the origin of the word "Dollar", the author goes on and on about aspects on oil that do not necessarily interest non-geologists like me. I was expecting more on the economics and politics behind the oil industry. 
 You'd expect something better from a band like Deep Purple, especially with the great Steve Morse, but alas, this album is no better than anything they put out since "Perfect Strangers". It's OK, but without that spark of originality that defined their earlier work... It's sort of like Genesis and their awful "I Cannot Dance" album. The well has ran dry I guess.. 
 The clappy-happy endorsements of this book are unbelievable shills- like the book itself. Keep looking. There are much better books out there. And no, Heiman doesn't need it, and Tom Hopkins is definately not the pick of the litter 
 I was getting ready to buy this cd when I looked at the song list and realized that only 2 songs are sung by Jane Horrocks.  What's up with that? I agree with Wayne Z. The truly enchanting thing about the movie was Miss  Horrocks wonderful ability to capture the essence of the original songs.  Nothing against the originals, but unless they come out with a  "soundtrack" that includes more of Janes fabulous work, I'll just  keep watching the movie 
 Has the superior writing of Frank McCourt and Roddy Doyle opened the door for anyone to believe their memoirs are worthy of public interest? Dublin Made Me, is at best a watery account of Sheridan's childhood which fails  miserably to grip the reader and maintain interest.  This account is more  appropriate for bedtime anecdotes handed from father to child, than  anything even remotely comparable to the writings of McCourt and other  contemporaries.  If the reader is anticipating the rawness and vigor  associated with the accounts of others who have shown the best and the  worst of Dublin life, then they will be disappointed. A very forgettable  read 
 I've only read about 30 pages, but already I am not satisfied with it. What is this about Jesus somehow being too shy and affected by the labels given to him by those in Nazareth as the reason why He could not perform miracles there? Since when did Jesus become discouraged by what others said of him? I read this book because I am very very chronically shy to the point where I am depressed half the time, but I'm not so gullible as to be pampered by comforting words that are clearly out of line with what I think to be the true meaning of a passage. In other thoughts thus far, I think the author is trying to target too wide an audience, giving it a rather impersonal tone. I will finish it nonetheless, for hope that it bring some advice to me, but truly I think the solution for you and for me comes from a life of prayer and patience and acceptance for who God has made you and believing that He loves you 
 A slow, loggy movie about a philandering husband (everyone was guessing this was Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein in the Nora Ephron novel on which the movie is based; he was Ephron's husband). Jack Nicholson plays the husband and Meryl Streep the wife, and both are uncharacteristically bland. There is hardly anything to the story: they marry, she gets pregnant, he gets restless and wanders. We finish watching knowing and caring as little about all this as when we started. Very dull 
 Give it up folks--the book is on Boston's best-seller list.  It's a waste of time to bash Dan.  He loves getting readers riled up, doesn't care what you think of his writing nor his overlong ride the Curse money train--just as long as you keep his name circulating.  He loves being hated because it means you are paying attention. He truly cannot help that his mean-spirited bitterness about an unhappy personal life seep into his Red Sox coverage.  Just ignore him and he will go away eventually 
 The title is completely misleading.  I purchased this book and software from Broderbund, after reading the reviews posted here at Amazon, believing the book and software would help me covert PDF files that I could not Save or print in its orginal format into ones I could. I can say for sure,in my opinion, the other reviews of this book led me down the "fools primrose path." Perhaps I should have read the reviews more carefully. Of course the fault is entirely mine 
 Why do people care so much what other people think about them?  This book is more of a whine and a moaning lament on what the author imagines other people think about this and that and so-and-so.  I believe a true liberation of spirit would come from simply stating: Who cares what you think 
 The authors skillfully elide several hundred words in the midst of their selection from Thomas Jefferson's "Notes on the State of Virginia" in a fashion that substantially alters the text. Anyone who is determined to use this book as an instructional work would do well to carefully examine the contents before making a final decision 
 So often it seems like an adequate book is well loved just because it appears in an "unusual" genre. If this book was about anything but wizards, it would be considered mildly entertaining, but not much else. I found it neither very intellectually stimulating, nor focused around an incredible plot. Of course, people can like what they like, but I feel like this book was a real let down. 
 I had such anticipation for this latest book from the Cedar Cove series....I was VERY disappointed, so much so that I didn't finish the book which is extremely rare for me.  I love Debbie Macomber as an author.  However, this book spends most of its time split among a huge cast of characters (from previous books...rehashing them into the story).  I love series and I even like to have earlier characters brought into the story of the current book.  However, in this case, it is too much and dilutes the storyline terribly.  Just as you are getting warmed up about a couple, it switches to another storyline....very frustrating....  I don't often write reviews...except when I am terribly disappointed.  Truly, wait and order this used or even get it at your local library....  I look forward to Debbie Macomber's next book as she is a great author....this one was off the mark though.. 
 I bought this book with the hope that it would give inspiration and instructions to create new pieces that include images as well as instructions to embellish existing pieces.  Unfortunately, this book is more focused on how to take Indygo Junction's transfer paper and use it to  embellish pieces.  The patterns to make some of the pieces are conveniently sold by Indygo Junction.  But this is not my major issue with this book.  Given that most of the pieces are created using the same image printing and transfer techniques, there is little reason to have detailed instructions on most of the projects; they use the same transfer techniques for each project, so essentially, you have a book of the same technique being applied to different pieces of clothing! In fact, out of the 40 projects in the book, over half of the projects have you either transfer or print the image onto printable fabric and adhere the image onto the garment.  There are 5 t-shirts that you just adhere images to with only slight embellishment.  I found the projects to be uninspired, even with some very beautiful images involved.  It was a "slap on an image, add a contrasting piece of fabric and some stitching, and you've got art" approach that I found, on a whole, uninspiring.  The projects themselves are a matter of taste--some were nice, others were repetitive (how many t-shirts with appliqued images do you really need to provide detailed instructions for???  One detailed piece, plus a gallery of inspiration would have been better--it would have left room for more project ideas).   To make mattes worse, the instructions are lacking in some of the projects.  For instance, one of the more advanced projects--soldered charms--where the instructions will NOT help a crafter select materials and complete the project.  There is no information on soldering, supplies, techniques, etc.  The assumption is that you'll just figure it out from the soldering iron manufacturer's instructions.  Other projects incorporate unique products, like the Z Becky Brown purses, but the instructions are so simple and provide little inspiration that I wonder why they were included in the first place (the purse instructions simply tell you the sizes are for the panels and instruct you to print out the images from the CD and cut them to fit).    When I first looked at the book, I thought there would be more detail in creating the piece from start to finish; this book is really just a clip art and idea book on how to use the clip art.  For a $30 price tag, I expected much more, and was sorely disappointed.    While the vintage artwork is nice and they make it easy to use (they provide both print versions and images on CD for people with different levels of computer skills--this takes up about 1/2 of the printed pages in the book), the images they supply are for personal use only--you cannot use the images for items you wish to sell commercially (even  for handmade items) unless you're selling the images for a non-profit (e.g. church fund raiser); others will have to license the images from them; that process is unknown, and I'm not sure of the legality of them licensing images they've collected since the images SHOULD be in the public domain for them to collect and publish them.    Overall, I would not recommend this book unless you can get it for a bargain price.  You can look at the cover page and pretty much make up your own piece based upon the cover rather than spending $20 or $30 looking at more of the same inside.  As an alternative, I'd recommend Rice Freeman-Zachery's book, "New Techniques for Wearable Art"--a much more forward thinking, inspirational and creative book 
 Well, I did considerable research for comparable low-budget microphones.  I have a 3-chip Panasonic consumer video camera and I'm interested in producing documentaries, shorts and travel videos.  My goal was to enhance the audio that came standard with my PV GS300 when filming and capturing both near and far-range audio.  I performed a few mic. tests to create a standard for evaluation.  I filmed six scenes.  3 scenes at close-range with these 3 mics, and 3 scenes at long-range using these 3 different mics.  I used iMovie to import my recordings to evaluate the audio.   For this review I tested my on-board stock mic., a Radioshack lavaliere mic. and the Audio Technica mic.  My results are as follows:  I. Out-of-the-box standard mic.: Performs with mediocre results, less than desired by Current.tv standards.  The recorded audio has a slight echo/ reverberation, it performs like a stock mic. is expected to perform and produces a somewhat muffled sound.    II. Audio Technica Mic.: Disappointing sound quality.  For $53 I expected this mic. to improve upon my equipment's stock microphone; it did not.  The regular setting was just as loud and clear as the stock mic.  The upside is that it had slightly less of an echo than the stock mic. but it also delivered a softer audio recording.  The Tele setting essentially acted as a volume increase; the subject was louder, but so were ambient noises.  Overall it was difficult to distinguish between this mic. and the on-board mic.; and certainly not worth the extra duckets.  III. Radioshack lavaliere mic: The audio was significantly enhanced.  When interviewing a subject sitting 3 feet away the recording of both my questions and the subject's answers were louder and clearer.  Down-side : this mic. is less convenient because it requires attaching a corded microphone to the subject's lapel.  There are ways around this like a wireless receiver but what is gained in audio might be lost by creating technical intricacies with your subject.  Don't forget to switch the mic. on; this one also requires a stereo adapter.  I was hoping this Audio Technica mic. would provide an increase in performance worth the additional cost.  The lesson I learned is that it is all or nothing.  Shell out $200 for a pro/pro-sumer grade mic. or get by with what you have.   You can improve your situation with a lav. mic. but so far I have not discovered a budget shotgun mic 
 This is the worst shark film i've ever seen. All of the shark attacks in the movie are done with shark fodage. And all of the shark fodage is outa all the Shark Attack films. The directer should be ashamed of himself. And one more thing,the sharks growl just like in Shark Attack 2&3. Do not buy this movie at all! 
 I have used NEC and Samsung laser printers in the past, but the writeups on this Brother printer attracted me.  My experience after just a month of use is awful:  the print quality is mediocre (seeming very gray in comparison with past printers), and the print drum appears to have failed, leaving streaks of print gaps on the page.  
 I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled "This is a racist book disguised as a work of art."  It seems that I didn't explain well enough my objection to Styron's co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, "The Confessions of Nat Turner," by T.R. Gray.  Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.    Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married.  Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional.  So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt.  In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.  Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction?  Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented.  Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die.  That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause.  What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero.  Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.  If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of "Confessions."  But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia.  Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself.  His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching 
      Bill O'Reilly has a good reason for his massive paranoia:  Somewhere, deep in the recesses of his brain, he knows something's wrong.  Only he's got it backwards:  The "secular progressives" are doing just fine, but he's the one with the serious problem.  Here's a guy who had to pay millions of bucks to settle a sexual harassment suit; yet, he's proclaiming himself the arbiter of the correct, "traditional" point of view.  Only in an era of the stupid, undereducated and witless would Bill O'Reilly have a modest role to play.  Save your money 
 The first Crow Film, including plot, eventually evolved from Brandon Lee's death.  The first film was going to include the Skull Cowboy from the Comic.  The Power of the crow could not be stolen from him by hurting the bird.  This is a Testimate to how all of the films after the first have failed.  This film and 2-3 tried to build on a story line that was never supposed to be and should not have been.  As seen by their success.  The movie The Crow was amazing, and made so by Brandon's performance along with his supporting cast.  I admit some of the scenes filmed after his death were cheesey, and that the actors did not seem, AT ALL, very thrilled to do them.  All of that a side.  You can't build on the accident that made the first film.  They should have starting with Part 2, tried to stick with the original story, and maybe, just maybe, they could have made the wrong this right 
 If you take out all the name-dropping and pointless anecdotes, there isn't much left to this book. What little advice it contains on the subject of succeeding as an artist seems to fall under the heading of common sense. (If you want to be a famous artist, move to New York, go to lots of galleries, talk to lots of people. It helps to look nice, and dating a famous artist doesn't hurt either. Do we really need an expert to tell us these things?) What little practical advice there is on subjects like having slides made of your work or sending out press releases is so general that it is of little use. These subjects are covered much better in lots of other books, Art Marketing 101 by Constance Smith and How to Survive and Prosper as an Artist by Caroll Michels to name a  couple. One bit of advice from the author made me laugh out loud. She stresses the importance of proofreading a press release before you send it out (good idea!), yet it is obvious that this book was not proofread. There are so many typographical, spelling, and/or grammatical errors that at times I felt as if I were grading a high school term paper 
 This would have been a good skit, or maybe a short story, but not an entire novel.  The book is tired like the town Wigfield 
 I really expected better from Roger Stevens. In the past he has written some truly excellent books on computer graphics that included working code. This particular book is very elementary with only the bare bones of the mathematics of fractals being given. Most of the book just shows a picture of each type of fractal covered, a screenshot of the included application and what you should type into the application to get the resulting fractal, and some text without equations on each fractal. If you really want to learn the mathematics behind fractals you should read "Chaos and Fractals" by Peitgen, and the older "Science of Fractal Images" by the same author. Both books are accessible yet go into sufficient mathematic detail that you could write working code. The authors even offer up code examples of their own. The second book I mentioned on fractal imaging has some great code samples and mathematics for creating beautiful realistic natural scenes of forests and lakes that are completely computer generated. I notice Amazon does not show the table of contents so I do that here: 1.  Introduction 2.  What are Fractals? 3.  The Lorenz and Other Strange Attractors 4.  What you can do with L-System Fractals 5.  The Snow Flake and other Von Koch Curves 6.  Peano Curve 7.  Generators with Different Sized Line Segments 8.  The Hilbert Curve 9.  FASS Curves 10. Trees 11. Creating your own L-System Fractals 12. Newton's Method 13. What you can do with Mandelbrot-Like and Julia-Like Fractals 14. The Mandelbrot and Julia Sets 15. Working With Colors 16. Fractals with the Logistic Equation 17. Fractals using Transcendental Functions 18. Fractals using Orthogonal Polynomials 19. Creating your own 2nd-order to 7th-order Equations 20. Phoenix Curves 21. The Mandela and Pokorny Fractals 22. Fractals Using Circles 23. Barnsley Fractals 24. Iterated Function Systems 25. Midpoint Displacement Fractal 
 I honestly do not understand what all the hype is about.  I forced myself to read this book because all I had ever heard was how it was one of the best and most influential pieces of modern literature, but eight hours a day of manual labor would be a less tiresome task then trudging through this pile of rubbish. In all honesty, the plot is entertaining, if you can find it.  I am sure the Cliffs Notes of the LOTR are interesting and entertaining, but why anyone would want to torture themselves reading this collection is beyond me.   I read one chapter a night until I was done, and that was too grueling a task.  I constantly found my mind wondering and having to reread every page because it could not hold my attention.   You don't have to believe the hype.  This collection of books is really, really terrible and boring, and I wouldn't wish the task of reading in on my worst enemy 
 This book is tedious, plodding, repetitive, themeless.  I never could really understand what its thesis was, or what the recitation of sketches of various Biblical figures was supposed to demonstrate.  This is a fascinating subject, but this book turns it into boredom.  I could not finish it 
 I read Apex Hides the Hurt after hearing part of an interview with the author on NPR.  Perhaps if I'd heard the entire interview I would have known better.  The field of nomenclaure consultancy sounds intriguing and a good premise to explore how we are influenced by names of products and places.  However, the protagonist is an un-named and un-likeable character.  His musings do not lead to any enlightening insights, even though the author may think they do.  This book's writing is very contrived.  I consider this book self-centered and disappointing 
 This book is an interesting combination of fairly good writing and fairly poor science. The information on which the author draws is taken out of its context, so while his conclusions have an internal logic, that logic is far-fetched and has almost no bearing on the rest of the world. But the author's writing is good enough to keep this from being self-evident. I found the book an easy but worthless read 
 I was disappointed in how small this book was, and that on every other page it was selling other books or even T-shirts!   I think it could have been a lot better.  The one chapter in The Girlfriend's Guide to the  Toddler Years that deals with bringing another baby into the house was more  insightful than this entire book 
    So the creators of this show paid a lot of money to various record companies to feature songs on the TV show soundtrack and hardly if ever used new music that they themselves would compose or not.   It is really product placement of the worst kind.  Be lazy and let other recording artists do the work for you, considering that this stupid show was made the way it was, it was not surpiseing that they reverted to this just to save money 
 This is a great read that will have you lol and thinking at the same time. The writer is talented and gifted and can turn a phrase as fast as you want to turn the page. Perspective, compassion and curiosity are operative words in this outstanding work. I can only imagine one of the Wilson brothers playing the writer in the flick. Don't let the title scare you off as once you get into it you will have made a deposit that will reap you interest 
 What does Mr. Riley have against bunnies?  I read this book in the bookstore and found it disturbing. The truth is bunnies don't contemplate suicide but sick people contemplate killing helpless animals. Perhaps thats where the ideas stem in this book. I'm asking the bookstore to remove this book from its shelves. It is a sick and cruel attempt at humor. It belongs in the same wastebasket as the "roadkill" candy. 
 This book is full of editorial errors and the Boston Globe should be embarrassed that they ever printed it.  We waited 86 years for a championship. The Boston Globe could have spent a few more days to get the book out without these glaring mistakes.  Here are a few that I found in less than 10 minutes.  1. Box score for game 1 of World Series is incorrect.  RBI category is wrong.  2. Line score at top of page shows St. Louis scoring 4 runs in top of 9th inning.  (Good thing that did not really happen)  3. Page 22:  Text on left of page that describes picture is incomplete sentence.  4. Box score for game 2 of World Series is wrong.  They actually printed the box score for game 3.  Box score from game 2 is missing.  (Game 3 box score is listed twice in the book)  It's like Curt Schilling never pitched!  5. Box score for game 4 shows Arroyo giving up an earned run.  Hard to give up an earned run in a game that was 3-0.  6. Box score for game 5 of ALCS shows New York against Anaheim.  How bad is that?  Can't even get the teams right.  Pretty sure the Red Sox played in that game.  (I went to it!)  I contacted the Boston Globe and the editor (James Reid Laymance) directly to inform them of the errors.   It has been nearly a month now and I have not been contacted.  Do not buy this book!!  As a historical keepsake these errors greatly diminish its value. 
 Graves goes on about scaring the student with such phrases as "plunging immediatley into frantic production of your own thing."  The entire book is a number tricks. I don't object to "tricks" if the ends result in  a good drawing. The first rule of art is ; there no rules. I agree with many of Graves' didactic, time tested academic step by step progress. However what I see here is not unlike many of the popular TV how to draw/paint....Like ME. In fact Graves' drawings are rather poor. His concepts about tone and form are sound. My fear is that is that want of the student to advance in there truest of artforms; the charcoal drawing. It is the purest of all medium. The art of drawing is the most important vehicle to which the artist can move on to painting, printmaking etc.; not that that is even important. A good drawing can stand alone and equal to any painting. If you really wish to draw well I would suggest "The Natural way to Draw" which is also very exercize driven and only people who truly want to draw well will follow this regimine. Nicholides does not present his own work as an example of how to draw; but rather chooses to present and challenge the student to work and work hard. I believe this a better way in which to convey the principles of draughtsmanship. 
 There are a lot of songs on this CD that I don't remember & don't really care for.  However, the sound quality is good.  Take the time to listen to all the samples before buying 
 This is a book on improvisational cooking only inasmuch as Schneider's own improvisations. If you, like me, bought this book thinking that it would provide the basis for your own improvisations, you'll be disappointed. Schneider 15-odd pages on mixing flavors will only enlighten if you haven't figured out by now that ginger mixes well with oriental dishes, that thyme goes well with poultry, and that salt and pepper are seasoning staples. What follows after these no-brainers is a typical recipe book with Schneider's own "improvisations."  Her recipes look interesting, but this is not at all the book that the title would seem to imply.  For much deeper and helpful insights into improvisational cooking, pick up instead Shirley Corriher's Cookwise 
 I bought this book based on the reviews on this website having never seen it first hand.  While I think it is a cute story, my 18 month old book lover didn't take to it.  It's the last of his picks during reading hour 
 We got Jason in space and we get Pinhead in space.  This is pure nonsense.  Words of wisdom to the makers of these sequels: when you start putting horror movie villains in space to kill people, it's time to stop making these movies! 
 In all honesty, this film is taking the mickey when it comes to the issue of egalitarianism in the armed forces.  This is an issue that is very close to me as I have Asperger's syndrome (a condition on the autistic spectrum) and was rejected by the Army on account of this.  However, I passed my Potential Officers Course yesterday, which is the first examination you have to do in order to gain entry to the Royal Marines.  If an amputee were to try and become a Royal Marine Commando, I would think he was taking the mickey.  This film serves to make a mockery of the issue of equal opportunities 
 I am getting rid of this book. I followed the recipes exactly but got very poor results. The eclair batter was too thin--the eclairs were flat and impossible to fill. The pastry cream recipe should be called "pastry sauce"--also thin, never set up. The almond paste pound cake recipe fell. The white cake recipe had a very nice texture but shrinks a great deal as it cools. Overall I was very disappointed with this book. It gave me the worst results of any cookbook I have tried in recent memory 
 To the point; The plot is boring, the herione is boring, the storyline and characters are not believable. Total waste of money. And a disgrace to a wonderful piece of american liturature. I am willing to read a parody, spin off, or background story based off of Mitchell's GWTW. However, Ms. Randal did a poor job and wasted good paper on this flop. She could have made this story MUCH better.  
 I hate to say this since Philosophy is one of my favorite brands, but this is probably the worst mascara I have ever used. It clumps really badly and is very difficult to remove. It does not simply wash off, it forms little rubbery strings that end up all over your face and the bathroom sink. About half of them remain attached to your lashes, and I've pulled so many of mine out just trying to remove the mascara. Everything else I've ever tried from Philosophy was fantastic, but the best mascara out there, hands down, is from Lancome 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 This is probably the worst war related movie I've ever seen. I am particularly incensed by several actors who are featured as being in the film are present for as little as a single minute or two. Time spent watching this film is time you'll never get back and have nothing to show for it 
 i too was greatly disappointed with this book, i feel it fell far short of the standards set by her other writings, of which i have read most. neither did i appreciate the swear words contained in this book. don't buy i 
 This shouldn't even be considered a baseball movie!  That is like calling M. Night Shamalan's "Signs" a baseball movie because the one guy played baseball.  Not worth it at all 
 This is the first book I've not been able to put down - not because it was so riveting, but because I couldn't wait to be done with it. It reads like a grocery list of domestic issues that might be intriguing for an adolescent or, perhaps, for someone who has never left their small town and dreams of the dramas that they assume lie in the big city. The themes, problems and experiences of the Stassos family are so completely generic that, should the book be interpreted into any visual form, it would take the shape of the most heavy-handed after-school special ever made!  And as for the "poetic" prose that is attributed to this novel: the use of language is over-the-top and often pretencious. Many experiences are not simply stated, but are rather coated with words that only add weight rather than description or meaning.   One example that I underlined: "'I'm always careful,' Ben said, in exactly the spirit he would toss a too-small offering -- a hibiscus blossom, a pomegranate -- into a crater." WHAT?!!!  Granted, the context is missing, but even in the context, this quote made me laugh. And by the time i came to the last third of book, the laughter was all that got me though to the end (that, and the fact that I had to finish it because I told someone that I would.)  If I could give this book less than one star, I would.  
 Geeze this DVD sucks, maybe if you smoke your socks before you watch it your mind will wander to a more interesting place 
 This book was obviously not written from experience. Minnery pretends to be an expert, but falls way short and even shorter as an author. I've read non-fiction accounts that have far more useful information in a few  paragraphs than this whole book has. A real disappointment, don't waste  your money or time 
 First, this piece of trash is based on The Journey To The West about as much as Raiders of the Lost Ark is based on the Bible. There are some characters common to both Lost Empire and Journey. Well, common in name. That said let's get to the real problem with this film. It is astoundingly insulting to Chinese religious traditions. Imagine for a moment some non-Christian producing a film in which: the God Jehova no longer cares what happens to humanity and just gives us over to Satan; Jesus gives up on that sacrifice stuff and is now focused purely on the personal acquisition of wealth and power; and the Virgin Mary comes to earth for a hot night at the singles bars. Sound offensive? It is. And this film is equally insulting to Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism (the three big ones in China). Confucius, a man revered these past 2500 years for his uncompromising moral standards appears in Lost Empire as a lecherous,traitorous,lying,cowardly weasel. The Jade Emperor,Taoism's chief God, is shown as a despondent,apathetic slob who no longer cares about the earthly or celestial realms. Kuan Yin, one of the Bodhisattvas, is shown in Lost Empire falling in romantic and physical love with a man. That is as likely as the Virgin Mary turning tricks on a street corner. If some religious bigot wanted to disguise a piece of anti-Chinese propaganda as a clever adventure-fantasy they could not easily do better than The Lost Empire. It makes me wonder if the insult was intended. 
 Anyone who can say, on page 6, that a man whose mother's death when he is 10 days old causes him to "suffer from a devastating loss and its concomitant anger" is more a cliched than a clear thinker 
 I could not sit through this movie. The acting and screenplay are terrible. This film could be described as a bad made-for-tv movie at best.   I ended up fast-forwarding though the entire movie after the first 30 minutes and turned the player off before I reached the end. I couldn't take it anymore. This movie is one of the worst I've attempted to watch in a long time.    Not recommended.  
 I am 15 years old and was required to read this book as summer reading for my school. Let me just say that this is the most punishingly boring book I have ever opened. I say opened because I just could not finish it. I was doing fine until I reached his section about the future of computers. I had to skip the entire section...about 50 pages or so. It, along with almost every other section of the book is impossible to understand, at least for a 15 year old. After that, the book just kept going downhill, and I gave up. This book is not interesting in the least. Avoid at all costs 
 This book, although beautifully written, did not make sense.  I was intrigued by the characters yet finished the book not understanding their motivations.  I would have liked to know more about the narrator, Susan, and her life immediately after the fatal accident.  Instead I felt like I was thrown into the middle of a story, with big gaps missing throughout. Perhaps some skillful editing would have made this more of a complete tale 
 This book is dangerous and filled very bad, dangerous advice. It was written in 1998, so giving the benefit of the doubt, perhaps our thinking about homing a rescue dog has evolved, but this book is extremely outdated.  It recommends using the dog's crate as a place for punishment -which we all know is wrong. It further recommends "pops" with the leash to jerk your dog into obedience and "staring down" a dog into submission -again, outdated, inappropriate concepts. It is a very high level, superficial, quick read riddled with inappropriate advice that certainly does not speak to how one goes about brining a new, most likely scared, rescue dog into your home. 
 Simplistic doesn't begin to capture the wisdom herein expresse 
 This is a book that has no reason to be.   The author appears to have two primary objectives, viz.,to exhibit how clever he is and, secondly,how awful a man and writer Orwell was.  The author is not clever;he is repetitious and snide in a schoolboy boastful manner. He is incredibly careless as a writer and editor, appears ignorant of basic grammar and rules of punctuation and mistakes coyness for principle.The reader may open the book at random for examples of these failures.  His knowledge of history one may measure by his statement that Chamberlin flew to Berlin in 1938. Again, the curious reader can find errors of this sort almost at random. Just open the book--if you must.  The more serious criticism of the book is that it is entirely a tendentious assassination of reputation. The argument of the book the author recapitulates in a chapter three quaters through, entitled "The Case Against".This apparently is for the slow learners who may have missed Taylor's derogatory points liberally supplied throughout the previous three hundred pages. In two pages and a paragraph, the author releases the proverbial cat;one understands why this text appears so late in the book. Had the author a proper sense of honest intellectual protocal, he would have announced in an introduction his purpose. So silly this is,no reader would have bothered with the book.  A  ploy Taylor favors is to  set forth alternative and always invidious explanations for Orwell's words and actions.If no one is at hand to quote, Taylor sets up a straw dog built from his own ever so sensitive reading, and precedes to demolish it.He makes no attempt at balance.He is utterly unpersuasive because he works so hard at being so unfair. As a deflator, he lacks subtley. One can imagine how little Orwell would have respected Taylor and how little he would have cared.   This is a mean spirited, unconvincing, and finally, unnecessary production.  The reader caring to read about Orwell has many fine alternatives, not the least meritorious of which is the Bowker life, published the same year as Taylor's spam of a study. 
 I couldn't finish this book after readng "Fairytale."  Misfit insecure Caucasian male falls for Asian stripper/prostitute after she listens to him talk about the odor of his sweat in the outdoor markets.  I thought possibly this story reveals a lot about Olen Butler.  He wrote about this relationship with such relish, he sounds to me like a P.C. Caucasian who is drawn in patronizing fashion to the "otherness" of Asian people and doesn't see them for what they are, just wants them to appreciate big strong white man.  I thought it interesting that in the story the woman never mentions to the man that she already has a young son living with her mother.  So she was not honest with him.  But Olen Butler wrote about her as if this stripper/pros. was wonderful, the kind of wife any man would want.  I shook my head and thought, "You have issues."  Probably if she were Caucasian he would not want to get near her for fear of catching something.  After this the other stories just did not appeal to me 
 Almost every recipe calls for browning meat in a skillet prior to adding it to a crockpot.  When coupled with the warning not to store partially cooked meat in the fridge, one wonders who the book is for.  If you have time in the morning to stand at the stove in a business suit and brown a pot roast prior to running to the office, these recipes will work for you.  But if you are looking for quick cooking recipes, you will be disappointed by this boo 
 A friend assured me that Pillars of Creation was the only stinker in this series to date. He was wrong. This is - by far - the worst book I've read up to this point.  A trilogy's first book isn't always the best. You lay out the rules, and set up the conflict. That's the way it goes. But the fact of the matter is that setting up the rules - and the conflict - didn't need to stretch on for 600+ paperback pages. Man, what a tedious book this was; if Richard wasn't reiterating his frustration in monologue, he was beating the same old dead horse with various characters.  I have a bachelor's degree in philosophy, and hadn't really taken issue with Mr. Goodkind's thinking until this book. Zedd's ramblings regarding contradiction and faith are ridiculously juvenile, and Goodkind did a startlingly wonderful job of making a wise character turn in to a stupid fool.  Here's to hoping Phantom isn't this burdensome.   
 Total let-down. Hannibal Lecter doesn't even appear once. I really expected more from the interim novel between "Black Sunday" and "Red Dragon." There's none of the thrill or suspense that made Harris famous, instead it reads like a '70s pop psychology manual. Skip this one, read his later novels instead 
 4 String's first album "Believe" has many great moments - well worth the purchase. I have to agree with the other 2 reviews though that this album is rather disappointing. To point out a few worthwhile listens here: "Until You Love Me" recalls the great feel of "Believe", and the single "Turn it Around" is good as well. "Free" is also not bad... You can find "Turn it Around" on collections by Ultra, so I'd recommend buying those before you purchase this album 
 Some of these reviews are great.  Some are hilarious and show just how little each gender understands about the other.  My favorite review is the one that says something like "Women have more to offer than at any other time: they're better educated, they make more money, and they're more fun to be with than ever before!"  I'd love to see the statistical research backing up that last assertion.  Anyway, about the book.  Truly, all the content could have been packed into one essay.  The rest is just filler anecdotes that contribute little understanding but for some reason make up the vast majority of these types of books.  Probably because they're really not a whole lot to say on the topic.  My own experience runs something along the lines of the book.  I'm in law school and I've noticed that an extremely high number of law school women are very, very pretty yet have lots of trouble getting men interested in them.  Looking around, it's because these women are *extremely masculine.*  They have nice faces and bodies, sure, but to be a lawyer (or other professional) one must be directed, unemotional, focused, hard working, serious, outspoken and aggressive.  These are all traits that testosterone produces!  And it's true, the women in law school are far more like female men than anything else.  I'm dating a couple women who have no college degree but who are very feminine and soft and gentle, the complete opposites of law school women.  Most of the guys I know in law school are doing the exact same thing.  Therefore I think that these women are having a hard time finding men simply because men see them as other men, not as women!  Several of the women I know in law school are dating or have married rather effeminate men: artists, a whale trainer, etc.  These are not the types of men who are the "Alpha males" of the business world.  The more Alpha a male is, the more he wants someone who is his complete opposite: soft, gentle, giving, unassuming, submissive.. a girly girl.  The women mentioned in this book aren't girly girls, they're man-girls.  Who wants that?   
 If you want the original recordings, don't purchase any volume of Television's Greatest Hits.  I've had better luck recording the songs off of my TV with a cassette tape recorder and then dehissing them on my PC.  These collections have sterile sounding fake stereo recordings of "The Beverly Hillbillies" and "The Munsters" that just don't sound right to me.  If the original recordings don't matter to you, then you may like this CD 
 Horror movies are a dime a dozen now, and nothing really speical about them anymore. Sad to say, considering its probably my faviorte genere. This movie was a disappointment from the start. Whoever did editing on this movie needs to be fired. I mean they are standing there talking, and it just cuts away when you think something is going to happen. I didnt watch the whole movie, it sucked that bad. I bought this movie used, and I'd gladly give it back to the owner free of charge. 
 I was so excited when I got this book. I love stories about Presidents. However, everything in this book I had read somehwere else. Same old boring stuff. No new pictures. Basically, I thought it was awful 
 Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.  The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the "dark people" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.  Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled 
 Life is too short to be spent reading drivel.  Stuart Woods was really off the mark with this book.  You shouldn't rest on your laurels Mr. Woods, your audience deserves better.  I've enjoyed your past books very much, but this one left a lot to be desired.  I was very put off by Stone Barrington's bed-hopping activities in this story.  With Arrington (mother of his son) one night, then with Holly the next, I don't recall him being quite that indescriminate in other books.  The plot was relly silly and contrived, it must have been that the publisher was pressing for a story, never mind quality.  Don't waste your money on this one 
 Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him 
 A disappointing book from the author of the excellent book "The Moorchild", but not out of character for the times when it was originally published (1952). The main character is torn between his white side (responsible, hardworking) and his Indian side (inconsiderate, untrustworthy). You have to wonder why the publisher dredged this nauseating racist garbage up in 1986. Don't buy this poison for your kids. For more information on just how little credit Indians are given for anything and why, see Jack Weatherford's "Indian Givers" and Eqbal Ahmad's "Confronting Empire". 
 Out of the sheer horror that someone recommended this book over Baugh and Cable's A History of the English Language and several other wonderful histories available, I find myself writing my first review.  I was unlucky enough to have this book as an undergrad a number of years ago, and along with a general dislike of it that I've always carried, I specifically remember that the exercises were impenetrable.  Now that I am getting a PhD in the history of the English language, I can safely say that I am achieving this goal despite this book.  It is adequate in some ways but nowhere near as good as some of the other options.  The only real bonus I can see is that the price is good 
 After listening, with some frequency, to the "Shaman" album, I noticed this song popping up on the radio-waves.  Instead of the growling, slightly-angsty version sung by Nickelback's frontman, we get this smoothed-over, watery version that is much more radio-friendly, and is much less appealing 
 The writing was eloquent with a entertaining mix of sarcasim. The history lessons were appreciated.  Most readers that chose to purchase this book know that the overuse of debt by the US is a long term problem/concern for the world.  Buying gold to address these concerns is not constructive nor sensitve to the dynamics of world economics.  I read this recommendation in 1980 by other sensational writers and would have endured miserable inflation adjusted performance if I had bought gold.  Even at $1000/oz.in 2006, I would not have realized the performance of the S&P or the Euro equivalent.    Economics is a dynamic dismal science that has an ebb and flow.  The US in not alone in its deficit spending practices.  I wanted a better feel for the international dynamics of negative balance of payments; to understand how the deficit spending of most nations impacts the long term value of $US.    I guess I bought the wrong book.  But still appreciated the writer's sense of humor 
 The move is one of my favorite sci-fi films but this is the worst job of trasferring to DVD that I have seen. There are no special features and NO CHAPTER STOPS, this is as if they copied a video tape to a DVD. I could accecpt it being full frame but if I had known that it was this cheap a transfer I would not have purchased it 
  Alas, I only made it to page 157 so perhaps I shouldn't even be allowed to comment but I was so tired of the wishy washy main character who could rain so much misery on her own life I couldn't go on another page. I loved Rule of the Bone, it's one of my favorite books but this one left me cold. 
 I'm dog-obsessed and was looking for a cool dog calendar for 2007... I love M.E. but I could not find a good description - or preview of what was actually in this calendar. I think the title is misleading in that A Year with ME - could mean a year with MARY ENGELBRIET -- not "me". And You Lucky Dog! - like she's holding on the cover might mean the calendar is filled with adorable lucky dogs. It's not. It's cute, but not what I was looking for.. the search continues - can't find a cute illustrated DOG calendar 
 My partner and I bought this book in hopes that it would be a good read for our daughter in the future (she turned 8 months old today!). From what we've read of this book so far all of these stories are from children who were born into heterosexual families  with one parent coming out, whereas our daughter was conceived, born and raised with two mommies. Since the stories are all from kids who have a gay or lesbian parent our daughter will, at least, have that in common 
 I found the dvd boring. The visuals were the same kaleidoscope over and over. The title of the dvd has nothing to do with the content.I didn't find any exotic robotics in it. This dvd you will view once then put it away. Actually you may not want to watch it even once. I don't recommend purchasing this unless you are a hardcore trance listener. The trance music is ok but the visuals are hard to watch after a few minutes 
 I'm a beginning db student, and this book is bad. Really bad. I'll just pick a few words that describe my experience with it: verbose, awkward, vague, anguishing...  Mine is now filled with handwritten corrections that our professor helped us add (I can't believe how many typos slipped through editing). Our whole class pretty much agrees that this book still needs some serious work before it could be considered publishing material. The university department chose this book based on Kroenke's excellent teaching and database reputation. However, it seems that he really has no idea of how to put together a good book. Something criticized in other reviews is the text's layout. I agree--it's horrendous. You are often reading about a diagram two pages back, or one page ahead. In fact, I'd say that, more often than not, when the illustrations are referenced, it is on a totally separate page. (Did that make sense?) Example: "Figure 4-5a shows how......." So you'll have to flip two pages back to see the illustration. Ugh! I normally love learning, but I really have to force myself to trudge through this drivel 
 First of all, the recipes in this book are NOT especially "quick and easy, so you can spend more time on the beach."  Most of them looked pretty time-consuming to me.  Secondly, they're all recipes that you probably already have:  Gazpacho, grilled shrimp, lobster rolls, mango salsa, pasta salads with chicken, lemon-glazed poundcake with berries, apple crisp...  I have to confess that I didn't try any of them (because nothing seemed the slightest bit new or original).  The recipes may work fine for all I know -- but I think that if you already have cookbooks like Barefoot Contessa, Silver Palate or any of the other classics, you really don't need this one 
 One of these days the YA publishers will stop using actual YA writers for their tomes. Sure, the young adults are the same age as the readers, but that means nothing when character development and insight are sacrificed.  This book is about a nerd creepy loser whose given a nanocomputer to train him to be cool. So he becomes a jackass creepy loser. Most of the supporting characters are types and the non-teenage characters are either boring or ridiculous. There's even some homophobia thrown in as the English teacher swishes every which way saying MAAAAAAAAAA (I'm not sure what that means either).   While the book centers on the narrator's attempt to go out with a girl in his drama club, you never get why he likes her. In fact, she never seems to be a coherent human being. Almost every time she's in the narrative she's doing something off-kilter that makes no sense to anyone. The only reason why you sympathize with her is because she's got to deal with this jerk, and even then you really wish she'd just put a restraining order on him.  While there are moments of insight, where the author and the narrator come up against the fact that they aren't the only people in the world with problems, they are few and far between.  Overall, this is a horrible book with horrible characters and lousy plotting. The only good thing that you can say for the book is that it's not half as irritating as the audio CD 
 I bought this CD because it got a lot of good reviews, and the description sounded like something I would enjoy. However, it turned out to be an atrocious CD. It is very repetitive and monotonous throughout. The songs pretty much all sound the same. There's little melodic variation, and the vocals have basically no range. The lyrics are extremely uninspired. I'm glad I bought this used at a cheap price. I don't know if I'm going to give it away or just throw it away; it's that bad. 
 I had never read anything by Terry Brooks, so I thought I would try listening to Armageddon's Children because I thought the premise sounded interesting. I guess the story is interesting, but I found it extremely slow and boring. The narrator has a dreary boring voice that drove me crazy. I couldn't even finish listening to the whole thing because it became torture 
 As with most books, this has a novelty concept, that of a man living in a Nazi superstate had the power been semi-victorious in World War II (and, he carefully notes, it was only a few bad decisions away from being thus). The historical research is beautiful, but the characters are alarmingly obvious and the mystery, muddled, goes so much nowhere. The obvious comparison is to Orwell's "1984," yet this is even more mundane; these characters make lip service to desiring freedom or democracy or whatever, but their actual motivation seems to be self-interest and the restless pursuit of a good life their neurotic minds will not allow them. Worthy for a historical read, boring as a mystery 
 It was apparent upon immediate receipt that this pillow was not a typical king-sized pillow and was only two inches larger than the standard memory foam contour pillow I already own.  As noted in the other comment, the odor was extremely strong.  Though I have not owned this pillow for very long, I made numerous attempts to "air out" this pillow, and the odor remains very strong.    In addition, this is the firmest memory foam pillow I have ever experienced.  I'm hoping with time that it will soften, because it certainly can not be used for sleeping in its current state.  
 "Journey to the Land of No" is a first-person memoir of a Jewish girl growing up in Iran during the Revolution.  The book describes what her life and the life of her family was like before and after this cataclysmic event.  Having developed an unaccountable interest in the Iranian Revolution during the past year, I have read perhaps a dozen books about this subject.  Hakakian's book, while not bad, would have to be toward the bottom of the list of books you should read about this subject.  It just didn't grab me.  And certainly there has been no shortage of books written by women who lived in Iran during the Revolution and have since escaped.  But if you're only going to read one or two, there is much better fare out there.  "Reading Lolita in Tehran" is searing and unforgettable, and the graphic novel "Persepolis" is simply excoriating.  This latter would be at the top of said list.  Yeah, the competition is pretty stiff these days.  The bar for writing an "I'm an Iranian exile and here's why"-type book has been set incredibly high by so much good stuff out there now, and Hakakian's effort doesn't quite measure up.  Anyhow.  Compared to harrowing books like those, Hakakian's story is -- dare I say it? -- ho-hum.  Occasionally it is tenderly written, but I left the book feeling that she had little to say, and because, at least compared to other authors writing about the same subject, little remarkable happened to her.  What is most regrettable about the book, I suppose, is that Hakakian's Jewishness is almost incidental to her tale.  This is sad.  She certainly mentions that she was Jewish, and this does form the cornerstone for a few events in the story, but basically what happens to her and her family could have happened to pretty much any Iranian during that time.  And this is regrettable because the Jewish angle was the one really original thing this book had going for it.  And the author, I must aver, failed to really explore it or make it come alive.  In fact, so forgettable is the whole outing that, a few weeks after having read this book, I am unable to recall a single incident from it 
 This product almost had me going to the ER. I felt a little flush so I used this monitor to check my blood pressure. It was 151/98. A second check showed 148/100. I then really started feeling flush as a wave of burning flushed my body. My wife an RN said calm down, breath deeply. I went over to my Rottweiler and started hugging and petting her. After about 10 min. I felt the flushness go away but the blood pressure showed 162/99. I made a Dr's appointment and brought the machine with me. In his office where my pressure always is elevated when he 1st takes it, I used the machine in front of him and my pressure was 153/107. I really got nervous. He took it with his machine and it was 140/82. You won't believe the relief. He took it again with another machine and it had come down to 135/80. I'd like to return the machine for a non-digital one. I've seen this before with a digital machine from a different company 
 Most of Time Lord should have been about Sir Sandford Fleming, about how he grew up, about why he left home (Scotland) and crossed the ocean to a new land (Canada), his trials and tribulations, the events of his life, great and small, that shaped this great but mostly forgotten man. Then after three or four hundred pages of this, an author can permit himself to give his personal views in a few pages.  Instead of doing this, Clark Blaise reverses the precepts and gives us 200 pages of his Views on Time and how Deep the Concept is. He gives us a mishmash of poetry and literature and badly thought out espresso philosophy. Nothing about Fleming. I would have loved a day-by-day account of the Prime Meridian conference, or of Fleming's days as chief engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railroad. No such luck.   After finishing the book, I went to the shortish wikipedia entry on Fleming and found more facts there than in Blaise's book. Until someone writes a better book, that might be the best thing to do.

 Well, my wife and I tried this diet plan, and lost a little, BUT... CON: some of the ingredients and just a marketing ploy. CON: It makes no mention of what to do if you're lactose intolerant. CON: How do you thicken a sauce without cornstarch?  Arrowroot?  Pretty hard to locate in most grocery stores.  File Gumbo? Makes a green gloppy mess out of your meal. CON: Somewhat poorly written, more poorly compiled into a book, and the person or persons in charge of the index need to be educated (back to school with you now!) in compiling a COMPREHENSIVE index.  Facts and figures are just too hard to find in this book. PRO: SHe's probably rich from sales of this re-hash of Atkins, Sugar-busters, and Carb Addicts. PRO: She's easier on the eyes than Atkins was 
 Lucky for us, Siri Hustvedt went on to write greater things, and we can expect even more of her as she hones her craft.  "The Enchantment of Lily Dahl," he second novel, will disappoint those readers who absolutlely loved her novel "What I Loved," an emotionally gripping, sophisticatedly plotted and lyrical novel about the intersections of love, art and life in 1980s and 1990s New York City.  I found nothing really enchanting or enchanted about Hustvedt's protaganist in this one, a blond buxom waitress withering as in smalltown Minnesota but hoping for a career as an actress.  The story might have been about a young woman discovering something within herself and her surroundings, but instead, the reader gets a murder mystery with a psycho, as well as a handful of caricatured and unbelievable characters who all seem to love Lily Dahl but never seem to get her.  Don't judge Hustvedt by this one 
 .  When 'The Dance of Change' was published in '99, Senge's work was already reaching the end of it's relevancy.  A brilliant thinker, he's had difficulty sustaining creative thinking since 'The Fifth Discipline'.   Not surprising.  With such a brilliant, breakthrough book like his 1990 masterpiece, one tends to get trapped by one's own fame.  Thus is born The Fifth Discipline Industry.  The Dance of Change contained nothing new in 1999.  By 2006 the ideas contained in 'Dance' are so passe for most industry.  Many others have built upon Senge's work in far more effective ways and your time is better spent with them.  While you can skip 'Dance', 'The Fifth Discipline' still is a must read, especially if you're working on organizational change in education or human services, two industries that remain stubbornly stuck in the 80's.    
 Mmmmm...I really don't know how I feel about this particular version of the Bible...it is actually kind of weird...it really is...I know that it's trying to get more and more people to read it and understand it, but I really don't think this book does it...at least, not for me it didn't.  The only translation that really does it for me, is the Lamsa Bible. It is translated from the original Aramaic...which, by the way, is the language that Jesus actually spoke. Did you know that "Abba" actually means, "Good Daddy"...it also means "Bad 70s music..." just kidding...but yeah, when Jesus called God, Abba, he was basically saying, My Good Daddy provides me with everything I could want and need, which, of course, drove the scribes crazy and which would probably drive some "Christians" crazy if they really understood the Aramaic language.  Not that I do, mind you...I'm not an Aramaic Scholar by any stretch of the imagination, but I have studied books by Rocco Errico and his mentor, George Lamsa.   So, no, I can't say that I really recommend this particular version of the Bible. It doesn't jive well wit da soul and all dat...y'know, what I'm sayin'...  Me neither..

 Halo 2 is a very easy game and this guide will not tell you ANYTHING you won't find in about 3 minutes.   
 This by far the worst movie that I have ever paid to see at a theatre.  That is not to say that it wouldn't make a good rental; where through multiple viewers you could knock the viewing price down to 15 cents a person, but then that would still be too much to pay for this movie.  WWE Entertainment should stick to what it does best -  wrestling events where the story line is better inside the squared circle.  Outside of a Terminator reference made to Robert Patrick, this is a total waste of 91 minutes of your life 
 No need to say more, these f@gs are just making lousy punk pop for the teenage girls and mtv watching kids who think they're quite rebel with listening to this kind of sheit, and these suckers do it just for the money like green day or blink 182. There just have to be some stuff like this to fill all the pop and mtv charts 
 This director mistakes lame attempts at surrealism for art. Artsy-fartsy disjointed and meaningless scenes leave the viewer benumbed and wondering what this movie is about.  Speaking Russian is no help in discovering the point of this wan effort. 
 The Starter Wife started out promisingly vapid, in an entertaining way, but rapidly became more disgusting than anything else.  The narcissitic self obsession rang true (not surprising given the author's similar lifestyle), and the ways in which it was indulged were fascinatingly ridiculous.  However, those descriptions only hold interest for so long, and then the book digresses into an unrealistic, annoying conclusion.  The insight into an actual L.A. Wife Of lifestyle is unbelievable enough; to try to throw in a homeless guy that leads an exemplary lifestyle then reconciles with his family and inherits their billions... there's a limit to the willful suspension of disbelief.  
 Waste and Want is a book in the same way that 10,000 pennies are $100.  Technically it is correct.  But it is less useful and more tedious than one would like.  Ms. Strasser has assembled this book like an old time ransom note.  But instead of using words cut out from magazines, she used 568 citiations.        A ransom note is short, direct and to the point.  Waste and Want cannot be accused of these traits.  Most of the quotes appear to come from old household manuals, for example, the 1835 edition of The American Frugal Housewife.  (Imagine some future historian expounding on the 21st centry american household using Martha Stewart as her main source.)       The book is massively, stunningly unreadable.    If your opinion is that all waste is evil, you might be able to stomach it.  But otherwise read Rubbish by William Rathje - much more enjoyable and educational 
 The music is way too "synthy" for me.  In many cases the "band" sounds like a synthesizer and a drum box.  Many of the lyrics are inane.  Lou's voice seems ok.  My 8 year old likes it a lot.  The songs have a certain pop catchiness to them, but there just isn't much depth there.  I have a hard time believing that this is the king of mambo.  I certeinly wish that I was as studly as he is 
 The people Al Franken refers to with the title of his book-- "Lies and the lying liars who tell them" are, of course, Republicans. If anything, this work brings out more clearly than any example I can think of, that ideologues are completely blind to their own bias. The highlight of the book was for Al to ask his secretary to lie for him to set up a visit for him and his son to visit the Christian Bob Jones University. He then took his prospective college-age son on a campus tour where father and son lied to the admissions office, lied  to student guides and lied to faculty members.  The purpose of this jaunt was "to have fun at their expense," "We were going to go on a comedy adventure."  Franken was "Excited about all the comic possibilities."    Egad. If even the otherwise sharp-as-a-whip Franken doesn't realize the shattering irony of his stupid prank, what more proof do we need that ideology blinds even the brightest of us? That being the case, there go all the rejoinders from the media that the fact that 90% of their reporters are liberals has no bearing whatever on their neutral presentation of the news. Yeah. Right.   
 This book is complete rubbish. It is a scathing indictment of our university system and an argument against tenor.  If my son or daughter came home spewing this tripe I would pull them immediately.    I surmise that maybe his [author] darkest day was in 1989 when the Berlin Wall fell. In fact, the only praise I remember in the book was for the Chinese over some clever anti-Western words they used in their showcase film.  I think he pines for "agrarian reformers" like Che (wink...wink).  The author is adamantly opposed to optimism (of any kind) and his main criticism of Disney comes from their inability to show history at its worst moments.  I think he would be unsatisfied with a dark ride reliving the grimmest moments of US history.  My favorite trick of his is when he uses quotations around words like "free market".  I think this is code to demonstrate to his smug friends his disdain for free enterprise and industry.  He almost writes/types the words "nuclear family" angrily!   It is sad.  He is sad.  Finally, you should never trust someone who writes about pop culture who places an AT-AT on Endor.    
 The res on the artwork here is less than miserable. The interface is high-tech circa 1996.   I'm dissappointed in this purchase. I would have thought it was fantastic when I bought my first PC in 1993 
 I'll admit it...the cover is what first drew me to this book. I liked the glowing clock hands and the fog with the creepy things standing in it. Then I flipped it over and read that the main character, Arthur Penhaligon, was supposed to die, yet he didn't. Instantly, I was intrigued.  Arthur has asthma, which is something I can relate to since I had it as a kid too. He pushes himself too hard because he doesn't want to feel alienated by his weaker lungs. It's an asthma attack that almost kills him, but he is saved through the efforts of a small piece of a Will and a key shaped like the minute hand of a clock.  Soon after the arrival of the key come those who wish to hunt it down and return it to Mister Monday. Among those are the army of doglike and winged creatures, all dressed in attire befitting a civilization one hundred and fifty years ago. With them they bring the sleepy plague that begins to overtake Arthur's homeland.  Arthur uses the key to enter into a mysterious house (that only he can see) in hopes of finding a cure. There he discovers a world beautifully ripe with clockwork imagery and centralized around the written word. Those that reside there trade in paper and ink materials instead of money. Plus there are ever present characters of Monday's army, such as Dawn, Noon, and Dusk.  Although I liked the concept of this book, I found Arthur's overall journey to be a bit too contrived and that he is led where he goes simply because the author placed him on that path and not because it was the pull of the character leading us on his story. Overall, despite the quirky environment and characters, the story felt predictable and a bit templated in its structure. I also picked up on a religious tone to the book, which I only mention to make you aware that it's in there.  I did find the setting fun to visualize and it is because of that, I will be checking out Grim Tuesday next 
 why doesn't anyone write good fiction anymore? why is everything I read pushing an anti-Catholic/anti-Christian,pro-socialist ,leftist agenda?? I would like to escape from all the politics for awhile,okay?? I can get the same rants from Washington Post/N.Y.Times/New Yorker,etc.ad nauseum..I just want to read a good book! I know we're supposed to hate Nixon & Ken Starr;I know we're supposed to think Christianity is stupid..I get enough of that from the mainstream press. Bausch is preaching to his own secular,Trotsky-rules, choir..of course all the characters have money..helps,doesn't it?even tho'capitalism is so evil..would've enjoyed this book,without it's blatant political messag 
 Like most great diplomatic moments, successes and failures alike, decades will pass before anything approaching a full history of the Camp David debacle can appear.  Even then, disagreements on the apportionment of blame will likely continue on for decades after.  Given the wide interest in the Israeli-Arab conflict and the complex nature of the negotiations, new works exploring the crucial climax at Camp David remain welcome.  Some dismiss Mr. Swisher's work because he was not in fact part of the negotiating team, but instead was responsible at Camp David only for negotiations.  That seems to me unfair.  Clayton Swisher clearly did considerable "leg work" to prepare this text; sadly both his rather obvious bias and almost juvenile desire to settle scores renders what could have been an important work at best suspect.  Mr. Swisher's book follows on the heels of Dennis Ross's interesting "The Missing Peace" and, given Mr. Ross's direct involvement in the negotiations; no one could be blamed for looking at other works as well.  However, Mr. Swisher spends much of his time looking to lay the blame at Mr. Ross's feet, even when he makes claims that others at Camp David, many more central then Mr. Swisher directly contradict his statements.  Much for example is made in this work of Mr. Ross's change of "municipal Jerusalem" to "greater Jerusalem" in a draft as if this caused the breakdown of the agreement.  Unfortunately, Ross's change in fact was a return to an earlier draft after being changed by Robert Malley, a member of the US team and now often a talking head representing the Palestinian point of view, who made the alteration without consulting any of the parties.  Malley has never denied this.  Moreover, days would pass before the negotiations actually broke down.  Swisher's target, perhaps seeking to sell books by putting forward a contradictory point of view, shifts the blame wherever he can to Israel and the US negotiating team.  While such an effort might well be reasonable, Mr. Swisher often twists facts, making excuses for Palestinian gaffs while blowing minor facts out of all proportion.  For example, Mr. Swisher brushes aside the days lost when Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian team insisted that Jews had no historic link to Jerusalem or the Temple Mound -- a position farcical on its face -- as mere posturing.  However, he never mentions that such ideas, undermining the Jewish people very claim to the Land, serve only to inflame the parties and make agreement almost impossible.  Nor does Swisher ever consider the Palestinians failure to negotiate in good faith, treating every Israeli offer simply as a new base line, rather than offering any proposals of their own.  Again, even Robert Malley concedes that this disingenuous strategy by the Palestinians likely doomed Camp David from the start.  Swisher's dismissal of all Israeli concerns reaches a crescendo when he simply casts aside as silly Israel's interest and the Palestinian's refusal of any compromise for the so-called "right of return," or the claim that all Palestinian who left the area of modern Israel and all their descendants must have a right immigrate to Israel, a right held by no other people.  As to the simple fact that this would lead to the destruction of the Jewish State and that the Palestinians are thus expecting Israel to commit national suicide, on this problem Mr. Swisher remains silent.  Lastly, one cannot help but marvel at Mr. Swisher's odd coverage of the events after Camp David.  That Yasser Arafat led a bloody war against Israel rather than offering an alternative proposal for peace is dismissed.  Mr. Swisher combs through events searching for, magnifying, and twisting any event that will make Israel look bad, while at the same time minimizing or even ignoring the waves of suicide terrorists who have murdered hundreds of Israeli civilians in cold blood.  Mr. Swisher even parrots points of Palestinian propaganda so thoroughly disproved that even Palestinian leaders no longer mention them, such as the claim of massacres during Israeli operations in Jenin, which exhaustive study long ago proved to be nothing more than a fabrication.    Curiosity will cause readers to ask why Mr. Swisher takes this extremely biased view.  Fortunately, he lays out his rather simplistic point of view at the very beginning of the book by writing the following, "The primary reason for Arab and Muslim anger against America has been and remains unbridled support for Israel's oppression of the Palestinians."  Again, one can only muse as to why Mr. Swisher does not take Osama bin Laden at his word when he spoke shortly after 9/11 that his hatred manifests from the presence of American Christian soldiers in the heart of Islamic holy lands like Saudi Arabia and later Iraq.  Surely neither the bombings in Madrid or more recently in London had anything to do with Israel, but it seems for Mr. Swisher's simplistic world view, it is at the door step of the Jewish state where all blame is to be laid.   
 I was very excited about this game until it came out of the box.  It looks great for my 3 year-old but as in other reviews the spinner ruins the entire game.  This should have been obvious at design and this game should never have made it to stores with this defect.  It is particularly frustrating because the concept seems so good with a lot of thought put into the educational value.  I think ill will is going to be the result of this penny minding in construction.  Leapfrog could have further enhanced the brand with this product but fumbled 
 The book starts out reasonably well enough, with Davidson drawing you into the overview of the life of Carl Sagan's parents.  But as the book progresses, you begin to see another side to the story of Sagan's life that you weren't expecting.  Davidson doesn't hesitate to make broad generalizations and interpretations of his interviews with people in Sagan's life, even making borderline psychoanalytical conclusions to explain his behavior when Davidson is clearly not qualified in this area.  There were several points where I read a line and found myself just staring at the book with a gaping jaw and a sense of incredulility, wondering how he could make such a strange conclusion.  For example, when he discussed Sagan's novel Contact, it quickly became apparant that Davidson hadn't even read the book or he wouldn't be making such strange interpretations of the book's plot.  Additionally, Davidson's writing is incredibly simplistic; although it may appear vivid and engaging on the surface, it is full of groan-inducing cliches and overdramatized descriptions of events.  This, in combination with his purely speculative conclusions on Sagan's personality, made me want to vomit.  Overall, although I was able to glimpse a small part of what made Carl Sagan so special and see a somewhat decent overview of the events in his life, I feel I was getting a blurry and distorted picture of who the man really was 
 I felt a bit ripped off by this book because it only superficially covers the investor's whose pictures grace the cover. In fact, it's an ambitiously massive survey of conventional finance theory related to picking stocks.  However, as a professional investor, I've read everything it covers in better detail elsewhere.  As a gift for someone new to investing I'd recommend Browne's Little Book Of Value Investing because it is more accessable and entertaining.  For more seasoned readers I'd recommend David Dreman's Contrarian Investment Strategy because it uses numerous empirical studies.  
 Having never read a book by Danielle Steel but seen and liked a few of the movies adapted from her novels, I was looking forward to reading Answered Prayers, since I usually always find the books more deep and interesting. Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed... The first thing that bothered me about this novel, was the amount of repetition it has. I was just through the first few pages of the first chapter, and I was already being told things (usually insignificant) which I had just read a few lines before.  Secondly, the moment Brad is introduced into the plot, I could foresee with certainty, how it was going to unravel and how the book would eventually end. So as not to dampen my enthusiasm and continue reading, I reasoned that if the plot was going to be so predictable, the book couldn't possibly be Danielle Steel's "Number One Bestseller" as the cover proclaims...seems like I have a grave misconception regarding the criteria needed to make a book a "bestseller".  The major flaw of this novel is that it desperately lacks imagination. Even the main characters themselves and their situations are mirror images of each other. Faith is sweet and caring, has two daughters who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving her feeling lonely and sad. Her husband is cold, unreligious and gives her no attention.  Brad is sweet and caring, has two sons who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving him feeling lonely and sad. His wife is cold, unreligious and gives him no attention. Even Faith's "deep dark secret" is too unoriginal, and it is revealed to the reader at the very early stages of the book, leaving no room for curiosity and suspense.  Halfway through the book, I was so bored that I considered giving up reading it altogether. However I kept pushing on, praying that some twist to the plot would miraculously materialize somewhere, to at least make reading Answered Prayers worthwhile... Unlike Faith however, my prayers remained unanswered... It's going to require a lot of will power to attempt reading a Danielle Steel novel again...  
 		Asking an alleged humourist to explain economics is similar, with all due apologies to Mark Twain, to asking a dog to dance on its hind legs;  it can be done, but it serves no useful purpose and merely annoys the dog.  	Granted, economics can be funny.  Stephen Leacock was an economist of the last century who wrote the classic 'Sunshine Sketches of a Small Town'.  In contrast to O'Rourke's nattering negative nonsense, Leacock's humour was "the kindly contemplation of the incongruities of life and the artistic expression thereof."  There's no danger of O'Rourke's bitter bile becoming a classic or being remembered for its humour.  	"Humour" and "kindly" do go together.  If O'Rourke ever read Leacock, he didn't learn much.  This book is a 1950s-rant against the evils of socialism, completely ignoring that one of the most successful socialist societies was the Jesuit missions among the Guarani of Paraguay.  This decent, humane and prosperous society was crushed by free enterprise slavers who wanted quick profits by making slaves of the Guarani rather than teaching them harmony in hymns.  Likewise, the ongoing success of the Salt River Project in Arizona, according to one of its directors a few years ago, "is proof that socialism works."  	Socialism can work, but it requires people with the qualities of saints.  The difference between O'Rourke's rant and the reality of earthly socialism was aptly seen by Leacock, who explained "socialism won't work except in Heaven, where they don't need it, or in Hell, where they already have it."  In other words. O'Rourke needs to learn it's not funny to beat a dead horse.  	Smith wrote an eloquent explanation of what happens when people are allowed to follow their own interests.  This is the most basic right of all people, it is the essence of democracy.  O'Rourke doesn't seem to understand this;  instead, he thinks, "an examination of any democractically elected government leads to deep puzzlement about why democracy works."  	Oh?  My humble observation is that American democracy is an inspiration for the world.  In other words, it works.  Try and find a better system.          In O'Rourke's view, justice is merely a "cash register" to provide government revenues.  In Smith's view, "every man, as long as he does not violate the laws of justice, is left perfectly free . . . . ."  Smith justifies interference with the freedom of individuals when it is necessary to protect consumers;  O'Rourke seems to think of it as merely another form of tax.  Maybe he should drive with greater consideration for others, to cut down on his traffic tickets.  	In brief, O'Rourke doesn't understand Smith, the modern world or the incongruity of humour.  Or perhaps, in his defence and in terms of those who hate every success of America, O'Rourke understands everything all too well and wants to return to the perfect freedom of Rousseau's savages.  	Conspiracy theorists believe tragedy is the product of a diabolical axis-of-evil plot.  In contrast, O'Rourke is an omni-theorist who thinks everything is a conspiracy.  Perhaps his next book will explain how the Vatican, al Qaeda and Mickey Mouse are partners in a vast multi-wing conspiracy to inundate him with traffic tickets, or perhaps to make buttered toast land butter-side down when it falls from the table.  	With it, he might tap a source of humour.  Until then, he should think about why petty-minded zealots are never funny.   
 Sure, the information in this book is current if your potential agent is doing a life term in Sing Sing. But of the five queries I sent out based on the information in this book, two were just unanswered and three came back addressee unknown. Maybe I picked the only five bad addresses in the book, or maybe current it isn't 
 I was halfway through this book and wanted to throw it against the wall,  it was that bad.  I have read her works before, and they were very good --  but not this one.  It was not scary at all.  The heroine was very  unlikeable--in fact everyone was.  I was definitely very disappointed in  this book 
 My thoughts on the book have evolved over time.  When it first came out, I could take  it as a serious critique of past policies of the state department.  But that was before Robert Kaplan published a Fascist policial book titled "Warrior politics: why leadership demands a Pagan Ethos".  Mr. Kaplan is an unapoligetic Fascist who has openly rejected both Jewish and  Christian morality in favor of the politics of terror and force.  And his decision to go down the road of Fascism casts a different light on the contents of this book.   This book draws broad conclusions about the state department and a whole set of people who served over the course of decades based on Kaplan hand-selecting a few individuals to prove the points he wanted to make.  Its also a profoundly anti-intellectual work that somehow asserts that knowledge and contacts within local cultures inevitably leads to collaboration with the "enemy".  After reading warrior politics, its rather clear that Kaplan's views of dealing with other countries were not what he tried make them in this book.  In "warrior politics", he comes out an unapoligistic imperialist who sees those outside the borders of the USA and Israel as barbarians who can only be dealt with by brutal force.  A level of force such that he feels it necessary to open advocate the abandonment of Jewish and Christian notions of  morality.  What Kaplan never understood about the state department he hated so much was that having all those voices who understood countries, cultures and languages allowed for better policy decisions often to be made.  The new state department is full of people top to bottom who don't understand the world outside the united states, often don't have language skills and who regard in-country postings as a joke.  Everything is centralized in washington now and policy decisons are more likely to be driven by someone from a political think  tank who knows nothing about the politics or culture of the countries they are making decisions about.  This didn't make sense before.  But now it does.  Kaplan is an amoral fascist who sees peace as a dangerous fantasy and pure force as the only basis for dealing with any "barbarian"  countries.  His love for the ideal of the roman empire and disregard for human life also explains why no amount of failure in reconstructing Iraq would mean anything to him.  The american soldiers who die in Iraq in Kaplan's world view have no particular value or meaning. Kaplan, as the Roman Empire or Napoleon, simply sees soldiers as something to be used up in order to gain an advantage.  To regard human life as having any meaning would, in his stated world-view, be false autruism 
 I'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn't much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual "pap" you'd expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn't do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander. And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character.   Although the cast is a powerhouse (on paper), sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball. An example: There was a sequence when Bret asks his friends (who are standing behind him) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting; which as it turns out they are unable to do. Instead Jodie and James, blow madly, just like the movie.  This movie reminds me a HELL of a lot like ''The Three Amigo's''; on paper you would think it couldn't miss, but on film it's painful to watch 
 I was really looking forward to getting this tool and saving some time.  It sorely disappointed me.  It was very hard to adjust to the right depth of cut, and instead of using a razor to cut the paper, it uses a pair of  very cheap star wheels to perforate. Even when finally set to the right  depth of cut, the wheels wobbled all over the place, leaving a wavy cut.   It seems like a good idea, but I guess I'll have to make my own to get it  to work right 
 very basic introduction  to yoga and it's benifits it offers to some people. I tried a class with my girl friends and perk my interest but i was unbale to get into these positions the author suggested without some discomfort may work for others 
 I really had to work hard to finish this book.  It was a stuggle in the beginning to keep up with the characters and the plot, though by about 3/4 of the way through, it finally started to make sense.  It wasn't my favorite Ludlum book 
 Of course you have to read this book if you want to complete the final book of this series but it took me a month to read it because of how bad it is. I can't believe how they make Bart in this book. As strong as Cathy was in the others I am surprised at her reactions to her own son. I would have killed him or sent him away for life regardless if he was my son or not. The ending seems very rushed and horribly done 
 A good read for the most part, but misses the mark as a textbook. Too much is unanswered or left as an exercise. The student is left blind and unsteady the whole way through because of insufficient reinforcement of the material. The exercises need to be bolted to the written sections and vice versa. Instead, the exercises look to the next section and and explore without sufficient groundwork. This book COULD be a masterpiece if the author decided to finish it  
 The problem with this CD is their is another CD called "The Singles" which contains all these songs and more. The only song left out is "Wind Beneath My Wings." True Sheena's version is far  superior to Bette Midler's it is better to buy the CD "Machinery"  from where the song was pulled 
      Paul Johnson generally gets short shrift and quick dismissal as that most dreaded of ink-stained commentators - the "popular historian." Suffering from two fatal defects - he suffers from having his books actually purchased and read in significant quantity, and unencumbered by footnotes or academic cant - Johnson is, three dozen books or so later, nonplussed, and certainly undeterred. Instead, Johnson soldiers on in his crusade of churning out crisp, readable and even trenchant history. Generally he hits the mark more often than he misses. A HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY, unfortunately, is largely one of the occasional misses, a misfired product of his youth written (1976) in what must be considered one of the most demoralized and cynical decades in Christianity's history. The resulting book is one very much of its day.   How cynical is A HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY? Johnson, in his preface, has the avowed goal of a history of Christianity with "the requisite degree of historical detachment." At no point does Johnson spell out what this degree is or if it is even measurable. Nonetheless, he certainly believed it to be attainable. Johnson, an avowed Catholic, achieves it by a searching and relentless hermeneutic of suspicion towards nearly all comers, but most especially his own church. "Nearly all" - but there are exceptions, for Johnson's narrative leaves no doubt who its heroes are and who resides in the rogue's gallery. And it is in both classifications that the reader gathers a clear sense of Johnson's brand of Christianity - and an uneven (at best) historical detachment. That brand is, inescapably, Erasmian.  In this regard it is worth noting that while Erasmus does not make his appearance until the opening of Chapter 5 ("The Third Force," devoted to the Renaissance and the Reformation), he provides not only only the glue for the entire chapter but the entire work. Johnson's sympathies are not only evident in the disproportionate treatment given to the Dutch humanist - over a dozen continuous pages, to contrast with, say, the two given to Calvin, the few sentences given to Athanasius, Anselm, Aquinas or Zwingli, and the lack of any mention at all of Kierkegaard, Unamuno, or Bunyan - but in the effusive manner in which Erasmian themes come to dominate analyses of crucial episodes throughout Christian history. An Erasmian theology "reduced to the bare minimum" finds little to praise in "the constant and depressing inflation in the vocabulary of invective" (p. 51) of the Church Fathers; the "parasitical" unproductivity of monasticism; the scholasticism, high, midddle or low of the High Middle Ages; the "confident dogmatism" of Calvin and Luther and their successors; but plenty for Pelagius in his doomed battle with Augustine - apparently the chief of Johnson's villains - and John Locke's religious minimalism. Locke and Erasmus, Johnson says, get to "the heart of the problem. What matters is not so much what a man believes as what he does. Christianity is about morals, not dogma" (p.338). From this premise most of Johnson work flows, and only in passing does Johnson hint at the possible vulnerabilities of this approach - Christianity at risk, he faintly concedes, to easily lose its Christian character completely "and topple over into mere deism" (p. 340). Passe Leo Strauss (or at least his popular caricature), Johnson's ideal Christianity is one that makes for well-behaved and productive citizens. "It helps to cage the beast," Johnson avers (p. 517). Which is to say, very Lockean of him.  Such a narrative requires a certain selectivity in treatment, but Johnson's story leaves surprisingly large swaths of Christianity untouched or barely grazed. The virtually nonexistent attention given to Christian history in the developing world is bad enough if tolerable given its marginality to the core of the faith's identity during much of its development. Less escusable is the scanty treatment given to the critical role of the Eastern Churches, which more or less disappear from view even well before the Great Schism. Likewise striking are the large gaps in Protestant history, especially of evangelical movements in the U.S. Johnson's is less a History of Christianity than A History of West European Christianity.   Nevertheless, there are glimmers of the old Johnson fire which no doubt form much of the attraction the book has had over the last three decades. Crackling, even astute observations pepper the work. Not the least of which is the concluding paragraph, which for all its Erasmian language is inescapably skeptical of the alternative: "Certainly, mankind without Christianity conjures up a dismal prospect. The record of mankind *with* Christianity is daunting enough...In the last generation, with public Christianity in headlong retreat, we have caught our first, distant view of a de-Christianized world, and it is not encouraging." While it is likely that A HISTORY OF CHRISTIANITY would be a different work if Johnson wrote it today, three decades of de-Christianization in Western Europe have lent an undeniable force to Johnson's observation 
 I'm a big fan of Colin Firth and I was disappointed of this movie, I felt sleep, wish I never do on an average good movie, I do not recommended if you've seen Bridget Jones diaries, not even close.. 
 This is quite possibly the most poorly written book I have ever seen. Like others on this site I will never again read a DS book. Talk about repetitive -- it got so bad that I began to underline everytime the main love interest was referred to as a "wacky artist". Between Chapters 5 and 7 the term was used 15 times, three times on one page. To make it worse, the "wacky artist" is also characterized as extremely immature and childlike, making him very unappealing to me, anyway. In the space of 3 pages the following phrases appear -- "looked like a big kid", "she felt like his mother", "his childlike style" "he was very needy sometimes, and self-centered, as children are", "he acted like a bored schoolboy", "pouting", "acted out, more often than not, like a child". What a bore. Both the book and the people in it 
 Gnocchi is a type of italian potato dumpling and are rather time consuming to make.  I was hoping this machine would help with the shaping of the dough before boiling as it's called the MilleGnocchi attachment.  Unfortunately, this machine is not to be used with gnocchi dough.  The light fluffy potato dough will stick to all the mechanical workings.  If you use a standard pasta dough instead, the attachment will make nicely shaped pasta 
 ...who said that the texture of this product is somewhat strange.  I love beef jerky, especially peppered and hot & spicy varieties. But this jerky lacks the chewy-ness that I expect in a quality beef jerky.  This stuff kind of breaks down a little too easily and takes on a mushy, grainy consistency.  The flavor isn't bad, but after reluctantly finishing the first bag, I can't bring myself to open the second one.  Perhaps I wasn't paying proper attention, but I was somewhat surprised to learn that this product originated in Brazil.  I would not have purchased it if I had known this 
 I like John Grisham, but THE KING OF TORTS was a slow-moving disappointment.  Grisham is obviously making an argument for tort reform in this novel, which is fine, but he ends up putting the message above the story.     Grisham devotes much of this novel to a young plaintiffs' lawyer and his new law firm dedicated to class action lawsuits.  This provides Grisham with an excuse to explain, in agonizing detail, how tort lawyers sue big companies and collect huge fees.  Grisham also produces scene after scene describing the enormous wealth of class action lawyers, and how they put their own greed above the interests of their clients.     In the end, none of this adds up to an engaging storyline.  It doesn't help that the young lawyer in this novel is a rather unlikable person that Grisham is obviously setting up for a fall.  Since I didn't care for this character, I found the storyline of THE KING OF TORTS to be largely uninvolving.  This novel is also rather preachy and heavy-handed in tone.   I personally dislike class action lawsuits, but I read novels for entertainment, not to validate my own political beliefs.   Although this book was decently written, I just didn't find the story interesting enough to recommend.  For a better version of this story, I would suggest A CIVIL ACTION by Jonathan Harr. 
 The pictures are abstract looking and dark in tone. The book makes reference to; ghosts, bad men fighting in the dark, and cougars in the park. I'm not sure my 3 or 5 year old children had thought up these bad things on their own yet. While reading them the book I felt uneasy about the dark pictures and scary references to things they may not have even thought of before. I'm still undecided if it will be helpful in convincing them that they don't need to be afraid of life or if it will convince them that life is pretty scary and they ought to be afraid! There is one reference to 'having a lucky charm up her sleeve' that protects her from the bad stuff and also allows her to walk on the ocean floor without having to come up to breathe. Those are both useless defenses in the real world so the book doesn't offer any real reasons to not be scared of life 
 I had heard good things about Chris, so I figured I'd check this out. But when I began listening to this one, I seriously thought there was something wrong with the CD. The first track sounded like a warped LP, or a cassette player in desperate need of cleaning. Unfortunately, the entire CD is that way. The playing is horrendous, and for the most part so is the singing, although he briefly shows flashes of potential vocally. The songs themselves blur into an indistinguishable mess 
 Carolyn Chute is well able to evoke a sense of place in which these  Northeastern hillbillies live by describing the detritus of their yards as  well as their lives.  However, the story meanders--again, not unlike the  aimless day-to-day existence of the characters she describes. Her  characterization provides the Beans and their friends and neighbors with a  rough dignity, although not enough to keep them from seeming pitiable to a  "sophisticated" urban readership 
 Personally, I found this workout extremely difficult to follow; the moves are simply not broken down enough to be understood. After pushing myself to go back to every part I didn't understand, I grew frustrated. Other reviews have mentioned that being able to pick up the moves comes from such repetition,  as I have obviously tried, but that technique killed my motivation and the thrill, both of which I believe are integral to any workout. And in my opinion any workout that one pays for should deliver a deserving output; one shouldn't have to teach themselves the moves.   To a less significant degree, I agree with the reviews that comment on the "cheesiness" of the video. At first, such cheesiness made me laugh, and then as I grew frustrated, it merely made me further annoyed. What I feel also adds to the cheesiness is instructor Marie Forleo's unsuccessful motivation attempts, which are not only redundant, but suggestive in a most unnecessary way.   I don't mean to sound so aggressively negative--I just wish I had been able to learn the moves, because they did look like fun 
 I love Il Divo but very disappointed with this CD. It's very short and a repeat of songs in previous releases 
 I wish I could recommend this book, but I cannot because it is so full of mischaracterizations and exaggerated claims about the men and positions being reviewed.  Apparently the author did not read his opponents charitably and with an open mind.  Consequently, I believe he failed to follow the first commandment of scholarly debate, which is to try to understand and appreciate what one's intellectual opponents are trying to say before attacking them from a position outside of their own circle of presuppositions and theological commitments.  All one has to do is look at the responses of the men critiqued at www.federal-vision.com to appreciate the failure.  Perhaps, however, this book will lead to a more objective and honest evaluation of what has been labed the "Federal Vision" in Reformed theological circles.  One can only hope 
 An abundance of full-color plates and numerous black-and-white photographs made this book worth the modest price.  The text is awkward. It sounds as if English is not the author's first language and certain elements of carelessness in the writing suggest that the author was more concerned with the manuscript deadline than scholarship. Picasso's own words, appearing as blocked quotes in the margins are not dated, nor sources given. The reader is not able to chronologically trace the change in philosophy reflected in his words. The text also suffers from an inordinate number of typographical errors. Walther's poorly disguised gut reaction of disgust in describing some of Picasso's work may reflect the reaction his early critics felt in viewing some of his paintings. Walther uses words such as "horror," "grotesque," "misshapen," and "ugly," at one point writing, "Picasso wanted to destroy absolutely everything.&quot 
 The authors of this book are key personalities of the American Botanical Council, an organization tirelessly committed to the takeover of herbal medicine by pharmaceutical companies, specifically German pharmaceutical companies that generously fund their company--and underwrite the production of their books. If you care about herbal medicine, don't give your money to this sinister organization 
 This film has many, many interesting ideas in it. I think it has an original cast of characters. I admire Brian DePalma for making his own brand of films.  Unfortunately, "Femme Fatale" is one of those films that will do ANYTHING to twist the plot in an alternate direction --disorienting the audience and supposedly giving the film depth. Alas, you need a strong plot in order to do this (see Memento) effectively. What's worse, other than the major twists (the biggest of which is just GOOFY), there are way, way, way too many coincidences and visual gags which just pollute things further.  DePalma has had this problem with many of his films. One that comes to ming is "Obsession". Twists work best when there are 1,2, maybe 3 -- such as in "Dressed to Kill".  The set-pieces themselves do not approach his best work, and Stamos is unendearing, almost irritatingly vulgar and nasty at times. In order to be a "Femme Fatale" she should be able to work both sides flawlessly 
 The sound quality of this CD is terrible. Whoever mastered the album onto CD is a completely clueless idiot, it is far too compressed and there is digital clipping galore. Harsh and unlistenable 
 A fan of the Notebook, I was dissapointed to see that Sparks has hit cruise control. There we no surprises here, and the depth of the characters could be measured in centimeters - especially the doctor, who is very one dimentional. I think it wouldn't have taken him that much more time to flush out the story, but, well, he didn't.  It doesn't mean I won't keep reading him, I just hope that he gets  his bearings back. So far, the Notebook is still my favorite 
 This was recorded shortly before the release of Schenker's second solo album. That points up the two things wrong with this: the band sounds tentative, like they're not comfortable with the new material, and the setlist is drawn almost entirely from those first two albums. That leads to some questionable choices: it opens with the big, inspiring "Ride of the Valkyries" music (uh, that's "Kill the Wabbit", if you don't recognize the name), and then the band comes in with a big, exciting, crashing chord, and you're just dying to hear them tear into "Captain Nemo", and it's an extreme letdown to hear "Armed and Ready" instead. Another odd choice is the piano ballad "Never Trust a Stranger", which surprisingly works very well live, and fits in well with the rest of the tunes because everything is played s-l-o-w.  On the other hand, Schenker himself is great, so how bad can it be? And there are a couple of songs here which you won't hear in live versions anywhere else 
 This is the first of Sawyer's books that I did not enjoy. I thought the combination of dinosaurs and time-travel would be a winning combination. That's what I get for thinking. The plot was boring and a bit far-fetched for my tastes. There's a certain level of believability that I like and this one didn't fall within the parameters. The characters were dull or irritating. The dino encounters were lackluster. The plot was, to me, a bit silly. The sub-plots, even sillier. I would be more specific but it would require me to give away plot points in the book. I may be critical but I don't wish to ruin anyone elses read. They may find the book delightful. I did not 
 A good friend of mine insisted I'd read this book, because she knows I love exploring the spiritual aspects of life.   In the end I was very disappointed.  Not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book, but Michael Crichton's whole attitude.  He would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences, only to revert back to his arrogant, narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter.  How can anyone claim they've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in?  Sadly, this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.  I have no desire to read any more of his books 
 I like the concept of having someone right a book that modeled the expansion and rise of Rome, it's blatant that the author did so. Even though I liked the concept the book was still bad. I think that if a differnt author had wrote this then it would have been good. Much improvement is needed, the book did not seem real, or lifelike and I was never really interested. Read something else, the Wheel of Time, A Song of Ice and Fire, the Inheritance Trilogy, anything but this.  
 While an interesting light read, these 'laws' are not immutable. Nor would your business be in peril if you ignored them, as the authors suggest.  In general, these laws are only for those obsessed with being number one. People going for those few #1 slots would find this book useless. For everyone else, there are a few small pearls to be gathered, but digging through the muck to find them makes them difficult to spot 
 Well, the book does have some nice photos. My copy is in english. However, it really falls short of what was promised. First, there is virtualy nothing in it about architecture. Very few photos of buildings, houses, etc. at all. It's just a collection of photos of the interiors of homes designed by famous people. I was very disappointed.  For example, it goes on and on about european homes in mexico -- what does that have to do with mexican styles?  If you are looking for a book that is basically a Home & Garden magazine with 270 pages then buy it. Like i said earlier - some nice photos.  If you wanted somethign else, then search on. Cause this may leave you unsatisfied 
 Who decided to cast Jessica Alba for this film? For those of you who admire her accent, you're way off! My mother was born in Malaysia, and there's a lot more to the accent than just broken English. Not to mention she looks nothing like the part. Did the casting director say, "Jessica's part-Mexican, ethnic enough -- she can play a Southeast Asian!" JA may be beautiful, but the interchanging is downright insulting, like lumping all the brown people together. Of all the "Asian" women in the trailer, it's so plain to see she's not! Were Asian women not attractive enough for the lead role? Are there not enough of them for a casting call, the most populous race? Actors can only "become" someone different to a degree. After watching the trailer, I was so disgusted I couldn't even give the movie a chance. It would only rile me up. Skip this movie, and ditch all its claims of cultural sensitivity 
 If you really like 70's themes, you should like this CD.  It was a little too dated for me 
 I went and saw these guys when they opened for Andrew W.K. at the Masquerade in Atlanta a while ago. The band itself is very good. I was impressed with how pure their music is. They hold on tight to metal tradition and don't pollute their music with sound samples, guest rapper appearances, turn tables, and slap-bass riffs. Yes these guys actually incorperate solos into their music! (Remember those?) This band reminds me of something out of the "Ride the Lightning" era, from that band that used to make good music. That being said, I gave this album two stars because it must have been produced on a painfully low budget. It sounds like garbage to be honest and doesn't do the band justice. The vocals seem at times to be totally drowned out by the blare of the guitars, and the overall sound was definately less than crisp to say the least. Bottom line, until this band gets signed to a label that is willing to expand their studio budget, leave this one on the shelf. But they are definately worth seeing live 
 GET REAL is right!  Practice what you preach 
 Scruton comes off as something of a learned amateur; I have no idea if music is his "field," but if it is, he hasn't been exposed to an idea that emerged since the '50s.  Virtually all of the ideas in this longish book have been stated before, by people with greater knowledge and experience than he and with more excuses for being wrong.  I mean, Adorno could be forgiven his false conclusions (somewhat) because of when he lived and the environment in which he was raised.  Scruton, living today, has none of these excuses for his dated arguments and almost primitive knowledge of music outside of Western Classical.  The best aspects of this book are the first few chapters, which are basically a regurgitation of the usual music philosophy from a Western Art Music bent.  You can get this information elsewhere, but Scruton does do a decent job of summarizing it in a readable, well-organized fashion.  The book falls apart after that, though, and for a good laugh check out the chapter in which Scruton (weakly) takes swipes at jazz and rock, revealing his virtual ignorance of the nuances of either style 
 I did not find the author's arguments for faith to be at all compelling.  Examples used a "evidence" in many instances were simply the opinions of people whom the author interviewed while preparing for the writing of the book.  The case presented was also extremely biased with minimal, if any, counter arguments being presented.  The majority of "experts" interviewed were of the clergy, so how would one expect those people to feel about faith 
 It is interesting to see all of the gushing reviews of this film.  I found nothing socially relevant, compelling, insightful or even remotely interesting in this film.  The pace is like watching a turtle race and creates a film that IS dull.  There is nothing to like or empathize with in any of the characters.  If your going to waste your time with any of the "Three Colors" films, watch White 
 not as good as the 1st three but you need it to go with the other 4 deathwish films 
 If you are an animal lover, beware.  After reading part of Chapter 5 "Will You Be Amazed?", I closed the book for good.  Yes, I was amazed.  The author doesn't believe that animals have eternal souls.  Out of all the multitude of books I've read, this is the only one that eliminates the idea of our beloved animals in heaven.  Rest assured, if we make it to heaven, they will too, indeed.  In fact, we are also animals, mammals, just as our beloved dog & cat friends are!  So what I've read in Chapter 5 doesn't make any sense.  I'm very disappointed & won't ever recommend this book to anyone 
 Maybe it was just the recipes I tried first from this book (Orange honey glazed carrots, brocolini and balsamic vinaigrette, mustard roasted potatoes), but her recipes are inundated with salt, to the point that my kids (usually salt lovers) cried out "too much salt" and wouldn't eat them.   I couldn't have misread three recipes by mismeasuring, and I won't try any more items from this book that call for salt.  A major disappointment.  If you are hypertensive, STAY AWAY from this book, it could be dangerous to your health 
 I searched amazon under "nobrow" and discovered another book on the same sumject, though infinitely better than Seabrook's self-indulgent musings (see the first 3-4 reviews below, they tell the whole story).  From Lowbrow to Nobrow by Peter Swirski is lucid, engaging, intellectually stimulating and funny, on top of leaving Seabrook's superficial analysis in the dust (nobrow literary culture, it appears has been around for a century at least).   In fact I'd go so far as to say Swirski's book (released very recent too) is the ultimate study of the subject, at least according to the dean of popular culture studies, Ray Browne, who praises it in the editorial.  Check it out for yourself, you're in for hours of happy reading 
 Only John Kerry would allow a book like this to be printed about himself. John Kerry, the guy who tried to get out of going into the service on a deferrment and when that was denied pulled every lowdown, dirty trick he could come up with including applying for fake Purple Hearts so he could get out early, go home, run a phony anti-war campaign and then run for President.  The biggest insult of all was at the DNC back on July, 2004 when Kerry made that phony salute and  said "I'm John Kerry reporting for duty." 34 years earlier, Kerry was singing quite a different tune.  More like "I'm John Kerry trying to get out of the service on a deferrment." OR "I'm John Kerry trying to rack up phony Purple Hearts from self inflicted and minor scrapes so I can get the heck out of here and go home."  As if Kerry's military background was not a myth, we now all know that his supposed academic prowess was also a myth. While Kerry claimed to be an A student, in fact he was a D student. And that great speech that he made in 1971, supposedly prepared by Kerry in the wee morning hours with little preparation was in fact written for him by Robert Kennedy's speechwriter who had been coaching Kerry for months. But why be surprised? Has Kerry ever told us the truth about anything? Answer: No!  What happened to that big draft Kerry said was coming for sure in January 2005? And how about those reduced social security benefits for our seniors that republicans were supposed to  install according to inside information that Kerry had? Looks like the only draft is between Kerry's ears and just last week our seniors got the second biggest raise on their social security benefits since Bush I was president and raised benefits back in 1991.  So is Kerry misinformed or just a flat out liar? Check out the heroic military image that he created for himself. Does that tell you something? It's not rocket science.  
 IM not sure where to begin with this review, its not that the book was poorly written, quite the opposite it was a very good piece but it lacked any sort of luster or appeal. It was quite infact extremely boring, by page 300 I could not wait for it to be over and this is weird because up to this point I have LOVED the gunslinger series, they were all very good from front to back. There is way, way, to much about Susanah and the whole thing about her having this baby and it dragged and draged, maybe this series is showing its age im not sure but one thing is for sure it was no Wastelands or Wizzard and Glass. It was a far fetch from those titles and it had barely any excitement. It got to the point where I had to try very hard to pay attention and often I would find I had read a page and not remebered what it was about and had to read it again. Im giving this book 2 out of 5, very poor story line, poor plot however it was written well I can only hope that the next book is better, cmon King give me the feeling Wastelands did, BLOWN AWAY!! rather than tired and exhausted 
 This is a story that never needed telling.  Stephen King is incredible with words and ideas, but I suppose I could be considered a fair-weather fan.  "Gerald's Game" did nothing to enhance my life, creativity, conversation or writing skill.  And I was not entertained.  It drained me.  If you haven't read any Stephen King, he's great, so don't start with this one.  Skip it if you can 
 I'm not sure quite what I was expecting from this book, but I wish I hadn't bought it.  One of the excerpts looked promising as a comedic forensics piece, but it is more biographical, really 
 Shame on Routledge for touting as a centenary edition this dog, riddled with egregious typos ("simiotics"? "ernestly"?), whose footnotes refer one to pages on which that which is alleged to have taken place does not, in fact, take place. I like the intros, and the very spacey Micky James foreword. But Routledge does not deserve the $18.95 I gave them for this book, which is, apparently, in the public domain, and which I can read, without typos, online. Shame!!!! 
 This book is completely unhelpful for anyone spending time in Berlin.  I've lived in Berlin in the past but wanted a new travel book to help me see all of the newer sights.  Even for someone who already knows her way around the city, this book was confusing and useless.  The maps are all oversimplified to the point that they won't help you find anything, and the descriptions about where things are will get you completely lost or cause you to waste a ton of time.  For example, the book's recommended ways to spend particular days are absolutely impossible to do.  As someone who knows Berlin, I noticed that their sample schedules told people to go to places that are sometimes more than an hour and a half apart by public transportation and then travel back along the same route to get to another sight or activity.  I felt like this was a waste of money, and I should have gotten the Lonely Planet or Let's Go guilde 
 When I purchased the book early 2003 I agreed with most of the reviews.  However, having it read again. It really shows that a lot of stuff has been outdated and certainly requires updating.  Especially on the new trends like Six Sigma, compliance and innovative technology solutions. 
 I hate this CD. I have most of the other Chieftan CD's, and their collaboration with other artists has always worked in the past. This collection runs the gamut from mediocre to ludicrous. To paraphrase a line from Spinal Tap:"There's a fine line between clever and stupid." This one's over the line.  "Tears of Stone" is my current fave 
 The other reviewers are quite right to praise David Newman's excellent score to Ice Age; the problem with this CD is not Newman's music but the lack of it here!  Everyone's favorite cuts from this score are the catchy opening travel theme (which IS here, briefly) and the extended travel song in the middle ("Send me on my way" with Newman's orchestration to it, ALL of which is MISSING).  NO songs are on this disc.  This partial soundtrack thus lacks the most memorable and enjoyable music in the film.  The CD also lacks the reprise of the travel music played during the end credits; you will find ZERO end credits music here, leaving the music experience to end oddly abruptly.  There is exactly 1 minute and 15 seconds of the travel theme here and that's ALL.  The entire CD is only 34 minutes long!  Both the listener and Newman [are not fairly represented] by this crummy job of producing.  The praise in the other reviews is for David Newman's fine work, not for its "mis-"presentation this CD.  You'll do better to record the movie music off your DVD than accept this very brief sampling.  This release does no justice to a really enjoyable job of movie scoring.  This CD is mainly frustrating 
 If you get an edition, such as "Signet Classic", that includes The Spooniad and the Epilogue, then you will have three bad works of poetry to wade through, the last two blessedly short.  The idea is a good one; a series of monologues from dead former townspeople, touching the major incidents of their lives, many of them connected, sometimes in surprising ways.  But Masters is just not a good enough poet.  He attempts blank verse monologues in the style of Robert Frost (as in North of Boston) but succeeds only in demonstrating how difficult a form it is and how it takes the brilliance of someone like Frost to pull it off.  I can see that a few of them are worthwhile and would themselves make good anthology pieces, but mostly they are simply second rate prose poems of no significance.  In my review of Winesburg, Ohio I compared Sherwood Anderson unfavorably with Masters, saying that he lacked Masters' humanity.  But - like most people, I suspect - I had only read selections from Spoon River.  Now that I have paddled the length of it, I can tell you it is meandering, flows very slowly, and contains very little life. 
 If you want some quick humor then this book hardly gets the job done. If you are looking for a "guide" on how to handle and get with women, then please look else where. 
 Hmmmm.... infomercials now seen as documentaries? If you are in need of hope then I guess you'll believe anything. Harry Potter was so much better than this .... guess JK Rowling has a much better imagination than JZ Knight.  Post-September 7 review given all the hoopla over What the Bleep - Quite frankly: Did the people rendered homeless by the Tsunami create that? Did the students injured at the recent shooting at Dawson College in Montreal (Canada) create that? Or even still ... did the people who were on the New Zealand airplane that crashed in fall 2006 in the Pacific create that as well? Sometimes others impose their wills on innocent bystanders through brutal force and that is not creating your day. That is just plain tragic. We are not victims of life but neither are we masters of the universe either. 
 This article is a reprint of a 1913 magazine piece written by Joshua L. Chamberlain to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Gettysburg.  While it's interesting to read his first hand depiction of the battle, all readers should note the story is approximately 15 pages long.  The publishers have tried to beef up the "book" by adding 15 additional pages of photos, but it does not make up for the lack of content.  I was very disappointed with the purchase 
 i received my order of three oils...jasmine,ambergris, and musk...their fragrance was so obscured by the oil medium that you cut the essential oil with that they all smelled very close to the same...i have caswellmassey oils from 30 years ago and they are still true to their fragrance and it is true...one drop will last all day and often linger for more...have they sold out or sold their name   i only ordered three oils because somewhere i read if you order 25 dollars or more from you the shipping was free...this was not the case...i was charged for shipping   these products i received are a joke...the caswellmassey name is no longer associated with an exemplary product...i am sure the original caswellmassey folks are turning over in their graves every time you send this "jokeoil" to an unsuspecting customer...shame on you...shame on you all     
 Interesting to compare the reviews of this book with the widely avaialble reviews that debunk the authors' previous 'secret life of plants'.  The SoS book is better put together, but again seems to be part of the genre of uncritical hanging together of a whole lot of suggestive bits and pieces with little critical weighing of the evidence.  Frankly if you believe some of this stuff (round towers and all that cow dung buried in horns) then you are indeed 'away with the fairies', although some of the material in the book is respectable enough (e.g. the stuff on remineralisation of soils).  What I'd like to see is a proper review by someone who understands soil science, yet has an open mind to there being 'more to the universe than we know'.   The problem is that to evaluate knowledge claims you have to have some kind of standard and method - otherwise it is just 'say what you like' time, and this is what gives the green and radical movements a bad name. The two stars are because it is thought provoking, but ultimately  it remains unconvincing.  
 a virtual nightmare with set up. no help from their support staff on phones, nor online Q&A. poorest choice i ever have made in a product!! I am a savvy computer type with network experience and this one for the books. Item still sitting where i left it......., useless 
 Like many other reviewers, I struggled with this book. For more than 600 pages, Anna Wulf explores every thought and emotion that comes into her head and tries to make sense out of her life. This might be an interesting book for fiction writers, who might understand the elaborate process Anna goes through to create characters and combine her life with her art. But for the average reader, this is just too much and too long.  I am very patient with novels. Perhaps too patient, because I should have put this one down sooner. I got all the way to page 500 before I realized I just couldn't go on. And it's quite depressing to invest so much time in a book and then put it down. Doris Lessing says herself that no one should force themselves to read a book they are not connecting with. I should have taken her advice sooner. But while some books you might not just be 'ready' for, I don't think I will ever be ready for this one.   It's disappointing because I am a Doris Lessing fan. The Four-Gated City explores many of the same themes - an emotional breakdown can be constructive in order to build yourself back up whole and understand the world around you. Anna Wulf did have a fragmented mind, as demonstrated through her keeping of four separate notebooks. She was kept together by the routines of her life, such as making breakfast for her daughter. When she didn't have anything constructive to do, she thought herself to death. And if you read this book, you'll likely be right there with her - going crazy. 
 "An American Haunting" starts out as many standard horror films do - with a teenage girl being chased by an unseen assailant. She is chased into her bedroom and waits while the assailant rattles at her door. As the rattling dies down, she approaches the door cautiously (always a wise move), and then an image of a very small but full-grown girl - that bears a startling resemblance to the girl from The Ring - appears next to her. She screams, only to find herself being shaken awake by her mother.  Ah. Just a bad dream.  Her mother confiscates a doll and some papers that her daughter found in the attic, goes down to the den and begins reading the papers, which announce that if anyone is reading them, then supernatural events must be occurring (or something along those lines).  The papers go on to tell the story of the Bell Witch, as told in Brent Monahan's fictional horror novel, "An American Haunting".  We move from the present day, with the mother knocking back a shot of Absolut as she prepares to read the stories, directly back into the early 19th century, Tennessee, to the home of John Bell. We find that he has committed the sin of usury by charging 20% interest on a sale of land (wouldn't it be great if 20% was considered, today, a sin??), and the woman to whom he sold the land, Kate Batts, may be a witch. She certainly acts like one, as she lays down what sounds to me like the granddaddy of smack-down curses on him.  Almost immediately, strange things start to happen (actually, they started happening before the "curse"...sounds like squirrels in the attic). His daughter, Betsy, is visited by what appears to be a rather angry poltergeist, as it drags her around the room by her feet, holds her suspended in air, and smacks her silly.  Director Courtney Solomon, who brought us "Dungeons & Dragons", and "Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of the Dragon God", pulls out a bag of tricks that include black-and-white shooting when we are supposed to believe that another entity is in the room. It's not terribly convincing, and good actors like Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek fade into the background. Indeed, during one monologue, Sutherland gives what must be the worst performance of his life, which renders his character unbelievable.  If we have difficulty believing in the human characters, it's going to be difficult to believe in the "haunting", "poltergeist", or whatever it is that's making poor Betsy's life so wretched.  I kept waiting to shift back to modern time. We didn't until the very end. Those sequences were utterly unnecessary, as they lent nothing to the film.  The conclusion was utterly unbelievable, though apparently not the fault of the filmmaker; rather, the fault lies with the author of the novel. I laughed. So did my roommate. It doesn't make ANY sense whatsoever, not when you go back and remember everything that poltergeist (or whatever) did - all of the attacks, the speaking, leaving the house, etc. One could argue my last example, but I know what the argument would be and I totally disagree with it. Unfortunately, I can't go into it because it would spoil the ending, such as it is.  This gets two stars, where it might have received one. The cinematography - even the parts I would rather they have not included (black & white) - was quite good. Also, Sissy Spacek gave a strong performance, and even though Sutherland fell sharply for one monologue, he was more than adequate throughout the rest of the film. In fact, all of the actors did a terrific job with very little material. 
 Without a doubt, this is the worst movie ever made, in any genre, in any decade, by any movie making company since the begining of motion pictures. Who ever put Sandra Bullock's image on the cover of the DVD should be arrested for false advertising, since Sandra is only in the movie a few minutes, and isn't very good in her role anyway. What a bomb, and that's an understatement. Don't rent it, don't buy it, and don't ever watch it, unless you are completely without anything to do, and want to find out for yourself just how bad a movie can be 
 As a teacher, I feel that this book can benefit all of my students in their quest for freedom as described by Tarthang Tulku. I especially recommend this resource for persons interested in learning more about their internal mechanisms or patterns of conditioning. This book has helped me learn what Freedom is really about in contrast to our president and others who base their understanding of freedom on religious beliefs, insecurities and prejudices 
 The tables and diagrams are confusing and too busy. The pyramid concept (having an objective in mind and actually assembling a document to support the objective) could have been written by a college sophomore. The advice given is so basic; I wondered why anyone would even bother to reduce it to writing 
 This book is full of just plain incorrect information, none of which has been corrected from the first edition. The section on the binary language of MIDI is particularly full of errors; not just typos, but errors of fact.  Let the buyer beware 
 I admit that I have read every single one of Lilian Jackson Braun's "Cat Who" books. I used to relish every single one, but I agree with the other reviewers: Lately the books have been getting lamer and lamer.  I, too, think the books are now being ghost-written by someone else. I think the ghost-writing began about five or six books ago. It's not just that the mystery, never central, is now utterly an afterthought in these books. Nor is it that the resolution relies not on accute detective work on the part of Qwilleran or KoKo, but on deus ex machina. (Qwill and KoKo used to really sniff around, so to speak.) Nor is it that the style is mucher coyer than what Ms. Jackson Braun used to use. (I've had it with the endless references to the salt-and-pepper mustache already! It's getting to be a parody of itself!) No, the clincher is the many errors and inconsistencies in "The Cat Who Talked Turkey."   Someone has already pointed out that the Siamese take a car trip in perfect harmony in "The Cat Who Talked Turkey." We all remember that Yum-Yum howls whenever she's in the car. And what happened to taking KoKo out on the leash? And the last time we were privy to the love life of Gary Pratt, owner of the Black Bear Cafe, he was mourning a dead girlfriend. When did he pick up the wife who plays such a big role in this book?  The ghost writer not only hasn't read all the "Cat Who" books, s/he hasn't even done much research. In the book, Qwilleran wonders how KoKo could know something if he can't read. But the very first book posits that KoKo can read backwards. Remember the title of the very first book in this series? The ghost writer clearly doesn't!  Also, Eddington Smith's great-grandfather or grandfather is described as a pirate. But, in the original story, wasn't he a highwayman, instead?  The change in tone comes in the very first sentence when there's a quote from the "Qwill Pen": "A town without a bookstore is like a chicken with one leg." Now, the "Qwill Pen," while not exactly Art Buchwald, has never been this ridiculous.  I've been a faithful reader until now, but this book is the last straw. I suspect that there's not one ghost writer, but more than one, and that's why the books aren't just inconsistent with the real "Cat Who" books, but they don't really match each other, either. I hate to say it, but I'm finished with this series 
 What happened?  I enjoy Beyonce's powerful voice where the "power" is in the buildup of the song.  This cd is screaming not singing!  Disappointing.  I only like the two singles Deja vu and Irreplaceable. I hope her next cd is better, a little closer to the first solo release please. I'm still a fan but will not buy her next cd without hearing it first 
 First of all, I must disagree that log(x) is poor notation for ln(x)... mathematicians use both (in fact sometimes log(x) is log-base-2 of x... frequent in computer science!).  This book is good in that it does things from such an elementary level that even those who've forgotten their high-school algebra will be able to follow it.  He's very very gentle in his exposition (tedious perhaps for those who know this stuff already).  And I LIKE the numbers taken out to 20 decimal places... it's neat!  The main complaint that I have with this book is that the author is WAY WAY too in-your-face throughout.  A good author tells a story from behind a curtain.  Derbyshire _constantly_ reminds you he is there: there are stories of his kids, his wife, his father-in-law.  He talks about his own schooling several times.  And (very annoying) he constantly writes in the first person.  Sample, "I will now show you a trick to make this more understandable."  This implies to me that he is the inventor of the trick (whereas he is almost NEVER the inventor: he's using it without crediting the true inventor and the reader is left wondering who discovered these methods!).    The more common way to write about math is to include the reader: instead of "I will now show you, the lowly uneducated reader how do to this" you say "we will now explore a way to solve the problem."  You see: "we" instead of "I, me, my" all the time.  To reinforce the Derbyshire-ness of the experience, he includes other Derbyful experiences as well.  For example, in the center we see photos of some of the greatest mathematical minds of all time: Gauss, Euler, Riemann, and... Derbyshire.  Later in the book, when explaining Landau's big-O notation, he needs a name for a function that he's discussing.  What would you call it?  f()?  func()?  He calls it the "Derbyshire function".  I found all of this so annoying that it was hard to read the book.  If you aren't bothered by the author's complete self-absorption, you will probably find the book a nice read 
 The name Ellis Peters in the title of the book was clearly meant to lure readers.  None of the writers are up to her standards.  There is no shame in not being a master but it left me feeling a little cheated.  There were a couple of stories that I kinda liked but the rest were forgettable except two were downright yucky.  And the tributes to Ellis Peters written by each and every author were so uninteresting that I didn't bother to read any of them through.  The biggest sign of how unimpressed I am with this book -- I am going to give it away which I never ever do, but I feel kinda guilty that I am going to inflict this lame book on some poor soldier in Iraq.  I shall have to include better reading material and some snack food in the box 
 I ordered one of these and it was dead on arrival.  Also, notice that this is not a Samsung OEM part.  If you call to ask for tech support from Samsung they will tell you they can't help you.  The only positive thing I have to say is that getting a refund was fairly painless 
 After blazing through the first two volumes, and halfway into the conclusion, my reading, and enjoyment of the series came to screeching halt.   Somewhere between the first page and 200 of the finale, Takeo and Kaede had became bumbling, inept and whining caracatures of themselves. WHAT happened to the strength and insight of the caracters I had learned to love? Their simpering and laughable "decisions" are a gross insult to the series...   Damn, and I was SO enjoying it too 
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 BPM is solution for all problem businesses facing today: from Snow White animation to unknown changes of next 50 years -- that's the description, comments, history reivew and the coclusion from Chapter one to Chapter nine. The "why" and "how" are missed. Too bad 
 I am a senior in college and I have used and read many, many textbooks but this is the worst one ever! Very hard to read, the example are not explained very well, MANY< MANY typo's that are confusing to the reader. Many math examples and explanations are outright just wrong. Even professor says its an awful book. Should have never made it into college classrooms! 
 You better hope you have a good teacher.  Don't use it as a last resort to study, if you can even find where a certain topic starts, its nearly impossible to follow 
 My husand and I purchased this DVD to sharpen our dance skills.  It was extremely basic, so if that's what you are looking for then this is for you.  The DVD was NOT new.  The steps were extremely basic and they teach you without music.  It moved along very slow, so my husband lost interest and we quit practicing with it.  It was not all that we had hoped for 
 This is the worst software I bought.   First,it cost $100 and McAfee did not honor the $55 rebate because I sent the rebate form a little late. They had only 15 days to send out after purchase while compusa receipt has much longer deadline to send our rebate form. Isn't that kind of trick?   Second and most important, it slowed down everything, not a bit but by dozens of seconds  or even more than 1 minute.   Third,the speed is not only the problem, its wireless connection sucks to the maximum and a couple of my machines can't get online and can't connect to the network. I have 3 PCs and 1 laptop. Only two machine can get connected. It also conflicts with Belkin network card driver which has been so popular for so many years. How the hell McAfee did not know that adaptor?  Fourth, there is no manual whattsover and you have to all figure that out yourself. Given it has so much problem it's very frustrating to configure it. Sometimes the security center is downloading forever. Who the hell knows what it is doing. Sucks.   I had spent so much time to fine tune it and it still sucks that much. I changed back to Internet Security Suite which is much better than this. Don't buy it even they give it to you free or you will break the disk.   
 I agree with some other reviewers.  Much of the information in this book is seriously outdated.  As a native Chicagoan, I was surprised to see that the China Club was listed as a hot spot.  Well, I hate to break it to you,  but the club doesn't exist anymore.  As a matter of fact, the China Club  was turned into residential lofts at least 3 years ago!   Overall, this is  an adequate reference guide, but double check your info before embarking on  a trip 
 The idea was good but Natasha simply didn't have the talent to put it in written and understandable text. She switches all the time the "I", got me confused about who she was talking about, her or her aunt.She mixed both stories, suddenly she wants to explains her "great destiny" (narcissism) at the same time as she tells the strory about her great aunt. Those second, third, fourth, xth brother's wife, sister, uncles, all irritating narrative. I really tried to like the story, to pick and read and just gave me headaches trying to figure it out whose story she is talking. Go back to school. I don't know how the editor accepts this kind of book to be published, need a lot of editing. Maybe someone in the publishing house is her relative. 
 I have had the opportunity to read just about all the books written about Conan, so I have a little different viewpoint than the other reviewers.  What appealed to me most about the Conan saga was exactly that; the majority of his adventures could be listed in order, in accordance to the oft published "biography" of Conan that appeared in the 12 voloume series by Ace Books which reintroduced Conan to recent readers and periodically, in later books.  That is why I have a problem with this book.  It has a good story, characters, and action but doesn't fit into the the timeline.  This adventure takes place apparently before his escape from the Hyperborean slave pen and his well documented trek to Zamora and his first taste of civilation.  Heck, in this story he traveled the length of the western world. Plus he was friends with a PICT!!.  Too bad; Roberts writes Conan better than anyone since Robert Jordan, and with a more accurate placment, this book could rank up there with the best 
 If you are thinking of leaving an abusive spouse, this book may help you. The latter section, "Dealing With," is a short 'book report' based on a few sources. It doesn't read well, and it doesn't present much information. The first section, 'Identify,' wastes a lot of paper, presenting one idea on each page. It is reminiscent of "you know you're a redneck if...". Many are redundant; the last several are lame. There is a solid use for this information, but I believe it was presented poorly. The title is also misleading. "Toxic People" is too broad a category. These are ways to identify Abusers: those who are either (or both) physically and mentally abusive of others. I'm sure it will help some people, but it wasn't what I was looking for at all 
 This was one of the worst group performances I have ever seen! Unbelievable that Disney has financed this "Hack Act". And the tread has only started with other weak talented groups coming out of Disney. Save your money for a better movie 
 I was anxious to read the reviews on this book and I am happy to find its not just me! Her words and sentences are REDUNDANT! Yes "wacky artist" was used about 50 times in the span of 2 pages! Liam picked up a poker and scared the daughter! WE KNOW! Don't tell us 100 times! This is what I think: Either Ms. Steel thinks so little of her devoted audience that she feels we need to be spoon fed the material...OR she's just writing whatever comes to mind and no one is editing. Is D. Steel so popular and successful that no one has to proof read her work? Also, is it cold stone sober? Or STONE COLD SOBER? (it should have been the latter) No editor caught that mistake?  I've been a fan of Ms. Steel's work for 21 years now and the past few year's works have been deplorable! I first excused it due to the death of her son.. But her talent never picked up again. From the Ranch onward the books are just pure fluff. If you want to read a novel and not think about what you're reading...then read her books, this one especially. If you want to read and process and fall in love with characters try Barbara Delinsky, Luanne Rice, Alison Clement, Susan Wiggs.. 
 There is no shortage of Islam apologists who use perfumed pleasantries to cover the ugly truth of the world's most intolerant religion, but they aren't as intelligent, affable and widely read as Aslan.  On pages 64-65 he makes the wild and totally unsubstantiated claim that Muhammad was only betrothed to his child bride, Aisha, when she was nine, but consummated with her after she hit puberty.  Unfortunately for Aslan, every Muslim source says clearly that they were married when she was six and consummated when she was nine.  Either Aslan has not read Sahih Bukhari or Sahih Muslim, or he's baldly lying.  Since he doesn't cite his sources, we must assume the latter.  Likewise he soft peddles life in the dhimma on pages 94-95.  He gives the definition of dhimmi as "protected" but conveniently leaves out that it simultaneously means "guilty," then goes on to suggest that dhimmitude is not an example of Islamic subjugation of other faiths, but is in fact an example of Islam's high degree of tolerance!  He excuses out of hand the wholesale slaughter and mass beheading of the Jewish Banu Qurayza tribe by saying it was not at all unusual for the time and offers as proof the fact that no other local Jewish tribes complained about it.  This is a terrible book, with no citations for wild and fictional claims.  But look at the reviews from the NY Times, LA Times, London Independent, and so on: "wise, passionate, insightful" -- with vetting like that, readers would be forgiven for not knowing they are being lied to.  Beware 
 I'am unable to get this message to anyone.  This is the second book I orderd and both books are bad.  This one starting on disc #4 all is bad. I sent back the customer card and explained my displeasure but no one has contacted me.  I had the same problem on Vanishing Point, the cd left will not play on my player.  I will not order another book from You. Once I can see this happen, but twice is unacceptable 
 This movie is typical Hollywood anti-war, anti-military, anti-American trash.  The "show biz" liberals, aided and abetted by their ideological cousins, the left-wing TV news moguls, have always sought to portray American soldiers in Viet Nam as baby-killing, drug-crazed monsters.  This movie is typical of that ilk. If you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war, buy the DVD of "We Were Soldiers."--a much better, and far more honest, film 
 This may be a five-star concept, but the execution leaves much to be desired, particularly in the illustrations. The best that can be said is that the pictures are deeply colored and might make a good stained-glass project. However, the almost uniformly bird's-eye view of this "global village" fails to show much difference between the haves and have-nots, or, really, to illustrate the facts of any given page. We simply see a colorful village from the air... over and over.  The very imagery that might make these facts come alive in a child's imagination is missing. Some sense of interaction - this is a village, after all! - would help. Instead of faces, we are given a fly-over. Thus, the facts remain mere lists, and not emotionally compelling 
 This is a re-release of a 1960 booklet.  It is of interest to historical mycologists but not very useful to amateurs who need a book to keep them away from toxic mushrooms. There are some good pictures; unfortunately, most of them are on the cover of the book. 
 I think the book was too difficult to understand for the average layman without an understanding of logic. The author must have been a genius 
 I watched as much as I could stand on PBS before concluding this was not a classic 19th century novel unknown to me but a poor recent imitation, and came online to verify that.  Anyone who is enjoying watching this has presumably never seen anything based on a really good novel, like those by Dickens, Dumas, or even Wilkie Collins. What ****!  I refuse to waste my time even to see it through to the end.  This is only for people in the current generation raised to observe frequent violence rather than intelligent plot and conversation.  It is not terrible, but not worth watching if you have anything at all worth doinng with your time 
 If you are looking for a book whith detailed risk management techniques this is not your book. This book is oriented to money managers that are currently aplying risk control and want to read some stories about that. There is no practical information that allows the reader to implement a real risk control mechanism. Just ideas like "keep your volatility below 10% of your trading capital" or "make a correlation analysis of your P/L with everything to see if you find something". Too much stuff to say "be prudent"  If you want to understand the mathematics of money management, risk control and position sizing you'd better read RALPH VINCE. I suspect that those that are publicy dissapointed with optimal f do not understand the issue very well. In "the new money management" by Vince you have a clear procedure to obtain the maximum profit from your money with the risk level you are comfortable with. (dynamic fractional f).  If you (like me) are looking for new ways to get the best for your money, with examples and practical demostration of the statements so you understand every single line do not buy this book. I does not provide that.   
  one reviewer headlined this disc with the words:' there's no way I could have prepared myself for this '......uh huh....& there's no way I could prepare myself for what it must feel like to be run over by a freight train.  this disc is an excellent argument for cutting funding to NPR as it was featured on NPR. about as pleasant  as stepping into an airtight room where someone lay farting all night, about as soothing a sound as metal shards in a cuisinart.. about as comforting as smashing ones head repeatedly against a cinder block or having ones finger nails pulled out or flossing with a rusty nail. the list is long :( the love child of keith richard & yoko ono????...why is there no option for zero stars??...do not operate heavy equipment while listening to this one. or better yet, don't operate at all.....please!... at first listen I thought of grannie from the beverly hillbillies & maybe while jed was shootin' at some crude, or was it food that became crude? maybe he should have shot grannie instead because apparently she cut some demo tapes back in '64 & here they are.. so this one is getting air time on college radio? thank god I was in college a long time ago. it may be a ploy of the bush administration to get this on college radio so that young people will drop out and join the military..." oh please sir, yes I'll do anything you say & yes I'll go to iraq & die for  your stinking oil war , just don't make me listen to that screeching cat in heat with the harp again "...there you have it! yes she's from california. I'm going out on a limb here and assuming it's northern california... eclesiastical purple, harmonic convergence, patchouli, mushrooms, save the redwoods,live in a tree, nuke the whales , yada yada yada . yes there were plenty of  really bad singers in the 60's ...fast forward 40 odd years. more people = even more really bad singers... 
 I just got back from vacation where I read a handful of fun crime dramas. This one really stood out as being horrible from the very first paragraph. The writing is weak and the story was so incredibly thin that that killers were obvious from the start.   I'm not sure who the target audience is for this book, but my best guess is old guys who only read one book a year. There was a really strange mix of detail and inference. It was almost like he needed to fill space so every now and then we would get pointless detail about flying or some other random aspect of what the character was doing. And the sex scenes were just bad.   I really couldn't recommend this book any less 
 To be honest, I was a little disappointed with this book...  Don't get me wrong, I wasn't interested in a kiss and tell look into her life, but I have a feeling Tweed is much more interesting and entertaining than what this book suggests.  Most of the book covers her live moving from Canada to LA boucing from boring boyfriend to even duller boyfriend.  She finally meets Gene Simmons and she tells us how good there life is etc.  But she is obviously a hard worker, a survivor in LA movies, mixes with interesting people and is part of an intriguing relationship with Simmons - but there is little detail.  I found the "Family Jewels" DVD series far more satisfying and complimentary about her life.  For fans only.. 
 The author's recommendation is as simple as daylight: do the job during the interview. Sounds like A-B-C: Always Be Closing!  Nice sales pitch, the headhunter, let's give it a try!   I decided to apply ATH's formula to get into a Fortune 500 company.Yes, I did my research on the company, its business, competitors etc. (took me a good month of solid preparation). I created a step-by-step plan of solving a department's problems. With the help of two insiders, I got a name of a hiring manager. My people introduced me to the hiring manager. I called that manager myself; moreover, I contacted a VP of Human Resources to help me. I used the scripts and tips from ATH extensively. Oh yeah, they were so impressed with my persistence but THEY DIDN'T WANT ME TO SHOW THEM ANYTHING BEFORE THEY'VE LOOKED AT MY RESUME. By all means, I tried to avoid giving them one. THEY CLEARLY TOLD ME THAT NO RESUME WOULD MEAN NO INTERVIEW...  I had the same situation applying for a position at a Big 4 company and the Government. Online application process and "no phone calls, please" makes ATH's approach dead.  Maybe that's why Nick complains about HR people in his book and newsletters so much. There should be some other more efficient ways to get an intervew and a job.  
 I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, "Collapse" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  First off, the book centered around too much death.  The main character spent more time in mourning than anything else.  Secondly, when Jancy finally reveals her true identity and that she's been lying to Simon this whole time, he doesn't even get mad.  He just shrugs it off and acts as if it's not that big of a deal.  How can lying about who you really are not be that big of a deal?  Furthermore, when it becomes known who was trying to, more or less, sabatoge them, one page is dedicated to fighting and threatning this person to never show their face again.  One of the plots in the story is about the "papers" and to just end it like that is disappointing.  I wasn't very happy with the book;  I wouldn't have finished reading it, but I wanted to get my money's worth and though it would get better as the story line went along.  I was wrong 
 I'm mystified about how this can be one of the biggest selling HAND volumes. I think "Smoke From A Distant Fire" is passable 70s shlock, but the rest looks pathetically bad. I guess it's "Disco Duck", "Devil Woman", and "Get Closer" that reels them in 
 If you have ever purchased a Disneyland Birmbaum book before you will not need to buy another. I have the 2003 book and only two short pages were added for the "50" celebration. On top of that, attractions and dining listings are either listed wrong, missed marked on maps, or not listed at all! One dining spot that is not listed for example is the Hungrey Bear restaurant in Critter Country. I also checked my 2003 book and low, it's not listed their either. They just keep getting your money by reprinting the SAME OLD THING. I DO NOT recommend! 
 Oh my...I have owned this book since before I even moved to California.  I'm glad I didn't let this book's terrible quality stop me from moving to the mineral wonderland that is California.  The problem with this book is that it is just small scale maps of california with freaking NUMBERS plopped all over some map.  Ok, thanks a LOT for the number 14 (QUARTZ =) over Quartz Hill in Palmdale...yes, it IS made out of Quartz...massive white quartz.  The ONLY way this book is of ANY use is if you were to use it in conjunction with other maps and even then, there are scores of better works to choose from on the subject.  Don't waste your time 
 I bought this camera because I'm going to Jamaica and I needed a camera, the video camera was a bonus. When I first tested it, it was during the night time, however in a well lit room, but I couldn't see anything. I figured I could deal with that as long as it took good pictures during the day. When I stepped outside ,which was very bright and sunny, all I could see on the screen was white. I tried all the settings and still encountered a white screen. The only time I actually saw anything on my screen was when I was inside during the day.  I brought it back right away, thankfully I had bought it at Wal-Mart and they were happy to refund my money. I hope anyone reading this review will take my advice and not buy this video camera. I would have loved to give it zero stars if amazon gave that option 
 I'm not Christian. I'm Agnostic and I picked up the book because I thought it looked interesting and I wanted to learn something about Christianity.  This is perhaps one of the worst books I've ever read. Let me be clear that I am saying nothing against religion in this review. I cant judge that, but I can review this terrible writing. LaHaye and Jenkins seem to have no concept of motivation, logic, or storytelling. It's as if when writing the book they had ideas of where the characters should end up, but then used the first idea that popped into their heads about how that should happen with no critical thought at all.   As stated before, the names of the characters should have given me pause, the most egregous being Chang Wong, a name so stereotyped that I cant believe the authors have ever met an Asian. At this book in the series the world has devolved into a right wing nutjob survivalist fantasy, where the TribForce(...) is living literally underground, in rebellion against the New World Order(who call themselves, wait for it: the New World Order).   The final battle of the Apocalypse is fought on ATV's and horses.  Jesus. 
 Yes, horror fans, I'm afraid to say that the title of this review is a line uttered by one of the characters in this movie.  It wasn't necessarily the actual line that was so bad, but the delivery of that line that is cringe inducing!  That alone is worth viewing this heap of garbage for sheer camp factor.  Too bad you have to wait until near the end of the movie.  Every performance is this movie is either bottom of the barrel (observe the sheriff, his daughter, the black woman) or over the top camp (observe the witch, the whole opening sequence).   This is one of those BAD cheesy horror movies (much like ANY horror movie released in the early 1990s).  The original Pumpkinhead was one of the underrated horror classics of the '80s.  This sequel does nothing more than cash in on that (and I'm not too sure exactly how much "cash" was reaped here).   Soleil Moon Frye (who you may remember as Punky Brewster) is probably the ONLY reason to even be interested in this, and she's even awful here! She looks like an NBC movie-of-the-week Amy Fisher-esque reject and even gets offed by Pumpkinhead in one of the top clique ways you can die in a horror movie! The whole charade is just plain laughable.  The monster itself isn't half bad, but it's nowhere near as authentic as the original.  DUMB, DUMB, DUMB, DUMB 
 THOU SHALT NOT was a disappointing show because the source material (THERESE RAQUIN) has the potential to be a powerful musical.  Harry Connick Jr. penned the words and music for this show, yet it seems he has never studied some of the Broadway classics (from OKLAHOMA! thru RAGTIME) to learn how to use songs to develop character and advance the story.  He has come up with some great tunes here, but rarely do they seem to have much in common with the tragic story.  One notable exception is "The Other Hours" which is perfectly suited to the moment.  "Take her to the Mardi Gras" is a geat up-tempo dance number, but much of the rest plays like a collection of songs rater than numbers which are part of an integrated story.  Connick says he hopes to continue to work on Broadway and as I write this in March 2006 he is starring in a smash-hit revival of PAJAMA GAME.  Broadway can certainly use a composer of his talent, and we can only hope that he learns how to weave story and character into his songs for a future musical.  The cast on this CD is first-rate: Nobert Leo Butz, Craig Bierko, Kate Levering, Debra Monk are all fine. The CD is well-produced but the booklet contains only the lyrics and no notes about the show or a synopsis. Also no label or catalogue number. It seems to be a private release.  Copies were sent to Tony voters when the score was nominated (it lost to URINETOWN)and then with little fanfare the CD started showing up on Amazon and other web-retailers and in speciatly shops like New York's Footlight Records, but it has never been given general distribution.  Was this prduction jinxed? Previews had to be delayed a week because of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  Opening night Craig Bierko was accidently hit in the throat durring a fight scene and was out of the show for 2 weeks.  Kate Levering spained an ankle and was also forced out of the show for a  spell.  Maybe the ghost of Camille Raquin is more powerful than we thought 
 The hype released for this book was not honest. The writer who suffered much abuse and trauma does not become the free, sexual competent woman of the ads. She still lets herself be used by the jerks she choses to hop into bed with and from all the evidence in the book, is not really enjoying herself.She had made gains in losing weight and improving her self image, but she is by no means a model of a self assured, in control woman.Unfortunately, she has many sisters in this world. 
 "The Last American Virgin" was literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's saying a lot. It's not a surprise no one from this film went on to any sort of stardom. The writing was terrible, the acting was terrible, the direction was terrible, the pacing was terrible, the jokes were god-awful, etc. Even the girls weren't really that attractive (with the huge '80s hair and bad fashion)! I mean, what the hell was that fat, ugly, dorky girl with the glasses doing in this movie, and, even more perplexing, why was our "hero" trying to lay her?? And why was our "hero" best friends with that jerk who kept screwing him over with the girl he was in love with? They would be at each other's throats in one scene and then best friends in the next! I would say that the only redeeming quality of this movie was the soundtrack, but then they started repeating the same songs over and over again. I guess the producers ran out of money to fund the rights to extra songs. They played "Whip It" twice, "Shake It Up" at least three times, and, at last count, "Just Once" like five times, when "Once" was certainly enough. Songs that I didn't know at the beginning of the movie I  knew by heart word for word by the end. To top it all off, this movie had one of the worst, most disastrous endings I've ever seen. I can maybe understand if this was a heartfelt, coming-of-age drama, but when you're doing a mindless, teen-sex comedy, you don't end on a downer and depress the audience! After all the hell our "hero" goes through, he ends up driving home alone without the girl and still a virgin, and then, without any follow-up or warning, the credits start rolling! I was like, "What the hell?" The only great thing about the movie is that I had a ball paying "MST3K," only no one was around to appreciate my witty, sardonic remarks, so I'll have to reproduce them here for your pleasure:   On Arguing with Your "Best Friend" Over the "Love of Your Life": "Hey, I stalked her first!"   On Sparking Up a Romance with Said Girl: "Remember our awkward conversation in my pizza mobile? Didn't that mean anything to you??"   On Declaring Your Love for Said Girl: "I've loved you ever since I destroyed your bike just so you'd talk to me!"   On Major Operations, "Not that Big a Deal": Real line (referring to the girl's upcoming abortion): "Hey, it happens all the time. It's not that big a deal." My line: "Yeah, it's a simple coat hanger procedure!" (and later) Real line: "I know dozens of girls who've done it!" My line: "I've helped all the gals in the neighborhood. They call me Dr. Abortion!"   On Nerds at Parties: "Man, there's nothing cooler than sucking from a juice box with a straw! Aww, yeah!!"   On Fat Girls, Inconsistent Characterizations of: Real line: "You know I have to be home by a quarter to 12!" (a minute later) "You said you had drugs! Where are they?" My line: "I have to be home by midnight or my parents will kill me! So fu*k me in the a$$ and let's do some blow before they come home!"   On Choose Your Mate Carefully: (as our "heroes" scratch their balls after having sex with a promiscuous, older woman) "Nothing's funnier than getting gonorrhea, eh folks?!"  Skip this dreck and rent "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" instead. At least that one had Phoebe Cates 
 This work is difficult to read. There are enough exclamation points to exhaust most readers. A lack of humility and the self aggrandizement soon makes the reader quite weary. The subject matter is well woth exploring but the author gets in the way. I cannot recommend this book 
 This book is dated; the law changes at least one a month, sometimes more often. Your examiner doesn't live or work in the past or regard out-dated laws as useful tools for business. You will never know what is current, right or wrong when you trust a dated law book. NO. NO, NO, NO, GET SOMETHING NEWER 
 I bought two Lexar thumbdrives, over other brands, partially based on their rebate offers. Despite my methodical record keeping and submission, I simply got post cards saying that I did not "meet" the rebate requirements (in place of the rebate checks).  The first time it happened, I thought it was, oh well, my fault, But the same identical thing happened on my second rebate submission. This is simply frank fraud by Lexar, on a smaller scale, therefore not worth customers' time to file a complaint or to pursue it further. I hope the recent fines associated bogus rebates woke up these small time thieves and deterred them from deceiving and conning their customers again 
 The latch is pitiful.  The phone fits nicely but that latch is NOT secure.  With in 30 minutes of having it my phone came out and hit the tile floor at a customer's house.  Tons of fun watching your $500 PDA hit the ground and the battery come flying out.  Phone is ok but the case is getting replaced ASAP!!  DO NOT GET THIS CASE! 
 Well, this is one of the more inventive books I've ever read.  It was difficult to plod through, however, I continued with the hope of a great reward at the end.  The reward was small.    For awhile I was being pulled along by curiosity.  After a few chapters I grew tired of the "game" and just had to try to keep myself from getting distracted so I could finish the book.  I'm glad I actually reached the end, but I'm not sure it was worth the effort.  I realize that more scholarly types think this book is spectacular.  I'm just an ordinary reader and I found it unenjoyable 
 Our battery quit recharging after about a year.  It is very dissappointing to charge a battery for hours and then have to tell your little one that it didn't work.  It has been difficult to find another battery.  I thought the Fisher price 12-volt would work but it did not connect. Apparently, you have to buy this brand, which, by-the-way, cost about a third of the cost of our tractor!  What can you do?  
 Every once in a while, a management guru or academician writes a book so idealistic and simple in its basic premise that it appeals to scholars and businesspeople alike solely for the inherent beauty in its simplicity. Much like the appeal of fairy tales or biographies. No fuss, no complexity, no crooked lines. But whereas this way of storytelling is charming when describing a lifelong career or the fate of princess or princesses, it becomes downright repulsive when applied to modern business and economics. Not only repulsive, but also dangerous.  Jensen is learned and a fine raconteur at that, which he uses to his advantage in this book. The basic premise, that corporations of today are selling stories instead of products is intriguing, if not completely original (Pine & Gilmore described the progression of economic offerings towards experience and entertainment in their 1999 book "The Experience Economy"). Had Jensen stayed within the boundaries of a conventional management book, i.e. simplified descriptions and corporate nice-to-know facts, The Dream Society would have been a fair effort, if slightly trivial. The big misstep that Jensen makes is that he, like too many other colleagues, starts to add a philantrophical aspect to his ideas. Not only can the striving towards a dream society be applied to goods and services, but also on the modern family, on the third world, on modern labour, globalization, urbanization etc. In fact, so amazing is Jensens Dream paradigm that there is no area or phenomenon that is left unexplored. Actually, "unexplored" is an inaccurate description. There is no area that Jensen doesn't beleaguer with his newly found buzzword-baby. That's where the book sets off on thin ice. To fully explore a principle, such as "The Dream Society", one must look at its flaws and dangers. The term "fundamentalist" is what we use to describe the people that don't and instead take the written word as the formula to follow. Jensen displays similar dogma and fanaticism in his belief that The Dream Society is our goal and destiny. As he runs astray from the description of economic offerings, he looses the integrity that he displays in the early chapters of the book, his "succesful" attempts to apply the theory to, well, anything become more comical... and questionable 
 Gaines spent a month in Bergenfield and tried to turn others' pain into her gain. The book reads like her website: Look at me! Look at me! Look at me! She should be ashamed of herself 
 This is the same old liberal tripe repackaged into another paranoid "I Hate George W. Bush" tome.  Can't the left come up with anything better than this garbage?  Here's a summary of every one of these absurd books, including Hightower's:  George W. Bush is evil; George W. Bush is unintelligent; George W. Bush lied; George W. Bush stole the 2000 election; George W. Bush started the Iraq War to benefit Haliburton; George W. Bush lets corporations run the country...blah blah blah. It's the same tired crap with a different cover.    Don't waste your money 
  This book was selected for an introductory statistics course at my university and ALL of the students absolutely LOATHE it. Unfortunately John Rice and/or Duxbury publishing have failed to realize that when it comes to mathematics, a textbook is only as good as the solutions to the exercises that it provides. With this book, THERE IS NO DETAILED SOLUTIONS MANUAL- only 'numbers' at the back that will in many cases leave even the strongest student absolutely clueless as to how the answer was obtained. Take for example, question 21 from chapter 1, which is one of the easier questions in the textbook. It asks a very standard probability question: 'What is the probability of being dealt a straight in poker?' When solving this problem, even an avid poker player might not think to subtract the number of straight flushes from the numerator (which is reasonable because it technically IS a different hand). So the student will flip to the back and see a 'minus forty' in the answer, and have no idea why it's there. And I must emphasize, THIS IS ONE OF THE EASIER QUESTIONS IN THE BOOK. With the proof questions (some of which are quite challenging) there are no answers whatsoever.   If you have a choice, you would be far better off purchasing 'An Introduction to Mathematical Statistics and Its Applications' by Richard Larsen and Morris Marx. It is deals with the topic at the same level as the Rice textbook, but is far superior in its presentation, examples, practice questions, and solutions. Many students in the course that I'm taking actually went out and bought this textbook (it was used to teach the course in previous years) because the Rice textbook is so bad.   
 Treats some of the stories of the Civil War in the west without explaining the larger issues.  This is an inexpensive book, but not necessarily a good value 
 Just another white man trying to prove Europeans and other non-Indians brought civilization to Ixachilan. It is easy to see why he would be jealous...Indigenous Americans had the most advanced civilizations in the world as of 1519.  The largest city in the world was Mexico-Tenochtitlan. The Mexica had the largest library in the world with information on more subjects than any other civilization. (Soustelle) They were also more advanced in medicine than Europeans. (Soustelle) The Aztec/Mayan calendars are still the most accurate calendars in the world. (Mann) Ancient Mexicans genetically engineered maize in man's first and greatest feat of genetic engineering. (Mann) Mayans invented the concept of 0 before any other civilization on Earth...Europeans did not understand it until recently. (Mann) They were also the greatest mathematicians the world has ever seen. The Olmecs knew that the Earth was round thousands of years before it was accepted in Europe. The Aztec pyramids are the largest in the world. Caral, in South America, will probably be proven to be the oldest of Earth's civilizations. The pyramids at Caral are older than any in Egypt. So now I ask the author of this book how Europeans could have brought us civilization before they had it themselves 
 I have 50 pages to go and I can't wait to finish this boring waste of time. Very predictable, sappy, sweet and quite meaningless.  I give it a minus 1 
 I agree with the two other negative reviews here and am surprised there aren't more dissenting opinions. This movie made me feel embarrassed for the people in it. The topic would seem to have a lot of potential but the folks who are featured are repulsive and there is not enough in-depth exploration of the art to make it interesting. The story rambled, and the Americans (yes, that includes Paul Pena) behaved so awkwardly it was painful to watch. There was just a low-level vulgar tone throughout the whole movie. In many scenes, Paul totes a beer and looks like an indigent. He comes across as pathetic, socially tone deaf, and totally unworthy of his own talent. Mario was a boor - always coming up with something obnoxious, loud, and totally irrelevant to say. (Why the hell he was invited on the trip is a mystery.) The filmakers did a poor job of setting up the story and getting me to care about it or anyone in it. Don't bother with this one. 
 i just finished reading the book.  there is nothing in it about velocity... It's boring, predictable and has lots of "filler text 
 Perhaps I'm just getting old, and maybe I just have such a special place in my heart for Dionne's recordings from earlier in her career, but this recording just doesn't cut it.  I understand the necessity and the desire to "update" old hits from one's singing career to make them "sing" to a new generation of listeners, but there is an annoying sameness to each song.  The electronic instruments dominate way too much, particularly the percussion.  Where's an acoustic piano?  Not one horn?  Not even a small string section?  This must have been a pretty low budget project.  If you are a Dionne Warwick fan or are eager to listen to her music for the first time, first go back to her recordings from the 60's.  Then try some of her music from the "Heartbreaker" and "Deja Vu" period.  But don't waste your money on this one.  I hope Dionne's next project has a bit more imagination and better instrumental arrangements.  
 If you were hoping for a skin flick, this is not it.  A couple of minutes of long shots of the young girls swimming topless and one real nice look at Julie McCullouh (...), in bed, is not enough too qualify.  The acting is awful.  Angie looks great for her age.  Still not enough 
 The author presents the reader with an Aladdin's Cave of information. However, with only a cursery attempt at analysing the growing body of evidence as to the aetology and pathophysiology of these illnesses, newcomers to FM/CFS are left to determine that which is credible for themselves. With the gathering mountain of clinical and scientific understanding of FM/CFS now available it is disappointing that a book of this recency hasn't taken a more considered and focused approach. Veterans of FM/CFS will be disappointed; newcomers will struggle to determine the wood from the trees.   
 This product is not the 11th edition but in fact is the 9th addition. a waste of money if you are looking fot the 11th edition 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 I've read The Other Boleyn Girl and a great deal of Philippa Gregory's other works and found them to be thoroughly enjoyable and hard to put down.  It is therefore unfathomable to me that she could have written such a disgusting, morally-repulsive "novel" (and I use the term loosely)such as this.    This book is about a woman's desperate need to retain control of the land she grew up on.  Land which, by legal rights, passed to her dimwitted, sexually depraved, mouse of a brother.  The incest scenes are rife and horrifyingly detailed.  I could not bring myself to even finish this book, and I certainly was not about to read the final two in the trilogy.  If you have even the smallest thread of moral fiber...run the other way.  This book will make you ill 
 I've never really been a great fan of the band but I have to say that I did like "Every Woman in the World" and "All Out of Love" when I first heard them and for these reasons and possibly because the 9 tracks probably represent the best they have ever done this is a good compilation for the casual listener or those who are curious and looking for a sampler of the band.    The sound in this cd isn't that great given the many other remastered versions out there and so I'd recommend you get those instead if you have more than just a passing curiosity of the band.  To put it another way, if I could do it over, I'd not get this cd but some other more recently remastered release.    Overall, as examples of great musicianship and/or songwriting, I suppose Air Supply never were but as syrupy love-song crooners, few could outdo them during that very brief period in the early 80s.  
 I could not wait to get this bag.  When I did I found out that it was not all that it was in for. I have to walk home and it really hurts my back.  Plus, it does not hold much.  I had the problem of having to much books. This does not help. It was a waste of $40. Plus, how do you clean it? 
 No wonder there is so little said about this award-winning Faulkner work. It is a chore to read. Only in a few passages does the reader have the sense that the writer can tell a good story. Worse than that, the  characters are like Rorschak blots with the Christian mythology mixed in.  Stick with Faulkner's southern writings for characters who remain in your  memory and images that are profound 
 This mini-series takes advantage of the fans' interest in the love triangle.  Two different endings were shot, so that not even the actors knew who Christy would choose.  Unfortunately, this decision to keep the viewer guessing until the final scene makes Christy looks like a flake. By the time this soap opera ended, I didn't care about Christy's fate; I was feeling too sorry for both the men in her life.  Catherine Marshall's characters deserve better. Stewart Finlay McLennan is excellent as Neil; I wish he had an experienced actress playing Christy and a script worthy of his talent 
 It seems I'm the minority here, but I believe this was one of the worst books I have ever read. Maybe it's only because I have no interest in politics what so ever, or that I was forced to read it for school. But in my opinion "Profiles in Courage" was so incredibly boring, it's not even funny. It wasn't well written or even very informative at all. It would mention political events, but not go in to any detail, so you must have a lot of prior knowledge to understand what's going on. Honestly, these senators seemed to be more stubborn than courageous. And I really don't care how dome shaped Daniel Webster's head was 
 To borrow a phrase from The Bard, methinks the lad doth protest too much.  The point of Owen LaFave, former husband of the infamous Debra, LaTourneau wannabe, in this collaboration with Bill Simon, seems twofold:  (1) "I am not gay!"  (2) "I am not sexually inadequate!" In this telling of the tale of Deb's predation on a student, the reader is constantly reminded of the 2 mantras above.  As to WHY this might have happened, then, the following lame excuses/speculations are propounded by these two guys with no training in any relevant area: 1.)	the abuse excuse - she was raped at age 13, and so continued the crime 2.)	Momma made me do it! 3.)	The Birth Control pill made me do it! 4.)	Unsatisfying home sex life (propounded merely to give Owen another opportunity to deflate any thought of it.)  Although filled with filler of the childhoods, adolescence, and early adulthoods (sans the growing up part, which it appears neither ever attained) of Owen and Deb, there are no pictures of any of this, which, to this reviewer, is a requisite of these type books.  Except for descriptions worthy to make Larry Flynt glint, there is little to learn here.  /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer. 
 While reading this book, I had the feeling that the author was making his observations from the perspective of an overgrown teenager, home from school around 3 pm and making puerile rants at the (...) tube, while downing a coke and potato chips. The author, who has said elsewhere that TV has become "our ground of being," borrowing Paul Tillich's phrase, doesn't seem to acknowledge or understand that most American adults work hard for a living and really don't invest a lot of mental effort in watching TV.  They're actually busy with making dinner, dealing with their kids, paying the bills, downing a couple of cool ones, and getting up in the morning to do it over again.  This is not to disparage the hard working American, but rather to suggest that most people really don't take TV all that seriously, or even pay it much attention.  Just because the TV is on, doesn't mean people are watching it, or at least watching it critically.  They have more basic needs to attend to. From 1980 to 2002, the time on the job (any job) has increased by about ten hours a week. I don't think information or pseudo information gets through to a culture that is so sleep-deprived.  (...)  Additionally, Gitlin takes his subject matter entirely too seriously. I mean understanding media was pretty much covered by McLuhan, and, just as A. Whitehead said that all philosophy was a footnote to Plato, one could say the same for McLuhan in relationship to his progenitors. Additionally, Gitlin's perspective's really couldn't be that profound since he seems to be called upon by the media as the academic in residence for news shows.  I think it may be time for some producers to cull their rolodexes (or is that palm pilots?) I started this book, believing I would be at least somewhat intellectually challenged, but in the end, the sentences sort of just rolled over me like a syndicated drama series rerun 
  Simply put: Don't support the Faux News Channel or anyone affiliated with it.  There are much better ways to spend your hard earned money 
 If you're wondering what happened to Beck Weathers after he was rescued from Everest in 1996... keep wondering. This inappropriately titled book focuses on the climb itself and Beck's life story, with almost no details on how Beck managed to surmount the terrible injuries he suffered while climbing Everest. Details of the climb itself occupy about 1/3rd of the book; 109 of it's 335 pages. It's the same story you've already read in "Into Thin Air", "The Climb", "High Exposure", and numerous magazine articles. Beck's telling is more informal and provides less detail than those other sources. Interspersed with Beck's narrative are occasional quotes from his wife, family, friends, or other participants in the climb(e.g. Charlotte Fox and Madan K.C.). Ultimately, this portion of the book proves unsatisfying if you're read any other material concerning the 1996 climbing season on Everest. The remainder of the book covers Beck's life story: his family life, difficulties with depression, family and marriage problems, and previous climbs. Those who bought "Left for Dead" with an interest in mountain climbing will be disappointed with the rather short descriptions of Beck's previous climbs. The final chapter, say 40 pages, describes the surgeries and rehabilitation needed to recover from the injuries suffered on Everest, along with family life at the time, and the death of his wife's brother. Again, the chapter moves along quickly without much detail. While this book is somewhat entertaining, it reads like a transcription of several hours of telephone interviews with all the limitations that implies; one wonders if co-author Stephen Michaud was simply the typist who transcribed these conversations. In the end, while you may have learned a bit more about Beck Weathers and what he went through on and after Everest, he still remains largely an enigma. 
 As someone who was absolutely blown away by 'Waiting' I anticipated loving this as well. I did read a pre-publication proof that I found used in a local bookstore, so maybe there were some big changes between the proof and the finished product, but I was very disappointed in this story. As a few other reviewers have pointed out, the characters are totally one-dimensional, and Jian, the narrator, is relatively uninteresting and one doesn't really care what becomes of him. Plus, while what happened to Professor Yang after the Revolution was horrible, i'm sure it happpened to many, many intellectuals, so it wasn't that out of the ordinary. Finally, and I don't know if this was in the final novel or not, there is a note from the author at the end thanking someone for 'seeing the potential for this when she first read it in 1988.' So, my fear is that this is one of those first novels that was rejected, and suddenly, when a writer has success (as with 'Waiting') their earlier work magically is worthy of publication.   Overall, not a great novel, but an interesting view of pre-Tiannammen Square China, and Ha Jin is a good writer, and 'Waiting' was SO good that this wouldn't stop me from reading something else by him, but i'd pass on this one if I were you.. 
 Author presented the book to a class by first starting out with a discussion of UFOs, spewing forth misinformation throughout the discussion.  If he's wrong on that, the book isn't worth reading 
 An accessible story with all the elements of a Great American Novel was somehow transformed into a perverse, worst of the worst ABC Afterschool Specials. If you had not read the book, you would be unable to follow what was happening. Some of the worst directing and editing I have seen in a long time. The original Evil Dead, with all its flaws, is a better put together film than this one. This movie is flat-out painful to watch. You get no justifications whatsoever as to why the characters behave as they do. It all seems so random. Read the book. If you see this movie in a rental store, just move along, please, nothing to see here 
 While I am not a great duo fan, and recommend MF get back to those lushly orchestrated back-ups, these tunes are uplifted as good as I have ever heard them. My only gripe is that sometimes, MF gets a little too slow for my tastes. He can be like a Shirley Horn of a different gender, so I found this album drags too much. It's like listening to a doctoral dissertation of Buxtehude.   Finally, I am an old Shearing Quintet lover, and boy would that have made this a gem. Shearing has not won me over as a paino player like say Brubeck or Evans, but with the quintet setting he is an icon nonetheless 
 What an odd book. It is so fully of empty speculation, completely fabricated incidents, theological nonsense that I finished it first wanting a shower, and second doubting if Albino Luciani had actually ever been pope. Seriously, this is perhaps the only verifiable fact in these (almost) 400 poorly written, wretchedly edited, repetitious, absurd pages. The entire book seems to have been fabricated out of whole cloth in order to "prove" that Luciani (John Paul I) was an ultra-liberal who was going to overturn the Church's traditional teachings on homosexuality (with which the author seems obsessed) and the ordination of women. He was even going to sell off the Vaticans real estate holdings in Rome and kick the Old Testament out of the Christian canon!   I would doubt anything contained herein besides the most rudimentary facts (which are much more engagingly and reputably presented elsewhere, most notably in a lovely little volume titled "The Smiling Pope" by Raymond and Lauretta Seabeck, which also contains numerous real writings by Papa Luciani). If you are interested in unraveling the "mystery" of John Paul's sudden death, the book "A Thief in the Night" by John Cornwell (hardly the Vatican stooge Gregoire makes him out to be) is still an excellent, superbly documented, exquisitely written source.  Granted, the death of Luciani, who was a conservative when it came to doctrine, though perhaps relatively moderate on most social issues, was a terrible human tragedy, and a real blow to progressive, pro-Vatican II forces within the Church. His would have been, perhaps, a much more flexible, decentralized, and humane Church than that which his succesor, John Paul II erected. But if you want a clearer understanding of his place in the history of faith, then STAY AWAY FROM THIS WORK OF ABJECT FICTION! Better to consult one of the books noted above, or to find a used copy of Luciani's own under-apprecated masterwork, "Illustrissimi", in which the humor and warmth and supple mind of this good man come through clearly. Better, too, to wait patiently in joyful hope for the apprearance of a real,  thorough, reputable biography of John Paul I, a humble and sincere servant of God who touched the world (and changed the Church) in spite of his extremely brief tenure as pope. 
 A very lively and fictional tale of how Masonry is taking over the world.  Another world conspiracy book, with the unfortunate problem of not being accurate.  Proposes that the real control of Britain and the world is through Masonry.  Read " A Pilgrim's Path" by John Robinson instead.  I wonder if I can get a refund 
 I was very pleased with my first under the counter radio/cd playerplayer. After three years the volume lower button wore out so I had to replace it.  I ordered the identical player but it was terrible. I can play store bought CD's but the radio reception is terrible.  I can't get all my usual stations and there is a lot of interference. I would definately recommend NOT to buy this item 
 Before you read the book, look at the sources.  I only found one scientific paper out of hundreds of sources. Everything else has to be classified as opinions.  Sources for this book  include news stories and testimonies in congress.  I will point out by two examples (not from the book, but from information that you are probably familiar with) why these are not good sources. I recall the news stories based on the opinions of experts that said it would take five years to put out the oil well fires started in the first Gulf War.  They were all wrong.  It took six months.  CEO's and others testified before congress about tobacco products being non-addictive.  Were they correct? No! So when we read this book, we can't be sure of anything.  It is a book of opinions and ideas.  Some of them may be good, but they may also be bad.  This is why we have science and the scientific method.  Even science may be corrupted at times or fail until we have a better understanding. Even if Mr. Gore had scientific papers, it is unlikely that he could judge whether they really support his environmental views.  He would need a Ph.D. or at least a lot of experience in the proper field(s) to interpret scientific papers properly.  This book discusses how corporations are unfriendly to the environment. Surely some of them are.  But so is the government.  When the government plant at Fernald, Ohio, (near Cincinnati) was accused of poluting the soil and water with radioactive waste, the government denied, dragged its feet, and fought in court. The government lost it case because there was obvious guilt, but the government did not hestitate to fight against the very people it represents. When you or I appear to be at fault in an auto accident, do we admit it and offer to pay all claims, or do we take a less candid approach as our insurance company suggests?  We might even think we are not at fault. Mr. Gore has denied being at fault countless times in his political career, but he can't believe that a corporation should do anything but admit guilt, accept every environmental claim that is made, and pay large sums of money.  Mr. Gore is an elitist.  First, he believes that he is an environmental expert because he has heard a lot of opinions. He doesn't need an advanced degree in environmental science  or experience in that field.  He just knows better because he is Al Gore. Secondly, he sees how he uses the environment and how you should use the environment quite differently.  When he was Vice President, he flew to Kyoto, Japan, to symbolically (read unnecessary trip) approve the Kyoto Treaty.  He used more than 180,000 gallons of fuel in a private government plane in one day.  My wife and I can drive our cars and heat our house for our lifetimes and never use this amount of fuel.  During his Presidental campaign, Mr. Gore would fly a private jet to his son's games.  I have no great objection to the former Vice President doing these things as long as he doesn't start telling me how I am abusing the environment, that I should drive an electric car, ...  I do have trouble believing his environmental views are anything but political.  If you like the views in the book, read it and feel good.  If you don't like the views, read it for some good laughs.  There are plenty of flaws.  Books like this make money, but they don't make good science, and they don't produce good policy.  Don't forget to recycle the book 
 Once I read the description on the author, about how she's a screenwriter, it all makes sense.  I mean this in the sense that the text is not lyrical.  It's just there to serve the purpose of conveying the plot, nothing else.  There's no poetry to the writing.  Like many have said already, the characters lack depth, the plot is not much more than a soap opera, the recipes are added to the writing almost as an afterthought (they're just dropped in), and the ending is so forced and abrupt and ODD, that the book just left me feeling like I wasted my time reading it.  I did find the smattering of information about the Mexican revolution interesting.  Maybe I'm too much of a realist and enjoy nonfiction too much, but this story just was not for me 
 I recently borrowed this from our library for our 3yo dd to watch.  Plus, I wanted to see if it was any good before potentially buying.  She watched it once, while I glanced at it every now and then while doing housework.  Since I missed some parts, I played it again to catch the parts I missed even though I wasn't very impressed with what I saw.  As I put the DVD in the 2nd time, my dd said, "No, not this one again!"  Obviously, my 3 yo has good taste too!  We own the 2 original movies, and a few DVD's of the episodes from the 80's and she MUCH prefers those.  She'd watch the DVD's from the 80's over and over in a row if only I'd let her!  I didn't care for the annimation style or the story plot.  Plus, since when did they make Funshine a boy?  I thought Funshine was a girl?!  We won't be adding this title to our collection.  Buy the original Care Bears or Strawberry Shortcake or Rainbow Brite. . . all of which are big hits with my dd 
 Forget this Cliff Notes crap! Just read Night. It's a great book and it won't even take you long to read. I wish I could give this Cliff Note book zero stars 
 Instead of reviewing which most people have already done and I agree somewhat, what I don't agree with is someone on here said the live version of "I just want to make love to you" was the better known version, this is far from the truth. The studio version of the song WAS the semi-hit, NOT the live version which is why radio always plays the studio version. Also, someone mentioned that Rhino needs to release the entire catalog..people, Rhino did that back in 1990, in fact, all are still available except "Night Shift" (for some reason lord only knows why) but they have been released which also brings me to this, the "Wounded Bird" label is in fact re-releasing AND remastering the entire Foghat catalog. See, you got all bent out of shape for nothing!!!!! 
 Do not bother to buy this sewing machine case.  It is crappy!  Don't be fooled by the "Universal" phrase of this product.  I have a Brother sewing machine so i bought this item. When i got it, i placed my sewing machine and i rattles around inside the case.  I don't see what is so "Universal" about this.  There is too much room inside and my machine tips over to its sides when i lift to carry the case.  It's terrible!!!  I'd give NO star but i don't have that choice on the selection.  I wanted to return it but it's not worth the shipping charge that will incure on my refund due to Amazon's policies.  By then i would probably only get at most $12.00 back in refunds 
 I purchased the ab lounge 2 online, but returned it the same day.  It's too bulky & heavy.  I wanted it for my bedroom to use in the mornings while watching the news, but it's too heavy to move around, and it DOES NOT FOLD.   I put it together in my living room, and then tried to get it into my bedroom BUT IT WOULDN'T FIT THROUGH THE DOOR.  I had to un-screw the bars, fold & pull it through the door.  If I had put the AB Lounge 2 downstairs, then I would never use it.  Unless you want the "AB LOUNGE 2" to be a "PERMANENT" fixture in your bedroom or living room, then I would order something else.  I need this thing to be where I can easily use it & then put it away.......The Ab Lounge 2 is way too big & bulky for that.  Unless you have a room where it will remain a permanent fixture, then don't buy it.  I'm buying the "Ultra" Ab Lounge because it folds for easy storage....It's more expensive, but to me it's worth the convenience of having the "EASY" storage capability.  I don't my exercise equipment to be sitting in my bedroom or living room when it's not in use. 
 This book stinks, the plot is trivial, the characters suck, and the chapters go on and on and on and on and on about nothing, nothing at all.   Here is my favorite passage from the book "There was nothing for him to do but roll over and try to sleep.  Somewhere, sometime, he had even forgotten how to cry."  Yeah the entire book is like that.   
 Power of Purpose would make a great magazine article, but there is not enough content here to make a good book.  "Creating Meaning in Your Life..." is not what this book is about.  There is lots of talk about  how important it is to have purpose in your life, but little about how to  create it.  Mr. Leider has a great reputation -- it must have come from his  other books 
 The high praise heaped on this is by people who have never actually read anything by George Orwell ( OR Francis Schaeffer, or Theodore Dalrymple or even John Mortimer -for the loyal opposition)-Trite, smug and arrogant opinions that warm themselves by the fires of this anti intellectual screed should have the honesty to read Paleo Conservative journals like AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE to see that discontent with neocon foreign policy ( that went on for a FULL 8 years under Clinton as well) is challenged by BOTH those on the left AND the right.It is the lack of intellectual analysis and clarity that has created our current crisis. TRY reading "HOW SHALL WE THEN LIVE?" by SCHAEFFER or DALRYMPLE's "OUR CULTURE ,WHAT's  LEFT of IT" for a more intelligent and cogent analysis 
 The story is set up very well but goes nowhere. The world(present day England)from inside the mind of 15/y.o. autistic(or some similar syndrome)boy. Loaded with lots of gimmicks to fill up pages and make it look like a real book--lists, footnotes, sketches, diagrams, puzzles, maps, doodles, graphs and even an appendix. After 15 pages inside Christopher's mind one gets the basic feeling of how he sees the world and reacts to it. I personally don't think one needs 226 pages to get this across. After the first one third of the book the story became repetitive, tedious and boring 
 I feel skeptical about NIN singles ever since they have stopped releasing them domestically in the USA. The singles just haven't been as good. The ONLY good thing about this single is the Live At Rehearsals version of Love Is Not Enough. It has a raw and rough feeling that I appreciate from the NOW too over-produced NIN. The DFA remix of THTF is too long - drawn out and redundant... like a bad techno song. Buy this if you collect Halos (like I do)... but if you're looking for a great single with great remixes... look for the promo 12inches instead. 
 I am a huge Berg fan, but this book did not cut it with me. The main character, Patty, is approaching mid-life and desperately wants a child.  Ethan was her first love and continues to be "the love of her life."  He also loves Patty dearly, so what is the problem?  Ethan is gay and his love for Patty is that of a cherised, long-time friend; they feel comfortable together. Patty asks Ethan to impregnate her so they can raise a child but, of course, marriage is out of the question.  We are not talking in-vitro fertilization here or anything that might be plausible, but a pregnancy developed by a good old-fashioned "romp in the hay"...or in the case, the bed!  Patty gets her wish, she has a baby girl.  In the end, Ethan also gets his wish, he finds "the love of his life" in another man.  As for the baby, well, we can only hope everything worked out well for her, too, but we will never know because that is where the story ended.  The problem with the book has nothing to do with sexual orientation but the fact the plot and events were just too inconceivably far-fetched.  For the past 20 years, two of my very best friends (men) have been in a committed gay relationship.  They are literary scholars and avid readers.  When I ran the scenario of this book by them to see what their reaction would be, they thought either the book was nuts, I was nuts for reading it...or possibly both. On top of that, the book has a juvenile writing style that makes one wonder where Berg's thought process was when she wrote it.  Like Picasso, she must have been going through her "blue period!"  Ms. Berg, you missed the mark on this one 
 i still not receive this item, i have wait for a month already! 
 First off, special effects mean nothing compared to actual quality. But at least this is better than the abomination that was JAWS.  The only dinosaur movie I can think of that's worse than this is RAPTOR, which consists of parts of the three Carnosaur movies cut & pasted together.  It has some redeeming feature in that Ian Malcom and John somedoy (I forget his last name... the guy who owns the park) were actually interesting characters. I guess Steve Speilberg finally realised that monster/animal attack movies only work when you have characters people are going to give a monkey's rear end about. Unfortunately, the boring, stereotypical Alan Grant was the central character in this.  If you want to watch a Steven Spielburg movie that's actually good, watch E.T. or something. Or "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" (even though recommending a sequel may seem lame, the sequel is a million times better than this)  If you want to see a dinosaur movie, then watch either the sequel to this movie, or Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Lost World". I would also recomend the 'Carnosaur' movies but I think they're out of print.  If you want to see a movie where Sam Neill plays an interesting chracter, watch 'In the Mouth of Madness' or 'Triangle'  But definitely avoid this movie. The only reason I even own it is because it was sold in a box set with "The Lost World: Jurassic Park 
  There are about 20% power thoughts in this CD/Book and rest are unpractical nonsense.  Nonsense like:  "I love every cell of my body" "Let the universe's solution come to you" "I am decisive in my decisions.  If I make a poor one, I'll just make another one."  I guess if you are completely foolish or just ignorant, this book will not help you much.  Your mother probably gave you much more and better advise than this book.  
 I know, Goldy got another movie later, but here we see why he ISN'T THE next 'Rock'. Supoorting cast is pretty bad  and belgian kickboxing Champ Van Dam just isn't Schwarzenegger (that says a lot!) and movie night filming doesn't help! Props and fake US army set up looks like something out of a Return of the Living Dead set! Not really any- thing to right home about unless you're into Bill Goldberg, "Next stop, intensive care...", just like Van Dam and B.G.'s careers after this movie. Can you beleive Van Dam did (another) sequel?! 
 Simply a big dissappointment. Could perhaps be considered a good introduction to the media for an absolute beginner, but lacks depth for any serious practitioner. Too American for my taste as well. Avoid 
 This has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read.  It was boring.  You would think that a erotic fiction book would be at least a little bit sensual.  It was not.  Don't  waste your money 
 One of the best books for first course in topology. There is some weakness in the second part, but for the first course of topology this book is great. 
 The author clearly has done his research and "digging" when it comes to the facts. Then how come he is so bitter? Jennings spends too much time not only disputing almost every other book about the French and Indian  War, but also "wrestling to the ground" any thesis in opposition  to his own! He comes off sounding bitter, cranky and unattractive. His  glosses over the military aspects of the war as if these details are  beneath the serious historian--why? It was a war after all! It is not a bad  reference book but as far as read-don't bother 
 okay. Your first pointer: Do Not Buy. I have been plaing the guitar for 1.5 years but I will tell you I did not start out on this guitar. My neighbors have one and somtimes i'll try to tune it but it dosn't matter because they never play it. the strings never stay tuned and they are horrible quality strings. I own a Gibson Les Paul Epephone. It is my third guiar. Do not even buy your child a guitar unless they are interested. A way you can tell is, How creative are they? How often do they use thier right brain? If they are interested you have to spend atleast $115 for a nice guitar. My eleven year old self hopes that this helped you/ Thank you very much.   
 Layla is one of the most overrated songs of all time. Cream is one of the most boring bands in history. Why not do yourself a favour and buy enjoyable bands like Dire Straits, and Metallica who rock.  PS.This Clapton compilation has no good songs so please don't buy it at all 
 This book is a real dissapointment.  If you love bland food and only moderately interesting taste this books for you.  I have been cooking for 35 years 
 I'll start off by saying that this movie had a lot of promise in the beginning. The dialogue (especially a lot of Sebastion's lines) was really witty and smart.  But somewhere near the climax, the movie turned into another sappy teen romance movie. That really disappointed me. I was hoping for something a little more than that. And (SPOILER) what also really disappointed me about this movie was when Annette lost her virginity. Her character changed so fast that it was unbelievable! It would have been more interesting if she had stayed a virgin 
 This book resembles two men with a vendetta over people with a solution.  Using a lot and I mean a lot of statistics they turn the data to favor their arguments.  If one school out of many supports their claim, that is the stat they use, ignoring the stronger evidence.  The authors do not offer solutions beyond "there should be changes made nation wide." These are the same people who write the mellon report, so getting additional attention is their goal, over informing a reader 
 I purchased this and am not impressed.  Note that "works with all click wheel iPods" isn't true.  It does NOT work with photo iPods (at least the 60 GB model). I'm on vacation and had to remove the cover to get it to fit.  I'm ordering a 'photo dock' since I can't see any way to get a cover that is made for the 60GB/photo model.  If I'd known this, I'd purchased only the stereo cable and the photo dock separately, since I already have a charger (came with it...).  Grr.  :- 
 I was really looking forward to this book. I'm not sure when I have been so disappointed in a story after all of the hype.  I was raised in mid-west and expected a serious story about trials of a disfunctional family. What a total waste of time. Turd fantasy is not my idea of great literature. Worst book I have read since "Running with Scissors".  I don't need to waste my time on this psychotic drivel parading as great art 
 Every since Bill Maher made his sympathetic comments with regard for the cowardly terrorists who caused so much pain for this country on 9/11, I've had no use or interest in his musings whatever they may be. I encourage anyone who considers purchasing anything that will benefit him to consider this 
 This is a collection of essays - some good - and some are so stupid and childish that I couldn't get passed them and I gave the book away - I couldn't tolerate having it in my house!! 
 The main disappointment with this movie was the excessive number of shots of the cars zipping through empty roads as compared to the number of points won by mowing down citizens. Actually not that many of the latter - the satire (such as it is) could have been much sharper and more extravagant here. Did the Director feel that stepping up that side of it would be too shocking?   Otherwise the movie has an agreeable facile sense of the period (bad hair styles, would-be funky music, absurd sets, inane plot, cheapo design all round). So worth a watch. But not the witty classic I had expected 
 Well, I just had to try another Dr. Phil book, since it has been a number of years since I read Life Strategies. To be honest, even though he can be a polarizing figure, I have nothing against him. I think his TV is a source of help and inspiration for thousands of people.  This book however, was a real struggle to complete. It was not coherently structured, and the author kept saying things like "This book will show you...." all the way through the book. It felt like I never left the "Introduction" and he was continually trying to convince me (or himself) that this book really would eventually get to the point and that the point would be profound. Instead it really couldn't ever get moving and instead often relied on crass language as a weak attempt to get the reader's attention.  Fret not! There are other books out there that tackle the same general issue, but are far better reads. I recommend:  1. Failing Forward, by John C. Maxwell 2. Today Matters, by John C. Maxwell  Again, I have no issue with the author, and applaud his efforts. However, in writing a review to my fellow Amazon customers, I must strongly recommend that you spend your time on more impactful literature within this genre. Best of success to you in reaching your goals 
 This item sounded great in the ad, but the only thing right in the ad is that it's pocket-sized. No one can understand what I say through it.  When the volume is turned up, the sound becomes fuzzy and incoherent. I thought this would be a great device, but no one can understand me 10 feet away, much less 200.  If you order this device, save the box it came in so you can send it back and get a refund.  WARNING: The shipping is non-refundable 
 This is sabotage rather than a tribute to Tupac.  This doesn't do him justice.  Listening to this CD, I thought of "This is Spinal Tap" - the part where they have the miniature version of stonehenge, and everyone is looking around thinking "what the hell is going on?"  That must have been how Tupac felt at this show.  The part of the CD where you can actually hear someone flipping through "all eyez on me" trying to find the right song...that was when I knew this CD was crap.  Tupac put great pride into the quality and sound of his work.  This is an abomination.  Well, what more can you say?  Death Row needed a little extra holiday bling, I guess.... My recommendation - don't buy it.  You might as well just listen to All Eyez on Me and sing along.  
     I read a good short story by Franzen in The New Yorker a couple years ago, but this book is lame, lame, lame.  The essays contain little to no humor or insight- they are just lengthy, boring opinions on various subjects.  Imagine if you can a duller, less-relavant Andy Rooney.  If I wanted to read some loser's uninspired musings, I would get on the internet and start reading weblogs.  I hereby declare this book Unreadable 
 Starring Tony Perkins perfectly miscast as a major league ballplayer. What can you say? The Red Sox have Jimmy Pirsall, Tony Perkins and "Fear Strikes OUT". The Yankees have Lou Gehrig, Gary Cooper and "Pride of the Yankees".  
 "It must now be self-evident that there is a vast gulf between the Jesus of history and the Jesus of faith."  This is Baigent's theme in "The Jesus Papers."  But does he succeed?  Does he provide evidence to prove his assertion, or even lead a careful reader to consider his claim probable?  No.  Not even close.  Mr. Baigent's method is flawed.  For example, he frequently calls into question the reliability of early historical documents, while relying heavily on anecdotal material, which is often relatively late from a historical perspective.  At times this "evidence" exists simply as the word of one person living in the 20th century.  Another problem is that Baigent is guilty of special pleading.  He discredits the New Testament Gospel accounts which are contrary to his beliefs as unreliable, but then quotes from the gospels when they help establish his point.  Often it is apparent that Mr. Baigent has left behind the realm of historical facts and entered the realm of speculation because he pauses in his narrative to ask questions such as "Could it be...?", "Is it perhaps possible that...?", etc.  But, once he has asked the questions, his answers to his own speculations are considered proven true, and he addresses them accordingly through the rest of the book.  Unfortunately, I don't have the space here to document his countless speculations, errors, and distortions.  Here are just a few.  Perhaps the single most outrageous claim in the book is the assertion that Jesus survived the crucifixion.  However, Jesus' death by crucifixion is so widely accepted that virtually no skeptic continues to entertain this possibility.  The event of his death is affirmed by Christian and non-Christian sources, as well as by the general expertise the Romans possessed in this manner of execution.  Baigent comments that Jesus, if he died on the cross, would have died more quickly than expected.  He neglects, however, to mention that Jesus first endured being severely beaten with a three-lash whip with pieces of bone or metal on the ends.  This whip tore the flesh of the skeletal muscles and set the stage for circulatory shock.  Following the scourging that Jesus received, he was probably in serious to critical condition prior to his crucifixion.  During the crucifixion, he sustained five additional serious wounds, including the wounds caused by the nails and the spear in His side, which almost certainly pierced one lung and the heart.  According to a 1986 article entitled "On the Physical Death of Jesus Christ" which appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association, "Clearly, the weight of the historical and medical evidence indicates that Jesus was dead before the wound to His side was inflicted and supports the traditional view that the spear, thrust between His right ribs, probably perforated not only the right lung but also the pericardium and heart and thereby ensured his death.  Accordingly, interpretations based on the assumption that Jesus did not die on the cross appear to be at odds with modern medical knowledge."  In addition to the medical evidence, the death (and resurrection) of Jesus is evidenced by the behavior and experiences of the disciples.  It is nearly unanimously accepted among historical scholars (including such skeptics as "Jesus Seminar" members Marcus Borg and John Dominic Crossan) that Jesus' disciples, following his crucifixion, were initially discouraged and despondent but shortly afterward had multiple experiences that they believed were actual appearances of the risen Jesus.  Additionally, due to these experiences, the disciples' lives were completely transformed, to the extent that they were willing to die for their belief that they had seen the resurrected Jesus.  It is utterly nonsensical to suggest that this level of belief and commitment could have been inspired by their experience of a badly wounded, bloodied, extremely sick Jesus barely clinging to life.  This scenario could explain their belief that they had seen him alive, but not their claim to have seen him resurrected.  Rather than relying on early historical documents to support his claim, Mr. Baigent's assertion that Jesus survived the crucifixion is based largely on the suggestion of one 20th century man, who claimed to have learned it directly from another man, who is supposed to have seen an elusive document making this claim.  This story will only convince the gullible.  By comparison, a surprising number of ancient historical texts (which are not elusive) record the death of Jesus, including a number of highly respected, primitive creeds that predate the New Testament, the Gospel narratives themselves, at least ten non-Christian texts, and several noncanonical early Christian sources.  In contrast to the evidence presented by Baigent, these sources provide multiple early evidences for the event of the death of Jesus by crucifixion.    Similar arguments can be made to refute other assertions made by Mr. Baigent, including Jesus' denial that he was the son of God, the relative reliability of the Gnostic Gospels, the supposedly lost years of Jesus in Egypt, the claim that Christianity was essentially the creation of Paul, and many others.    In chapter 13, Mr. Baigent laments what he refers to as the lack of "pure historians" in the field of biblical scholarship.  It seems we are justified in assuming that he would categorize himself in this manner, yet his haphazard acceptance and rejection of various data disqualifies him as a scholar.  Hardly objective, his sole test for evidence is whether it supports to his own view. 
 A question for anyone who has this dvd pack. I am after a movie my friends and I watched years ago. It was about a lady going out for cigarettes on a wet night and having to stop for petrol on the way home. A killer is running lose as we hear on the news, playing on the car radio.  The petrol attendant worries her in the way he is acting. He tries to get her out of the car but she wont. He attacks the car trying to get her out.  What she does not realise is the killer is in the back of her car and the attendant is only trying to save her...  This short movie was on with 3 other movies one being about a boy being sucked into a video game.  We would greatly appreciate any help finding out the name of the dvd or tape which has these four short stories on it.  We are wondering if they are on this dvd or any of the others listed with amazon.  Thank you. Aussie Girls  
 Despite the opinions of other reviewers on this site, this is not a well written book.  I am speaking of the Future Interests section in particular.  In order explain concepts, the book uses terms that are defined later in the chapter, and simply gives examples without clarifying.  I think the authors are capable of explaining these concepts in an understandable way, but fail to do so.  This is evident once you use the Gilberts outline written by Dukeminier, where concepts are well defined.  Perhaps this is a ploy to sell more Gilberts.  Regardless, the textbook leaves much to be desired 
 I guess this book would be better appreciated by those who actually believe in magic, protection spells and things like that. The book does offer it's fair share of information to those who are just interested in monsters generally, but there are far more better books for that kind of research.  The book has chapters for ghosts, demons, angels, werewolves, vampires and other things that go bump in the night. Greer has included sightings and legends from the history, but I always found myself wanting more details. Most portions of the book are about monsters generally and they also offer magical means to defend oneself from monsters. If you are not interested in magic and spells, the book offers only a brief glance into the monster lore.  I was somewhat disappointed in the book, it had only a few interesting bits and pieces of information. Most of the times I found myself reading about Greer's own theories, which I am sorry to say, didn't seem too convincing. If you are offering an example from the history or news, you should include more information about it, otherwise the example has no real use.  If you are interested magic and it's involvement with monsters, this might be the book for you. If you want to really read about monsters, I recommend you find other books for your reading pleasure 
 I purchased this memory card for a camera I was also purchasing. It was listed as an accessory to the camera on the same page. When I received the card first and then the camera, I was disappointed that the card was the wrong shape and size for the camera and would not fit. Because I had opened the plastic package to the card, I was unable to return it. In fact, when I emailed the company who sent it, I never even received a response. 
 I wish I hadn't spent the money on this book. While it does give you the basics of doing mosaics, there's maybe 6 pages of it. If you've ever done any tile work, then its useless. The rest of the book is centered on doing specific projects. Frankly, the example pieces in the book were downright ugly. Most of them looked like they were just a smashed plate re-assembled. There's really no color or design patterns. The rest had doll heads all over them, which I found pretty creepy. If you're a beginner, this might give you the basics but there should be better books out there. If you're looking for inspiration, there HAVE to be better books out there than this one 
 Sometimes there are books you read and when you're done you just want to set them on fire and throw them back at the author and say "Bad! Bad author!"  This is one of those books.   Set in the days of American independence and revolution, this guy, Professor Shaara, tries to "hip up" history by making it semi-fictional. This is regardless of the fact that in doing so, the actual history is being fudged, leaving the reader with a distorted view of our actual factual American history.   Which is the American way; If our kids can't learn history, then let's spin it in a way that facilitates them while at the same time robs them of finding out our true history. If this book had lips I'd make it kiss my ass.   And the bukkake scene with Ben Franklin? Way too much 
      Well I decided to buy my first Girls Gone Wild video (The Seized Video) and it was a waste of my time and money. I hope th other ones are better than this because it was useless. The girls were good looking no doubt but its not that long of a video, the camera guys are idiots and act like twelve year old boy's. I thought this was going to be a good adult video but it is way over rated trust me. Wasted my money and spent thirty minutes of my life I will never get back.  
 Most of the content of this book belongs in sales brochure not a book. A large proportion of this book is a long, overblown ad for the author's services.   Some of the ideas, while creative, are just repackaging of many well-known and established techniques.   In addition, there is one reality the author ignores. The exercises are not going to work well with "average," everyday people. They require a degree of creativity and acumen that quite honestly, most people (including very well-educated ones) just do not possess. I work in this industry everyday and if there is one thing I've learned it is most individuals are much better reacting to ideas than creating them. 
 I was surprised to find this book on the shelf of books recommended for high-school students at my local bookstore, but the subject intrigued me, so I decided to take a chance on it. Like all decent sex manuals, it gives  good advice in many matters -- foreplay, treating one's partner with  respect, and so forth, but often lacks the detail necessary for one who  actually needs the advice in the first place to follow. And like most sex  manuals, the people who need it the most are the ones who will be the least  likely to bother with it. There is a long catalog of various names of the  sex organs of both males and females which was half-amusing, half-tedious.  Suffice to say that they are not all that different from the ones in use  today. Also, certain idiotic misconceptions abound, which will probably not  be helpful to most people -- that in order to satisfy a woman, for example,  a man should be rich and have a penis roughly a foot long. Also, certain  cultural assumptions are made which may strike some readers as odd, but  which in fact are very telling -- for example, in the period and location  when this book was written, fat women were considered very erotic. Hearing  a man tall about how he adores his wife's double-chin is rather amusing (in  this sense it makes a good introductory study towards ideals of beauty as  one finds in Wolf's "The Beauty Myth"), and lets one see that  contemporary idea of beauty are not by any means universal. Another  interesting aspect of the book was the notion that sex is an important and  decent part of one's life as it is given one by god. The author was  obviously Islamic and this shows over and over again, but unlike in  Christian writings of the same period, sex is portrayed as something  beautiful to be shared as a gift from heaven and not as a "dirty  secret". This is really quite refreshing -- in the west, we still  suffer from this lamentable malady today. The Sheik also takes it for  granted that women enjoy sex as much as men, and places a strong emphasis  on female satisfaction; something that only recently has become  fashionable. On the negative side, the chapters on beastiality and  tribadism were left out in Burton's translation -- necessary considering  the time in which he lived, but an omission which nevertheless leaves the  book incomplete. As a study in cultural values, it is quite interesting, as  a sex manual, it is obviously dated and could use much improvement --  modern ones are much better. Depending on what you are looking for, it may  be an interesting read, but still comes across as rather dull; it won't  replace the Kama Sutra anytime soon 
 I listened to this work on CD.  It took two attempts before I completed it.  I completed listening to the first CD and thought I had missed something so I re-doubled my efforts and began again.  I came away with the feeling that there were a couple of things of value but overall you will really have to dig deep to find them.  Also, if you are a Christian reader/listener you won't get past track one on the first CD.   Even after studying world religions in college and living in Asia for a year, I was left with very little to walk away with from this book.  
 Egan is a good writer, but in this book she does not transport us.  It feels as though she is distracted.  The research leaves a little something to be desired.  Lastly, the book seems to have a need for a brand of drama that fuels the imaginations of 18 year olds. zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz 
 First of all, I'd like to point out that the cover of this book resembles a skinhead forming a swastika with his body. I'm not accusing Burne of anything, but I think someone should have noticed this before going to press.   Next, I'd like to point out that this book isn't easy to read. I read books constantly... technical books with big words, so it's not like I've got a problem. Maybe it's the fact that he basically says the same thing over and over that makes your eyes glaze over. Maybe it's the incredibly dry and boring style of writing. Or maybe it's the fact that EVERY image has two or three paragraphs written about it, even if it's unnecessary. Most of the text just seems like a bunch of meaningless cushioning to take up the empty space around the pictures and to make sure the book is half an inch think. Regardless, I got about halfway through it and was like "screw it, I can't read this anymore". The same thing happened with Dynamic Light and Shade. Burne: Just say what you've got to say in simple plain language... don't make it harder to understand than it should be. Your could get the point across in a tiny fraction of the words you use.   Another thing is that he refers to his own drawings as if he's observing a photograph or a real life event. "Notice the way the woman's shirt spirals down to the ground and around a rock due to the slight elevation of her right hip". What? It's a drawing! And an exaggerated and unrealistic one at that.   It's also hard to trust someone's judgment when there are obvious distortions and exaggerations in their own work. Also, just by looking at some of the drawings, many of the wrinkles do not look right... as if he followed one of his "rules" and forgot to even check to see if it looked right. I started to notice, mostly after starting to draw my own wrinkles, that his drawings were WAY too wrinkly. Nobody's clothing is as wrinkly as it is in Burnes drawings. I opened the book up and showed my girlfriend and asked her "does this look a little too wrinkly?". "Yeah!" she said with a "duh" tone in her voice. Quite simply, the drawings in this book are grotesque.   Burne is great with a pencil and has a polished style. It's just that he seems to fall short of what he strives to do: drawing realistic people and clothing. The casual observer will notice that there's something weird looking about his work and the exaggerated wrinkles are annoying to look at. His figures sometimes have distorted faces and heads too small for their bodies. His examples of human movement often depict people in grossly unrealistic or even impossible positions.   In conclusion, I know this review sounds harsh, but it's not completely useless. Burne's drawings are a good source of ideas of how to render wrinkles. Also, although I don't necessarily agree with all of his "rules" (because I've observed that the real world doesn't follow them) but he does call attention to the different places you should look for "anchors" (where clothing is held firmly in place) and how to observe where the anchors move from the anchor to the direction they are pulled. Burne seems to want to give students formulas to use when drawing bodies and wrinkles. As with everything else, formulas are a good starting point from which to build, but they are no substitute for human judgement and expirience. So, for Burnes obeservations of wrinkles I give this book 2 stars rather than 1.   Also, one thing I would have liked to see is more analysis of the shape of wrinkles, the waves and how one decides what the wrinkles should look like depending on the material being wrinkled.   My advice is to get some clothing catalogs and start studying them and sketching them if you want to get the hang of drawing clothing. That's what I'm going to do.   One last thing, if you disagree with my review, I challenge you to pick up a catalog of real people wearing real clothes and compare what you see to Burne's drawings. You'll find that wrinkles are not nearly as prevalent or predictable as they are in this book. Some things you have to learn from expirience and I think this is one of them. 
 Warning to potential buyers of this book...it's pretty expensive for what you get - have to say I expected a gorgeous hard cover and lots of glossy pics but it is NOT like that. Whilst the cover is hard, there is minimal coloured pics. All in all, whilst this book has good ideas I was generally disappointed. 
 The only explanation is that James Paterson churned this dog out to make a buck. I've read a number of James Patterson books and while I'm not a hard core fan, I've enjoyed most of them. I know this will outrage some Patterson readers but I'm not much of a fan of Alex Cross who frankly I find boring as hell.   As mediocre as Patterson often is as an author, readers should beware, London Bridges is especially bad. The novel reads like an abridgement, moving at a frantic pace without ever generating any suspense. The premise is ridiculous - super criminals with silly names join forces to blackmail world leaders (sounds like the plot for an Austin Powers movie - without any of the humour).   Patterson is not remotely qualified to enter the international terrorist thriller market. An author who churns out 3 or 4 novels a year doesn't have time to do the kind of research that is needed to produce a plausible terrorist thriller.   The twists at the end - "he's the wolf - no, he's the wolf - no, she's the wolf - no...." by the end, I just didn't care.   James Patterson has written some decent crime novels but his fans should beware. Quantity, not quality seems to be Patterson's priority these days. London Bridges is a mess from beginning to end. 
 I'm a big fan of both Perdido Street Station and The Scar, compared to these earlier works Iron Council was a huge disappointment in both the writing and story.  It was at times very painful to read and I was so excited to finally be finished.  If you are new to Mieville, start with Perdido Street Station, if you are a big fan and looking for more from New Crobuzon be prepared to be disappointed 
 I really like Bruce Campbell and his movies like Army of Darkness. But this movie is not in the same league. First of all the plot is slow and boring. Bruce does not have the same rouge character that he is so good at. Instead the movie is filled with frankly depressing scenes of him in bed or limping around barely able to move. This really hampers the action aspects of the movie. The dialogue aspect is not much better.   If you like Bruce, my advise is to get his other movies or try to get a hold of the TV episodes of  "Jack of all trades" episodes. It is a lot more fun and has the "real" Bruce 
 Although the book may contain some very good information, the poor editing makes it hard for me to read. As a magazine editor, I probably notice these problems more than others, but I find them very distracting. I may change my rating once I've made it through the entire book, but as it is, I'm having trouble reading more than 2-3 pages at a time without putting the book down in annoyance 
 Troy why did you put your name on this.  This cd has one good song on it and that is about the long and short of it.  I am not going to waste a bunch of time talking about a cd that is not worthy of being pressed, by the way the group was better with Conrad the Colonel (Ehhhh Hehhh!  I AM DSGB! 
 We are HUGE Amazon customers and we have always been so pleased with our purchases.  However we were shocked when we went to use 4 out of 6  of these expensive wine glasses.  THEY FELL APART!  The glass is tissue thin!  Perhaps from shipping there are many fine fractures????  One fell apart in my guest's hand...three fell apart later that night while being rinsed out.  we handled these glasses so delicatly...I have 2 more and we would like to send them back and be reimbursed for all 6. 
 I was disappointed with the whole thing:  mostly commentary and not much content;  I'd have expected and would have liked more of each show and less of the commentary.  It felt to me like the authors missed their mark and focused on their documentary rather than on the subject(s).  I wouldn't recommend at all, even at the reduced price from the original retail.. 
 Certainly not into the Uniden CLX485, thats for sure. I have owned plenty of cordless phones in my day and to be honest, I wish I could go back in time to buy up all the older phones.  I am just one person and I dont know about everybody else, but what would be the very FIRST requirement for a "good" phone to have? Sound quality. Second? Battery life. Anything after that is icing.  The sound completely sucks on this phone. There is a constant hum and the voices sound slightly distorted and low. Whle changing the volume does increase the decibel level, it also increases all the annoying sound coming from this phone.  If youre looking for the same quality phone that your old 900/2.8 had, good luck. If you find yourself reading reviews about how good this phone sounds, think skeptically about who's writing it.  I did not invest any money in this phone. It was a gift and I am embarassed that I will have to return the gift. 
 The border in this film which is beyond belief is that of credibilty. The drama's tone is disturbingly melodramatic with the Relief Doctor's appearance at a high society fund-raising ball in London. We can accept this though, given the painful urgency of his message. But when Jolie quits her poor husband to Ethiopia in pursuit of responding to well-intended empathy for the war and famine stricken camps, the balance of the film gets crazily out of whack, and never recovers. It's not to say that romantic love has no place in such dire life circumstances. More, the film makes this point above the far more expressive needs of the people who the aid workers are there to service. Quite addled really, and undrermining all other high-minded and serious utterances made by the lead actors. In Ethiopa, in particular, this seemed in errant taste. The conceptual work is at the root of this 
 I first became interested in fusion the day my dad threw the mahavishnu record Visions of Emerald Beyond on his turntable. The sheer power and emotion of that record assaulted me completely. I then listened to RTF's Light as a Feather and the mellow chords and melodies entranced me. I then listened to Where Have I Known You Before by RTF and I was floored by the drive, the bass playing, the guitar playing, the drumming, and chick corea's synths and piano work. That album is a masterpiece. Later I went out and bought Romantic Warrior... just after 10 minutes of trying to cope with the cheesy synths and boring grooves, I had to turn it off. This is a landmark of the commercialization of fusion and nothing more. Ive been trying to understand why there was such a sudden turn from the previous album's energy and enthusiasm, and why this album is so popular 
 I read this book about 10 years ago and was initially impressed. I didn't like the redundant writing style, but I thought this guy is a "scientist", not a writer, and that the information was credible. It's not! Aside from the severe calorie deprivation, recommended through a convoluted protein equation, this book sounds reasonable. Eat as if you were diabetic, or about to become diabetic.  Back then, I didn't realize that diabetes is as much about atherosclerosis, as it is about blood-sugar levels, and eating a 30% protein (As I recall, Sears actually advocates a higher than 30% protein diet because he doesn't  count, or consider reliable, high-fibre sources of protein such as beans.) and 30% fat diet can be a recipe for heart disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Plus a good way to increase your risk for some kinds of cancer.   One other thing. Barry Sears claims, in this, his first "zone" book, that his "zone favorable" diet helped Dave Scott, at age 40, finish second in the 1994 Gatorade Ironman Triathlon. Dave Scott's response was published in 2001. "That's the biggest false statement ever. I've never read Sears' book. I've never tried Sears' diet. It's been awful having to refute this lie for the past five years. I called and left a message for Sears and sent him an e-mail, and he never replied". Read a full critique of this book in John Robbins' "The Food Revolution". The only reason I gave "The Zone" 2 stars, is because at least it's an improvement over Atkins.   If you're looking for a book on superior nutrition, as well as one for weight-loss, start with Joel Fuhrman's "Eat To Live", and if you have to, modify his approach to suit your needs. He's got  the results and credibility Barry Sears can only dream about. The only zone Sears has found is "The Twilight Zone". He's not the first, and won't be the last, to make a lot of money there 
 It amazes me that not a single previous reviewer noted the gaping hole in the logic of the plot that renders the entire reading excercise an utter waste of time (not mention the waste of money in purchasing the book).  The hole is this: Did the Giordano parents "look in" on Amy when they returned home from their evening out? If so, and if she was asleep in bed, than the suspicion of Eric would be no greater than anyone else in town. If she was missing on their return home than Eric has some major explaining to do.  Incredibly this issue was never addressed. It is beyond logic to me that neither Giordano parent would check on their 8 y.o. daughter upon  returning home from a night out.  Would you?      
 This work by an eminent writer on old-time outlaws and lawmen can be viewed from several vantage points: the storied career of Harry Morse, the ins and outs of law enforcement in the Old West, and the interplay between  Hispanics and Anglos in Old California.  Boessenecker describes Morse as a  "gunfighter, manhunter, and sleuth whose career is without parallel in  the history of the American frontier."  More importantly, the author,  like other western historians in recent years, shows the difference between  the blood and thunder school of thought about Old West gunfighting lawmen  who occasionally pinned on a silver star, and those individuals who saw law  enforcement in the American West as a profession.  As a career minded peace  officer, Morse spent decades learning the techniques needed to investigate  crimes and to track and capture outlaws and desperadoes.

 As I have gotten older seeing the tiny print inside the view finder has become more dificult, as well a seeing the image clearly enought to get super sharp focus.  I thought this might be a solution.  This Eyecup fails on all requards.  Worst feature, the optics are not nearly as clear as you would expect.  Second the magnification is so minimal as to be useless.   Last it has the cheep feel of Cracker Jack plastic, well and the optics to match.  Now I know where Olympus had it manufactured 
 Ehrenreich is the kind of journalist I despise. One who thinks her insights are so important that it doesn't matter how much she inconveniences others to make her point. She constantly drones about how difficult it is to find housing on the wages blue color workers earn.  The market is to tight, that oftentimes one has to use a huge percentage of one's pay to stay in hotels while looking for apartments.  Does that stop Ehrenreich from competing for those coveted apartments?  Of course not.  She has to do her research, and she is the only reliable subject she can find to satisfy her curiousity.  If jobs and apartments are so hard to come by, then leave those jobs and digs for the people who so desparately need them.  There is nothing one learns from Ehrenreich's experiences that one couldn't have learned from professional interviews of blue color workers.  But that would have taken away Ehrenreich's righteous indignation.   Don't encourage this kind of writing.  See it for what it is. Gratuitous research that could have been easily conducted without firsthand experience.  And that while doing it, some very needy people were out of work and living in substandard housing conditions 
 Had to stop about 1/4 of the way through it and give it away 
 Of all the books I have read and discussed, there is one book that we never should trust...when I got this book out from the library I was all geared up for a great read...therefore was greatly disappointed as I read this book.  MacDonald is unfortunately negative about all of The Beatles songs, and in particular has it in for George and Ringo's numbers. I found that he did not have a single positive comment about any of The Beatles songs - no matter who wrote them. It makes one wonder why he wrote a book on them. If you are looking for a book with a positive approach to the Beatles masterpieces, this isn't the book you should be buying. I reccommend "A Day In The Life, the Music and Artistry of The Beatles, by Mark Hertsgaard, instead of MacDonald's sloppy, single-minded musings. This book should be put to shame 
 This book is a waste of money.  I gives the appearance of being written in the 1970's.  I would recommend the USMC Clost-Quarters Combat Manual instead 
 very heavy easily torn--reinforcement non fucnctional--doubt i can cover my bike 10 times before it is torn to shreds--i would not reccomend it at all--wasted my mone 
 I've always loved Kay Thompson's brilliant "Eloise" books.  Eloise was born 3 years before me, although she benefits from a case of arrested development (not unlike Dennis the Menace), having reached the age of 6 in 1955 and never aging since. I've been to the Plaza Hotel as a child in the late '50s and early '60s, and my mother spent many happy years in the Big Apple, some as a Barbizon resident.    My grandmother once remarked to my mother that the oil portrait of Eloise in the Plaza lobby made her think "She must be the manager's daughter," since no other explanation could account for such an "ugly child" being so prominently displayed!  Kay Thompson was a graduate of the same high school in St. Louis as my mother, and went on to achieve many wonderful, gutsy, triumphs in Hollywood as a dancer, choreographer, designer, and actress (including her role in "Funny Face" with Fred Astaire and Audrey Hebburn as the Vogue-ish magazine editor who advocated "Think pink!").  I greatly admire the multi-talented and mercurial Thompson and her  inspired illustrator, Hilary Knight who did as much as Thompson to bring Eloise to life.  For that matter, I very much like Eloise herself, who was by all accounts Kay Thompson's alter-ego.  The first Eloise book was subtitled "A book for precocious grownups, about a little girl who lives at the Plaza Hotel."  Eloise was a child, but the books were not meant for children. Adults, especially those who've raised children of their own, understand that children are not Better, Wiser, Smarter, and Kinder than adults. But since at least "Pollyanna" if not before, Disney Studios has been churning out a constant stream of propaganda films asserting just the opoosite.  And now, Kay Thompson's wonderful playful, innocent, bratty, obnoxious, sweet Eloise has been beatified by Disney as their latest Child Sage.  The problem with these lies (and all others) is that they blind people of all ages to their own shortcomings while unfairly blaming them on others.  Children are not wiser and better than adults, and they never have been, and they never will be, even if Jimmy Carter did think his 11-year-old daughter Amy had the last word to say about nuclear weapons (he was mistaken, of course).  Children are typically much more cruel than adults, and if they say sweet innocent things from time to time (which is rare) it is only because they haven't lived long enough to learn better.    But they will learn better eventually; although some of them will suppress or deny their life-lessons to become seriously committed adult hypocrites.  Adults who don't get this either don't have children, or don't pay attention to them as they really are, Disney Studios' party line notwithstanding.    In the books, Eloise's charm lay in her vulnerabiltity, her precociousness, her smart-aleck attitude, and her essential warmth, which asked no quarter and took no prisoners...delightful as childish qualities, but lacking in, shall we say...nuance.  Disney tries to make her into an all-wise marriage counselor and social activist do-gooder. As such, Eloise is transformed from a delightful child into a *very adult* sociopathically manipulative prig, which quite ruins the film...as it also ruins real life when people go wrong like that.  This was never the character Thompson and Knight developed, who was simply a charming self-absorbed brat...and, by the way, a lot more credible as an actual child.  Eloise's future as an adult has been speculated upon. Some think her a likely candidate for alcholism, drug addiction, and perhaps certain dysfunctional sexual disorders, as an adult child of an absentee mother and no father at all, raised in circumstances of artificial material luxury and moral decadence.   Such concerns are not unfocused, but since we all know that Eloise will never, and can never, get any older than 6 years of age, they are, I would suggest, unwarranted.    Meanwhile, I wish Disney Studios would either go away or do something else.  Of course "children of all ages" (sanctimonious children and smug, narcissistic adults who can't or won't grow up) will eat this junk up as Disney knows very well.    But I think Kay Thompson would spin in her grave at this PC propagandistic re-working of her own special "inner child" who was so much more real than this Disney caricacture: not despite, but because of, her obvious childish failings.  On the plus side, the film's production values could not be better, and the little girl who plays Eloise is...perfect.  Julie Andrews is absolutely wonderful as Nanny.  The sets are great.  I loved the first half hour of this film, before the Disney message (children, especially little girls, are the Master Race) became apparent.  It's certainly well done!  I did wonder, since there seemed to be an emphasis on making the time frame seem 1950s-like, why the featured toy store was Toys R Us instead of New York's flagship toy store, F.A.O. Schwartz?  
      For those of you who have sincerely been seeking the truth about the Holocaust, who have done your homework and read a variety of sources and opinions, this book may well push you completely over into the revisionist ("deniers") camp, as it did me.         Deborah Lipstadt is an Emory University professor of Jewish Religion, NOT history.  She was evidently supported by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in writing this book; they hold the copyright, not her.  Denying the Holocaust is an attempt to respond to Arthur Butz and others who have raised major factual objections to the usual "6 million Jews killed in gas chambers" version of WW II.         Arthur Butz gathered a wealth of research material in his book The Hoax of the Twentieth Century.  Ms Lipstadt responds to his scholarship with things such as name calling, twisted logic, half truths, appeals to emotions, failure to produce evidence, failure to define terms, omitting things, assigning bad motives, answering a question with another question, using big words, etc.  That is why I call her book, Denying the Holocaust, a Holocaust Liar's Handbook.  I value my copy as a wonderful exercise book for seeing through sophistocated lies.        
 basically, this cd/dvd is documentation of green day's sloppiest, all time low, and over all worst tour ever. with the addition of so many band members onstage, why, i wonder, do billie mike and tre play sloppier? on this tour, mike misses many backing vocals, billie's guitar playing is at an all time sloppiness (embarassing for such an amazing guitarist). also, billie's guitar sounds are TERRIBLE, why can't he make his les paul juniors as powerful as they sound on the recordings? anyways, about this cd/dvd: it's nothing more than a handpicked selection of the most overplayed songs from the tour (their "greatest hits") with the banter completely cut out. it is very very dissapointing coming from a band who used to put on an amazing energetic live show. but.... if you are a new fan to the band or are young and stupid, then you will probably love this cd/dvd 
 I was expecting a book about concrete homes.  The book showed little on concrete other than the introduction.  I wish I could of viewed first or at least return it 
 Hmmm. I'm struggling to give Agatha Christie such a low rating. She wrote the kind of mysteries that you could sink your teeth into. Not quick reads, but very methodical with lots of character development. I don't always feel very motivated to get through some of those slow-moving chapters, but I always do it knowing that I will be rewarded with a great ending. Christie was great at spinning scenarios designed to shock the reader when the "who, where and why" were finally revealed in the end. I was shocked again at the end of this book - not because I didn't know who the killer was, but actually because I already knew who and how. I tried to convince myself for awhile that it had to be someone else because it was just too obvious. Very disappointing. Christie books I would recommend instead - ABC murders, And Then There Were None and Murder of Roger Ackroyd 
 The song from the funeral is not on the album. I have searched for it for years. It is sung by Oleta Adams. I contacted her management company to find out how to get this song. I did get a response back that this song was not released. It was only :30 seconds of music that was recorded and they asked Oleta to sing on it. I think we need to start a writing/email campaign to FlyteTyme Productions and have them release this song. It is so beautiful and should not have been left out. Obviously it's a classic since folks are still talking about it 5 YEARS LATER 
 I love the Goos, however I can only recommend this single only to diehard Goo fans. I don't expect Johnny and the boys to put out an album like Hold Me Up, Superstar Carwash, or even A Boy Named Goo, but it seems like they've lost their rocker souls and have settled for being banal adult contemporary (ac) musicians. Better Days lacks the passion, grit, and ingenuity of past songs like Name, Flattop, We are The Normal, Iris, and Two Days in February. Better Days sounds like the usual sappy drivel produced by ac musicians like Kelly Clarkson, Ryan Cabrera, and Howie Day.  The Goos might be pushing 40 but they can rock harder and produce better music than this. Look at The Rolling Stones. Although overrated in my opinion they still know how to rock out. 
 The contenet of this book was fine -- exactly what a Jackie Collins fan would expect.  However, the ending is so disappointing, it made me angry!  It seems more like cliffhanger than an ending.  To tell you the truth, I'm still half expecting a sequel!  Just when you're getting to the book's climax, IT ENDS!  It is absolutely unnerving!  This may be due to the facts that it was Ms. Collins' first book and was written back in 1968, I don't know.  But I do know that of all the books she's written, this has got to be the worst 
 I give this book two stars for effort and its Christian perspective, but he reverts to the "forgive at all costs" mentality. Some things aren't forgivable, nor should people be expected to do so. This may lay an additional burden on people who are suffering, trivializes their injuries, and it gives the abuser an out. Still, a decent effort. Might be helpful in addition to counseling from a ministe 
 This is one of the few instances that I have found in which the movie version of a novel is better than the novel itself.  This is a contrived work through and through, and one can understand why Bertolucci completely changed the ending for the movie.  Moravia here displays his utter sentimentality with an admixture of arm-chair psychology that is truly laughable....and this is probably his best novel 
 I found this book to be lacking in substance and humor. And I really wanted it to be great, I did. I heard about it from the Oprah show, and had already heard the best stories before I read it.  If you have heard anything about this book, anything at all, I would save yourself the 20 bucks. I was disappointed by this book, and found that it did NOT support all the hype. I got this book from the library for free, and STILL FOUND IT to FALL SHORT of the great reviews. It is a sad day for me. 
 I'm sorry I wasted the money. I can see by the reviews you either love it or hate it.  I'm not squeamish by nature, but this book is one continuous torture fest which not only targets human victims, but animals as well.  Three quarter's way through, when I realized this indeed was the premise from beginning to end, I started skipping these parts (which got me to the last page quite quickly). I was bored and disgusted with the author.  I believe he had a sick fetish and lived them out through these pages. In the end my eyeballs got six-pack abs from rollng around so much.  This book is going on my "Do Not Lend" shelf as I value my friends and wouldn't consider them subjecting them to such gory nonsense.  
 I got this book thinking I was going to learn java.  Great right?  Well not, I soon figured out this book is about using someone elses applet, on the web!  First of all This book has nothing to do with programming!  Second of all, If you wanted to have applets on your web-site, why can't you learn to make your own, instead copying off of someone else 
 James Loewen's "Lies" is a valuable tool, debunking myths and misconceptions-even unearthing causation for common historical misconceptions. Where this critcal work fails, though, is in understanding the purpose for teaching history- for students to understand and affirm American institutions. Loewen's praise of a figure like John Brown does nothing to further this end. I do not believe, as the author does, that history as taught today is propaganda, but I do agree that textbooks are written to serve a purpose, and this being a capitalistic society, they are also written for consumers.   I am particularly irritated at his continuing the present trend of Christopher Columbus bashing. It serves no interests to villify Columbus in the name of historical accuracy. All who have immigrated here owe him a debt regardless of his alleged crimes against humanity. Loewen rails on about the "exploitative" element in Columbus's story, but his personal bias is likewise present in his support for African discovery and claims of racially motivated historiographical discrimination. Similarly, his accusation of Lincoln as a racist violates the historical principle of judging the past through the prism of the present. It is a fallacy which needs context to be properly examined. Both the author and I agree that history is written by the victors, so why does Loewen rehash this ad nausem?  Loewen asks the question, "How is one supposed to feel about the America that has been presented?" My answer after reading his book is, overwhelmingly negative and cynical. His criticism of texts, as well as all modern scholarship revising previous inaccuracies, must be taken into account in teaching history, but his negative tone must be balanced. Students do need to become, in Loewen's words, "crap detectors." Students should be given the tools to analyze events and formulate reasonable conclusions, on that much I think we would agree 
 I was really looking forward to starting this book based on the positive reviews.  But I was very disapointed.  I had a very difficult time reading this book.  It is slow to develop and filled with many unnecessary details 
 By far the boringest most pointless book I've ever read in my life. I seriously don't see how it won this award and I seriously don't see a life in anybody who would bother to read past the first chapter of this pointless novel. 
 No true CW MCCALL fan should stoop to buying any collection that would omit the classic singer/songwtiter/rapper's most seminal work!  Looks like I'll have to pass on this one and be satisfied with CW McCall's Greatest hits.  What a disappointment 
 If you wish to understand the dynamics of theology,this is not the book for you to read. After reading the book a saying comes to mind and no animus is intended: "If you can't dazzle them with brilliance, baffle  them with BS." Haight does exactly that. Sorry, but if there were an  Amazon rating of 1/4 star, I would'nt hesitate to give it.      Of course  there are probably many theologians who have read the book and will  pompously comment that it is brilliant. All I can say to those who do is:  Nonsense! Haight should take heed of the public cry to the legal profession  to "use plain english, not 'legalese'"; I say to Haight,  "use plain english, not Jesuitese&quot 
 Picked this and the new _American Hardcore: A Tribal History_ up at the same time. Despite listening to the West Coast punk bands growing up, I knew far less about them and that scene than I did about their contemporaries in New York, England and even DC (well-covered in "Our Band Could Be Your Life").  The first half is tedious, spending too much time on the fading glam scene and teenage groupies - unlike the Doors/VU/Iggy chapters of _Please Kill Me_ they don't really tell you how this scene fed into punk rock.  The latter half takes off fairly well, when X and the Germs (and Black Flag and Social Distortion, etc.) start to make records and we actually get to read about them instead of which Chinese restaurant/bar was booking shows for a little while.  A key difference with this one vs. _Please Kill Me_ is that they had (it seems) less access to personalities that readers will recognize. Fewer famous acts from LA than NY, and some wouldn't speak to the authors, so they had to rely on people.  Skip this and find a bootleg of _The Decline of Western Civilization_ for a more intimate account of what LA punk rock looked and sounded like 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 Homesick: My Own Story by Jean Fritz is a story about an American girl who grows up in China. She spends a good part of her life wishing she could be in America, where she belongs. WHen she's not doing that, she's corresponding with her grandmother, trying to make friends with some young chinese children, and learning british culture in school. 	As you can see, Jean Fritz would be an excellent storywriter had she made it up. However, this story is an autobiography, and is in almost no way fictional. Jean Fritz is an excellent storywriter anyway, though. Jean Fritz describes the setting as if her pen were a plane ticket. Her story line makes it difficult to locate the plot, or even understand the full story. The autobiography is punctuated by emotions. All in all, this is a fine educational history text, but is not, in my opinion, a fitting storybook 
 I agree with many of the other reviewers.  This book seems to have been written by a 12 year old boy.  Simplistic, almost cartoonish, plot and character development.  I found it so unbearable after about 50 pages, it went in the trash 
 This book is not really that good of a guide.  Very simplistic in approach and mostly common sense.  Their guide seems to be geared towards educational program start-ups and nothing else.  If you are in the biomedical sciences, this book is a waste.  
 We checked this book out of the library.  My daughter who is almost 6 began flipping through the pages and then came running, screaming, crying with tears saying the book is very scary and she did not want to even look at it, nevermind read it.  I read it myself.  The message is a good one - be yourself and don't worry about what others think, but the things that happen to Camilla are a bit graphic and scary for an impressionable child.  
 Up until this album, Ben Folds was the maker of fine artistry, but here he became totally hooked on the useless pop mainstreamism of artists such as John Mayer and Beth Orton. A few of the tracks remind me of the typical schlock-rock wimpiness used by so-called "bands" like Sevendust. I guess he decided to go for a new audience, but his desire for cashflow got in the way of his art. Oh well 
 this is a crappy album. so why do they keep on making this if only two people buy these albums in five years, anyone who likes this crap is retarted. dont buy it and buy cds from the actual singers and buy this to use as a coaster, a dog bag, toilet paper, a tissue, a toilet, a target to shoot at because you wont like this beacause the kids are just screaming "YO!" and its a rip off for 10 buck 
 For many years, Middle East departments of American universities including Columbia have provided intentionally fake and fraudulent education on Middle East problem and history to American students.  The Table below lists major milestones of the Middle East history and demonstrates that long before Arabs came in Palestine, there were Jewish states and Jerusalem was a capital of one of them.  In 1917-18, British army with Jewish contingents liberated the Holy Land (Palestine) from the Turks. During the WWII, Palestinian Arab clerics contacted Hitler and asked him to exterminate Palestinian Jews. There prove, that Jews lived there before creation of the state of Israel in 1948.   The 1964 PLO Charter addressed to UN used term "Palestinian Arabs" and PLO did not claim Judea, Samarea (so called West Bank), and Gaza their territories.  The term and national group "Palestinians" have been invented some time after 1967 by Arabs who fooled the entire world because the world would like to be fooled.  They also invented a fable that Jews never lived in Palestine. In 2003, Dr. Nabil Hilmi, Dean of the Faculty of Law at the University of Al-Zaqaziq, together with a group of Egyptian expatriates in Switzerland were preparing an enormous lawsuit against all the Jews of the world.  They blamed Israelites, who escaped Egypt and returned to the Promised Land in 12th - 11th centuries BC, of stealing gold from Egypt.  In other word, Dr. Nabil Hilmi and his colleague acknowledged that all Jews of the world are decedents of those Israelites who escaped Egypt and returned to the Promised Land in 12th - 11th centuries BC and, therefore, have a legitimate right for entire Palestinian land.

 this backpack was very uncomfortable. the inserts are stiff. it doesn't represent canon quality (I hope) 
 There is some good biographical information in this book if you are interested in Gordon B. Hinckley.  However, much of this biography is about the Mormon church and the role he played in it.    Gordon B. Hinckley, as stated in the book, got his big opportunity to impress his uppities by trying to help Mormon boys avoid the draft and the fighting in Korea (insert national anthem here).  Since missionary work took precedence over the fight against communism (let others die for their country), a concerted effort was made to try to keep Mormon boys from having to serve.    Appointed to the big twelve in the early 60's, Gordon mostly spent his time marketing for the church.  He played important roles in battling "liquor by the drink" in Utah and stopping the ratification of the "Equal Rights Amendment."  He also filled in for senile prophets when their capacity to rule declined.    If you are into suffering from congenital disciplitis, this book is for you, though there are probably more dynamic leaders out there who might give you more wisdom for the money you shell out to be in Gordon's inner sanctum.    And I say this in the name of Sonia Johnson, amen.  
 Shelley Long stars as the clutzy wife of an prominent Plastic Surgeon- when she chokes to death on a piece of chicken she is brought back to life by her ditzy sister and an occult book- with one 'catch' she must find her true love by the next full moon or return to the grave.   Frankly I was bored. Shelley longs 'clutzy' episodes were meant to be funny, but instead, I felt embarrassed for her. How many times can you watch someone knock something over or spill food before you begin to become annoyed? This movie had a dated feel and I felt the main character's helplessness and slapstick antics just didn't capture the interest of this viewer. Instead of laughing at her antics I pitied her. Not humor in my book. 1 star 
 Like most High Priests of Academia, Stephanie Pincetl gets it wrong. Either she's a shill for the Nationalist's Left Wing of Officialdom or simply she does not know how things work.  In true socialist-speak, Pincetl writes,          "...individuals have responsibilities to social whole..."  Pincetl confuses socialist liberalism (levelling based upon whims of mobs -- see: horrific French Revolution, 1789) with individualism (even the Lockean type).  Pincetl opposes all of the safeguards of Freedom Californians have against Elitist Officialdom:       1. requirement of 2/3's legislature to pass a fiscal year budget       2. private citizen participation in politics through private donation and support of candidates       3. special districts designed to "get work done", e.g., library districts, school districts, water districts  Pincetl even takes underhanded swipes at our beautiful ballot initiative safeguard against the Politics of Corruption (everyday politics in California and America).  Worse, Pincetl supports all of these evils of Socialist Elitist Officialdom:         1. forcing taxpayers to pay for elite politicos campaigns        2. subsidizing land-use owned by elites within one administrative boundary by stealing cash from the residents of another region       3. exponentially increasing theft of income using the rubric of "ability to pay"       4. elitist regional control of land-use but without any control by the great voters of California [a sure-fire way to allow corruption to decide who wins and who loses, but on a much larger scale].   Pincetl fails to see that "Progressive Era" was a nationalist movement to gain control of 1) local politics 2) California 3) replacing Jeffersonian statism with Roosevelt-Wilson-Roosevelt nationalism, a movement that used the rubric of "scietism enlightenment" to trick and deceive the good common man.  This is the kind of poison that you should keep away from yourself and your children.    Transforming Californi 
 I own one of these, it came packaged in my Dell XPS Renegade. Sound in a Windows environment is good, as indicated by other reviews. But in a gaming environment for example World of Warcraft, and not just this game, I and other user's have experienced the squeal of death, wherein the sound will become replaced with a high pitched squeal, and may hard lock your computer. Either way this can only be corrected by rebooting. Check out the forums before buying any creative labs products. BUYER BEWARE! 
 I received this as a gift because I am a huge JA fan. I read it through to the end because I read all books related to JA. I cannot believe this book has a rating of 3/5 stars. The plot, as continued by Barrett is absurd in the extreme, and, as others have pointed out, inconsistent and capricious. There is almost no dialogue, a distinct departure from Austen's usual style. A smarmy, confused, verbose narrator conveys most of the "story line." Adding insult to injury is the unnatural and awkward writing style. Barring a few grammatical constructions and vocabulary changes, Austen's language is not so different from our own. Barrett would have us believe that people, in truth, fly everywhere and use the conditional every other word. Would that eager JA readers could but be warned away from this unhappy collection of words

 Although Gundry does well in this introductory book to give the reader pronunciation guides for names of persons, his syntax is incredibly poor.  Because his sentence structure is lacking, his intended meaning is confusing and requires at times a multiple read in order to make sense of his sentence 
 Let's keep this simple. Lyra is a well-drawn charming character. She is also a weapon in Pullman's battle with the late C.S Lewis ("Chronicles of Narnia"). Pullman is an atheist and a revered member of the Brit chattering class. He has called his manichean view of religion--evil, evil, evil--"an artistic flaw." Yep, you bet. About halfway through the first book my stomach began to hurt, as if I had swallowed something rotten (and I am not terribly religious).  So, parents, there you have it. If you are atheists, this book is just the ticket. It, however, needs a PG-13 label. Young kids will certainly have nightmares. It is scary-gruesome. I wonder if Nicole Kidman (cast as the icky lay church official) will actually break the good witch's fingers or will the director skip that part?  Heretical positive comparisons with Tolkien aside, if you have even the slightest belief in a higher power or don't want to scare your kids half to death, I suggest you give Pullman's propaganda a pass. When an author's primary goal is to kill God (Pullman succeeds), he clearly has issues. Don't make them your ow 
 To get to the point, I was very disappointed with this item.  I've been battling with weight issues ever since I was a little girl and so I recently thought that portioning the food out would help in the battle.  Although the item arrived on time and in mint condition, the plate became a nightmare to handle with trying to wash it and it cracked in less than two weeks.  Now the plate is somewhere collecting dust in one of my cabinets and I turn to it in desperate situations when intake of food may be too much at a meal with my family.  Excitement for this plate turned to massive disappointment 
 My son loves Ben 10 and was really disappointed in this toy.  If they just designed it with a built in light it would be so much better.  Who would design a viewmaster that doesnt let in light so you can see the images???? I agree we've had fast food freebies that were better quality than this thing 
 We could not get the bread to rise properly no matter how much we tinkered with the ingredients.  We also tried the exact recipe that turned out beautifully in our old bread maker, but couldn't get it to work.  Must be the rising temparature is not appropriate 
 A Place on Earth is a laborious, read so filled with description and imagined thought processes that the point of the story is never evident.  The character development is not sufficient to entice the reader into really caring for any of the many, many people who wonder through the "Place".  It would be nice if Mr. Berry decided whether to present his ramblings in the past or present tense.  If you are interested in what a valley looked like in Kentucky during World War II, and you have a lot of time to figure out the unnecessarily complex rhetoric, maybe you'll enjoy this book.  If you want a story that invites you to turn to the next page, this ain't the place 
 Definitively this book is a very bad fairy tale. For instance: The prologue has three chapters and the only one that matters is the Air Force One's chapter. So you can skip the other two chapters as well as the epilogue.  Once you just skip those three chapters, the book goes fast paced until the persecutions began. How many persecutions can you read in a book? So to keep this review short. After the third persecution you'll start to bore of reading.  But the book's finish is scrumptiously preposterous. I don't know if there is or not a lost world -myself wrote a book about that- but traveling in time is just distraught. 
 Sorry to be so blunt, but I spent the last 5 weeks cursing the authors of this book (and those that I met on the road with this book felt the same way). Do NOT waste your money on this thing. It is FIVE years old (I live in Seattle and met one of the authors before she left in June '99). The information is totally outdated and some of the campsites no longer exist! My advice is to get a good guide that is updated regularly, maybe get a good idea for a route from the Mountaineers and then get the Michellin map following the scenic (green) routes (or get the special bikes maps from any bookstore (librarie) while you are there). Cycling in France is a breeze. Enjoy France on the bike...there is no greater place to ride. Don't let McGuide mess with your fun. Live to ride...ride to live.. 
 We thought that this book was on the boring side because there should of been more action or excitement. Our favorite part was when her grandmother came over. Our suggestions are to add more excitement and to make the book a little longer 
 This book's greatest flaw is, undoubtedly, its predictability.  It naturally has the descriptive and creative style of Scott, but the plot moves too logically from high point to high point with very little between.  There are very few "plot twists," and those which do occur are far from surprising.  From the book's outset, the story proceeds rapidly to the obvious tragic ending and seems to repeat regularly.  This ending also seems hurried and completely unbelievable.  The characters are poorly developed and, rather than seeming independent and realistic, seem to be nothing more than puppets forced to follow the extremely depressing plo 
 I read this book because it was my book club's choice. The best thing about a book club is you sometimes read a book you might not have read otherwise and the worst thing about a book club is you sometimes read a book you might not have read otherwise. This one falls under the second. No continuity, no story, just a compilation of research results. It might work as a thesis to fulfill a degree program but not as general reading. Boring 
 So she's blasting us soldiers (goes along with the President) for our "shedding blood in the name of liberty"? Dang her, she's like Dixie Chicks! I don't suppose she blasted Geo. Washington for shedding blood in the name of liberty? 
 I bought the 2006 edition of this book automatically, as I have for a number of years.  I am extremely disappointed with the totally revised content, as I find it much more difficult to use.  While it would seem logical to group the records together as done in the new volume, it just doesn't work for me.  The old layout of team info, with each team starting at the top of a page, has been junked, and the results are not pretty.  Furthermore, this is now just a record book; the old "facts" sections, including a review of the preceding season and a preview of the new season, have disappeared.  I'm keeping my 2005 edition and trashing the 2006.  I hope Sporting News comes to their senses and arranges the 2007 edition like the 2005 and prior editions.  "It wasn't broke, but they 'fixed' it anyway. 
 I never received this book. I'm hoping it was overlooked and will be sent soon 
 This book is not for someone who just wants to pick up enough French to get them through a trip unless they have a good ear and memory.  I found "French in 10 Minutes a Day" much better as you must write what you learn in a workbook 
 This was a really great story told in a really cool way but with this last book it almost all gose down hill. What was mistrious is now sappy a qultia. This is the down fall of the a great story 
 Dr. Sarno's concept is sound, but this is his first report, rather old.  There are two newer books, the best of which, of course, is the 2006 "The Divided Mind : The Epidemic of Mindbody Disorders", which I highly recommend.   
 This Audio CD was produced in very poor quailty, in terms of the sound and by the person reading it.  It would be nice if it was the true voice of Wallace Wattles - because I'd keep it just for sentimental reasons, but it sounds like it was recorded in about 1970 in a closet with a $50 tape recorder.  The reader is not professional - being short to of breath to speak whole sentences, and they are very monotone without expression (and I love this book so much, I want to hear it with some amount of conviction, strength and joy!)  If you want a better audio version than this - simply record yourself 
 Way too much music and the music was too loud.  Not only that, but the music isn't even good - just some new-agey soothing sounds stuff...  I bought it to meditate while I listen to nature but ended up giving it away after one listen.. 
 After reading Skinny Legs and All, and loving every word, I bought this book on tape.  Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed with it and stopped listening after the first CD.  How many times do we need to hear about an extra large scrotum?  It must be repeated a hundred times, and it just wasn't amusing.  The reader, Barrett Whitener, tries to do the best he can, but his poorly contrived Japanese accent (which sounds more like a German accent), just doesn't cut it.  I'm sure if I gave it another 3 or 4 hours of listening, I might get hooked, but who has that kind of time to gamble?? 
 Dear Sean,  Thanks for sending me your book "Deliver Us from Evil : Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism." Before I put the book down and turn off my light and go to sleep I just wanted to dash off a quick letter to you so you could clarify a thing or two for me. Let me get this straight. You'd like to see all Liberals vanish from the face of the American political system and have only Conservative Republicans running the show...is that right? Hmm...Let me see, if my memory serves me right there were some political states or nations that did function for a while under a one party system. There was the Soviet Union 1917-1991, Fascist Italy 1923-1945, Nazi Germany 1933-1945. Those are three just off the top of my head. They didn't like Liberalism either. Well, Sean I got to get going. I'm sure I'll write again soon.  All my best,  Bill  PS. Remember, fanaticism is far from being fair and balanced 
 this book just didnt do it for me and i agree that the book was just all over the place. 
 Well, nice cinematography as set-designer work: nicely interiors and well dressed actors. Maybe, visually it is enough to keep you watching this movie once, but not enough to consider it as a remarkable  movie of year, as other reviewers trying to assure 
 The author's barely concealed condescention towards her Provencal neighbors is annoying enough, but her lack of any charm or distinction relaying her experiences is really a bore.  Read Peter Mayle instead --or ANYONE ELSE FOR THAT MATTER,and save your money.  You wouldn't want to live next door to this writer, in Provence or in Bel Air California -- her other home.  Not exactly your average tourist!  And oh my,the recipes!  At the end of each chapter is a recipe of food vaguely mentioned in the text.  Tasteless, trite recipes bound to fail since they lack any semblance of detail, even, sometimes, the baking temperature.  Obviously the lady was trying to cover all bases.  Too bad she struck out on all of them 
 I read the reviews, and thought - this might be useful.  I haven't had a raise or cost of living adjustment in three years - and do not make what I was agreed to by the end of thie first year.  When I have asked my boss just to cover some expenses - I get to write a letter to the compensation committee (my boss and my other boss).  Yeah - I'm intimidated.   This book focuses only on this real estate broker complaining about not getting his commisions paid to him and the manuvers he did to get them.  Don't bother with the book - here is his advice:  Get all agreements in writing and feel blessed if you get what is in the agreement, bring a lawyer with you (fly him in your private jet like the author does) and use expensive suits and brochures to show how important you are.  I finished the book just to see if there was an easter egg at the end - the joke was on me.  The only advice I get take from the book is that I should have gotten it in writting, and should had an attorney come to my job interview.  What I thought I was getting was strategies to keep from being cowed and how to move people to my point of view.  What I got was a self rightious egoman, compaining how the world undervalued his work while he attached ugly labels to every buyer and seller he worked with.   Skip this book unless you are hateful and sell real estate 
 Nice photos on most pages, but the author jumps around and goes into topics that I'm not sure anyone will care about. Text is sappy and meaningless most of the time (example:  "Ladders are pure potential  energy: they just stand there waiting for that moment when they feel the  weight on the first rung, then the second, etc. Imagine being a ladder. It  must be what a fireman feels like: a life of expectancy."). You're  better off with the triumvirate of nicely photographed AND written  "rustic lifestyle" books: Cabin Fever; Adirondack Style; Rustic  Style 
 The cardboard shipping container for this bike was broken through and open in several places, which could have been the result of poor design of the packaging and/or inept handling by the shipping company.  A fender was bent and some of the paint was scratched.  The front brake was difficult to adjust because there did not seem to be enough wire.  A required tool, a 5mm allen wrench, was not provided. I have not attempted to adjust the gears because it seems too complicated, however, the bike seems to perform adequately as is. 
 This is the only one of the series that I've read, and now I doubt I'll bother with the others.  Conant has hung a bunch of red-herring plot twists and turns on a simplistic semi-mystery that in the end is nothing more than a guilty-family-secret story.  Nazis, eugenics, dog shows in the thirties, a Rockefeller heiress, the Isabelle Stewart Gardner museum -- all turn out to be irrelevant to the story line... 
 The reader should be aware of the fact that the author of this book was in the process of converting from Buddhism to Catholicism when he wrote it. In fact he then went on and wrote a book specifically about THAT - it is titled "The Unexpected Way: On Converting from Buddhism to Catholicism". In my opinion Williams goes out of his way (and at times quite obviously) to promote the view that Buddhism is inherently nihilistic. Rupert Gethin's "The Foundations of Buddhism" is vastly superior, as are the books by Kogen Mizuno: "Essentials of Buddhism" and "Basic Buddhist Concepts" 
 Bought the Camera, Charger and the kit as part of the deal. Every thing looks good except the missing NPF-50 Battery. Requested for a replacement. In the replacement kit also battery was missing. Returned both the items.   59.99 for a Carry bag and 3 DVD sis not worth buying this item  
 There are some things worth learning in this book. However, the characters reviewed are all postmodernists.  Schrift is utterly tolerant of the lunacy most of them write.  In fact, Schrift is one of the postmodernizers of Nietzsche.  He wants Nietzsche to worship at the feet of Derrida along with himself.  Schrift does not review, for example, Alain Finkielkraut, who is more popular in France than any of the PoMo big shots, and who does not share their opinion of Nietzsche.  He ignores Julien Benda as well.  And he never mentions Clement Rossett -- who had the temerity to point out that the entire movement claims to be Nietzschean, when nothing could be further from the truth.  The book is selective, and suspect becasue of that 
 Until a listen of this cd I never truly understood anguish, pain, and authenticity.  Morrisette is an artist of the highest caliber.  Reaching inside the depths of her soul to produce music that allows mere mortals a glimpse into the heart of genius.  Thank you Alanis for having the courage to put the struggles of growing up in suburban Ottawa as a provincial Tiffany child star into this masterpiece.  The realism of those mean streets that you survived only serve to make your art more credible.  Even the name Jagged Little Pill (and Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie too) is charged with an energy that is free from all posturing and posing.  The best that music has to offer. NOT!!!!!!! 
 I bought Regency Etiquette expecting a reference book which would explain in detail forms of address, rules of precedence,  how to make a formal introduction, whether a gentleman precedes or follows a lady up or down a staircase, and other specifics of correct behavior for the period. Had it contained this information, I would have considered it well worth the purchase price because I would have referred to it many times.   It is instead an interesting if repetitive specimen of the conduct book for young ladies, covering behavior in a very general way - you should dress to suit your body type and station, dress and carry yourself modestly, not allow gentlemen friends to take liberties, etc. The only specifics covered are the rules of precedence, and even these are given only for precedence among women, e.g., daughters of dukes, daughters of marquisses, viscountesses, etc. There are also some strange cosmetic recipes included at the end of the book, many of them so bizarre it was hard to imagine that any women of any era would be willing to put such concoctions on their skin or hair.  As another reviewer said, having read this book once I felt no need to read it again, and for this reason I regret spending $18 to buy it. However, if you are looking for an example of a general female conduct book of the period, you may consider the money well spent 
 This "novel" is supposed to be about a personal assistant to the stars.  While I was excited with the premise, my first upset was to discover that this was written as a novel.  Would it not have worked way better as non-fiction? It was my belief that this book was based on the author's personal experiences.  Yes, it would have been a little dicey to make it non fiction, but certainly lots more fun.  As it stands, this book is full of stories about "make believe" stars.  The author has our main character jumping from one star to the other without much coordination and throughout the whole thing, we are also subjected to silly comments from the main character.  Also, are we expected to believe that the "star assistant" works for all these people and does not even have contracts with any of them? Smacks of plot advancement to me.  Overall, unfortunately, this book was boring for me. I did not even want to attempt to try to figure out who the "fake" stars may represent in real life.  Next time - try writing a non fiction memoir - that would be interesting 
 Having read a few Bosch books already (The Closers and Lost Light), I realized that I should probably start at the beginning to get better insight on how Bosch became the Bosch I was reading in the later series.  However, I was very disappointed with this book.  One of the most irritating aspects of this book was the grammatical errors (mispellings and such).  I found 3 or 4 in the first 50 pages (before I stopped reading)!  I thought it was ironic that Connelly was thanking his editor at the beginning of the book, because it did not seem that anyone was editing this book.  Also, I found the book to be too gritty.  It lacked the emotion and soul that I found in the later books.  It seemed that Connelly was trying too hard to make Bosch fit this certain mold, but then transformed the character to be more likeable in the later books that I read.  So it was disappointing that this book could not hold my interest because I just finished reading The Narrows and loved it, and will probably pick up some other Bosch books and just read it out of order.  Connelly's writing seems to be getting better and better, which should explain why I didn't enjoy this book and couldn't finish it.  I gave it 2 stars because it might have gotten better and maybe I was too impatient.  This is one of those series that seems like it is better to read out of order 
 I have not seen this movie, but thanks to the review of "A viewer" from July 2001, I don't have to 
 I found the book to be extremely wordy.  As I read the book, I found myself having to remind myself what the chapter (or topic) was suppose to be covering.  Many of the statements in the book are common sense and points are repeated over and over through-out the text. The books is loaded with long list consisting of from 4-12 items.  The list appear to be attempts by the authors to include every possible idea they could think of.  My Professor used the questions from the test bank and many of the answers were buried in the readings.   	The cases studies were interesting, and the information on the website helps with the case analysis.  Although after reading one of the chapters, any reading was interesting.  Reading this book became a chore.  If the book is required for class, start reading now because the way the book is written will make you procrastinate 
 In wandering around the web, I find I am not the only person to experience crash after crash upon importing (from Photoshop Elements 5).  When importing, Lightroom "thinks" for a long time (that's fine, and they do warn you it can be slow), but then the program crashes before it gets even close to finishing the import. About the rest of the program?  I don't know.  Too frustrated just trying to get it up and running.

 This book and its various companion volumes are edited by Ivan van Sertima, a particularly extreme Afro-centrist. Now, I'm not against historians unearthing early (or late) African presences in Europe. Such a book could indeed be very illuminating. If no such books exist, Black scholars should write them. Or White scholars, for that matter.   But the books by Van Sertima are, I'm afraid to say, utter nonsense. Sorry, Ivan! The author is an extreme hyper-diffusionist, who believes that civilization started in Africa, and that Africans then spread it all over the world. Apparently, everyone was Black African: Moses, Jesus, Mohammed, Krishna, the builders of Angkor Wat, even the Olmecs in Central America. Come again? This is presumably the Black nationalist alternative to White supremacist hyper-diffusionism, where everyone is White instead: from Quetzalcoatl to the ancient Chinese, even the Zulu (I kid you not). However, it is a very bad alternative, simply reversing Euro-centrism.   "African presence in Early Europe" is very disconcerting. One example is its discussion of Herodotus, who claimed that Pharao Sesostris conquered "Europe" and "Asia". From this, one contributor draws the conclusion, that Sesostris actually did conquer what we today call Europe and Asia, including northern Europe with Scandinavia! This is rather like suggesting, that since Dubya is "American" president, he's in charge of everything from Greenland to Patagonia. (Well, maybe he thinks he is?) Of course, Herodotus was refering to Asia Minor and the European Black Sea region.   Further, the book claims that Pygmies lived in Scandinavia in ancient times. The proof? Legends about trolls! I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that statement. Frankly, it would make any Scandinavian laugh. The authors also believe that some Norsemen must have been African, since one of them was nicknamed "the Black". But other Norsemen were nicknamed "the Red", for instance the discoverer of Greenland, Erik the Red, or the Swedish king Hakan the Red. Yet, nobody claims they were American Indians.   This book may be interesting to those who study extreme forms of "alternative history", being essentialy a Black version of it, a sort of Black "Da Vinci Code". But those seriously interested in whatever impact Blacks might have had on Europe, should look eleswhere.  
 Who wants to watch images of crosses zoom across the screen? What is that? Looks rank amateur. THey got inaccurate lyrics typed while dude is rapping like if you like Bizzy you dont know the lyrics.

The extra footage is again a no name from ohio not bizzy. It goes back and forth from two shows and shows what looks like bizzy drunk doin a freestyle or dude can't rap no more 
 Grey takes a European vacation with his girlfriend and others but on Elba has his first (?) sexual experience with another man.  This apparently converts him and he returns to New York to take up with Scott, a whining, unappealing stereotype of the nelly queen.  Grey also has a brief, undeveloped fling with his boss, Bob, and then is driven back to Elba where for half of the book nothing happens between him and Paolo.  There is much potential here but it is not delivered.  The dialogue is also stretched, with Italians inexplicably saying "ya" with the same frequency as the Tennesseans in the  story.  On top of all of this, the book is frequently just weird.  Chapter 25 is totally unexplainable.  Some, but not all, chapters begin with cartoonish sketches of floorplans or maps.  Drew Banks, the author, may want to say Able Was I but this effort doesn't support it.  
 I give this album one star solely because the CD side WILL NOT play in a computer!  I love the content of the album; it's one of my favorites.  The remixes are all pretty good, from listening to the album in a CD player or as a DVD.  I'm not sure if it's some sort of copy protection that prevents play in a computer, or poor manufacturing techniques, but either way the producer of the album should be ashamed 
 Barry Glassner pulls off the unlikely feat of being the Sean Hannity of food writers (even though this is his first attempt at food writing).  After getting past a meandering argument that restraunt reviewers receive far better service than the ordinary folk, Glassner launches into his core argument that food scientists are often real smart folks working hard to give you what you want.  Folks who complain about their frankenfood creations just don't understand how hard these guys work!  In fact he recounts how he met a few himself in the course of writing the book and says they are real foodies too!  This drivel is followed by a defense of fast food in general, with snippy rebuttals generally aimed at Eric Schlosser's Fast Food Nation.  You'll learn that criticism of fast food is really just (another) elistist/leftist attack on ordinary folk, and that fast food restaurants provide a great place for homeless people and children to relax over delicious $1 burgers.  Less direct are Barry's snide comments on those who like ethnic, non-chain restaurants.  For some unknown reason, Glassner devotes a substantial portion of the book to belittling folks who just like to get out and try small off-beat restaurants.    All in, a strange collections of views on the food industry with poorly "cooked" arguments.  If you want to be educated about the food industry, look elsewhere. 
 The title and cover photo suggests this book is about US troops captured in the Battle of the Bulge particularly since the sub-title is "American POWs Trapped by the Nazi's Final Gamble."  The cover photo is one frequently published as capured GIs of the 99th Division at Honsfield on the German/Belgian border in December 1944.  The book was "inspired" by a 2003 documentary piece BERGA: SOLDIERS OF ANOTHER WAR by New York's WNET PBS channel developed by Charles Guggenheim, an internationally acclaimed documentary filmmaker who was captured as part of the 106th Infantry Division in the opening stages of the Battle of the Bulge.   The book (I listened to the audio version) is more two stories, haphazardly woven together about Hungarian and other people of Jewish background with no connection to the US military and some GIs singled out by religious beliefs or assumed to be Jewish or troublemakers in POW camps all sent to work camps near Berga, Germany to dig tunnels and caves for protected industrial sites.   Savage treatment of captives in concentration and work camps is well known and this work provides more evidence of depravity and repeats, in new circumstances, unmet justice as the developing Cold War diluted much of the fervor for finding and prosecuting Nazi war criminals.  I think thr writer had a story of Hungarian victims and wanted to tell it.  He should have, but not by using GI experiences as the tease.  If you are looking for military history and what happened to some Jewish GIs captured near the end of the war, maybe twenty percent of the book is about that with little at all about their experiences immediately before capture, a context for their role and the role of their units or anything else.  The rest is about other victims, with dialog "enhanced" almost as fiction.  I felt deceived by the title and cover and would not have bought the audio book in lieu of a couple of Google searches, particularly the PBS website which contains interviews of dozens of GIs who did hard time at Berga.  Better yet, PBS sells a DVD of its documentary for twenty bucks.

 I found the plot of this book impossible to follow.  It contains excessively verbose descriptions with a lot of cliches. The hero almost dies twice in a row and is each time magically saved for no reason.  And there are only so many times I can read variations of "he swung his sword really hard" and "it was a really scary dragon."  The illustrations are quite beatiful, though 
 I have been a big fan of these printers.  I own one vintage unit from when they were CoStar LabelWriters, and 2 LabelWriter 330 units. I still love the functionality, BUT ... now both of my 330s (one at home, one in the office) have suffered power supply failures.  Dymo's solution is to send them back for a $75 repair (each).  That's a large fraction of the purchase price.  The power supplies lived through the warranty period, but not much longer ... so the calculation you must make is whether a unit that lives just about that long is worth the purchase price.   It is possible, of course, that current models are more reliable. Or not. 
 I hated this book!It was like a big lie. Nothing of what she mentioned really happened. I am Lebanese and I know all about Arab culture. This lousy book gives a very wrong impression about Arab culture, it is infact  nothing of what she mentioned.Even in war time, when Lebanon was devided  into Sharkiyyeh(Eastern part where all the Christians lived) and  Gharbiyyeh( Western part where all the Muslims lived)it was never like what  she wrote about. Even if it were to happen, it would happen to one in a  million. I wonder why she got so much attention over a lame book. To me it  was more like a lousy re-write of an American novel. Western people who  read this book PLEASE don't beleive it! Elle doit faire attention a ce  qu'elle ecrit 
 There's not an ounce of meat in this book.  This book features a steady stream of the author's self-praise and excessive "name-dropping".  The "conclusions" are certainly not original.  The thesis of the book is never really developed and the text is directionless and slow. 
 I should know by now that anything Oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy.  But this tome pegs the Kumbayaometer.  I don't know what was worse, Morrie's trite, Godless, and lapsed-Jewish advice to "be nice to those we love" or Mitch Albom's profiteering off a friend's gruesome ALS death. What is it with America that we flock to this shallow I'm okay-You're okay amoral clap-trap and treat it as profundity?  Is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our self-esteem which is the real god of this age? As a sidebar, what is it with Oprah and her ilk?  That a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic.  Safe to say, anything written by the tirelessly self-promoting Albom should be avoided and anything The Big O pushes should be rejected out of hand. By the way, I read this drivel in a Barnes and Noble while I waited for a phone call one afternoon.  If you must read it, get it at a library and keep the money from getting to Mitch 
 This guy is pathetic and should be ashamed of himself.He was ashamed of his mother,yet thought John's mother could do no wrong.He is a hanger-on,and Im sure all Kennedy family members and true friends are disgusted.Also,did every social interaction revolve around liquor? 
 This must be one of the latest entries in the Dan Brown school of writing. Name an expert, assign an audience, lecture on historical points and expect applause at the end. Well, Kathy Reichs can wait for a long time. There will be no applause for this book. I would like my money back. I'm almost finished and still can't really figure out what the plot actually is. I guess she will just pop the final lecture and the conclusion will name the murderer. What about motive, character development (sex + history), etc... This is my first novel by this author and it will be my last 
 It's amazing how 195 pages can contain information about all wild foods (of North America?) complete with descriptions and from field identification to its uses to the kitchen. Makes no mention of ethical harvesting (photos of ginseng and her stories of the market price of ginseng actually work against the spirit of wild foods) nor warnings of poisonous lookalikes (rendering the book dangerous). Never to be bought or caught holding a copy, so please be discreet if you want to find out for yourself in a library or bookstore 
 I read this book after reading "What to Expect When You're Expecting" and was very disappointed.  I liked "Expecting," most likely because while pregnancies differ, the biology is pretty much the same for everyone, so it's hard to miswrite pregnancy.  However, after reading "First year" I have found myself overly concerned for no reason simply because a lot of what is in this book has not accurately described my child's behavior or abilities.  I know the authors put out the disclaimer that every baby is different, but I'm not talking about when kids will walk or talk.  I'm talking about their claim that babies can feel embarassment at the age of ten months or understand that I want my son to help clean up if I hand him a paper towel.  Additionally, the book does not always offer a good answer to a question...the answer usually comes in the form of "some babies will, some babies won't."  How is that helpful?!!  After noting a string of inconsistencies and claims that are simply false, I finally had to put the book down or drive myself crazy.  In long, I do not recommend this book to anyone, particularly a first time mother.      
 If you buy Storeys Guide to Raising Chickens then do not bother with this book it is just an excerpt from his other book word for word 
 I'm not sure if I'm reading the same book as the one read by all the 'positive' reviewers here.  What I was hoping for when I ordered, was some insight into how someone with a relatively small (at least in the casino's eyes) bankroll could find places to exploit the comp systems at the casinos.  Instead, I found the book was 90% geared towards 'high-rollers' who would be able to play blackjack for hours at $100 per hand.  In my casino experiences, if you have the bankroll to play at that level, a) you have enough money that comps don't matter and/or b) the casino will make certain that you get the 'attention' you deserve.    There was nothing that I found useful for the smaller player.  Things mentioned are common sense to most players.  
 what a shame.  c.a. was such a talented and beautiful young woman but apparently got some horrible career advice.  maybe she wanted to be this way, but most likely, it was a manager, or record company trying to create a even more slutty successor to britney spears.  more is not always better, and in this case, it is definitely worse.  hopefully, she banked her $$, cuz i can't imagine that she'll ever recover from this debacle.  that would be as likely as a porn star trying to make it in hollywood.  very sad 
 Sternhell brings no new news, as Hertzberg correctly states above, just his spin on the already known facts.  Sternhell is one of the gang of 'new historians' and as such brings the already debunked 'original sin' libel to the table again.  This is tiresome and repetitive 
 I read this in passing at the new San Jose Main Public Library the other day. These coauthors' writing is as harsh as Ann Coulter's but of an opposite persuasion.  However, their use of citations and supporting documentation is lacking.  It is mostly up to the reader to guess which points are supported by which references in the bibliography.  There are no footnotes, just mere page number references.  A great number of references are simply for the sprinklings of quotations used.  The fact, that Alterman and Green are employed by any journal, is chilling and an insult for that employer. Alterman, intending to attack "neocons," uses an example of voter intimidation in places like Baltimore where the "Get out the Vote" advertisments also say "...and take care of your oustanding warrants, overdue rent, etc..."  Another example is one that persuades people to show up at the polls days after election day.  [Incidentally, the book's issues like this are debatably related to the topic of President Bush...] So much for the idea of a "well-informed electorate!" Such voter intimidation is not just sad but almost laughable. First, does anyone want to admit depending on a voter base of individuals who fall for intimidation like this?  This was an insult to liberal causes!  To think this was a great book, you too would probably fall for voter intimidations like these examples given by Alterman and Green. Second, are these guys trying to tell us that a qualification, to be considered a minority, consists of being duped by garbage like this?  What an insult to minorities! Third, if these guys are responsible journalists, can they report on anybody of their own polity that might be doing something about the state of the electorate's information?  While Alterman and Green make this point on their own voter base being so inadequate with any base of knowledge, they are trying to make a point, by begging the question from the first page, that President Bush himself has a very inadequate base of knowledge.  Worse yet, Alterman and Green propose that a bad state of knowledge is further demonstrated by President Bush's tendency to ask "stupid" questions.  Perhaps all readers should reflect on whether it is better to have stupid questions asked than to have stupid results occur when nobody has the courage to ask stupid questions.  And back to the concept of a "well-informed electorate," real education begins with real questions.  It is too bad that Alterman and Green have evidently been too proud to ask any questions, starting with "Why did so and so ask such and such question?" instead of jumping to their conclusions.  Another example of Alterman and Green's points is that President Bush's tendency to leave the "details" to others is a weakness.  It would have been more useful to their point to expound on how this balances one's own core competencies with those of others.  It's an effective corporate strategy.  Maybe journalists know nothing about that.  Alterman and Green's publication is a strike out for journalism. If you are a proponent of progressiveness or of the idea of a "well-informed electorate," this book does not help either of these causes 
 Not all that useful, really.  Message is "buy mutual funds!".  In general, since the vast majority of mutual funds underperform the market, just buy index funds would be the best advice.  Most of the text is entirely useless to someone who might want to trade individual stocks.  Passages suggest that if a company seems undervalued you might want to have lunch with the CEO to go over the financials and confirm your valuation.  Oh, thanks Peter, what great advice... ("Mr. Gates, your 11 o'clock is here to discuss purchasing 15 shares") 
 These is beastly, useless DVD. Instructors don't count at all and don't dance to music. They dance only cumbia constantly.  They have no style. Don't buy this video, you will not learn salsa. I think to return these DVD 
 In terms of readability, Fagan's book is a decent piece of popular science.  It makes an engaging argument that human civilizations have been affected mightily by climatic shifts.  But it is fraught with problems: I  am an expert on the history of El Ni~no, and I can attest that the chapters  about El Ni~nos past and the history of scientists' understanding of El  Ni~no hit some of the bright spots.  But the details are at best inaccuate  and at worst highly deceptive.  Fagan simply knows little about this  subject, otherwise he would have distilled a more accurate account!  It  simply does not stand up to careful examination.  Mickey Glantz's book  _Currents of Change_ (1996) is better, although it suffers from similar  problems and is less readable.  Those who want to read a carefully  researched narrative about the El Ni~no-Southern Oscillation and its impact  on human history unfortunately have no where to go, yet 
 This video is way overpriced for what you are getting.  The video quality is extremely poor and the sound quality is even worse.  The content is extremely clinical, almost to the point of grossing you out.  The 2-video set is basically the same concept demonstrated 2 times.  If you feel compelled to check this out, buy the 1-video version, which is less expensive 
 And by REAL AMERICAN HISTORY, I mean empirically observed and verified facts, not some over-exaggerated facts created by some die-hard socialist with an ideological axe to grind against capitalism, which just got picked up by government propaganda artists and regurgitated by public school teachers and textbooks, such as the person below:  "Mr. N. obviously still thinks this book is complete fiction and has probably never had a United States history lesson in his comfortable life."  First of all, the book is widely cited as being responsible for the Meat Inspection Act of 1906, yet there was a previous Meat Inspection Act passed in 1891, practically fifteen years before the Meat Inspection Act of 1906.  In the time since there grew to be hundreds, if not thousands of employees at the federal, state, and local levels.  After Upton Sinclair wrote, had published, and had distributed The Jungle, the United States Congress at the time (specifically the 59th Congress) had a (now pay particular attention to these next few sentences class, as they provide far more factual information than your textbook describes) Congressional Hearing for their first session in June of 1906 where on page 194 of their Hearings on the So-called "Beveridge Amendment" to the Agriculture Appropriation Bill, where Indiana Congressman E. D. Crumpacker of Indiana noted in testimony before the House Agriculture Committee that not one of the hundreds of meat inspectors at the federal, state, and local levels "ever registered any complaint or [gave] any public information with respect to the manner of the slaughtering or preparation of meat or food products."  There was even authoritative 1906 report of the Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Animal Husbandry written. Its investigators provided a point-by-point refutation of the worst of Sinclair's allegations, some of which they labeled as" willful and deliberate misrepresentations of fact," "atrocious exaggeration," and "not at all characteristic."  On top of all that, there were millions of tourists visiting the Chicago stockyards each year, plus thousands of workers who at one time or another worked for the Chicago Stockyards.  So how come it took one lone, heavily die-hard socialist to reveal this all?  Or could it be that it just made it all up and greatly overexaggerated in order to push his socialist agenda?  After all, it was Theodore Roosevelt who wrote about Upton Sinclair in his letter to William Allen White in July 1906, "I have an utter contempt for him. He is hysterical, unbalanced, and untruthful. Three-fourths of the things he said were absolute falsehoods. For some of the remainder there was only a basis of truth."  It is ironic that Upton Sinclair then decried the Meat Inspection Act of 1906, as he saw it for what it really was, a move to give more power to big business who got the taxpayers to pick up the entire $3 million price tag for its implementation as well asnew regulations on their smaller competitors, and another myth entered the annals of anti-market dogma.   "The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair is a novel that illustrates the blunt reality of accurate historical event of the 1920s"  No, as I've just pointed out, it was largely fictional propaganda, just like Michael Moore.  If you really want to know how bad things were like during the Industrial Revolution, then ask yourself why we constantly had newer and better technologies available to the public and dirt-poor people like John D. Rockefeller, Henry Ford, and others constantly fulfill the American Dream, which happens a lot less in America thanks to all of the government controls on the economy 
 A tired attempt to re-run the ancient heresy of Gnosticism. May impress ignoramuses who know nothing of theology. I attended Fox's lectures in Western Australia a few years ago. They were an incoherent babble of scientific gobbledegook, historical nonsense and psychological trickery. I am not a Catholic but I don't wonder the Catholic Church unfrocked him 
 Reading the reviews for this book I thought it would be a more substantial book than what I found.  It is a cute idea, but it is lacking in content.  Very disappointed...will probably end up as a garage sale book 
 More work for mother?  Gimmie a break!!  This book attempts to further the fiction that it's women who are still doing the housework.  While this may have been true 40 years ago, the feminization of the American male that's occurred since then makes this a thing of the past.  Just look around!  Men are pushing strollers, cleaning houses, cooking dinners, involved in selecting dcor, PLUS doing all the "men's work" that they previously did, such as yard work, fixing the car, and doing all those other heavy and dirty jobs.  To make matters worse, these are often men who work demanding jobs with lots of travel to bring in the money, often for wives that are just sitting home on their asses!  When these men come home from a grinding business trip, the wife is on them to "be more involved," so you see them running around killing themselves around the house and with the kids while their wives are over at the spa or having coffee with their yenta friends.  More work for Mother?  The book we need is "Modern Marriage:  What's in it for Father? 
 A picture showing James Dean and Elia Kazan visiting the East of Eden set claims they're doing so in 1955 when they were probably actually visiting it in 1954 (the year they actually made EOE). I never thought of Kazan as being one of the greatest directors ever and I still don't. He's certainly no Alfred Hitchcock or Cecil B. deMille or Steven Spielberg. 
 This book is a prime example of how ignorant politicians are of the principles upon which this country was founded on and in particular the US Constitution.  One chapter of this book is even called "Reclaiming our constitutional democracy."  Reclaiming our constitutional what?  The US is a Republic, not a democracy.  Our founders loathed mobocracy.  No where in the US Constitution is "democracy" even mentioned, although the Constitution guarantees a republican form of government for every state.  In the introduction, Ted writes that one of the "challenges" is "to provide health care to every American."  Excuse me, where in the Constitution does it say that the Federal Government is to provide health care?  Take a look at the 10th article in the Bill of Rights, Ted.  Health care is not a Federal issue.  So stay out of it.  Another "challenge" is to "restore our basic values."  I wonder what basic values Ted has in mind here (because at this point I could not stomach this tripe anymore and had to put the book away).  Then again, considering this book is written by a man who escaped a manslaughter conviction after leaving a woman to drown in his car, my curiosity over Ted's "basic values" has been abated 
 As far as acting, story line, directing, casting, and sexiness, it's a dud. Another ultra-hyped mediocrity. Enjoyable to a degree for just how incomprehensible it is 
 I'm forced to read this book for an American History class that I'm taking, and, although the stuff inside seems fairly accurate, it can be INCREDIBLY boring. So, if you are one of those weirdos who likes watching paint dry, go ahead and buy the book 
 Overall, an 'OK' read, but teaches human sexuality as though his audience was a grade-six sex education class as rather than mature-minded adults.  This book is extremely simplistic and vague, and tends to lean towards a more dellusional depiction of human sexuality, often confining it to the contexts of outmodded biblical principles and male-dominated patriarchy.  Lacking modern approach and intimate sensuality, I would sincerely hope that this book is not a reflection of poor Tim's seemingly mechanical sex life!!  I would not recommend this book unless you are totally ignorant and clueless about what sex is all about.  I would suggest looking elsewhere for a more relevant guide to sexual intimacy 
 I'm very disappointed because the word "Minature" is hidden in the parenthesis section after the title.  I didn't notice that when I ordered and do NOT want the miniature version 
 this movie was really bad not to mention boring.  three campers run into a psycho who kills them after torturing them for a bit.  however don't think the torture scenes are that great......if you want torture, Hostel was a better movie for gore/torture and the acting was alot better also.  I ended up fast forwarding through most of it sinc it was slow in alot of parts.  The two girls died, the boy lived and Mick was never caught.  
 This book didn't cover the "main" short stories I thought should be in a "greatest hits" of F. Scott Fitzgerald.  It did have some of the "classics."  I would look for another book on short  stories before I bought this book 
 THE LORD OF THE RINGS   I was a teenager back in the mid and late 70s, and JRR Tolkien's popularity was inescapable. I started reading THE HOBBIT, which is a little prequel to this. I don't think I finished it, and I know I never tackled THE LORD OF THE RINGS. I found Tolkien hard to read. Imaginative, sure, and no doubt thematic, but it was like Margaret Mitchell. Unreadable. (Don't start -- I'm from the South.)   Later, I saw an animated version of the trilogy on TV which lasted somewhere between 90 and 120 minutes. Naturally it made no sense, because you can't compress all that into such a short time span.   Then, I gave up on Tolkien and played another game of DUNGEONS & DRAGONS. I was addicted, folks. Role Playing Games are an author's playground. I didn't play as much as I wanted, because I was too much in demand as a Dungeon Master. Naturally.   But now, in this millennium, let's watch some movies! I live in China, where the trilogy cost me 20 yuan. For those keeping score at home, about US$2.50.   THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING   It was a bit slow getting started, presenting all the back story, but I was surprised later on when I needed it and remembered it so well. Okay, yep, Tolkien's got game. Given his popularity, one would sincerely hope so.   You absolutely have to love the look of Middle Earth. How are they able to adjust everybody's heights? Most of the special effects are impressive.   Most importantly, somehow I feel sure the filmmaker stayed true to Tolkien's vision. In fact, I read somewhere that he did.   I never found elves quite so annoying in my Dungeons & Dragons days as I do now. I bet they never sweat, do they? They talk in riddles and glow too much, but I guess that happens when you live too long.   The various species are quite distinguishable, aren't they? So are different members of the same species. This is masterful. It's a skill far too few modern authors possess. Either everybody in the book seems like the same person, or else each character seems to belong to a stereotype of some sort. Tolkien avoids both pitfalls while simultaneously acknowledging that, yes, sometimes it's reassuring to a person/character to have a stereotype to fall back upon for a sense of identity when circumstances require.   Once our fellowship finally goes into battle, we get some great sequences. Among many fine performances, those of Frodo and Gandalf stand out in my mind. Oh, and "never toss a dwarf," which I KNOW Tolkien didn't write. Anxiously awaiting part two.   THE TWO TOWERS   What's more boring than real world politics? Fictional politics! I don't believe Tolkien spent this much time on the war aspect. Well, I hope he didn't. Saruman makes a bunch of uber-Orcs and sics 'em on humanity. Fine. We don't need a cast of thousands to spend hours in mock battles. Nor do we need the lamest excuse for a "love story" in cinematic history.   But once we FINALLY get past all that, I believe we get back to the Tolkien vision. Here's hoping we stay there for part three.   (Two hours, two paragraphs. What's wrong with this picture?)   THE RETURN OF THE KING   A balanced attack. That's what THE TWO TOWERS lacks but THE RETURN OF THE KING has. By this, I mean that long sustained fight sequences are boring. That's not your "action," unless your name's Jackie Chan. Give us just enough fight to let us move from plot point to plot point, then switch over to the real conflict before we get bored and leave the theater.   {No hate mail from Jackie Chan fans, please. I love SHANGHAI NOON.}   The real drama comes in the interpersonal, and in Frodo versus that @#$%^* ring. Gollum is one freaky deaky, ain't he? Liv Tyler is still unwatchable, but fortunately her screen time was minimal.   We get very close to the end of this film before Hollywood excess creeps into the war scenes. Those very cool elephants, for example, seem unstoppable. I was quite impressed with Orlando Bloom's quietly effective performances, but I'll never believe his computer simulated double took down one of those big bad muthas. Those elephants are doomsday machines, and the heroes' strongholds were Hiroshima and Nagasaki.   Meanwhile back at the ranch, perhaps we had one too many dramatic rescues that stretched credibility. Sam the Hobbit versus HOW MANY orcs? Um, lest we forget, he's only a freakin hobbit!   I don't know if it was the screenwriters who wrote themselves into a corner or perhaps Tolkien himself. But, well, somebody damn sure did. Let's floor the gas over those speedbumps and see what's on the other side.   Unlike some critics, I appreciated that this film didn't end at the "climax." We needed some more time to just hang out in Middle Earth, well over 9 hours after we entered the place, without all that pseudo-violent cast-of-thousands FX crap.   However, anyone who left on the elf ships is a geeberhead, and that includes the entire elven race. You can leave your Shire without leaving your world, Tolkien. I did. I've been in China since 1999.   THE VERDICT   I appreciate Tolkien's imagination, and I'm glad the film people made this. But I know it could be so much better with an editor. Yeah, I'm talking about changing what Tolkien wrote if required.   (There goes another subscriber...)   I read somewhere that so many people write in this genre because they don't think Tolkien wrote enough. I disagree. I think they write in this genre because they know they can do it better.   (And there goes another subscriber...)   Nothing about this movie changed my opinion. I was happy to watch it once, but I can't imagine anyone wading through it twice. I've swapped it for a copy of the GODFATHER trilogy, which I'll review in a future issue of WHO MOVED MY RICE?  
 My 5-year-old daughter was thrilled with her locket. It is really beautiful. We were both quite disappointed, however, when the locket itself broke...the loop that attaches to the bail completely came off. She is a normal kid, but was not overly rough with the necklace. It is currently at the jeweler's to be fixed 
 In a word, disappointing.  Reese sets out to document the machinations of the Catholic hierarchy, satisfactorily covering the structure and official mission of its various parts.  The energy he devoted to questioning Vatican officials is apparent, yet is also the book's shortfall.  As an insider, Reese writes what could easily pass for an authorized biography; the Pope could read this with nary a blush (was that the intent?).  Interspersed with the occasional slap on the wrist for good measure, the book seems to have only one source for information on how (in)efficiently the Vatican functions: the Vatican itself.  Missing is any analytical scrutiny, external sourcing, or simply a ounce of skepticism of anything emanating from Vatican lips.  Some utterances are downright banal: "...everyone agrees that the Vatican is better run and more efficient than the Italian bureaucracy."  It would be hard to contrive a more meaningless analysis.  Reese is an insider's insider; those looking for a documentary or expose can look elsewhere.  But if you want the sanitized version, I recommend calling the Vatican and avoiding the middleman 
 Hateful liberals once again undermine their so-called ideology by promoting the hatred of over half the US population. They claim to be tolerant and open-minded toward all lifestyles,religions, races etc... but that open-mindedness obviously shouldn't apply to people who disagree with them. Throughout the "book," Moore also demonstrates his racism towards caucasians and thin people. If you like this book, I also recommend Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler. Both "books" are jam-packed full of hate. 
 It makes for a wonderful book when your toddler is going through one of those stages of just wanting to read the same book over and over and over and over and over b/c there isn't much for you to read.   I have to admit though that although I find the illustrations charming the whole premise is kind of creepy. I always end the reading with, "And then CPS came and took the mother away and placed baby with a loving, responsible family and Carl went on to star in his own TV show." I don't want my daughter being left with the impression that if we get a dog at some point it will be babysitting. I'm all for catharsis in children's books to show irresponsible behavior, etc. I think this one is disturbing b/c the parent is the one that's so horrible. The kid and dog are doing what one would expect 
 If you suffer from a digestive disorder (mine include IBS and ulcerative colitis) you are desperate for a cure. This book has about 100 "cures" but none of them work. If they did everyone would be cured. Most people with GI disorders try everything possible because the medical profession simply doesn't have any answers other than surgery. I myself have tried about 15 different "cures" this book offers.Nothing worked.  I bought this book but don't reccomend that anyone else do so. If you want to read it, take it out of your library 
 This movie really showcases the extreme dorkiness of the early 80s. But it's really no one's fault, they didn't KNOW they were dorks back then, that's just the way everyone acted before Michael Jackson came along.  Clarence Beeks (the Breakfast Club guy) turns in his usual McGruff the Crime Dog performance. And nice appearance by Tom Hanks too; his 2nd best performance, very closely behind Saving Private Ryan, which I would recommend watching immediately after seeing this movie. They go well together.  Oh well, at least this movie gave the Police Squad! an idea on how to open up their show. And it's still better than Hercules in New York, although by very much, no 
 This is the worst appliance I have ever bought. Because of the timer the fryer keeps shutting off after 15 min. which is the max you can set the timer, but the instructions clearly say chicken takes 20 min. Huston I think we have a problem here. The "helpful hints" in the back say to keep resetting the timer, sorry this is to much work. I just want to cook my food and be done. I gave this item one star as clean up was so quick and easy that I was able to return this fryer the same day. PS my house still stinks of fish after a week and a half so the order blocker doesn't work 
 I have not enjoyed a novel less than I enjoyed this one for many years. Totally unconvincing, uninteresting, and really just silly. To be avoided. 
 This book is simply horrible. It takes the stereotypical accountant and shoves him into the pages. It is so lethargic and monotonous that all the valuable information within the book just stops making sense. This book should be read by anyone who has doubts about becoming an accountant. They'll drop everything and go into premed. Horrible 
 While there were some interesting bits in this book and it was readable, for the most part it completely undermined the character of Raistlin, contradicts previous books, and is generally annoying 
 Not sure about this one. Really enjoyed the Woman in White. I found this one a little tedious and slow quite despite the  very high esteem in which it is held by Wilkie fans.   
 Somehow this book ended up being a required text in my full-time MBA program.  We complained so much that this was a 1st year 'college level' book and not appropriate at our level that my school discontinued it the following year.  Now I can't resell my 'unused' version on campus.  What a waste 
 I could hardly get through this ugly memoir filled with mean and unsympathetic people. The worst was the extreme cruelty toward animals that runs throughout the entire book. It left me with a very bad taste in my mouth! This book should not have been written 
 I have read many methods books over the past 4 years. This book was the initial text required in a methods class. I found it to be very poor in detail (especially for the preservice teacher). I finished the book wondering, "where are the specific how to's?" I felt that I wasn't prepared to go into a classroom to teach a lesson. We were all struggling in class.  So, I decided to go to another college bookstore and found "Methods for Effective Teaching" by Paul Burden. This book answered all my questions and went into great detail. It is based on the INTASC Standards and PLT of the Praxis 
 Making your own kanji flashcards is A LOT of work (I've tried it) so I definitely recommend buying a set. I tried these Tuttle cards and then read a review here saying that the White Rabbit Press cards were the best, so I thought I would try them too. (I'm always in the market for anything that is going to save me some time.) Compared to the White Rabbit Press cards, the Tuttle cards are not as useful. The vocabulary words they picked are not always something you would use everday and the definitions are usually just one or two words. Also, I found several mistakes, and I'm still a beginner! The White Rabbit cards are much larger (and thicker) so they had more room for more vocabulary (each card has 6 examples--Tuttle has only four) and the definitions on the White Rabbit Press Kanji Flashcards are more like the ones that you'd find in a dictionary. They show if nouns are countable or uncountable or both, like in "(an) internal medicine." Overall I think the White Rabbit cards are a much better investment. I had to search Google to find them, but I found the author's email address and he said they should be on Amazon soon 
 ...the bullet before compromising Michael Caine into this. But, what else could you expect from trash made for TV (sorry for the redundancy) 
 The 49A cartridge gives you about 2,500 pages of print.  The 49X gives you about 6,000 page of print, for ONLY about 4 dollars more in price!  The 49A costs about 33.5 cents per page printed.  The 49X costs about 12 cents per page printed.  Why would anyone buy the 49A cartridge and pay almost 3X as much per page of print?  Where I work, I made sure our supply folks order ONLY the 49X cartridges.  
 Some books, in my opinion, are just plain overrated.  The characters in this novel are dull and uninteresting.  Likewise the tale.  The reader takes nothing from it. Put this in a list with Franzen's The Corrections and Frazier's Cold Mountain of award winning novels that did not deserve the accolades 
 Christopher Byron's sensibility indicates that he is a small-minded, pathologically envious little weasle of a man, who tries to puff up his empty meaningless life by attempting to denigrate a great woman who has brought great beauty and grace to our culture.  Unless you're one of those nasty-spirited people who find glee in joining the pack of hyenas who hate powerful, brilliant, talented women because the light from great women's souls is too bright and reveals too vividly your pathetic life, avoid this book. Byron is simply a mean little vampire, trying to suck money and notoriety from the life blood of Martha.  Shame on John Wiley & Sons for publishing this book 
 Right from the start, when Fleming hopelessly muddles the beginning of the war to put Germany in the best light ("The French, allied with Russia, attacked from the west," he says (p. 43). In fact, it was Germany that unleashed the Schlieffen Plan on France) it is clear this work is a dedicated piece of revisionism. While Fleming spills much ink on his theme the Germans were the victims of shadowy forces conspiring against them, and not primarily responsible for turning a diplomatic stand-off over an act of pre-emptive regicide into a world war, it is clear the true villain of the book is Woodrow Wilson.   If anything goes wrong, Wilson is to blame - not just the failure of the League of Nations, but everything from Bolshevism ("Without U.S. support, the bankrupt British and French could do little but fritter around the edges of the Russian upheaval," p. 342 - gee, I thought the problem with Wilson was he was too eager to intervene in other people`s wars), to prohibition: "If Wilson had been on the job as president instead of playing world savior he might have fought the passage of this bad legislation and immediately started rallying enough congressional votes to sustain a veto. He did neither. It was one more piece of evidence that the president had lost sight of his responsibility as leader of the American people." (p. 414-415).  In exonerating Germany Fleming seems to take positive glee at the fate of "poor little Belgium." "To an objective observer, Northcliffe and his allies in Wellington House would seem to have had a problem arousing pity for Belgium." He describes the appalling personal rule of King Leopold as "a holocaust that exceeds anything in previous, or subsequent, recorded history," and calls Belgium "about as neutral as Scotland" and "about as democratic as Germany." (p. 49-50). Setting aside for a moment Germany's unmentioned but less than stellar record of barbarity in its own Africa dominions (just ask the Herero people), and the book's pooh-poohing of German atrocities during their debauch through Belgium, the principle of state sovereignty itself cannot be allowed to stand in the way of the triumphant march of Fleming's revisionism. Everything the noble Teutons do (or don't do) is ascribed to the noblest of causes - even the failure of German propaganda is ascribed to "Na√Øve Germanic self-righteousness." (p. 61).  Ironically, it is clear Anglophobic Fleming draws heavily on arch imperialist Niall Ferguson (see footnote 17, p. 494) for his themes (as does fellow revisionist John Mosier in his The Myth of the Great War). He says that it wasn`t until 1918 that "The Germans, exasperated by the Allied refusal to settle for anything less than a knockout blow, were contemplating peace terms as harsh and vindictive as those the French and British imposed." (p. 480). In fact, as anyone who has read Fritz Fischer's Germany's Aims in the First World War would know, German imperial ambitions - which aimed at the effective annexation of the Low Countries and neutralization of France - were fully realized even before the end of the first year of fighting.  In his efforts to whitewash the Second Reich Fleming skips from revisionism to fantasy. "Germany's aims before the war were relatively modest," he maintains. "Basically, Berlin sought an acknowledgement that it was Europe's dominant power. It wanted an independent Poland and nationhood for the Baltic states, to keep Russia a safe distance from its eastern border. Also on the wish list was a free trade zone in which German goods could circulate without crippling tariffs in France, Italy, Scandinavia and Austria-Hungary. It is not terribly different from the role Germany plays today in the European Economic Union. But the British Tories could not tolerate such a commercial rival in 1914 and chose war." (p. 480). This paragraph includes one factual error - the Tories were in opposition in 1914 - and the rest is Niall Ferguson-inspired utterly spurious nonsense.  The real extent of Germany's imperial ambition was revealed at the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which was forced on Russia in 1918 - Fleming deems this worthy of nothing more than two paragraphs on p. 197. Meanwhile, "The ongoing British blockade would become the greatest atrocity of World War I," Fleming declares (p. 296), something the Armenians, victims of outright genocide perpetrated by Germany's "halfhearted" (p. 58) ally Turkey, might take issue with.  The book is also riddled with mistakes:  Fleming says "[Media baron Lord] Northcliffe almost single-handedly revived the British Conservative Party in the elections of 1912." (p. 48). Presumably, he means the two elections of 1910.  Contra Fleming, tanks did not make their combat debut at Cambrai in 1917 (p. 220) but on the Somme a year earlier.  Fleming describes the Prime Minister of South Africa as coveting "German West Africa, a huge colony just north of his country, now known as Zimbabwe." (p. 336). In fact, Zimbabwe used to be called Rhodesia after the very British Cecil Rhodes. Fleming has it confused with Namibia.  Fleming lists Texas as a Republican gain in the election of 1920 (p. 469); in fact it stayed in the Democratic column.  In sum, this is disappointing work from a historian whose writing (his Burr-Hamilton history Duel, for example) I have enjoyed in the past. 
 Based on the advertisement at Amazon this was the book "In Search of Excellence.  It was not the book but an interview about the book.  I was very disapointed.  I still want the book on CD but feel it futal to try ordering it again on Amazon as it is a nusance to order and return.  If you can help, I would love to purchase the actual book on CD.  Thank you.

 I got this book because the book claims to evaluate softswitch advantages as a Class 4 replacement. I work for a telecommunications company and one of our projects was to expand our long distance capability at the lowest costs possible. We evaluated the softswitches out there and determined the technology had not matured enough to replace hardware switches.  This book does explain the architecture and protocols, and for many SOHO's out there, it is a viable alternative. However, this book is deceptive in claiming that there is no reason not to immediately migrate from circuit switched Class 4 to a softswitch Class 4. After reading this book I believed that only configuration errors would stop migration, but my personal experience differs from the author.  I have experience to know that the softswitch products out there are either good for small scale migrations or as a MUX between real circuit switch hardware. Claims of Class 4 replacements are vaporware.  Because this book was the first one about softswitch does not make this a 5 star book. There is better white pages out there and sales literature that is better, and more realistic, than this book. I think the 5 star reviews are either shills or someone who has not read this book 
 For the Mob historian there's nothing really new here outside of lotsa pure fiction. If you want the real story of Sam Giancana check out "The Don" by William Brashler, "Mafia Princess" by Sam's daughter Toni, and Bill Roemer's bio of Tony Accardo. But forget the hogwash of "Double-Cross" 
 The first set that I got from Amazon had major production problems with the third CD and it couldn't be played.  Amazon replaced the set and the replacement set didn't have problems -- they could all play.  My complaint is not with Amazon.  On a more serious basis, the audio cds refer to things that are not in place.  They refer to a hard-copy list of high glycemic fruits and vegetables that was supposed to be included.  This hard-copy list was not included with either set that I received (in case they just screwed up on one).  Even more interesting, in the audio it refers to the fact that additional information is supposed to be available through the Atkins web site, lists an address (http://www.atkins.com/agr) -- and that's not a valid page.  You get the dreaded error message 404 page.  I sent email to the Atkins' site and got no response.  This could be solved by adding the page mentioned in the cds -- and adding the information that's supposed to be included on a card.  Right now, some of the key information that you need to make this diet work is not available.  You would still need to go buy the book to get that information.    I am a fan of the Atkins diet and had hoped that this cd set would be helpful for a friend with diabetes.  It is not.    I would not recommend this cd set.  If you care about the information, then buy the book.    It is my understanding that this cd was produced by a different company than the people who produced their other CD set.  I'm sorry they didn't do a better quality control.  
 Harv keeps saying how great the book is going to be, and I was stupid enough to keep reading all the way to the end....and found out there was nothing.  Just a worthless rant 
 This book is old news and is filled with predictions for 2005 & 2006 - most of which are inacurate.  His boom and subsequent bust theories are not materializing - and at this point even if they do will be of much smaller scale than his grand predictions (DOW over 40,000) presented in this book 
 After downloading the CheckWriter DB from Wiley's companion site for the book Access 2003 Programming Weekend Crash Course, I try and try but it will not run; it cannot find the linked files; and the "tools" for reference and linking are greyed out. So we "Crash" on page 10. How can the author claim he is teaching us Professional Techniques when his program will not run out of the box 
 If you enjoy the story of Hugh Glass and like at least a little historical accuracy, then don't read this book.  It takes the story of Glass and makes a comedy of the entire struggle.  I had to force myself to read the book and hoped that it would get better as it goes.  Not so!  The book takes a fantastic struggle of the west and makes it so fictious that it makes one cringe as you read it.  I gave my copy away rather than take someone's money for it 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 I teach an inclusion third grade with about half of my class being special education students.  They are having a hard time understanding multiplication and how it works, so I thought this book would be a great visual!  I was very, very wrong.  I should have listened to the other review on this book.  I agree that the art terminology gets confusing with the math explanations.  I feel the author could have explained the math in more detail and left out the art all together.  I will not even read this book to my class because I know that it will only further confuse them, rather then help them.  So this purchase was a waste of my hard earned money that I thought I was putting towards helping my students.  Don't make the same mistake!   
 I normally enjoy the Cussler books, especially the Dirk Pitt stories.  This one, however, is especially contrived and very confusing.  There is virtually no character development, so keeping track of the various pieces of the plot is difficult.  I felt like I was in the "fog of war", seeing hundreds of snippets and just hoping it all came together in the end.  Will the real Clive Cussler please come back?  
 Don't loose your money and time reading this old histor 
 I think Lynn Picknett sat down one night with a big bottle of wine and decided to rant her feelings, her research and strong opinions on some paper. She has some interesting ideas about who the Magdalene may have been or come from, and then never mentions it again- in fact here isn't much specifically about Magdalene at all.  And statements like "..when the Gnostics were silly they were extremely silly"- excuse me?? I resisted reading this book for a long time because friends who, like me, thought The Templar Revelation was an exellent book, didn't really like this one. Well, I gave it a shot, and it was not worth it 
 Normally I don't take the time to write a review, but this book just bugged me.  When I finished I felt like I had run a marathon.  The book was just too drawn out and I felt the descriptions were long winded.  Faith was a little too unbelieveable even though she was abused and had little self esteem.  The plot was good, but moved slowly.  I am typically not drawn to Danielle Steel books and probably with good reason that I never seem to like them very much.  I am glad that this book was in a box of 30+ books that I paid $15 for at a used book store.  I would have felt like I wasted my money had I actually paid full price for it 
 Haught succeeds in thoroughly confusing most readers not at a graduate level in theology. He randomly assembles quotes from prominent thinkers, but when all thrown together with his own beliefs and 'evidence' readers can expect to be frustrated. His arguments come off as depending more on his own beliefs than any true evidence. On and on and on he blabbers, often without any obvious purpose. Finally, 190 painful pages later he wraps up with a conclusion that essentially leaves us back where we stood upon starting chapter 2. I recommend waiting for the Hollywood movie version 
 I'm not sure what the audience for this extremely poorly written book is.  Is it graduate-level students?  If so, this book will drive them totally crazy and depressed, thanks to its confusing structure, lack of contextual motivation for the topics covered, and nonsensical, semi-rigorous mathematical treatment of the subject.  Is it "quant" practitioners?  If so, it'll leave them more confused and pessimistic about their trade than ever -- or just leave them feeling disappointed and frustrated, which was how I felt when I tried to read this book.  This book is so bad it serves as neither a textbook nor a reference.  It has no value whatsoever.  Want to know the technical details of VAR models and when to use them and when not to use them?  You won't find it here.  Ditto for GARCH models.  Ditto for ECM models.  Ditto for dynamic pricing models.  I'm pretty well-grounded in advanced math, statistics, econometrics, and financial economics, and I have to confess I had no clue what the word and sentences and math notations in this book meant.  The contents are totally incoherent.  Please do everyone a favor and don't buy this absolutely worthless book, so publishers won't be encouraged to kills trees in order to print such trash 
 This had some great moments: better understanding of animal behavior, the debate between different religions.  But the only way I could finish it was by speed reading.  It's claim to be a story that will make you believe in God was the most unbelievable part.  Where did that even enter into the book?  Pi was spiritual and loved God but there wasn't anything that made this survival story make you believe in God more that the next 
 Book is out of date with modern economic thought.  Essentially restates classical economics and provides little in the way of acceptance of the need for balance between government and the markets. 
 I bought this book because I wanted an anthology of "the best," classic articles on a variety of fields and from a variety of critical viewpoints, hoping to use it for my introductory art history course.  But  not only could one quarrel with the choices here, but the articles are  abridged almost to the point of incomprehensibility and the footnotes are  left out.  This makes the collection unrepresentative of what it purports  to be about, and useless in the classroom 
 i was given this set by a friend at work and i thank them for that. the movies on the disc are good but the transfers are the worst. poor pictures and sound make this one to pass over 
 Not a good read.  Have not read any other Kellerman but was not bothered by the absence of character development others have complained of.  I could not stand, however, his decision to focus on the detail of certain events.  One example, why dedicate so many plodding pages to a conversation with security guards at the end which contributed absolutely nothing to the resolution?  There are other instances.  Thankfully I picked this one up on the bargain table 
 This story looks at the L.A. Riots through the eyes of a child. Illustrator David Diaz used bold, thick acrylics on textured papers to illustrate the different scenes and then photographed those images for the book. The outcome is a surreal combination of the real and the imaged, reflective of the feelings one might having during a time of uncertainty. The story is short, almost too short. It attempts to show the riots from Daniel's point-of-view, but leaves out so much of the history of the riots, that they seem unfounded and decontexualized. Bunting's portrayal of this event is shallow and borders on racist. His mother's words "other" the predominantly black rioters, making them out to be thieving monsters and perpetuating negative stereotypes. This book may still find a use if only to promote discussion and get children thinking about what might have happened before the rioting began to make the people so angry. Otherwise, this book is an example of how beautiful illustrations can lead to a Caldecott seal and the book can still have an awful story 
 I must confess that I was thrilled the first time I read Conversations With Eternity. But at the same time I was puzzled because there were some things stated in the book that I had a hunch was totally wrong. So I began to check the verifiable information provided by John Chambers and discovered that not only did he present incorrect basic facts, such as dates, places and historic detail, he also neglected to present vital information that contradicts his version of the events that took place in Marine-Terrace. In addition, he has invented a state of mind of the Hugos, during their early exile, that simply have no connection with reality.   If you are an admirer of Victor Hugo, save your money for a decent biography instead.       If you are an advocate of the paranormal, choose mentors of higher quality than that of John Chambers.   
 I have read several of Hiaasen's books and loved them.  They were very funny.  This one is not.  It is an endless description of naked strippers.  I found the main character, Erin, to be very unappealing.  She is just so stupid.  Her problems are all of her own creation.  And she is not funny.  I think you have to be a man to like this book.  I, as a woman, just found it exceedingly boring.  I kept waiting for it to get funny.  It never did 
 For me, the civil war is one of the most fascinating times in US history, as well as the time right after it. I felt that Eric Foner did not do his best to make the material interesting. On the contrary, the story was rather uninteresting. I found myself having to read many paragraphs over and over, because my mind kept wandering off out of boredom. There are many other books that are much more interesting. However, if you are a graduate doing a thesis on the topic, this book is very concise and detailed. You just need to be willing to read a really dull book 
 the author juggles 2, 3 and sometimes 4 topics all at once as he tries to switch back and forth between the trinity, feminism, slavery, and even homosexuality. unfortunately all of these topics suffer because of the approach. for example, on the trinity, he confuses the very straight-forward understanding that God is three-in-one, father, son, and holy spirit. these three are co-equal members of the godhead, yet they each have separate and distinct roles or functions within the godhead, and they also have order within the trinity, that puts the God the father organizationally above God the son and God the holy spirit. but the greater confusion comes when the author tries to explain away the earthly organizational order of male headship in family and church. even though 1 timothy 2:12 says, "I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man," the author goes to great lengths to try to show that this doesn't really mean what it says for us today. the classic, historical Christian church interpretation of this verse is that it says what it means and means what it says, namely, in the church, for whatever reasons he might have God doesn't want women teaching and leading men. yet the author says that defenders of this classic, historical interpretation of the Bible teach a novelty! To believe and practice a doctrine and teaching 2000 years old, followed by all branches of christianity since the beginning of the church is a novelty! the author says that modern day defenders of the classic belief don't explain it exactly the same way as older defenders did. but that's just nit-picking. aren't readers of the bible permitted to explore different lines of thought, sharpen up old lines of thought, etc? while staying within the basic orthodox beliefs? of course, yet the author makes a big deal about defenders of the historical interpretation of 1 timothy 2:12 using different reasoning to defend the classic belief. he does this because he wants to argue his truly novel and new argument against the classic, historical interpretation is legitimate because everybody is using new arguments anyway, even the defenders of the historical interpretation. but again, there is nothing wrong with holding to the historical, classical interpretation of a verse in the Bible while using a mix of old and new arguments. just because a modern day defender of 1 timothy 2:12 doesn't employ every argument Augustine, or luther, or calvin used doesn't mean that the defender is teaching a novelty. the author is truly teaching a new and novel doctrine and practice because he is employing arguments (although bad)to come to an entirely new doctrine and practice within the church. next, the author tries to say that the slavery issue and the Bible proves that it's ok to dismiss biblical teachings. he says just as christians opposed slavery even though the bible seems to teach it's ok, so too, christians can oppose any restrictions on women teaching and leading men even though the bible seems to prohibit it. but he ignores the dissimilarities between the two subjects in the bible. 1 timothy 2:12 clearly states, "i do not permit a woman to teach or have authority over a man." there is no similar new testament clear command on slavery. slavery wasn't a cause for which God had called christians in the early church to fight; christians had higher spiritual priorities to attend to. even so, Paul is able to basically says, "but if a slave can win his freedom, let him." because of the dissimilarities of these two subjects, slavery is not a good model to follow in the current debate about women teaching and leading men in the church. finally, even though the author tries to defend his views against a slide into defending homosexuality, he fails. if we follow his methodology in disregarding clear biblical instructions, there is no logical way to stop someone from applying the same principles to defend homosexuality. once clear biblical instructions can be dismissed for a higher princple of justice, then other clear biblical commands can be dismissed in the same way and there is no way to stop it. the only answer is to stick with the plain interpretation of biblical teachings. for all of the wordiness of this author, he fails to prove that the classic, historical interpretation of 1 timothy 2:12 is wrong, or that is shouldn't still be applied today in the church. 
 While this book is not an utter garbage, there's nothing remarkable about it either, at least in my opinion. There's a certain wit and charm to "Fat Girls...", but that in itself doesn't save it from being mediocre. Even though miss Peck says that she's not a professional writer, by any means, it still feels as if though you need be a part of her family in order to enjoy this book. There's no humor in here, despite whatever reviews are saying - its just a number of observations on life, good ones at that, but I was looking for something else.  Bonus points for an excellent books cover. 
 If you are a novice EE student, never buy this book. This is not an introduction in the sense we usually think. In a word, terrible 
 I found that tying in human traits to different styles of architecture was not interesting at all. There is no discussion of building techniques or the practical side of architecture.  This would be more for the artist that is trying to project different human feelings into the structure.  If you are looking for a techincal guide to architecture this is not it 
 I purchased the Crocs Butter thinking it would be something special just for Crocs shoes.  As soon as I opened the package, I noticed the Crocs Butter is just like any other shoe buffer/cleaner with the black sponge.  I already own two shoe buffers, one of which I received free with purchase from a local shoe store.  Needless to say, I returned the Crocs Butter, since it's not worth $4.95, plus $10 shipping, which I was not refunded.  What a crock 
 While many of those who have read this book have come down upon it rather harshly, it was a valuable book. Allen Forte was really one of the pioneers in atonal theory insofar as attempting to conceptualize the mathematics behind it. While this book has many obvious flaws, we must realize that it was published thirty years ago. At the time it was written it probably made sense to the author, anyway to analyze in such a fashion. So where does that leave us on the issue of purchasing this book? As a historical study of why everybody has been groomed to use this method, this book is invaluable. How else can we understand what many believe to be the truth? If one wants to truly understand the concept of atonal music, however, this book is not a good choice. This book should be viewed in much the same light as the sun orbiting the earth. Sound, logical thought, that when inspected more closely was found to be completely off base. We needed this book to show us what not to do. Let's thank its author for opening up the subject in the first place 
 This book is undoubtedly very good value for a birding handbook (certainly by European standards). But the physical packaging is a total disaster. It has a ridiculously rigid spine and tiny page margins. It is difficult to read text near the spine, and virtually impossible to keep the book open on a particular page. The most unuseable book I've ever experienced 
 It seems to me that the diet recommendations are more healthful than un, but by page 45 there were so many gross errors (or deceit... but I'll give the guy the benefit of the doubt and assume that he wasn't paying attention in class, didn't employ a fact checker and had an editor who didn't bother reading the whole thing) that I had to put the book down.  Seriously, these are things that are so overwhelmingly WRONG there was no reason to read further. The two points that just rankle me beyond belief are:  1. Rubin's assertion on page 40 that our ancestors of four generations ago lived lifestyles which "...tended to keep them strong and healthy well into their 80s and beyond."  No. No person reading this could find it true. I looked up average life expectancy for the U.S.  1860 - 40 (the world average was 30) 1900 - 49. 7 1920 - 54  The current U.S. life expectancy is 78.  Is this deliberate misrepresentation or did he not bother to educate himself about his subject matter?  BTW - the longest lived peoples are Japanese/Okinawans (81.25 years). These are peoples who eat a diet made up primarily of foods Rubin forbids (in the name of God).  2. On page 45, 2nd paragraph, Rubin claims that vitamins A and D are "nutrients found only in animal fats."  I'm floored.  The best way to get vitamin D is via sunlight. Not animal fats.  One of the best-utilized forms of vitamin A is beta carotene. It's what makes carrots (and yams, sweet potatoes, pumpkins, etc.) orange.  This is the kind of information you learn in the first day of a uber-basic Nutrition class.   Oh - and 1b. on page 36 is pretty wild. His list of animals which "chew the cud" is way off.  So I haven't read past page 46 becase he already proved to me that I can not trust any claims he makes. I wanted to like this book. But I'm forced to suspect he's yet another charlatan cashing in on the longings of the masses. He must have assumed that his claims of God's intervention and inspiration would force his readers to abandon skepticism.  I find this especially offensive because many of the dietary changes I've seen inspired by it are VERY good. The emphasis on organics and unrefined grains and sweeteners is wonderful. I hate it when good ideas and messages get ruined by dishonesty, incompetence or ignorance (or a combination of any of those).  Many corrupt idealogues base careers on the assumption that the reader will suspend disbelief in deference to their godly credentials. The sad thing is that it usually works.  So, in case this isn't obvious - I don't recommend this book. 
 I sincerely wish that amazon.com allowed 0 stars.  There were too many "eyerolling" moments in this book, not to mention that the copy editor must have been on vacation.  The plot, which involves a voluptuous woman and ex-rock-and-roll star who get married because of the terms of a will and then begin to fall in love, would have been far more believable if the author would have spent time in story development to make us care about the characters.  This does not happen.  Consequently, the characters come off as simply unbelievable and cliche-ish.  Save your money and pass on this book 
 Not what I expected.  It wasn't as 'manly' as I had hoped 
 Most Hollywood products are designed to indoctrinate the audience in one way or another. The main propaganda punch line for this move is this: People who work for government agencies are intelligent, kind, ethical, emotionally mature, trustworthy and have your best interests at heart. The US is a beacon of light, goodness, equality and justice. 
 Powell's analysis takes place in an economic vacuum, where all Americans had to do was wait out the four years of economic collapse, and the roaring twenties would have reappeared. The simple truth is that Roosevelt and the New Deal saved capitalism (that out to set off some of you, I'm sure). By 1933, capitalism had fallen into disrepute; only by regulating its excesses, and providing a safety net for its victims, is a part of it in existence today 
 This book is not as gripping as the usual Wilbur Smith novel.  It is the story of a dysfunctional branch of the Courteney family living in South Africa around 1900.  Somehow the blood and guts of civil war isn't as interesting as other Smith narratives.  Other books have lots of fascinating and well-researched context material that make them interesting and separate them from other "pot boilers."  But "The Sound of Thunder" is mainly just about people hating and harming each other in irrational ways.  The characters are all improbable, the coincidences that bring them together stretch credibility beyond the breaking point, and the action is often senseless and leads nowhere.  One interesting dimension of Smith -- exploring the essence of Africa -- is trivialized in this book. In summary, it's not Wilbur Smiths best book by a long shot.   
 I was expecting a lot more anecdotes about the NBA and its players.  An inordinate amount of this book is taken up with discussing Red's post-retirement weekly roundtable lunch and the various participants.  Hearing about a bunch of middle aged and old guys sitting around eating chow mein and idolizing Red is not very entertaining.    I have no doubt that all of Red's adventures in the NBA would make a fantastic book.  Unfortunately, this is not that book. 
 James Spader was supposed to be in the last season of DINER. That would be my only reason for buying it. He is certainly not in this one! So where is he????!!! Are there no Diner videos or DVDs with James Spader? 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  There were some good reviews but I found that the story could not deliver.  It started off good, a good murder mystery, I was excited to see what would unfold...  I kept waiting for the book to get exciting or suspenseful or to get attached to one of the characters but it never happened.  The whole book was, to me, a lot of filler and the end was anticlimactic 
 Do not purchase this ebook!  You can't print it.  AND it uses some sort .NET internet validation that stopped working on the laptop I downloaded it on.  So, I CAN'T print it and I CAN'T read it.  For GOD'S SAKE SOMEBODY TELL ME  - WHAT GOOD IS THIS LOAD OF E-BOOK!  Unreal.  Absolutely unreal 
 I so wanted to enjoy this illustrated guide into the world of Conan yet, even after reading it, I still have my reservations. The artwork and imagery alone is a blast! I've always loved the grand mythos of Howards characters as seen or dreamed through the eyes of top-noch artist. But it's the so called chronological events of Conans life-long saga that leaves me with a rather bitter taste in my mouth. Much like the "Star Wars" expanded universe, I find it hard to validate these additional stories of Conans travels. I have nothing against the musing of Conans high adventures by other various story tellers. I've read many Conan books in my time that were not written by howard but I have always seen them as "Separate Works" of fiction.   Anyone could write a story about what happens to Odysseus after he returns home to Ithica to reclaim his throne but no one would ever dare to officialize it as part of the original Homeric myth. You don't see anybody writing additional stories to JRR Tolkiens "Lord of the Rings" trilogy or Stephen Kings "The Dark Tower" sereies either. If Marvel decided to continue the exploits of these characters through the medium of comics, I don't think anyone would complain. Certainly not me. Yet the events of these comics would never be added to any kind of visual companion guide of the original stories. I don't see how Robert E. Howards work should be excluded from this norm. A book of artwork involving Conan is a great idea but three quarters of the chronology that can be read from "Conan: The Ultimate Guide to the World's Most Savage Barbarian" just doesn't hold weight for me. So I'am definitely torn here 
 Maybe it redeemed itself eventually but this was one of the few books that I quit reading 3/4 of the way through. For whatever reason, the historical counterpoint was more distracting than engaging.  I was also puzzled by the lengthy focus on the gender issues surrounding the volunteer light house keepers and wonder what compelled the author to make such an issue of every movement and vocal inflection.  To each their own but it is not something I would recommend 
 Saw these canisters and fell in love with them. Couldn't wait to get them and when I did they were broken into a million pieces.  They replaced them very timely but one lid is almost too small and the seal doesn't fit properly.  Another lid fits so tight it takes two hands to get the lid off.  I was disppointed in the quality.  I wouldn't buy these again even if I had to buy something more expensive 
 Back twenty or more years ago Lacy J. Dalton sang 16th Avenue, a superb country song about unknowns seeking their musical fortune in Nashville.  One verse had this lyric:   Ah, but then one night in some empty room Where no curtains ever hung  Like a miracle some golden words  Rolled off of someone's tongue  Well, that's Train.  They had the miracle of Drops of Jupiter and who knows where it came from, but come it did, like a slap to the face and always remained fabulous with every overplayed-on-the-radio hearing. (Though I could do without all the "na-na-na-na-na" background over the last minute or so.)  And beyond that, there is not a single thing on this CD worth hearing, relentless mediocrity, as if one were trapped on the state fair circuit, hearing big-haired bands from the 80's eternally playing their semi-hits while roller coaster and dodge 'em cars add to the aural clutter.  Two stars for one miracle of brilliance. 
 IF YOU LOVE GOOD MUSIC YOU WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH THESE GREAT ENTERTAINERS!  WONDERFUL SINGERS AND VERY TALENTED MUSICIANS.  IF YOU ARE A FAN OF CELTIC WOMAN OR OF THE BEST IN CELTIC MUSIC THIS DVD AN CD ARE A MUST TO OWN!!  
 I did not feel this book provided anything that the new real life entry level investor needs.I thought this would be informative information that would have real value, but instead got a collection of stories. It was like a collection of stories to help the investors that have already made it, but not the real stories to prevent the everyday small investor from making the entry level mistakes 
 **1/2  If "North Country" didn't say that it was set in 1989, you'd never believe it based on the attitudes and behavior of its male characters, which can only be classified as "Neanderthal" (though that might be an insult to Neanderthals).  And, indeed, you would be right NOT to believe it, for the events on which the film is based actually began in 1975, a full decade and a half before the time of the movie.   The drama seems to have been moved forward in time to accommodate footage of the Clarence Thomas Senate hearings of 1991 - images that play continually in the background as some sort of running commentary on the foreground action of the movie.  It's a sleight-of-hand maneuver that doesn't do much to enhance the verisimilitude of the movie.  With Charlize Theron once again ugly-ing herself up for great drama, "North Country" tells the true but highly fictionalized story of Lois Jensen (here referred to as Josie Aimes), a battered welfare mother with two children who takes a job in a northern Minnesota steel mine, only to find it to be a veritable hell hole of unbridled misogyny and sexual harassment.  Here are guys who are so chauvinistic in their view and treatment of women that they make Henry Higgins look like Alan Alda in comparison.  When she attempts to take a stand against the outrages perpetrated against her and the other women there, Aimes finds little support from either the bigwigs at the plant, the unenlightened townsfolk, or even her own female co-workers who have been terrorized into silence in order to keep their jobs.  Eventually, she manages to file a class action lawsuit against the mine (in 1988, actually, a full three years before the Clarence Thomas/Anita Hill spectacle), resulting in a landmark decision for sexual harassment laws around the country.  There is no doubt that the issue of gender equity in the workplace is a serious and important one, but "North Country" feels strangely out-of-date and lacking in vitality in an age in which sexual harassment laws have become common place in the business world (yes, I realize that this film is showing us how such laws eventually came to be, but that still doesn`t make it a fresh topic for a contemporary movie).  Moreover, "North Country" can't quite shake that air of stultifying self-importance that too often infuses dramas dealing with serious social issues.  As a result, the film is often plodding in its pacing and obvious in its theme, with the characters falling a bit too neatly into hero, villain and victim molds with very little shading in between.   Despite its good intentions and its being based on a true story, the film is riddled with push button feel-good moments and implausible instant conversions - and damned if the whole thing doesn't have the look and feel of a Lifetime original movie, just with higher priced stars in its cast (Frances McDormand, Woody Harrelson, Sissy Spacek, and Richard Jenkins, the dead father from "Six Feet Under").  And while the acting is decent, the suffocating nature of the drama inhibits most of the performers from breaking out and really having a go at their characters.  Perhaps it's just that after movies like  "Norma Rae," "Silkwood," and "Erin Brockovich," which could really make one care about the people and the issues they raised, "North Country" comes up a day late and a dollar short in the I-am-woman-hear-me-roar department.   
 The Design of this knife is HORRIBLE!  Not all people are as careful as they want to and we know what we will get (painful cut!). This brand is not taking people's security into consideration. The corner close to the handle is general really sharp and some items even have a curve that is making it worse.  I am really unsatisfied that the sharpness of this brand's collection is good enough while you may get a few stitches on your skin easily 
 I am amazed that all these so-called health foods will add artery-clogging "palm kernel oil" as an ingredient.  Don't buy anything with palm kernel oil, cocoa butter, and anything hydrogenated!!  No matter how many "organic" things are added to it.  For many years now, it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease.  The World Health Organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases. 
 I liked Time magazine a lot until they named George Bush person of the year? Oh my god, where were all the educated editors/writers when they let this moron write this article 
 ...at least it wasn't what I was expecting.  The title, "The Big Book of Self-Reliant Living" lead me to believe that it was a handbook for living off the land.  However, when it arrived I was dismayed to find that the "health" section did not contain home remedies or herbal medicine, but 40 pages (40 pages!!) of lists of the nutritional value of foods.  Who has time to count calories on a farm?  Furthermore, the "health" section had oodles of detailed information on diagnosing a wide variety of cancers and chronic diseases.  I found this to be frustratingly unhelpful information.  The bizarre material can be perfectly illustrated by the bee-keeping page.  It instructs the reader to buy factory made hives, and to have a bee-keeper bring you bees.  Self-reliant my foot.  So, in summary: if you are a hypochondriac who lives in a city and you want a book with tips on environment-friendly heating methods, instructions for removing stains from clothing, money saving ideas for the grocery store or a chart of toy dog breeds, then please contact me because I have the book for you!  
 If you've never used a blackberry at all get this book, but if you actually read any of the instructions that come with it this book is redundant.  I did not learn anything new that I hadn't already read or figured out 
 I was extremely DISAPPOINTED with this toy. The directions basically say "pull, twist and let go" how hard is that??? Apparently very... I thought the toy was broken. The company sent me another one and it still did not work!!!! My dog doesn't even pay attention to it. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this item. I would recommend something else.. 
 Sorry for the sarcasm, but I can't help thinking just how uninspired this book is.  Imagine a counter to this book.  This book would promote "hate", "dishonesty", "immorality", "ignorance, "ingratitude".... you get the picture.  This Mormon leader's great contribution to world is to say we should be honest?  Now that was profound!  Sadly, Gordo and his wrinkled cadre have this bad habit of taking the basic decency of the members of the church and attributing it to the implausible myths they peddle to the world.   As an avowed atheist, I encourage everyone to be honest, moral, learned, and all the things Gordo promotes in this book.  There is nothing wrong with promoting these and they have nothing to do with Mormonism.  But this book is written for children and sheep.  Promoting this book among the various books that seriously discuss morality, ethics and other serious issues is like watching a high school team play the New England Patriots or comparing a Janice Kapp Perry vapid song to Bach's Mass in B minor.    Mormonism is declining in real terms because their leadership does not have the capacity to address and provide any illumination to the relevant issues of the 21st century.  This book should confine itself to the children's section or to the local Deseret Book store.

 Reading the reviews for this book I thought it would be a more substantial book than what I found.  It is a cute idea, but it is lacking in content.  Very disappointed...will probably end up as a garage sale book 
 After reading all the rave reviews, we put Pupsqueak on our Baby's registry, but were very disappointed when we received one as a gift and he didn't work. We tried exchanging him for another one at Babies R Us, but we couldn't find one that worked. So instead we exchanged him for the Dinosaur (I forget his name). Our daughter loves him. Since he's soft we are not afriad with placing him in her car seat with her. She loves falling asleep holding onto Mr. Dyno 
 This movie was obviously made by Japanese fans of several American films.  It then tried to mix them all together in one film.   The main ones are the Matrix, Reservoir Dogs, and Night of the Living Dead.  Especially the Matrix.  We have several yakuza meeting at a specified location where they usually bury their victims, the location turns out to be a forest of reincarnation so their victims are coming back to life.  Then it is a dead-come-back-to-life genre gore film heavy with feuding Yakuza elements.  Our main character has the long black Matrix type coat and general emotionless demeanor.   The high-tech 360 camera movements of the Matrix are blatantly being imitated minus the high-tech aspect.  Instead it is obvious that the camera itself is being moved 360 around the action.  I really hated the Matrix so a film mainly paying tribute to the Matrix already has a big strike against it.  As for the other elements, they were all brought in awkwardly and it just seemed to constantly extend the story with another element of their favorite American movies that they wanted to include.  The gore was mostly uncreative and uninteresting.  Note that if you are looking for something different than typical American movies by checking out those wacky Japanese movies, you will not get it here 
 At first I didn't realize that you have to use Amazon's software to load onto the Zen.  Once I figured that out (actually my husband figured that out) the show played perfectly and it was very easy to do.  I wasn't able to edit the stars.  If I could I would give this 5 stars.  If you have tried some other sites for the Zen, they are much more difficult to use. Amazon's Unbox is great for the Zen 
 We only bought this CD for this very special song.  No Christmas is complete without this song 
 If a story doesn't hook by the middle of Chapter 3, there are other books to open, books that kick in by PAGE 3, thank heaven. I bought TIME BOMB because the reviews on the jacket made it look fast and thrilling. I could not even finish chapter 3. I'd read something once by Jonathan Kellerman that made me remember him as a reliable author of great escapist fiction. I can't remember what it was.  *sigh* I don't see where these rave reviews are coming from. The book is so boring.  Also, the racist meanies I saw lurching up over the horizon, as well as being hackneyed and ho-hum, were unrealistic. Even the meanest harshest republican white adult male doesn't picket a school in a high income neighborhood shouting "wetback" and "greaser". Not even in wacky California, I shouldn't think. 
 I was completely dismayed with the overall appearance of these dishes - the "fleur-de-lis" looked like a bug, and the patina was very blotchy and uneven....my husband said it looked like someone had wiped something brown and nasty on them.  Very disappointing, and expensive to ship back!  Don't use the photo as a guideline - it looks nothing like the actual product 
 I think there are two major problems with this tape. First, in no way it is suitable for beginners. Instructor cues  for breathing are inconsistent, about 50% of the time there is no cueing at all. Her cues for poses are very poor, she mostly mentions if the pose is hard to do or not. You cannot follow her without looking at your TV screen, and if you do not know which muscles to flex or stretch, 50% of the time she is not going to tell you. The program does contain two levels, for more and less flexible. Yet, transition from one pose to another is so quick that you can barely get your balance. Try Jane Fonda Yoga instead, or (and) Kundahlini yoga 
 My estimation of humanity went down a notch when I read the reviews of this book.   The book is clumsily written, and uses cheap sentimental tricks to try to get us to swallow the shallow and ultimately dumb chunks of sophmoric philosophy.  That people can be charmed or even moved by this kind of bunk makes me sad, and also makes me realize how vulnerable people are, and how many would rather go for comforting and easy answers than actually think and confront the realities of the world.   And  no, I do not believe there was any such child. 
 Unix in a Nutshell is not for the faint-hearted.  It tries to be a concise reference on Unix but ends up being incomplete (esp. with regard to Linux).  A lot of commands are explained cursorily without complete options or examples.  The presentation is often confusing; witness the chapters on shell programming.  If you know nothing about Unix, don't even consider this book; it'll get you nowhere and more frustrate than ever.  If you already know Unix you can find better and more accurate Unix references elsewhere 
 Read this review prior to reading this book (or series, hopefully).  This series ends probably as badly as any series possibly could.  If it wasn't for the fact that parts of the book were OK, I'd give it 1 star, because the ending was so stupid that, if I could, I'd give it a negative five stars.  While I don't recommend you read this, I won't give away the specifics of the ending, as that would be wrong of me.  However, everything that was frustrating about the first two books (i.e. silly caste structure, total reliance on patronage, accent descrimination) wins in the end, irregardless of the world changing honors that the two heroes achieve.    I truly don't understand the point of the author even writing this series, if he's simply going to allow the status quo to remain intact.  One of the reasons people read books like this, is to see a civilization that has turned geologic, and then gets into a war of survival, have the ability to change.  But no, the author strives to make sure that all of the stupidity that we wished to see overturned is put right back in place after the war is over.    Now, don't get me wrong, I don't mind the love triangle ending.  But the political ending really makes me regret ever picking up the first book, as I now realize that reading this series has been an absolute waste of my time 
 Got to the 11th chapter before giving up on this Confederacy apologist film.  Sorry, but don't see slaveholders in a good light.  As a Black female, I will always root for the "Federals".  It took another 100 plus years for freedom for Blacks in the South after the end of the Civil War, so I don't really see the need for movies that show the "humanity" of Southerners who fought tooth and nail for breaking up this nation so they could continue slavery.  Anyway, this is not a movie for progressive minded folks.  I'm sure there are movies such as Glory, which are not on the wrong side of history.  Nuff said 
 Who published these weak translations?  Yup, they are on newsprint and get smudged immediately.  How about using real paper?  B&N needs to stop thinking opportunistically and start thinking about quality 
 DO NOT rely on this book to pass the exam. It lightly touches most of the important subjects, but goes nowhere near deep enough to be useful. I agree is it better written that the BCSI book, but it needs to be much more thourough in its handling of the subject matter. Very poor considering its Cisco 
 We've always used Mr Coffee coffeemakers. A friend raved about this Bunn model...really fast coffee with great taste... so much so she sent one to us as a birthday gift.  Well, its great if you dont care about auto shut-off (I DO!) and if you dont care about spilling the coffee when you sneak a cup before the entire brew cycle is finished, the good ol' pause and serve feature (I DO..) and if you could care less about programming your next pot (I DO). Granted, it does brew quickly. But it just doesnt have the features that I want and use, therefore it rates a 1 out of 5 
 While the explanation of the social order of the "Soiled Doves" was interesting, I found the constant judgemental harping on how they ALL ended up badly a bit hard to take. Anyone who has read first hand accounts of pioneer women in the 1800's knows that NONE of them had it easy. Lawfully wedded wives were subjected to loneliness, abuse, death in childbirth and the same diseases that afflicted the prostitutes of the day. And drug addiction was extremely common among 'respectable' women as well as the soiled doves through opiates legally available at any drugstore as well as alcohol. The 'decent' women's business was merely cloaked from public review in the local paper and not as easy to document 
 Straight up: Dip Set is garbage. This album is no exception, although in comparison to all the albums that they released, this is one of the better ones. Trufully, Cam'ron has very limited lyrical skills, and it displays throughout this album. Although during this time this album was released, he was just signed to Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella Records (you saw how long that lasted). Also around this time, some of the Dip Set artists (Jim Jones and Juelz Santana) were starting to surface. They themselves also weigh this album down. I did like the first single "Oh Boy". Also the second single "Hey Ma" was good also. The album's hugh highlight would be "Welcome To New York" featuring Jay-Z, that was well thought out.  The album also has many low points. A lot of these songs like "Loosing Weight 2" shows how very limited Cam'ron's skills are behind the mic. Memphis Bleek and Beanie Sigel do absolutely nothing for the song "The Roc". Production is good, like the Daz produced "Leave Me Alone", but Cam couldn't pull it together. Just Blaze and Kanye West would also toss in a few beats on this album also.  "Come Home With Me" is average at best. It has a few good songs and a lot of skip material. If you're used to hearing Cam on albums, then you might want to check this out for a few good tracks, or download it to hear how it sounds like. This isn't one I could fully get into.   Lyrics: C Production: B+ Guest Appearances: C- Musical Vibes: C Overall: C  Favorite Tracks: Oh Boy, Welcome To New York City, Hey Ma,   Peace Everyone 
 I had to read this book for a book group.  I found it unreadable.  It seemed like it was written by someone in high school who would be better destined to be butcher.  I picked it up several times and truly wanted to finish because of my book group, but I could not go further than page 75 before totally giving up on the book.  Although the five other members of my group did finish reading the book and said that they enjoyed it, we spent time in the group pointing out some of the particulary badly written passages 
 Although an interesting read, it would be so because it is filled with false information. Davi Kopenawa Yanomami claims not only did Chagnon misrepresent the Yanomamo, but also offered them gifts to fight among themselves so he could take pictures and record the sounds of the fight. In a 2001 interview with Janet Chernela he says the following: "To repeat, Chagnon is not a good friend of our relatives. He lived there, but he acted against other relatives. He had a lot of pans. I remember the pans....When he arrived at the village, and called everyone together, he said 'Whoever is the most courageous will earn more pans. If youkill ten more people I will pay more. If you kill only two, I will pay less.'... This isn't good. This kills. Children cried; fathers, mothers, cried. Only Chagnon was happy. Because in his book, he says we are fierce. We are garbage. The book says this; I saw it. I have the book. He earned a name there, WATUPARI. It means king vulture- that eats decaying meat. ... He ordered the Yanomami to fight. He never spoke about what he was doing. The purpose of an ethnography is to document, not to fill in gaps to make something more interesting to read. 
 I wouldn't recommend this movie, unless you have nothing else to do for the night and want to watch it alone. Due to a high content of bad words, screaming and violence, it's kind of embarrassing watching it with someone else. Some people really enjoyed it, and that's not me, and that's not the other two people I know who watched it. Some violent parts are a bit hard to believe, but I guess that's what the story is about. This movie is a bit of a hollywood-style suspense, with rather cheesy college scenes that are common to comedies.   There's one good idea in this movie and that's how life develops as it goes along, and one action or inaction changes how life plays out. But this is no where near original, even the Simpsons had an episode like that.   So, this movie is definitely not on my best movies list. 
 I ditto the previous reviewer...i thought these seats were adjustable, was I wrong, there is only 1 position and that is practically laying down..  suck 
 This album is just sad.Sugar ray have always been a guilty pleasure of mine and i'v had no problem admitting I liked them...until now.This album is a big joke piriod.It lacks the maturity of the self titeld and the catchy pop rock of 14:59.Sugar ray tryed to sell out and make bubbelgum pop with this release and faid misurably 
 I was expecting a lot from this book, and I certainly walked away feeling disappointed.  Jayna Davis comes off as something of a literal Michael Moore for the right here.  I say that because much like Moore used his film to ambiguously blame the 9/11 attacks on Saudi Arabia, Ms. Davis seems to be insinuating that Saddam Hussein was responsible for this attack.    First, yes, there is much more to this story than has been told to us.  John Doe number 2 is a legit question and the evidence does seem to indicate that he may have been a former Iraqi who was brought over to America by the first President Bush (along with many others).  But that does not mean that he, or anyone involved in the bombing, was funded or linked to Saddam (or Al Qaeda).    A things to take into consideration: I've read a few of the previous reviews that seem to indicate that because there are endorsements from former CIA director R. James Woolsey and Reagan DOD official Frank Gaffney, this makes the book completely legit.  Not quite.  Woolsey and Gaffney have become two of the loudest underground neoconservative voices of the last few years.  Woolsey also endorsed "A Study of Revenge" which pins the first WTC bombing on Hussein.  Clearly, he's more interested in justifying the war started by his peers than helping the American people find the truth.   Further, since these are two people who have the ears of the White House (especially the VP), why wouldn't this have been used to justify the second Gulf War if the evidence is so strong linking Saddam to this attack??  It certainly would have helped make the case, and given the American people a solid reason for taking the man out.  Considering that this adminstration has no problem playing fast and loose with the facts, I would imagine they would have run with this premise, even if they have minor doubts.    Personally, I don't believe Saddam had the ability to pull something like this off.  Throughout the 90's he was heavily contained and monitored.  I can't see him pulling off an attack like this (or the first WTC).    Still, this book raises some important questions that remain unanswered to this day.  And those questions should continue to be asked, just as many questions about 9/11 persist.  But raving endorsements from Glenn Beck, Woolsey and Gaffney actually hurt the credibility of this book rather than help it. 
 This book is just plain stupid. If it works for people and helps them lose weight I realize they will be estatic. However, it is not healthy. Each of our meals should be balanced. These people are promoting unbalanced eating. The reason so many of us are carb sensitive is because we have spent a lifetime over indulging on carbs! If one were to sit down and eat each meal with balanced food groups, including complex carbs in small amounts, we would not only lose weight in a safe manner, but we would heal our bodies from the inside out. This diet won't heal us, it is a fad. If anyone is looking to really heal their metabolism, lose weight and even heal disease, try reading "The Schwarzbein Principle" by Diana Schwarzbein, MD. That is a great book on how to heal diabetes, hypoglycemia, and many other things. It also explains how eating balanced and giving up stimulants will not only help us lose weight, but reverse aging and stop having food cravings in the first place. This book promotes eating unhealthy foods and is only about weight loss, not getting healthy. 
 Bowie hits his first slump on this album. 'Blue Jean' , along with a couple of other tracks are good pop songs, but it's just padded out with too much filler. Even its high points don't match Let's Dance's, but on the plus side (or should that be down side?), this album is at least a bit longer. You have to accept that Bowie is no longer the avant garde enigma he once was, and just try to enjoy what's left. Which isn't much. 'Tumble and Twirl' is given a brisk, funky backing, and it's good fun, too.   Yet half the album is made up of, at times embarrassing, filler. I especially don't want to hear Bowie singing about 'Old Rudy' in a cod-Jamaican accent ('Don't Look Down'), and the inclusion of a Beach Boys cover is the sound of a man without ideas, trying to get by as a crooner. I'd pick this up on Marketplace if you see it for a couple of quid. 
 I too was mesmerized by this documentary, as an educator and student of child psychology, etc. THen I heard the running commentary, especially the remarks of the cameraman, and realized what a vile example of grotesque cultural imperialism this is: using despised children for selfish purposes=prostitution.  THe cameraman calls one of the children a whiny b#tch (his words) and has a rather obviously ambiguous relation with another of the girls. The inclusion of these comments and some of the stills casts a telling pall over the entire enterprise. Often under the guise of doing good we exact greatest harm, as Mr. Oscar Wilde noted.  This despicable film takes kids, uses them and disposes of them with the sneering arrogant attitude so overtly and unselfconciously expressed in the commentary by the cameraman, divides families and friendships, exposes children to realizing painfully and traumatically their condition, like Liza Dolittle, without hope of going either back or forward. The pain on their faces as they observe the film is especially telling 
 I guess I was looking for a scrabble dictionary which would list say words that have an X in them--not just the ones that start with x. My own dictionary is just as good as this one is.  When you are trying to fit a hard to place letter, it's nice to have clues on words with that letter--at the beginning, in the middle and at the end. This is basically just a dictionary 
 Sean "Puffy" Combs, Puffy Daddy, Sean John, P Diddy or Diddy.  When he figures out what he wants to be called is when I figure out if I like him.  Meanwhile, there still isn't one good DVD set for Star Wars. 
 AS I FIRST BEGAN READING THIS BOOK I WAS GREATLY IMPRESSED BY THE AUTHORS PASSION, CLARITY, AND HIS THOROUGH AND ENLIGHTENING APPROACH. THEN ALL OF SUDDEN HE BEGAN PRAISING VATICAN 2 AND "HOW BRILLIANT IT WAS". WHERE EVERY OTHER PARAGRAPH REVERTED TO VATICAN 2 DOCUMENTS. I TOTALLY LOST INTEREST, I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER FINISH IT... PERHAPS BECAUSE VATICAN 2 DISGUSTS ME, I DON'T KNOW.. 
 This book's description sparked my interest and led me to think that it would fill a gap in Eliot scholarship. Unfortunately, this is not the case. The book does not quite achieve what it sets out to do 
 The first cut, Long-legged Guitar Pickin' Man is a fine start, but it's downhill from there, especially with such ill-advised covers as It Ain't Me Babe and What'd I Say 
 Issue solved!  I returned the Harmony for a full refund.  All thanks to my experience with your wonderful support team.  After screwing up everything on Christmas day (it was a Christmas present)), your support staff said "level 2" would contact me within 24 hours.  After waiting 72 hours, I called "support" again yesterday.  After waiting 30 minutes, I finally got to speak with a real-live agent who "could not switch me to level 2 without a supervisor's approval."  This was after providing the incident number.  That took another 15 minutes.  I then waited another 30 minutes (total now 1:15) before I had to leave.  I tried again several hours later.  After being told "level 2 was not available."  I hung up and immediately returned my Harmony to ....  Thanks, Logitech.   -Keit 
 Like many of the readers, I agree that Ms. Evanovich seems to have run out of ideas.  The series could be written by a twelve year old.  Just give them a checklist- blow up car, eat donuts, feed Rex a donut/grape/piece of pizza, eat donuts, vascilate between Ranger and Joe, eat six tastykakes.  You get the idea.  Ms. Evanovich did expand the plot a little with this book, though.  She added in Ranger's shower gel to the list.  It was only mentioned every other paragraph.  Might I add that I have never smelled a shower gel that lingers quite like his supposedly does.  Seriously, the books went downhill after the sixth installment.  If Ms. Evanovich cannot expand the plots and allow more character growth rather than rehashing the same events over and over, perhaps she should consider ending the series.  
 Have not read the book or seen the play. However, in reviewing the item in light of the fact that the local High School is putting on the play, I am struck by a common theme many of the other reviewers have touched upon. That being some common thread between witch trials and Joe McCarthy. McCarthy was many things, many of them bad. However, the substance of his claims were far more right than wrong. America, including many high offices in the government, of the 1940's and into the early 1950's was substantially infiltrated by Communists. That fact is provable by records opened to the public after the fall of the USSR 
 As I said, a huge disappointment.  I really enjoyed the Duets CDs from Sinatra, and, being a Tony Bennett fan, I had high expectations for this cd.  Don't bother with it - it is a real loser in my opinion.  Dull, boring, just plain bad.   Sorry Tony - but this one is a stinker 
 Amazingly lazy effort.  Some of the data, like basic security concepts, are universal (the definition of a "threat" is the same, regardless of OS) but after that this book is... well, saying it's a "retread" is being nice.  The screenshots in this book even still refer to Windows 2000.  Chapter 3 has a very nice "System Properties" screenshot that says "Windows 2000, Service Pack 3".  Going by that, it's not even completely up to date on Windows 2000.  If you're looking for basic security concepts, this book should be alright... but there are better options (like anything Security+ related).  Unfortunately, this was my first Sybex book... and will probably be my last. 
 Andrew Sinclair's tedious and pompous book about the supposed discovery of America by his ancestors, the Sinclairs of the Orkney Islands, and his supposed discovery of the Holy Grail. is the closest thing to saying he has found the Lockness monster. This pseudo-scientific bunch of baloney never should have been published. God only knows why it was. If this is all Sinclair can produce these days, he should pack it in and take up checkers.  Chess would be too challenging 
 This book is very ineresting, accurate accounts of the battles fought during this period, This book brought back memories of the winter that we had to endure plus the Germans. I was there for most of the time and attest to the worst winter of the century. 
 Once "Let's Get Free" came out, it lauched a revolutionary group that was powerful in their lyrics and made you feel their whole message.  After damn near burning another whole in this disk, I picked up their mixtape.  It was alright but I was waiting for that 2nd full length album continuing from the debut album.  I bought this on the 1st day it was released and was highly disappointed.  Most of the beats sound the same.  The album length is entirely TOO short.  I would have given this 3 stars because the album content is not awful.  But Dead Prez loses a lot of credibility when on the SAME ALBUM you say "turn off the radio" and 5 tracks later you collaberate on a song with Mr. Radio himself, Jay-Z.  That loses a star right there.  Was this an attempt to appeal to the very radio stations that you constantly blast for not playing real hip-hop?  Well, I live in the major city of Philadelphia and I haven't heard about this song burning up the airwaves nor did I hear about it topping the Billboard music charts.  Great job, guys 
 This book was written in an obvious "My dad is bigger than your dad" frame of mind.  The author makes not doubt about who he thinks is the "alpha male" in the bunch.  President Clinton made a statement while on Air Force One and it was an opportunity to tell the world about his unsimpathetic words while President Bush is just a stumbling, chokes on himself when talking in public , "Awwww! Shucks that isn't what I meant to say!" kind of a guy.  Pres. Bush can outrun anyone, even in shape well built secret service guys, on his feet or his bike.   	If you're a firm believer in Bush you will love this, I'm a bigger, better man than you, book.  If you're an anti Bush person, you'll see through the bush=sh*% and through it in the trash.  This book made me wonder who wrote it; Bush or Sammon.   
 Bless Alan's heart! God bless you Alan! This is a terrible book. It isn't even enough to get a conservative angry 
 Well the only good thing one can say about the Treo 680 battery is that it's thinner. The battery for the Treo 650 basically got one through a normal business day. As the Treo 680 battery only lasts a 4-5 hours under business use, the descriptive adjectives that come to mind are: deplorable, distressing, lamentable, unsatisfactory and unsuitable.  I'm really dissapointed that Palm delivered such as lousy battery with the Treo 680. But happily, there is a quick fix, buy 1-2 more batteries and keep them charged and don't leave home without them ;- 
 First I haven't read this book.  But I do know Mr. Lake and have found it important for me not to believe what he writes about from "his experience".  I have found that he does write a good story for fiction 
 2 1/2 stars  Despite this album's horrible vocals and carnie-on-acid vibe, there are actually many times throughout the disc that you hear an amazing young band with some real fire in their approach. This album does work better as a sheer party favor for your head then an actual musical exploration, be sure that you want to embrace your inner 15 year old partying teen mode complete with crappy garage band rehearsal vibe, and you will appreciate this alot more  
 I am not sure how to describe this book, but clearly its claim to be "history" is really misleading.  Whatever it is it is badly organized. The author seems to be trying to employ a sort of movie flashback system of relating history, but what the educated reader will get is confusion followed by boredom.  If you are seeking to learn something of the history of Poland you are not going to get it from this volume.  This is one of the worst books I have ever read whatever it is supposed to be 
 I think Gates meant well by producing this piece,but his mind is no different from Eurocentrics who constantly degrade Africa and it's culture. I Have been on a crusade to justify Africa's existence in the broad history of the world. Gates Fails to do even this. I am a white person by the way. I recommend Gates instead of trying to displace Egypt from Africa you should look for connections. The connections between Egyptain relgion and African traditions is in there and worth a look. Dubois had said in his books constantly about the african features of ancient egypt. I heard Gates is making a documentary of Egypt,and I wonder if it will be insulting like this book and video set. Can scholars trust Gates not to be a biased eurocentric,nor a manaiac Afrocentric. I enjoyed parts of Africana,but found this book was offesive to African people and their culture. If you want to learn more about pre colonial West Africa check out Basil Davidson,a white historian of Africa,but a whole lot better choice on African history. Gates has no knowleadge of Africa either and it not an expert. He is just a pseudo anthropologist/african historian/book critic. TOny Brown also exposed his envolvment of the jewish coverup of the trans Atlantic slave trade. I shall discuss that on another pos 
 I'm semi-new to Hibernate. I've read through most of Hibernate in Action. The Hibernate Developer's Notebook as well. And I just wanted to get MORE familiar with Hibernate. Part of what I like out of a good computer programming book (and I've read many in my career) is when the authors walk you through the examples presented. In this book this happens in the first couple chapters. So far, so good. You think you're getting a thorough code walkthrough and so far you are. Then the authors begin refactoring code like crazy. Often in very subtle yet meaningful ways, but they never bother to explain themselves. So if you like to learn by typing the examples yourself, this book isn't for you. You'll quickly have to just plug their code in and read through their code, not allowed to code it yourself, because they just give up on presenting complete code examples and walk-throughs. I'm not sure if this is because they were trying to save paper or just didn't care, but they completely lost me at chapter 6. After I began having to go through the source downloaded from the website, I didn't care to read on. I just skimmed at that point. Because if I can't actually learn to write  the code myself it goes from being a teaching tool to a reference manual. As reference manuals go it's okay, but that's not what I was buying when I purchased this book. I was buying something to teach me "Hibernate Quickly". Good idea. Poor execution 
 This book is terrible!  There are so many mistakes in this book, I don't even know where to start.  The family tree is so complex, that not even the author seems to have been able to keep it straight.  In addition the plot takes so many twists and turns and so many of them dead end that it is hard work keeping the story straight.  And the ending is predictable.  A character ("Ashely") identified as Odile's grandson on the family tree is called a great-grandson in the text.  The novel describes events that take place in 1999, yet Odile's birthdate is given as 1918, when the characters are supposed to be coming together to celebrate her eighteth birthday.  And when a character talks about an event in the 60's, she describes it as almost thirty years ago?  Last time I checked, that should be almost forty!!! In addition Henry's son is named Harry Jr.  Aren't Henry and Harry different names?  How did he (Harry) get to be a Jr. I couldn't put this book down - mainly because I wanted to see what would be wrong next. These errors bothered me so much, I got up to write a review at midnight - and I've never written a review before 
 While I really enjoyed Badami's first book, The Hero's Walk proved cumbersome and tedious. The plot lacks any creativity. It plods along at a labourious and predictable pace. The reader is "told" rather than "shown" everything feeling, thought, emotion. Pales in comparison to Such a Long Journey by Rohinton Mistry. 
 This clip came with the case that I bought for my Palm Treo phone. The second day that I had the case I lightly bumped against a doorway and the clip came apart and all of the pieces went everywhere and it wasn't able to be fixed. I am unhappy about the clip mainly because when it broke my phone his the cement and chipped the corner. I would not buy this clip of you are going to be doing anything but sitting around at a desk. I don't know if it was just my clip, or if all of them are made poorly. 
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 Warning:  This book causes extreme drowsiness.  Do not read while operating motorized vehicles, batheing or cooking.   Do not mix with alcohol 
 This book applies to women who are in leadership positions, which I am not, so I despise the title "Nine Secrets Every Working Woman Must Know". It's misleading. I'm currently reading this book and have only found a small paragraph that applies to "every working woman." Given the title, I thought the book would give helpful tips on getting ahead for the average working woman, but it doesn't. Needless to say, it didn't do me much good for where I am currently in my career. 
 I'm a frustrated beginner at Javascript. This book is part of what frustrated me. It's not very clear, with not enough examples and not enough details all at the same time. Much later, after I put down this book in frustration, I picked up WROX press' "Beginning Javascript," which I find much easier to follow. If only I had started with that book instead of this one 
 This is rather a silly spatula.  The reason it's silly is because it is a rather small spatula, with an odd pointy tip, a very tiny paddle, and thus a very short paddle edge for actual scraping.  This makes it pretty much useless for various spatula-enabled tasks such as, say, scraping batter out of a mixing bowl.    I may be missing some incredibly obvious use for this weird little spatula -- I suppose the pointy tip might be useful for scraping out the bottoms of mayonnaise jars, but I do wonder how many people in this world go through so much mayonnaise that they would need an item like this on a regular basis.  The reason I got this spatula in the first place was because it was inexpensive and has single-piece silicone construction (no places for gunk to collect), but there are much better single-piece silicone spatulas out there -- for instance, ones that are shaped like normal spatulas, with a paddle big enough to get some actual spatula work done.    What better way to say "I love you," than with the gift of another spatula?  Don't get this one.  
 I understand there is a CD rom available which contains four volumes.  Has anyone used this 
 I washed this garment according to the recommendation and it shrank about 2 sizes . . . to the point I can no longer wear it.  Bummer after just wearing it once 
 Why oh why haven't Smith and Ragan, experts in instruction, noticed that dry writing is not effective?  Apparently they believe that dry impersonal writing is a model of proper academic voice.  Sure, if the purpose of writing is to ensure that readers disengage as quickly as possible, then the style chosen does a wonderful job.  In addition, the text presumes that its audience are bottom-up learners and short-changes those of us that need a good hard look at the big picture before we can absorb the components thereof.  I can say one good thing about this text; it holds its resale value.  
 I was disappointed in The Writers Guide to Everyday Life in Regency and Victorian England, but gave this one a try.  Unfortunately, I think the editors of these books are just lazy when it comes to information.  Both  books covered history with broad generalizations.  There are some useful  items in both, but both are poorly laid out and badly written 
 I had not seen this book before, but was familiar with the illustrator's work on the Little Acts of Grace book.   The text of this book is very nice, but a bit wordy in places, however,I was extremely disappointed with the illustration on page 35.  It shows Jesus on the cross with blood pouring out from his wrists going into cups being held by two little angels.  The expression on the one angel's face is one of apprehension and almost fear like.  It is totally too graphic and disturbing and I will not use this book with my students because of it.   Too bad to have just one illustration ruin the whole book 
 I bought this book after seeing Mr Florida talk on CSPAN-2. He does have some interesting things to say about creativity, but...  I found it very difficult to finish.  Mr Florida claims to be politically independent, but he doesn't even hesitate to engage in the sort of casual Bush bashing one see's only in the extreme left, and along with this he repeats almost every silly platitude of same, including the ridiculous "pentagon holding a bake sale to buy a bomber" bit.  If he's politically independent, then I'm the King of Siam.  And his solution? right out of the leftists playbook, we have to spend more, lots more, way more than we ever have, "several orders of magnitude more" on "education", "culture" and "the arts."  Anyone interested in buying a used book? Only read once.. 
 Another bunch of blather, in my opinion. The biggest stock market crash in history may be coming. IS probably coming, even. But WHEN, Mr. Kiyosaki, WHEN? In 2016? It might, but you don't know, the chairman of the fed doesn't know, the President doesn't know, no one does. You're guessing. All your books say you're a money expert, based on a questionable autobiography, anecdotes, and a gullible public. I don't think Mr. Kiyosaki gives very good advice. I'd prefer Andrew Tobias, Ben Stein, or God help me, Suze Orman. Sorry 
 Madonna in her pre-Kabbalah phase - check the liner notes -  This collection is garbage.  DANCE Madonna,  DANCE.  (Yawn... 
 The material is first-rate but his writing style is horrid. His five-part typology of memory doesn't make sense since he is basically repeating the same theme for each type of memory in each chapter. The underlying theme is about the destruction and shattering of the self. Very poorly written and bad organizatino of his material. There are much better and clearer books on the Holocaust! Don't bother with this one 
 We are currently using this book in my digital logic class and it is confusing.  All my class mates agree that this book is terrible and we get little out of it.  His explainations leave you saying ???What??? and there are no solutions to the odd numbered problems, a basic requirement for a text.  We are learning soley from the lectures and other students who have some experience with boolean algebra and truth tables.  The other reviewers that like his book must be friends of the author. If your college has chosen this text... Pray you have a good instructor!!! 
 I like that you can customize your workout or use a pre programed one. There is the option of only having music and no talking which is nice. The cardio segments are about 13 minutes each and the toning segments are about 5. There is a total toning segment and it is about 10 minutes. The cardio didn't get my heart beat elevated like some other dvds I have. The toning segments had good exercises, but my muscles didn't feel tired after doing them. I think this dvd is geared more towards beginners 
 I flip through Time every now and again at the barber shop.  Sometimes there are good bits that they are using to keep the interest of people who want progressive social change, people who are sick of the power of the corporate elite and the violence of our militarists.   For the most part, since Time receives most of its revenues from Big Business advertisements, it can't challenge the establishment as it needs to. So instead I read magazines like Z, Utne, Mother Jones, The Progressive, The Sun, Earth Island and the New Internationalist 
 While Guy Grand's pranks are amusing, the book lacks any real satirical center or dramatic structure, which would give it some meaning (and some real bite).  You could take the chapters out of their present sequence, reassemble them in any order, and the book would be just as effective --- and that's about as damning a criticism as I can think of.  The book utlimately is a washout.  It starts and stops in the same place, and in between the narrative just meanders from episode to episode without any real idea of what it wants to do, or how to do it.  Not Southern's best, by any means, but better than tripe like CANDY 
 I have never put down a book (actually, I have, once) I Have never left a series  unfinished I am leaving my third decade I have read this book one and a half year ago. No one goes anywhere and they go slowly. I Will probably finish the series when i get to be around seventy, so I can say that I've finished it and go in peace with myself and maybe get Mr. Jordan's hidden message, which I seriously doubt.  I am also posting this on book one, so no one goes unwarned, as the series started off pretty well.   Shame 
 If you're interested in learning how to build wooden boats but have NO wooden boat building experience whatsoever this book is NOT the book for you. The Duck Trap Press how-to books might be a better place to start.  This book appears to contain a wealth of information from a very experienced author. There's a ton of good historical information contained within.  Unfortunately without knowing how to 'read' wooden boat plans and drawings and understand the terminology that the author uses this book did not meet my expecations at all 
 This is a realy, really fun movie...I saw it years ago and loved it, so I ordered in DVD...well, it's BLAN 
 The book is an easy read enough for an introductory text, but the details for many chapters are really inadequate 
 This is the first book by Deaver that I have read.  Apparently there are a couple of prequels to this novel involving the same main characters -- I will never read them.  Deaver has adequate style and a talent for pacing a mystery thriller.  He also has some skill in character development; however, he only applies this skill to the secondary characters in this story.  Perhaps the main characters in this story appeared so flat to me because I have not read the other novels in this series, but judging by their inconsistent behavior, bizarre motivations, and the melodramatic dialogue in this novel I doubt the other books could be much better.  Worse than Deaver's hackneyed mystery cut-out-characters is his insistence that the reader be willing to accept the most unbelievable and unlikely situations for the sake of a dramatic situation or plot twist.  Like many other second-drawer mystery writers, Deaver portrays such notable organizations as the FBI, INS, US Coast Guard, and the NYPD as ridiculously inept and corruptible.  Nor has he made any attempt to research the actual policies and procedures that these organizations would follow in the situations presented in the story.  Deaver also has a poor grasp on the politics of international economics.  This is normally excusable in a mystery writer, but since Deaver sets Chinese/American economics as the foundation of his final plot twist the whole story comes crashing down in the final chapters of the novel.       A note to Deaver and other mystery writers:  it is not a requirement for a great detective to be a pompous jerk and an abrasive know-it-all.  It has been 115 years since Doyle introduced the world to Sherlock Holmes, and we have had 115 years of mediocre mystery writers plagiarizing Doyle's character.  Please try to be original.   And also, if the final "twist" in your story is so complicated and so unbelievable that you must expend two chapters in trying to explain it, perhaps it shouldn't be there in the first place.  I give this book a D.    
 Day is superior to both Night and Dawn, the first two books in Elie Wiesel's Night trilogy. However, six aspects of Day really bug me:  First, Day's plot lacks cohesion and is out of chronological order, unlike Night and Dawn. The heart of a novel should either consist of either solid storytelling and an advancing plot or delicately crafted interwoven stories. In Day, it is instead largely a jumble of disparate memories - typically of women in steamy situations. This is not conducive to seamless communication.  Second, Wiesel originally wrote The Accident separately from Dawn and Night. As such, it is the least connected to the other two books. He decided at some point to change the title to Day, tack it on to his first two books, and call the resulting mumbo-jumbo a "trilogy." This is sloppy, self-centered, and ultimately irritating because now students at my school are required to read all three volumes.  Third, my same old complaint about Wiesel's writing holds true in Day: too much crying! I find it absurd how many times people cry in the Night trilogy - readers of Night and Dawn (as many of you readers this review are) can attest to this. Rather than making his readers more sympathetic to the feelings of his characters, Wiesel conditions them to indifference with this blatant overuse of sadness.  Fourth, Wiesel's comparisons in Day are too often uncreative at best, stale at worst. Too often he compares one woman to another, typically his mother or grandmother. Comparing one woman to another does nothing. These comparisons would be acceptable once or twice, but, one's patience wears thin after reading paragraph after paragraph of them. Wiesel should keep in mind that he is writing to other people who did not grow up with these women. Much more interesting and effective would be to compare the women to romantic inanimate objects such as the sun, the moon, or a budding rose.  Fifth, Wiesel shies away from many chances to show us a lurking literary prowess throughout Day. These opportunities crop up whenever somebody "talked for hours." It's hard to imagine that these terse, two-dimensional characters are really capable of speaking for hours without seeing the monologue on paper. Why does Wiesel hold these soliloquies back from us?  Sixth, and last, Wiesel doesn't vary his sentence structure enough, in Day or either of the other books in his Night trilogy. This is a run-of-the-mill high school error, and I'm surprised that neither he, nor Oprah, nor the legions of devoted oprah&wiesel fans pick up on this. His short, choppy sentences should be reserved those rare pulse-pounding moments, but Wiesel uses them everywhere.  I will quote from the text to illustrate my points:  Kathleen's face was twisted with pain. She looked like a sorceress who has lost her true face from having put on too many masks. A great fire burned around her. Suddenly she cried out and began to sob. My mother, I had never seen my mother cry. (p.74)  Kathleen. Tears were coming to her eyes. My mother didn't cry. At least not when other people were there. She only offered her tears to God. Kathleen looked a little like my mother; she had her high forehead, and her chin had the same pure lines. But Kathleen wasn't dead. And she was crying. (p.89)  These selections are the concluding paragraphs of two back-to-back chapters. And yet they say the same thing. That's not any kind of plot advancement that I've ever heard of. I hung my head upon reading the following, though I agree with it:  Nothing is more sacred than life, or healthier, or greater, or more noble. To refuse life is a sin; it's stupid and mad. You have to accept life, cherish it, love it, fight for it as if it were a treasure, a woman, a secret happiness. (p.67)  This "profound" realization flies in the face of what the narrator previously thought - that life wasn't worth fighting for. However, I knew that "life is all we have" before I even knew who Wiesel was. I know we humans must simultaneously struggle for our lives while still finding time to cherish them. I don't need an emotionally-estranged Holocaust-survivor narrator to take me by the hand and lead me through the way he discovered that truth, which is essentially the only task that Day accomplishes for society. Day certainly doesn't make one happier, unless one derives pleasure from knowing one can write better than a Nobel Peace Prize winner. I cannot speak for how this book affects other readers, however. Perhaps this book will save someone from suicide someday?  I will make you suffer though one more irresistible passage before I quit:  In the beginning she didn't cry. We were on the same level. We dealt with each other like equals. We were free. Each one free from himself and free from the other. When I didn't feel like keeping a date, I didn't. She did the same. And neither of us was angry or even hurt. When I didn't talk for a whole night, she didn't try to make me explain. The familiar question asked by lovers, "What are you thinking about?" didn't enter our conversations. Hardness had become our religion. Nothing was said that wasn't essential. We tried to convince each other that we could live, hope, and despair, alone. Each kiss could have been the last. At any moment the temple could have collapsed. The future didn't exist since it was useless. At night we made love silently, almost like our own witnesses. A stranger watching us in the street could easily have taken us for enemies. Rightly so, perhaps. True enemies aren't always the ones who hate each other. (p.90)  I prefer that my novels not read like Chicken Soup for the Soul.  Gyula arrives near the end of the book, providing the comic relief and fog-cutting outsider's insight that the rest of Wiesel's Night trilogy needed so desperately to keep from being the bore that it was. In Gyula's laughing light and portrait-mirror, the narrator sees himself for who he truly has become and discovers that he needs to change his outlook. Day was a more satisfying novel than either Night or Dawn in part due to this resolution and promised change in attitude.  I have concluded my reading of the Night trilogy, and of Wiesel, for good. I can't wait to discuss this trilogy in English class - fur will fly, for sure, as most readers of Wiesel whom I've met become insta-fans. I will conclude by saying this - if you enjoyed Night and Dawn, then Day will be right up your alley 
  The Equidistant Letter Sequence (ELS) Codes are a fascinating subject and possibly one of Man's greatest "archaeological" finds.  There appears to be much to learn yet, but this discovery cannot be dismissed.   Grant Jeffrey's, 'THE MYSTERIOUS BIBLE CODES' is an interesting although flawed look at the ELS Codes, which he has touched upon in some of his earlier books. The cornerstone of this publication is chapters 6 & 7 which address the discovery of the Aramaic name for Jesus (Yeshua) encoded in Old Testament passages concerning the coming Messiah and Redeemer of Mankind. For example, amazingly, "JESUS IS MY NAME" is encoded in the "Suffering Servant" prophecy of Isaiah 53. It appears here and only here.   Twice in the year 2000, I wrote to Mr. Jeffrey. I related how I was a volunteer for a Prison Outreach Program and sometimes utilized his book - making it available to inmates - but I needed clarification on a couple of flaws or typographical errors concerning ELS Codes that he claimed could also be found in some of the Greek New Testament passages.   On page 171 (hardcover) he states that the Greek name for Jesus is located at a 5-letter skip interval in 1st John 5:13, but I was unable to find it in the Greek passage illustrated there. Also, on page 173 he states that the second smallest skip interval for "Jesus" is encoded every 8th letter in Matthew 24:30, which contradicts his later claim on page 176 that the second smallest skip interval for "Jesus" is encoded every 7th letter in John 21:17. These are mutually exclusive statements. I did include a self-addressed, stamped envelope with my queries, but I have yet to receive a reply. I know we call it "snail mail" for a reason, but this is ridiculous!   Jeffrey delights in pointing out how the names of all the apostles and other personages close to Jesus can be found encoded in Isaiah's "Suffering Servant" passage. While it IS intriguing that "Judas" does NOT appear in this passage, Jeffrey neglects to inform his readers that these same names consist of such few letters that they also appear well over 1000 times throughout the book of Isaiah!   Some of Jeffrey's books do contain valuable information and are worth reading. But because he tends to sensationalize and because most of his facts can be found in the books of other writers, it may be advantageous to search other sources first. In his book, 'THE MILLENNIUM MELTDOWN' (1998), Jeffrey stated that the Y2K computer problem WOULD precipitate "a global crisis, the scope of which we have not experienced since World War II....this appointment with destiny cannot be postponed or avoided." THAT BOOK (which thankfully I bought for only an inflated 25 cents in 2002) damaged his credibility forever in MY BOOK!   While I wholeheartedly recommend that you explore the ELS Bible Code topic, I suggest that you acquire 'BIBLE CODE BOMBSHELL' by R. Edwin Sherman instead. Sherman's book is easily the best on the subject as of this date.  Grant Jeffrey opportunistically cranks out nearly a book a year that is second-rate because it never includes an index. ('The Mysterious Bible Codes' is no exception.) Also, each book closes with a proselytizing chapter which (while he may feel it is his obligation to The Great Commission) I find grating. I feel that if the facts are persuasive, they will bring the open-minded to Christ without excessive cajoling.  I read the Bible from Genesis through Revelation every year and still I find much of Jeffrey's contemporary Christian dogma unsupported by Scripture. I don't think he would appreciate that. But then I didn't appreciate my polite enquiries being ignored either. I guess Grant and I have now balanced our BOOKS. (Galatians 6:7 
 Even though this book was terrible, it starred lesbians, and that's got to count for something. Exactly 2 stars 
 There are several very good crochet stitch guides on the market.  This is not one of them.  I should have realized when I read the introduction and saw some blatant errors.  It states that "These days machines crochet items as small as doilies and as large as sweaters and afghans."  Wong.  If you look up "crochet machine" on Google you will find a huge industrial machine that makes drapery trim.  It does not, nor does any other machine, crochet doilies, sweaters or afghans.  Then it talks about the diagrams which  it says are based on International Crochet symbols  "...the old European code used widely today" that were found in France. Actually, the symbols we use today are of Japanese origin, and the earliest recorded sighting of them is about 1915.  Finally, it says that crochet was called Nun's Work in the Middle Ages.  But nothing about crochet has ever been discovered  as early as the Middle Ages.  Doesn't give much reason to trust the rest of the book.  Each stitch is presented with hand-drawn symbols (pretty well done), a fuzzy black and white photo of the stitch, usually worked pretty poorly, and written instructions. Nothing new here. No color in the book except on the covers.  And as one previously revidwer pointed out, the covers feature a rectangular motif for a teddy bear block that may enduce someone to buy it.  Too bad!  The pattern for it is not in the book!  Save your money 
 Don't waste your time or money on this one as there are far better forensic books out there. This book was just a collection of short narratives reading more like a personal diary than any kind of scientific narrative laying out the facts of cases. I guess it lives up to its subtitle of "Life as a Forensic Anthropologist" in that she usually presents only HER part in each case with little presentation of the entire case. The forensic cases are not really the star of this book, the author is. I was frustrated with the lack of depth. Instead, read "The Body Farm" by Bill Bass. Excellent storytelling there! He gives you personal stories, but also provides all the fascinating forensic info to provide a complete picture for the cases he has investigated 
 The sizing on this cardigan is way off.  I ordered a women's medium and it looks like a child size large.  The sleeves are about 4" too short and the overall profile is far too small.  To make matters worse, I ordered it as a X-mas gift and by the time we opened presents we passed the 30 day return window and I'm stuck with a bad product 
   After purchasing the program thinking it would perform a through check on my Presario running XP Home all I get is a message that SSP6 has unexpectedly quite. I emailed tech support w/ the info, but so far no response after 10 days. There is no # to call for support. Maybe I overlooked something.    Also, I submitted the rebate form which came on the package, but was told that the seller was not participating in the rebate program and I need to check w/ them. I did and they said they shipped what VCOM had provided them, which included a rebate form if doing a competitive upgrade.   Not very impressed w/ either the software or the company. Would never buy another product from these guys, even when the price after rebate is 0. LOF 
 I'm quite disappointent with this book. Although there's tons of stuff in it - Rae covers drawers, hinges, feet, shelves and many more topics, none of the topics is actually described thoroughly. There's plenty of pretty pictures in there that at first seem to demonstrate how things are to be done, but when you actually start making say mortises for door hinges, you suddenly realize that there's no details in this book.  To summarize, don't let yourself fooled by the many pretty pictures; there should be more information instead 
 The odd assortment of stories in this book mostly portray hunters as  cowards, braggarts, and boors---all caught up in dysfunctional  relationships with their parents, children, friends, neighbors, and  spouses. There are few classics here and some quality stories by budding  authors, but there are many other mediocre ones that seem to have been  selected only because of the negative light they throw on hunters and  hunting. If you love hunting, you will be disappointed with this anthology 
 I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).    Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of "references" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.    I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."  But in this case it would seem: "With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet. 
 This book is full of assumptions and generalizations. Some information is distorted. According to the logic of the writer over 90% of the population should be already dead from "addiction". The writer assumes from the very beggining that any system that is centered around men is addictive and therefore harmful. It is possible, but the writer doesn't make any notes about the  men and women centered systems. The only system that is good is the female system 
 My book club and I all agreed that this book left much to be desired as a survey of Western Philosophy.  I had hoped for a better skeleton to hang the fabric of Philosophy upon.  However, one cannot go through such a survey without being stimulated to think deep thoughts - 'Do I see red the same way you see red?' - and so forth.  The author did refer to previous philosophers as he progressed in the book, however, It just didn't hang together 
 This book misrepresents eating disorders and makes eating disorder sufferers almost seem psychotic. The author is very inexperienced with eating disorders and only has her word to back up her statements. She puts down eating disorder facts that have proven to be true for many of us that have suffered with eating disorders. The one good thing about the book is how she encourages treating victims of eating disorders with love and compassion and her methods  may work with some individuals, yet I have talked to those that have said that working with her was a terrible experience. I think her kindness is what drew her clients. She states that her way is the only way to help anorexics which ignores the fact that people are individuals. And she ignores the fact that other therapists besides her have had a high success rate and she puts down therapies that have helped me and many others. Some of her theories almost seem  mystical. Almost like those with eating disorders are saints or psychics of some sort.  It is good to note that her clinic was closed down for operating without a license.   
 While occasionally interesting and compelling, the nonsensical anti-evolution message not only makes the book's focus leave suspence and head, instead, for religious banter, it also makes things confusing and impractical.  While Crichton's "State of Fear" gave a brilliant argument againt global warming through fiction, this novel does nothing brilliantly and, in fact, some things quite miserably 
 very confusing, non-focusing writing style plus author's splurge of mathematical demonstrations everywhere in the book makes this text book very hard to understand and offers no help for people to grasp the beauty of the economic theory. 
 I have enjoyed following Fairstein's Alex Cooper mysteries but this one has started a tedious note to them. First, it seems Fairstein/Cooper is getting a tad high-handed in the way she treats others and comes accross as being snooty in this book. I was so hoping for another ending that didn't develop (those of you who've read the others know what I'm talking about.) Will give her next one another shot and hope for the best, if not, I'll pass on the rest of her 'formula books.' As an aspiring author, I know how dangerous getting into this rut can be. Linda, you're better than this. Go back and give me 200,000 words of CREATIVITY 
 At first glance it seemed to be the perfect gift for a baby with a thing for all things wheels and musical.  AND normally I really trust the Vtech name - so I didn't look at the item too closely prior to buying it.  But it didn't take long for me to realize what a mistake I made.  Yes, he likes it very much and uses it well, and it performs well etc.  However, I will agree that there is NOTHING nice about how the voices speak or what they say - and I would never think that I would have such a 'prudish' view on a baby toy!  But it is rude, it is obnoxious and I don't like the message - if you can say that there is one - I mean - they could have had much more endearing snippets.  There is little education in it really - and the songs are short the lyrics to the ABC song is half cut out?!?!?  I could do without having education in a toy - but that coupled with the bad attitude - I have one thing to say "Outta' my house"   The older version of this toy is MUCH better with friendlier voices and helpful 'neighbors'.  Vtech should go back to the old version 
 I could honestly say, that the time this band was concieved, I did not like them at all, that was grade school people. But dumbfounded me decided back in I think it was 87 or 88, whatever it was bought Girls, Girls, Girls, boy what a let down that was I must say. I had a friend that idoled them, and I could not handle it, I had to put him out of his misery, just kidding, but I sure let him have it many times over. I just can't get into Vince Neil, nor the walking disease Tommy Lee, they both nausaete me too death with their perversions. And as far as the music goes, just pure garbage, fresh from the pile of leftovers from the cruddy hair band 80's. I would have to say, I would have a better time smacking myself with a hammer several times and get permanent brain damage than to happen to listen to these songs all over again 
 This was my first Catherine Coulter book and my last.  MAYBE, the author was trying to portray life during those times, but rape scenes between the hero & heroine isn't exactly what I'd call romantic...  One other little quirk I had was during her pregnancy...so..her husband pushed her down like a boulder, got stabbed in the side by a knife in the process, husband's ex-lover kicked her in the belly during a cat fight, fell off a cliff and hanging down on that cliff and STILL managed to keep the baby!?!?!   Nothing made sense in the entire book.. from the characters, to the plots, and to the title...nothing made sense! Like one reader was saying, its so bad its good 
 Newt and William are going to write a new book.  It will be called an Alternate History of World War II.  In it Germany will win the Battle of the Bulge BUT lose the war.  Their next book will be an Alternate History of the Revolutionary War, in it the Colonies will win.  Then they will together write an Alternate History of the First World War.  In this stirring book, the ALLIES WIN, THE ALLIES WIN. What is the point?  Also read Sidewalk Sam below for a fuller explanation of this lousy book 
 I bought this scale because I figured the price was right.  Well, as they say, you get what you pay for.  First of all, it is flimsy in construction.  I am under 200 lbs., yet when I step on it, the cheap plastic bends down.  You can just feel how thin and unsubstantial the plastic is.  Next, the first time I weighed myself, I found that I had lost 7 lbs. overnight!  If only this were true.  I didn't believe it.  I stepped off and got back on and I had gained back 5 of the lost pounds.  Off and on again -- and I was up another 4.  If you like to just kind of average your many readings, then this scale will work for you.  Otherwise, take a pass.  BTW, and I was using it on a flat hard surface. 
 Unbelievable that a publisher would agree to print this nonsense.  Don't waste your tim 
 Most of the graduate students in physics and chemistry here at Cal agree  that this book is incomplete and glosses over too much of the details.   It's also very annoying to read things like, "Proof:  The proof is  trivial."  Anyone studying from this text will be left with the  feeling that something is missing.  Personally, I prefer the classic two  volume "phonebook of quantum mechanics" by Cohen-Tannoudji et al 
 ...half-decent tracks don't make an album: "Pure Gold", "Show Me The Way" & "To You". The rest sounds like OutKast or Black Eyed Peas (of s**t). Even some clowns from aforementioned groups are even on the album!(?).  Well, the album probably could get 4-5 stars...if your under 14!!!  Oh well, EW&F's collaborations has NEVER been successful through the years, not this time either.  If you by any chance are interested in the REAL EW&F, check out "I Am" or "Raise!" etc., these albums get my 5 stars.. 
 The English translation is of a German translation of sections of ancient Chinese texts that earlier existed as an oral tradition.  The terminology of the book is let us say obscure to a Western reader and I found Jungs commentary difficult even though Jung explicitly treats the texts as psychological rather than metaphysical.   Jung says in an Appendix tribute to Wilhelm that Wilhelm made a greater impact on him than any other man.  In his commentary Jung also says that one of the reasons he was so impressed by "The Secret" is that the symbolism is the same as that Jung encountered in his clinical practice ie both originate, he argues, in the structure of the collective unconscious.  The good news is that if you can struggle through the strange wording and references of the Chinese texts, there are real signs of wisdom throughout the texts.  For example at one point in "The Secret" it is said that man creates his body through his thoughts.  Again on several occasions it is clear that the text is assuming that man survives death, and that after death there are alternative possible scenarios including re-incarnation (many many times) and movement to non-physical realms.    "The Secret" talks about meditation techniques including control of breathing to achieve altered states.  I did not find those sections persuasive, perhaps because they were too brief for my taste 
 I like reading.  I am a literature snob.  I put down poorly written novels (even though I can't write well myself!).  But, I think I've met my match in this novel.  I recognize the style is something unique, but I just couldn't grasp the rhythm.  I'm afraid I'm going to have to side with those who gave this book thumbs down.  I really want to be in the group that appreciates this Plitzer Prize novel, but I don't make the cut.        HOwever, I'd love to read more from reviewers on what they saw in this book because I just couldn't find much other than the rambling thoughts of a very whiny and boring 40-something man whom I would't enjoy spending a 3-day-weekend with at all.        I've persistantly struggled through 180 pages, but now will surrender!   
 I didn't like this book one little bit.  Not to say it's offensive.  Just dull, predictable, and, well, I hate to say this, but immature.  Let me preface this by saying that Spider Robinson has some sweet ideas about humanity.  His notion that a bunch of people getting together to share their pain and joy is very nice.  It's not that I'm cynical (Well, I AM cynical) but it just never comes across as very believable.  None of these characters seem real to me at all.  Worse, they all seem like the same guy.  They all find the same things funny.  They all talk the same, all have the same attitude about life.  And never once did I find them remotely interesting, hence it was hard to find them very likable.  As for the humor, I guess I just don't get it.  It's lifeless stuff without much punch.  And puns?  Dear God, who outside of a ten year old thinks puns are that funny?  Maybe one or two, but come on, a whole book of them gets old fast.  Robinson's immaturity is the real handicap, made evident by his unsophisticated sense of humor and lack of in depth characters.  Even more obvious, like a little boy uncomfortable with the opposite sex, there are very few female characters in the story, which doesn't really bother me, but says something about the writer.  That said, there are plenty of people who enjoy Callahan's, even love it.  I guess I'm just not one of them.  
 This is one of those books that's so bad you can use it to judge critics -- because if *anybody* says it's well written, or well plotted, or has good characterizations, THEY'RE NUTS.  The fact is, there's NO characterization, the sentence constructions are painful, and at least one major plot point is impossible.  (If you're paying even a minimum of attention, you'll put the book down and go, "HUH?")  This book is good for exactly one thing:  it shows you don't have to spend a lot of time writing a book -- or even be a competent writer -- to have a best seller.  I don't mind mindless escapism -- heck, I'll give Janet Evanovitch two thumbs WAY up -- but when it's a trash heap like this it gives reading a bad name 
 Okay this table is perfect for my daughters Little People, but the packaging that it came in was horrible. When I received this item on my door step, there was a hole at the bottom of the package and it was missing 9 screws. So I had to go to Home Depot and find some similar just so that I could put it together. After all that hassle was said and done, this table is good...my daughter LOVES it 
 This is a somewhat useful book for those who accept the highly- sensitive-person designation.  Ms. Jaeger provides some helpful advice, though a fair bit is so general as to render it almost useless. Also, I think even she is aware that there are many cases in which people with family obligations simply cannot afford to leave dull, menial, and wearisome jobs, however soul-destroying such work might be. Ms. Jaeger's book deserved a much more careful editing. It is full of grammatical errors, most glaringly--pronoun-reference problems and needless repetition, which frequently obstruct the message. I appreciate the efforts of the author to tackle the subject, but the book ought to have been much shorter and more finely-tuned. A good editor should have assisted her with this 
 Everything is fine, everything is OK. The simplest answer is the most likely.  Conspiracies are made up by left-wing wackos with nothing to do.  Did Iran-Contra ("Ask about the cocaine!"), Tuskegee, MK-ULTRA, Latin American germ warfare, Bay of Pigs, Allende overthrow, CIA LSD research of the 50s, '66 NY subway experiment, and the Arbenz coup in Guatemala all happen?  No they didn't.  Oliver North acted alone and was deranged and crazy.  E. Howard Hunt was a deranged loner who tried to kill Castro.  Uncle Sam was a crazy deranged lunatic that give African Americans syphilis in 1932.  He acted alone.  God bless America.  I love our leader.  The more than fifty people that died after the Kennedy assassination all committed suicide.  They were distressed by Oswald's murder of Kennedy and could not go on living.  Shame on you Mr. Oswald.  I love you Mr. Posner.  You're a lot better than that Oswald guy.  Mr. Posner: would you please write a book debunking the claims of The Chuch of the Sub-Genius?  JR Bob Dobbs is a nut and must be stopped.  God bless you and your people 
 This was the first book by Danielle Steele that I have read and it will be the last I read by her. I was truly disappointed and believe she is a highly over-rated author. The story was VERY drawn out and I caught myself dozing off a few times because the book was so boring. If you want to fall asleep quick then this is the book for yo 
 I bought this same brand of discs sometime last year on this very site. I was very pleased with the purchase then. I didn't have one problem with the discs.   I bought another pack recently and I've been using the pack I just bought. All of the discs are messing up for me. I can understand having a few problematic discs but this is insane to have a whole pack of discs and every single one of them messes up for you. I wish I could send these discs back and get a refund. This purchase has scared me away from anything else related to Memorex. I thought Memorex was a very reliable brand and they would make sure they were sending out top notch items to consumers. I guess I was wrong. And apparently you get what you pay for. Don't be fooled by the good price. You'll just be out of your money and stuck with discs that wouldn't even be worth using as a frisbee. Find another brand to use and avoid this brand 
 You know how a typical historical romance reads.  Heroine, somewhat older, a little feisty, determined not to marry.  Hero, complete reprobate.  Unfortunate circumstances lead to blooming of sexual passion; a complete surprise to the heroine, who's never felt a stab of lust before.  Eventually, he realizes he loves her, despite pushing her away.  Some Dark Secret lies at the heart of his attempts to avoid love.  He tells all; and love blooms.  The end.  This is a typical historical romance.  There is nothing in this book that is not in a hundred other historical romances.  The writing is passable the sex scenes aren't particularly passionate.  I hate to say it, but there's nothing in this book that steps outside the norm.  This is your typical mid-list Avon writer.  No envelopes are pushed, and nothing interesting--or even remotely suprising--happens to shock the reader.  If you want more of the same, this is the book for you.    If you want something that sparkles, try Julie Anne Long's "Beauty and the Spy," Elizabeth Hoyt's "The Raven Prince," or Laura Lee Guhrke's "And Then He Kissed Her. 
 What dooms "A Son Called Gabriel" is a combination or too much ambiguity at the end and too little focus throughout.  By the unsatisfying end, I never felt any connection to the book or to the relatively flat characters.  It might just be that I've read far better books on the subject of a young man grappling with his sexual identity.  I agree with another reviewer who remarked this entire book could have been condensed into a Part I with a Part II and possibly Part III that get to the meatier times in Gabriel's life after he leaves for college.  That Gabriel plays with girls and dolls and wants to be a hairdresser at 7-9 is interesting--albeit stereotypical--but doesn't warrant 100 pages of development.  The early teen years also don't add a lot.  Really nothing gets moving in this story until Gabriel's 16-18 or so and by then it was almost over.  There's a lot of lip service given to the Catholic-Protestant "Troubles" in the 60s, 70s, but it's never clear how any of this really affects Gabriel's development.  Since he's boyfriend to a Protestant girl, I'd have to say the political tensions didn't matter a whole lot to him.  In which case, it doesn't add much to the story.  At the end of course there's the big Scarlet Letter/Empire Strikes Back twist, which only distracts readers from the fact that the ending raises more questions than it answers.  What will happen to Gabriel in London?  Will he and Fiona stay together?  Was Father Brendan a homosexual?  We'll never know unless there's a sequel in the works.  As for the writing, it was average.  I thought the author was guilty of run-on sentences at a few points, but that's just me.  There wasn't enough scene-setting.  Instead, we get a lot of rushing through test preparations/results and repetitive encounters with school bullies.  As a result of all the rushing around, there wasn't time to really develop the characters.  The rest of Gabriel's family isn't much different than any sitcom family because there wasn't time to really settle in and flesh out their personalities into more than one dimension.  But as I said at the beginning, my lack of enthusiasm might be because I've read better books on the subject.  "A Home at the End of the World" by Michael Cunningham, "Kavalier and Clay" by Michael Chabon, and "Line of Beauty" by Alan Hollinghurst top that list, the latter two winning the Pulitzer and Booker Prize respectively.  By comparison, "A Son Called Gabriel" isn't in the same weight class 
 Sober and Wilson attempt to reduce the perception of evolution as necessarily leading to individualism and selfishness by resurrecting group selection as the means by which altruism has also evolved. Unfortunately they have produced a book which not only fails but is a laborious read.  The authors clearly accept kin-selection and the gene's-eye view yet fail to show how these methods already explain altruism and cooperation. Their attempts to show that there is altruism beyond this only leads to misrepresentations and a contrived argument.  Their definition of a group is 'a set of individuals that influence each other's fitness with respect to a certain trait' and groups are therefore 'defined on a trait by trait basis'. This sounds to me as if it is actually more along the lines of Dawkins' extended phenotype which is fine but is not how people understand groups and group selection.  The main problem with group selection is the lack of stable entities that can be called groups in the first place. The authors try to leave out sexual reproduction to make it easier but this is unacceptable. One or both sexes move between groups to breed so they are always fluctuating entities and within a species there can be separated groups of males or solitary males. In humans females moved between groups either willingly or by force. Though cooperation within groups is important it is a major omission to overlook the importance of actual numbers of fertile females and female fertility in the successful expansion of groups and how this leads to male-male competition within groups and between groups of male kin.  The authors do raise the relevance of empathy but other writers make a much better case of how the biological mother-infant bond has expanded to some degree to the human male and beyond parental feelings to group feelings (eg Jonathan Haidt in 'The Happiness Hypothesis').  Sober and Wilson have contrived evidence for 'pure' altruism, contrived a definition of 'group' and contrived models of 'group-selection' that are frankly impossible to relate to reality. Though well intended they have unfortunately merely produced a book that to read is like wading through mud and does nothing but confuse the debate. A very disappointing book 
 I tried to watch this dvd, but after about 10 minutes gave up.  It was impossible to watch because only bits of the conversations between the characters were translated.  I've seen some poorly subtitled foreign films, but this was by far the worst.  Don't bother until a dvd with decent subtitles is released 
 I sat down to read about this after hearing about it for years, and I want my week back. It only took that long because I had to push myself to finish it.  SPOILERS AHEAD: Meggie and Father Ralph (who everyone always seems to refer to as Ralph de Bricassart, even when they're talking to him) meet when he is twenty-six and Meggie is...ten. She speaks, acts and thinks like a 5-year-old, though. As the years go by, Father Ralph de Bricassart becomes sort of a father figure to little Meggie, and she develops a girlish crush on him. As Meggie is also "developing a very feminine figure," Ralph comes to love her in return but realizes that their love can never be. They discuss this in approximately fifteen thousand "Don't love me, my darling, for I love you but you know our love is forbidden and can never be" conversations throughout the book. Finally, after years of smothering their passion, they do it. In a really very boring scene that's all inner ruminating and blurred descriptions. And wouldn't ya know it, she gets pregnant. Ralph de Bricassart realizes (again) that their love can never be, and leaves. Meggie has his baby, and capers about gleefully that she's "stolen" something back from God. But wouldn't ya know it, the kid (who's as angelic and one-dimensional a boy I've ever encountered in literature) decides to be a priest. So she sends him to Father Ralph de Bricassart for training, who--get this--is so totally brain dead that IT NEVER ONCE OCCURS TO HIM THAT THIS MIGHT BE HIS CHILD!!!!!!! Apparently arithmetic is not a compulsory part of training for the priesthood; this guy also misses an incredibly broad hint from Meggie, when even the other priests figure it out. The Big Secret finally does come out (again in a very brief, anticlimactic scene) toward the end, but by then we're too busy skimming to really care.  All this leaves out a great many things--including immortal dialogue that makes Meggie sound perpetually ten years old ("I'll tell you something else about your roses, Ralph de Bricassart--they've got nasty, hooky thorns!"), endless, heavyhanded symbolism (ashes of roses, thorn birds...we get it! we get it!), some dumb subplot concerning a brother who is absent for 90% of the book, and one of the most unintentionally hilarious "tragic" scenes I've ever read (death by pig). Yet the Ralph-and-Meggie storyline really is the only major thing going on. And we never really get to see what it is that draws these two people together. I was expecting other subplots and development of other characters, and this never really happened. Many of the other relationships were sketchy and/or very confusing: Meggie's cruel judgment of her daughter Justine as a "monster" and a "b* tch," for example, seemed to have no basis. The last third or so involves Meggie making peace with her mother and daughter, and it just doesn't matter. The quick "the end" wrap-up would have been an even greater letdown if I'd still cared by that point. Even the most developed characters are flat and lifeless, and thoroughly unlikable. Scarlett O'Hara was selfish, but she was fun; these people are selfish and boring. Sickly-sweet quasi-romantic trash. 
 Firstly, I'm a huge fan of Jackie Chan and his work, but I just can't give this movie a good review. It is one of the most depressing films I've seen. Basic plot synopsis; Jackie has to watch all of his team members be executed, he is given an opportunity to save each one and fails each time. So thats the first 20 or 30 minutes of the film and all his closest friends are dead. The next portion of the film deals with him trying to drink himself to death. Then we watch his relationship with his fiance fall apart. Then we get to see one of the gang members being abused by his father. and thats at least two thirds of the film.   And then there's the whole subplot about the gang members making a video game out of all the people they kill so the good guys have to play the game in order to figure out what bank they're going to rob next. Kind of cheesy.  As I said, I really like Jackie Chan and he does display some really good acting talent in this film. But I don't like waiting until the last 20 minutes of the movie to see some good action and fight scenes especially when I just had to sit through some of the most depressing stuff I've ever seen 
 Yes it will be nice to learn few things about Nuremberg while following a live personal story. The problem is that this live personal story completely fails to click. 
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 ok, I hate to say it, but this never grew on me, i grabbed it when  it first came out and, sadly,  still it's very weak.  I'm a huge Kool Keith fan and this is very disapointing.  By far it's his worst album.  He needs to get back with Dan the Automator or something, these tracks are boring and go nowhere, with a couple exceptions-- so if it's dirt cheap it's worth grabbing. This does nothing for me, I hope he gets back on track 
 This book makes the most grievous error a book can make: it's boring.  The title sounded intriguing, but the book is a real snooze.  I skipped page after page looking for something of interest to read.  Alas, I found nothing.  Talk about disappointment.  I was hoping for a scathing analysis of the degradation of language in contemporary discourse and music.  What I got was...well, I'm not sure but it put me to sleep within 5 minutes.  I don't want to read in-depth analyses of speeches from 1856 or whatever.  Maybe there's another book out there that discusses the devaluation of language in pop culture in a compelling way.  This one ain't...I mean, isn't, it 
 Imagine my disappointment when, after reading all of the reviews about Alan Rickman's great reading style, I get this audio book in the mail only to find that it's actually read by Peter Jeffrey. Alan Rickman's name isn't even on the jacket 
 where can i read about this beef and how this release is shady? Ive been looking everywhere and also trying to find the real dr octagon on myspace but there has been nothing. someone please help... thanks! 
 Waste of money, lasted ONLY 2 weeks this summer. Garbage. Pay a little more for Bosch or same for Anco 
 the book does not contain enough information to be usefull. I would recommend other books such as "building Embedded Linux Systems 
 This is the worst game I have ever played.  It was so bad that we didn't even finish.  It came down to just guessing and could have gone on all night without a clear winner.  This game sucks! I wouldn't buy this game with somebody elses money, even if it were only $1 
 well lets be real here there are two really catchy songs and they stand out.Don't Let Me be the one & of course one of the baddest and rarest Bass Jams from the 80's I Can't Wait.cuz the Synths took over at will and  sadly the music hasn't recovered 
 yes this is a book about friendship and i realize for child at times simple is better but this book i thought really lacked especially compared to how great a book the hungry caterpillar is(i personally think just about this authors best book)it has at the very start of the book the question ask by a mouse "do you want to be my friend?"and then at the end a yes from another mouse no other writing between yes you can teach your child a little about the other animals the mouse is apparently asking though not in print.I personally thought this could have been laid out a little differen 
 It must make some feel very powerful to sit back and rank peoples intelligence and then claim that success or failure depends on that ranking. In a game they designed and created all the rules for, they tell others that their kind do not tend to excel and therefore they are not likely to be successful or rich, as a result. I guess it is true. I too am destined to be poor, dumb or inadequate by your definition of those things, but I continue to ask, what is, "smart?"     30 years ago, I witnessed an experienced well drilling company try in vain to find a water vein on a rural parcel. Two weeks, two wells dug and two wells not adequately producing, within days of being dug. Ready to give up, the landowner approached some locals, who, not really liking to talk openly about the different kinds of intelligence they had encountered in their community, hesitantly referred the landowner to "Mr. Jones," an old black man "down the road."  To make a long story short; using nothing more than his mind, body and the branch of a peach tree, Mr. Jones picked the spot and suggested the depth for a vein that, to this day, still flows abundantly with life-giving h2o. When the well drilling company complied with the landowners request to dig in the spot Mr. Jones had staked out, they refused to discuss Mr. Jones use of the divining rod and stated it was "unscientific" and plainly said to the landowner, "it's your money to waste." I suppose in today's world, Mr. Jones would be defined as "dumb," if he didn't make a million dollars with his God-given craft, but few of his book-smart critics will ever know how rich he really is.   You draw up your IQ tests, that you subject others to, and with all your fancy ways of measuring a brain, you proclaim there is a pattern at work, a bell curve, but, in all truth, you will never know what smart really is, and you will certainly never know wisdom, as you sit back comfortably and observe the rules that make and keep you king, while blind to the very earth creeping up on you. 
 Celebrity Skin by Jim Gerard gives the reader just what it says:  skin.  The collection, while titled with a body art slant, looks more like a group of celebrity photos where everyone just happens to have some body art, rather than focusing directly on it.  Many of the tattoos could have been showcased more if the portraits had been posed for that purpose instead of being collected from previous publications.  Written material about the celebs and their tats is of mixed length and quality.  Overall, this is more like a book of celebrity tattoos for the dentist's office, and not a great addition to the tattoo library that it could have been 
 I found any plot disrupted by the author's silly use of the term "mon". I believe he used it to give us an insight into Jamaican culture :=). Sam Tucker's use of the words "Boy" and "Son" are also very amateurish 
 I am a great admirer of some of Steinbeck's books. Grapes of Wrath is among my top ten.  East of Eden is unspeakably bad. It thrashes cliches out until they smell of putrefaction. The brother conflict, rather than being a modernization of the first biblical murder story, is an exaggeration in kitsch than can hardly be surpassed. So is the story of the incredible evil woman, the mother. So is the good Chinese in his great goodness. It makes me grow new goose bumps just to remember the extremes that Steinbeck went into as far as sentimentality goes. There is not a single real person in here. The book is a rambler. It walks about the countryside of it's story like a gentleman with nothing better to do. It gives you heaps of little pearls that wait for the rescue from the swine. It throws aphorisms at you when you start drowning in the pulp. In Germany we had a special genre for this kind of writing: the Heimatroman. This is one. I enjoyed and cursed it till the end. And then I watched the movie. Boy, was James Dean a bad actor, you wouldn't believe it. It got an Oscar in it's days as best movie? Oh boy. There is absolutely nothing right in the movie. And that made me realize the difference: the movie is so bad, you can not possibly stand it till the end. The book however is a monument of artistic provocation. I couldn't put it away. I dumped the DVD though 
 as a transmasculine, genderqueer person, i found this book offensive. valerio adopts socialized male sexism and then justifies it as a product of hormones. it is full of objectification of women, trivialization of women's emotions (at one point, he attributes the fact that a girlfriend has accused him of sexism to pure "jealousy"--instead of actually interrogating and examining this accusation in a serious way) and straight-up misogyny. the book is also extremely heterosexist--much of what valerio uses to define a man is his heterosexuality and attraction to women.  of course, i should not have expected otherwise--in the introduction, valerio establishes himself as someone who loves the binary and gender roles. i can't lie--he gave me fair warning for what i was about to read. i give it 2 stars because for anyone considering going on testosterone, it is an important perspective. but i warn that it is offensive, old-school machismo. it feels to me like it would be offensive to ANYONE who loves and respects or is a woman 
 Calling "The Truelove', whose story is primarily that of Clarissa Oakes, a woman who has been sexually abused from early girlhood until she boards Aubrey's ship [and, one might argue, until she leaves] a light hearted romp is misleading.  Hardly the first time this series has dealt with the impact of a woman on 'the wooden world' that Aubrey, Maturin and the ever changing cast of supporting characters inhabit, this time it shows everyone behaving in odd and surprising ways. Jack is thick headed and oblivious. Stephen, normally so clear-eyed, sends Clarissa, who admits not only to disliking children but to throwing an infant down a well, to stay with his wife and their newborn. Pullings throws off his sense of duty and is befuddled as well as bewitched.  Since Clarissa [like all O'Brian's 'strong' females] is really a man in a skirt [for a woman in uniform we have the aptly named Killick, in all his shrewish glory] she is far too flat, vague and undeveloped to carry such large portions of the plot with any measure of success.  This is definitely the worst book of the series and, sadly, in some ways not a good book at all. Not just because the plot is so out of place in this series, or even because characters you have grown to know start behaving in ways that are inexplicable, but because they have almost disappeared from the story to be replaced by someone you can't actually care about because she seems so fake 
 I was tempted to toss this book into the trash after reading the first two paragraphs that pronounced God dead and the character Anna master, oh, excuse me, mistress of the earth.  But then I begin to wonder just what kind of point was this author trying to make. I forced myself to trudge forward with the novel and found the story line and characters quite novel.  But too many times shivers ran down my back as the author pronounced, through the heroine, Anna, her hatred of people, especially those who believe in God.  How can anyone who cares so much for plants and animals wish for "an Old Testament God to visit the peak with one of His famous scourges: a lightning storm that would blast the rock clean of cloying humanity".. 
 Like many of the other reviewers, I found this book frought with recipe mistakes (or are they just sloppily written?).  However, many of the recipes, with adaptation, become quite nice.... the problem being that you must have enough cooking knowledge to know how to adapt recipes.  What's great about this book, though, is the plethora of information about food itself, mini-articles about things like mushrooms, green tea and how to grow your own herbs make for some great and informative reading.    Interesting and a great idea, but very poorly executed.  A good and thorough revision would make this book wonderful, but this edition is just not that great 
 Really a total mis-mash of bewildering essays from the mid 70s this collection mirrors the typical anti-Americanism of the era.  The essays are called `bold' but the reality is that disagreeing with the Vietnam war isn't exactly revolutionary.  No original thought is found within these essays instead they are the typical `America is evil' mentality.  One essay in particular focuses on the war in Laos and Cambodia but it ignores the Vietnamese invasions of these countries and the destabilizing influence that Vietnamese troops caused as they rampaged through the rice fields of Cambodia in order to invade South Vietnam.  The reality is that these essays completely ignore and in fact deny the truth about Pol Pots regime in Cambodia, a communist regime that killed 25% of the country and especially murdered minority groups and Muslims.  These glaring anti-factuals make this collection hard to accept and even harder to digest.  Fans of the authors previous work will be delighted, while most will be unhappy 
 Having never read a book by Danielle Steel but seen and liked a few of the movies adapted from her novels, I was looking forward to reading Answered Prayers, since I usually always find the books more deep and interesting. Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed... The first thing that bothered me about this novel, was the amount of repetition it has. I was just through the first few pages of the first chapter, and I was already being told things (usually insignificant) which I had just read a few lines before.  Secondly, the moment Brad is introduced into the plot, I could foresee with certainty, how it was going to unravel and how the book would eventually end. So as not to dampen my enthusiasm and continue reading, I reasoned that if the plot was going to be so predictable, the book couldn't possibly be Danielle Steel's "Number One Bestseller" as the cover proclaims...seems like I have a grave misconception regarding the criteria needed to make a book a "bestseller".  The major flaw of this novel is that it desperately lacks imagination. Even the main characters themselves and their situations are mirror images of each other. Faith is sweet and caring, has two daughters who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving her feeling lonely and sad. Her husband is cold, unreligious and gives her no attention.  Brad is sweet and caring, has two sons who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving him feeling lonely and sad. His wife is cold, unreligious and gives him no attention. Even Faith's "deep dark secret" is too unoriginal, and it is revealed to the reader at the very early stages of the book, leaving no room for curiosity and suspense.  Halfway through the book, I was so bored that I considered giving up reading it altogether. However I kept pushing on, praying that some twist to the plot would miraculously materialize somewhere, to at least make reading Answered Prayers worthwhile... Unlike Faith however, my prayers remained unanswered... It's going to require a lot of will power to attempt reading a Danielle Steel novel again...  
 but this one I had no trouble parting with.  I purchased this book shortly after it was released, long before General Clark made his bid for the Democratic nomination.  I've tried to complete it twice, but cannot bear to finish it.   It's just too much celebration of General Clark and not enough discussion of events in  his life or the the context of those events.  It's a dissapointment , because General Clark is obviously intelligent, and has the resume to provide an interesting read 
 This live album/in-studio acoustic EP is hard to figure. Most of the live stuff is selected from BLS's "Stronger Than Death" album, which wasn't all that great to begin with. The only good thing being; that album was so poorly mixed that live versions of "All For You" and "13 Years Of Grief" sound much better and immediate than their studio counterparts. A new heavier version of "No More Tears" tries to please, but fails by showing Zakk Wylde's gruff vocals don't always work. Unexpectedly, the bonus acoustic EP is the far better attraction. "Like A Bird" is the best song Neil Young never wrote and "Blood In The Well" shows Zakk's soloing chops in full form. BLS needed some better songs before doing a live record. End of story 
 It is a shame that even though it was advertised, the hebrew text is missin 
 I had to read this book in ninth grade honors English.  I thought the book was one more the more profound wastes of time I had ever expended when I was done.  Now that I'm in college however, I do not despise the book as much.  I still feel that it is of very little value.  Had the author been white and not helped along by Ophra, this work would be largely unnoticed.  It's just another story about how someone had a rough life... with nothing to differentiate it from all of the other books like it.  The reason I have rated it so low is because it seemed to be an agenda setting work.  Maya Angelou is black and has used this book to help push her liberal agenda.  Again - if Maya Angelou was white and was not well liked by Ophra, the book would have flopped.  I would not recommend this at all... especially if you are a conservative.  
 This book is unbelievable in that it takes seriously the demented ravings of a very mentally ill woman (Anna Anderson) and her equally disturbed husband, John Manahan. The book is completely biased and one-sided in favor of Anderson's claim that she is Grand Duchess Anastasia. The author treats his subject with deference and reverence, even when she is acting like a madwoman, which is most of the time. In a restaurant, Anderson demands coffee: "I want coffee!". Her poor, long-suffering husband gently tells her she can't have coffee , if she does she will be up all night. "I want coffee"! she shrieks, like a spoiled child. The author Lovell, says to Manahan, if the Grand Duchess wants coffee, then coffee she will have. He is quite in thrall to the bizarre woman he believes is royalty He believes her claim that the Grand Duchesses, their mother Alexandra, and their father Nicolas, were gang-raped. He believes there was a secret FIFTH Romanov daughter. He believes that Anna Anderson is Anastasia, and that anyone who thinks she is not is involved in a vast conspiracy to retain political power and gain access to the Romanov millions which are secreted away in some bank, somewhere. Lovell reminds me of people who insist that Bigfoot exists, that Elvis is alive, that a sea-monster lives in Loch Ness. There is no proof of any of that. Just as that there is no actual PROOF that Anna Anderson was Anastasia. There never was. You had to take her story on faith. That's all her followers can really offer in the way of proving she was of royal birth; faith. Here's something else that is disturbing about this book, and the other Anastasia book by Peter Kurth (also a devout believer in Anderson); Anderson and Manahan are portrayed in both books as harmless eccentrics, when in fact they were both dangerously mentally-ill. They both were what is known today as "hoarders"; their home and property was a health hazard due to the immense piles of junk and garbage they had accumulated. Anderson was a hoarder of ANIMALS; she had dozens of cats, and when one died she would cremate it in the fireplace. These two needed to be committed to a mental institution, but due to Manahan's money they occasionally would be given a warning to clean up the property or else, and that would be the end of it. Their property would be cleaned up a bit, then go right back to where it was. Anderson and Manahan were quite simply, two unbearable, insufferable people who were both paranoid and irrational. Both this book and Peter Kurth's "Anastasia; The Riddle of Anna Anderson" attempt to throw a smoke screen over the reader's eyes as to the reality of what Anderson really was. But the evidence can't be refuted. Anderson could never PROVE she was Anastasis. But the DNA evidence PROVED that she wasn't. Case closed. End of "fairy tale"

 I'm a BIO major and this book must be the worst text I've been required to read.   Seems to be a giant collection of facts, somewhat organized into chapters and extremely difficult to read and follow.   If you have to read this text, be sure that your instructor explains it clearly or else you're screwed!   I'd give it a 1/2 star but 1 is the lowest this system allows 
 I will preface the review that I believe most of the tenets of "Peak Oil" and related arguments.  I picked up this book after seeing it in a side-bar banner add on a popular peak oil forum.  I was disappointed as soon as I started reading.  my main comments on the book are 1)  The book doesn't offer any new data on the topic, but instead gives a rehash of peak oil along with some alarmist consequences 2)  The book doesn't offer any tenable strategies to survive the author's "power down" scenario.  Kunstler in his book "Long Emergency" gives more meat here (though still not too much). 3)  The author gets sidetracked in a conspiracy theory discussion on Bush, the Iraq war, and various other ills of the military-industrial complex.  Generally I think these types of theories don't add a lot to the discourse, and was annoyed to see "Bush is Bad" references sprinkled throughout.  Bottom line is: not terrible, but not worth $10 
 First off, I subscribed to this magazine for a couple of years, and enjoyed it. But the "main guy" Robert Kennedy, is someone who offends me both personally and politically. He assumes that every girl/women reading that magazine is tiny. For his information, some of us work out 5-6 days a week and eat well, and are still heavy-set. His comments on heavy-set people are offensive, thoughtless, and sometimes even downright cruel. Nonetheless, the pictures/articles were inspiring to me, and it is a decent fitness magazine 
 A collegue of mine raved about it--she has several of the smaller model in her home and brought one in the office.  I tried it for a day, but was not convinced either way.  Then, I bought the largest model, and tried it at home.  I used it exactly as written in the instructions and put it to the "acid test".  I used it in the toilet room, closed the door, and let it sit there for 8 hours.  When I inspected the room, I could still smell what I smelled 8 hours earlier. And I so wanted it to work!  The other thing that bothers me is that it is supposed to make the odors undectable to the human nose, but even the manufacturer does not claim that it actually removes the source of the odor (as does a HEPA air filter) 
 This movie is about a nightclub owner in Cuba shortly before Castro took power and thereafter. It is too long and tries to cover too many things. As a result, it never develops any drama or tension and the characters never develop into people you understand or care about. 
 I guess I'm one of the minority who don't care for this series and set of characters. This was my first 'In Death' book and will be my last. Although nearly all of the characters were unengaging and not likeable, the heroine, Eve Dallas, was right at the top of the list: harsh, nasty, vulgar and very off-putting. And what, oh WHAT is the deal with that amazingly stupid character name Nixie Swisher??! Please 
 I began reading this book several years ago, but quit due to a nagging in me that something just wasn't right about it. Recently, I decided to give it another shot, and my husband - a Baptist minister - became my voice of reason, saying to throw the book away because she's a nut (due to her saying that people don't need their medicine for certain ailments, just prayer)Well, I decided to look into it, and lo and behold if she isn't listed as a cult... I read some articles from former members of her cult which said that she encourages people to leave their churches, friends and family to come to Remnant Fellowship out of Nashville, TN. She lures people through her seminars around the country. I'm not saying the book is all bad - the principal of eating only when hungry is a good one, just remember she is not a prophetess - as she claims - and has no background in spiritual matters 
 This is absolute offal. Not only is it a rip-off of a GOOD idea, it's not even a good rip-off. Dumb pictures, dumber captions.  Up next "Bad People"! 
 I loved the Sunday Wife.  The book had a great concept however we were lead into little clues along the way of different relationships and twists and turns...and yet nothing went further.  The focus ended up on the one SSG who got cancer and died.  The end left me very empty 
 I don't like the index in the front of the book. The headings of the units that the book is organized into are kind of cryptic. It's hard to find what you are looking for. Some of the monologue selections would be poor choices for contest or auditions. They wouldn't appeal to every kind of judge or director. There still are some great pieces though, so I had to give it 2 stars 
 I am the dummy for purchasing this book online. Should have gone to a book store and previewed it first. It tells you nothig of what Webtv can really do.No infomation on Word Processing, making tables, and many other tricks  that I have learned.I wish I could get my money back.Buyer BewareJoan  Simpso 
 I will not be passing it on to a friend.  The ending left me irritated; why should I close a book with questions in my head?  I will not buy another Picoult book.  I felt "snookered" by Keeping Faith and now I have been fooled twice.  I have to say I did enjoy the book up until the ending, but the Hannah ghost plot was unfulfilled and I was surprised to find out in the middle of the book that Ellie had short hair.  Why didn't I know that before?  Obviously, the characters would have benefited from better descriptions.  
 For somebody who was not alive in JFK's time, this seemed like a great way to get a feel for the politics and history of the 1960s.  This approach, though, gives only a few minutes, five at most, of each speech and so the  listener gets a famous highlight, but no depth of experience.  I am excited  about the primary exposure, but much more content and length is necessary  for this to be of much use to a serious fan of history or politics 
 I rarely stop reading a book in the middle of it, but I couldn't take any more of Look Homeward, Angel after Part I (about 1/3 of the way through).  It was long, rambling, and most of the passages did not add anything to the story, not even in the way of atmosphere.  I do not recommend this book 
 I went to the library with my 4 year old son and just grabbed the book. We have read Pinkerton stories and have always loved them and I didn't even look through the book or even much at the cover until that night when we settled in for night time stories. I then realized that there was a "robber" with a gun on the cover. I thought to myself, "How did I not see this before?" and by then it was too late. My son saw it and had a zillion questions so we read it. I was shocked by the content! We are very open with our son about anything he asks and I explained that yes, there are "robbers" and yes, people do get into dangerous situations like that. I felt very uncomfortable having to almost outright lie to him and tell him that, "No, noone will break into our house because we lock our doors, etc..." How else do you explain this to a 4 yo at bedtime?! We got through it and son loved the book. I thought it was very cute that Pinkerton was confused but could have done without the break in part. I feel it could have been as cute without that. Very irresponsible in a child's book, but I guess I learned a lesson to read the books before we check them out even when they are written by someone you consider "safe" 
 Truman Capote. Summer Crossing.   Before departing for Europe in 1966 to write In Cold Blood, Capote dumped this book's manuscript in the garbage, but it was salvaged by his Brooklyn apartment sitter. Too bad. The 123-page, love-gone-amiss story follows 17-year-old Grady McNeil, a bored-with-it-all New York rich bitch enjoying her first taste of freedom when her money-bag parents hop the Queen Mary for a Parisian summer and her older sister heads for the Hamptons homestead. While mumsy is in a tizzy over securing the perfect dress for Grady's debutante come out, the girl, left alone, goes on the upper-crust social equivalent of a murder spree-she gets knocked up by a petty thief and pothead who parks cars in a Broadway lot when he's not sleeping in them, and, worse, marries the low-brow slob. There's no denying Capote's talent, and there is some beautiful writing here, but overall this is a predictable and pointless mess that's nuclear fuel for the debate on the pitfalls of publishing deceased authors' unfinished works. 
 Even though I am very careful with how I use and store my pots and pans the exterior of this set scratches very easity due to normal use. I store my set in a deep drawer in my new kitchen and removing and replacing these causes the scratches. I am very disappointed in the poor exterior finish and how badly this set looks. I would not buy this set again. I sent a pot back to Meyer for their inspection and am waiting to hear from them. I will probably replace this  set very soon, but not with another Anolon product 
 This is a terrible book, written by somebody who is totally ignorant about football (please, use the proper name for the game) and seems to have decided to write a book based on secondary sources, puff pieces and ignorant oversimplifications.   It would take too long to discuss the numerous inaccuracies, exaggerations, mistakes and so forth present in this horrid tract. Just as an example, when dealing with Jewish football he never mentions the peregrinations of Israel through UEFA and Oceania (for WC qualifications). Yet this would be exactly the kind of topic to be dealt with in a book purporting to explore the intesection of 'soccer' (sic) and geopolitics.   Compare this with Kapuscinski's 'The football war' for a vastly superior and more intelligent treatment. 
 Take a look at the ingredient list. Alcohol is first, then water. This product doesn't do anything more than plain old rubbing alcohol does--except for make you about twenty bucks poorer.  Regarding some of these reviews: Smells like rubbing alcohol? Why yes, that's because it is. Stings? Yes, it's rubbing alcohol. Someone recommended a spray bottle for easier application? Well, yes, (and duh) what a better way to fly through an expensive product that would last much longer if you used cotton balls.   Unless you've got money to burn, it's just nonsense to buy this. I used it and noticed no difference between it and rubbing alcohol. Except the price 
 There soon will be published a four-page review of this book, by my hand, in the journal 'Vigiliae Christianae'.  What follows here, is the summary of that review : 	Louth's 'Maximus the Confessor' wants to provide an  introduction to the theological thinking of Maximus the Confessor, a goal  the author hopes to achieve by providing translations of some of Maximus'  major theological treatises, especially 'Ambigua ad Thomam' and 'Ambigua ad  Johannem'. 	Although both the editor of the series 'The Early Church  Fathers' and Louth himself stress the necessity of an accessible modern  translation of "key texts by the major Fathers", Louth's  translation of Maximus leaves a lot to be desired. 	First of all, his  negligent treatment of the original Greek text has been the cause of a  number of annoying mistakes in the translations.  In more than one case,  these mistakes even twist Maximus' theology in a way the Confessor himself  would not have agreed upon. 	It is hard to believe that the author of  this kind of translations has been able to provide such a sound and correct  introduction to them.  However, it goes without saying that the real  sources for further study of Maximus' thinking, i.e., the Confessor's  works, have not become more accessible by this edition.  On the contrary,  the numerous inaccuracies and definite errors in the translations might in  the future result in some strange conclusions about Maximus' theological  thinking 
 The author presents several different "methods" for sharpening a knife. They all boil down to "scrub the knife back and forth on a stone". This will produce an edge of sorts but not a very good one. He dismisses the collected wisdom of millennia of knife sharpening as "bull" without any evidence to support his claim. The author says he has "studied" and tested his methods. This mean he tries shaving with each blade until it feels right. The rest of the book is an ad for his products. Don't waste you money.  If you are interested in the actual science of sharpening with detailed instructions on how to sharpen almost anything then Leonard Lee's The Complete Guide to Sharpening is the book to read.  If you just want to sharpen you kitchen knives, send them out to a sharpening service every couple of years.(Ask at the local Chef supply store) They will use a slack belt or hollow edge sharpener to put a perfect edge on. This is impossible to do at home without a couple hundred dollars of equipment 
 Well, we finally know the identity of Deep Throat as W. Mark Felt came out of the closet yesterday and quelled the "Who Is He/She?", game.  Therefore, this book is now completely outdated, irrelevant, and not worth the effort.  This book was a wasted effort from the beginning, however, now it is not even worth the paper it is printed on 
 This book actually pokes on Henry's contemporaries and describes series of events which will eventaully lead to a horrendous headache to be suffered by the reader. On the other hand, Fielding's Tom Jones is a delight and mustn't be missed at any cost! This book is a total waste, though!  
 They tell you tha this product holds 6AA batteries, and works with the 20D's battery grip, but when I received the item it is for a completely different product and DOES NOT WORK with the 20D's BG-E2 grip.  It has the product name of CPM-E3, just as stated...but it accepts 8 AAA batteries and doesn't even come close to working with the BG-E2.  
 This book's premise is great, and I thoroughly enjoyed the first 75 pages.  We meet the two main characters and learn interesting things about their lives.  Arlette is the 'book doctor,' and the query letters that are interspersed with the action are very entertaining.  I loved reading about this side of publishing...  Then I hit the wall.  Too much discussion in the text about feelings, nothing more than feelings...I started skimming.  The dialogue started disappearing.  The query letters sent to Arlette all started sounding the same, as though the author had lost her ability to change voice.  I gave up at page 130, regretfully.  I stopped caring about the characters, but I wanted to like the book more and couldn't

 I purchased this book because the reviews seemed great.  Well I could not believe it.  There isn't a fried rice recipe, nor regular recipes like you would buy at your local chinese restaurant.  I wasn't interested in gourmet chinese cooking.  Honestly 98% of the recipes turn me off.  Don't spend your money, it is a total waste.  You're better off getting recipes on the web 
 This is a chick flick!It has more elements of a love story that action.I am very disappointed.This will never be a part of my JB collection,as I am selling it ASAP 
 Sorry, Babs.  You can't call yourself a Christian and also be so judgmental about your son or the so-called "homosexual lifestyle."  If we're throwing labels around, we might just as well call it "the heterosexual lifestyle." Gimme a break; it's 2004, lady. 
 I was very disappointed to open this book and find very bad quality illustrations. For $24 I would expect better than this. The illustrations, which are mostly stills from the movie, are about the same quality as newspaper photos from 40 years ago---very low contrast, mostly gray tones. This ruins what should have been (and sounded like) a good book. I take issue with the previous reviewer who said it has "improved scans". If this is the improvement, I'd hate to see what they looked like before. Any book about movies that features Metropolis will have far better quality stills from  the movie than this book.  Metropolis is one of my favorite films, and its influence can still be discerned today. Moreover, it is a political metaphor for class divisions that grow ever deeper in America. As long as there is a ruling class and an underclass this movie will stay relevant. Your money would be better spent on the excellent DVD of the fully restored film than for this disappointing book 
 My wife and I are great Woody Allen fans.  While we have most of his movies, this is one we missed.  Based on the high Amazon ratings, we ordered it.  What a dog of a movie!  Michael J. Fox, Dom DeLuise and the girl playing Woody's daughter stink.  Their combined horrible acting brings down the movie.  Casting Fox in this role is beyond comprehension!  His "acting" was pathedtic.  He couldn't stand still for even a few seconds in a scene.  Woody should have burned all copies since this leaves a bad taste for his other great films.  Save your money on this one.  Clearly it is Woody's Worst!  I never trust those five star ratings again 
 This is easily the worst textbook I have used in my entire college career. Its language is convoluted and extremely confusing, and its descriptions are poor at best. Had I read this textbook alone without concurrently taking a project management class, I would have been utterly confused as to what the authors are trying to convey. Thank goodness I had an excellent professor to help me delve through this monstrosity 
 maybe because I didn't like Porco. Everything was sub-par for me. Animation is definitely not as good as his later movies. Not enough weirdness, tried too much for the plot. Everything was just too ho-hum. As if he tried to carry the whole movie on Porco's shoulders. But once you got past the fact that everyone else was human and Porco was a pig there wasn't anything else there. 
 All I can say is shame on you for rushing our children into areas they are not emotionally ready for. Obvious to me that the author has never seen the "normal" effects of a teenager who had an abortion. The internal struggle and depression that "normally" follows. Where are your cartoon pictures of that? Where are the cartoon representations of the child's spirit that is dying while they seek out the "normal" pleasures this book proscribes. America wake up 
 These shoes were very cute, as I thought they would be from the pictures.  But because of the sides being so short, they were nearly impossible to keep on my feet when walking, especially when going up stairs.  I returned them after only wearing them for 1 day.. 
 I agree with a previous reviewer who found fault with the way the story was told.  There is no excitement in describing the stages.  They are just wrapped up all of a sudden.  To me, it did not seem like the author did many interviews of his own.  It seems like he just watched the Tour de France and retold what he saw on the broadcast.  His supposed "back-stories" which should be really interesting, all seem like a recap of the mini segments during the Tour broadcast that let you know more about the participants.  There is just nothing that reaches out and grabs you, and makes you want to keep reading.  I finally quit it after the poor description of the day in the Pyrenees.  That is one of the most exciting stages of the race, and the narrative was so wooden 
 Hofstede's work was and is not really helpful; perhaps fascinating for those who deal with the issues from the comfortable space of their warm home of office in a western country. For all who want to get a fundamental insight to understanding espec. Asian behavior and cultural differences, I highly recommend to start with: "The Geography of Thought : How Asians and Westerners Think Differently...and Why -- by Richard Nisbett". That's the stuff that will bring you where Hofstede could never dream to be 
 this book led me down the road of jesus' death and i thought it could have done a better job. it told too much detail about the backround of the story and i found it misleading and tiring 
 My daughter loves to learn new words/signs, however, these were not ones we used regularly, so it was not as useful as I thought 
 What happened to lyricism. I remember back in the days if you had know skill and couldn't rock a party, you got booed off stage. Now all you gotta do is call every chick a b**** and every dude a n***** and you sellin records like crazy. Now I remember NWA used to that, but they had lots of points to get across. Most of these dudes have nothin to say at all. The essence of hip hop is non existent with this trash. I swear I cant believe whats being passed for hip hop these days. Guys like him, D4L, Franchize boys, Khia, Trina and a few more southern rappers set black people back like 2 centuries. If it wasnt for other people playing these albums around me, I would'nt even know most of these crackheads exist 
 One of the other customer reviews for this book (which may have been removed by now because I have complained about it) says: "This book has been updated to include the 4.1 version, a big improvement over the old book which covered 3.0 or maybe 3.1."  But clearly, that customer was referring to the 2nd Edition of the book - this book that you are looking at is the First Edition; in other words, it IS the old book which only covers version 3.1. I know, because I just bought it for $20 and now I will throw it away and buy the 2nd Edition 
 We have watched all of the movies in this collection. Some of the movies (about 1/3) are either inaudible (hard to understand what the actors are saying) and/or skip parts (words/scenes) because the film is so old. My husband and I watched at least 3 of the movies per week, and what strikes us most is that many of the films in this "horror" collection are nowhere near the "horror" movies we watched on Saturday Matinees at the movies in the 60s. Over half belong in the "mystery" or "comedy" category. And what's with all the gorillas? Every fifth movie it seems has a gorilla in it.  These horror movies are from the 20s to the 60s and are much more tame than todays horror flicks, granted. But, come on, why should we have to sit through a movie where the quality is awful and the movie is not a horror movie?   Again, there were too many gorillas! Not that there's anything wrong with gorillas, but we prefer ghosts to gorillas. 
 A decent summary, even concise; a basic introduction to the conflagration that is referred to as the First World War.  As others have stated, this book is all three, but at the same time is superficial, pedestrian, and lacking in originality.  For example: "Since the Great War of 1914-1918 was fought on all the oceans of the world and ultimately involved belligerents from every continent, it can justifiably be termed a "world war".  But it was certainly not the first.  European powers had been fighting each other all over the globe for the previous 300 years." Those are the opening sentences in this short hardcover book of 143 (junior-sized) pages.  This book has 7 very simple maps; basically of various maps of Europe at this time, with almost nothing in detail of the battle lines of the conflict.  The author repeatedly mentions lines of defense & areas of attack, but offers no aids herein regarding maps and/or description. What you get from reading this work is not, in short, much better than what you'd get from a fairly decent encyclopedia treatment; and at least there you'd get a few color battle maps instead of the ink lines that suffice in this work.  Yes, this volume is billed as "A very short introduction"; I acknowledge that, and with the limitations that implies.  I just don't see why one would choose this selection; of, in effect, rice cakes simply because you may not be interested in having a heavy meal. My recommendation thus is to look to John Keegan or others for more value, substance, and insight concerning the "Great War". Cheers!   
 For all the things we had heard about it being a suffocation hazard at a later age, it actually had potential even in the very beginning. Our little one actually used to slide down it as the night progressed, leaving her in between the wedges by the time she would wake. We tried tightening it to her as much as possible, and she still scooted down it. After a few too many attempts of this we stopped using it altogether. Maybe our baby was just too squiggly, but honestly I just found it dangerous. I think it is a great idea, but the product needs some work. 
 Tonight I saw Mr. Chopra on television.  I was stunned at seeing a man who hardly looked healthy never mind younger or ageless!!!  Common folks, put two and two together.  Why can't he produce the effects he promises and makes you pay for such empty promises.  My Dr. friend was correct about Chopra finding a way to milk folks for tons of money!  The shocking part was the man who carries an air of such lofty spirituality displayed little spirituality on the TV.  He was not only bloated looking but so was his attitude, full of criticism for Western thought, Christianity, America's foreign policy etc.  I am not saying we are perfect or there isn't room for criticism but he was full of criticism with nothing good to say about what is worth acknowleging at the Western culture.  He had to set himself up as the one voice of enlightenment....it sells more books, healing appts, lecturers, etc.   I copied a portion of what another reviewer wrote because it shows the level of superiority in attitude and the traversty of such actions upon real dialouge, the kind of arrogance that came across by Chopra on tv tonight. Before finishing want to say,  It's ok to want to make a fortune only don't wear false spirituality to do so. In the early 70's I went to the Marharishi (?) Meditation Center in NY where they charged $200 for the mantra, the same mantra they undoubtedly recycled a billizion times, asking the initiate not to share the secret mantra!  I was so young and naive.  Then there was Baghwan (?) with the fleet of Roll Royces and a hefty bank acct. He had followers hand over the deeds to their homes for the price of enlightenment, of course they did so willing based on what they were made to believe! That guy feed into the human desire of some, to let go and feel it was ok to do whatever they want...endless sex, drugs etc...no judgment. All this done in the name of being more spiritual, enlightened than the rest of us! Chicanery comes in many forms, only in searching for the NEW often people ignore the obvious deception that is right in front of them. End  "Having worked with a large number of cancer patients through the years, following their fears and struggles, it seems like an insult to ordinary humble workers to say "Reprogram your quantum mind and get rid of the cancer". If Chopra could show one case of a person who could do this, including himself, I`d be willing to change my view of this as a condescending way to treat suffering humans who need compassion and good palliative care, not easy solutions that give the responsibility to the patient, whereas the doctor stands with no soil of the human factor on his hands. This is a travesty of the Hippocratic ideal, and will strengthen the view of alternative doctors as superficial, money-loving peddlers of false hopes. 1 star rating is inevitable, I hate to say. Luckily, there are many good sources of the same knowledge that Chopra embezzles. (Hope I haven`t been too harsh, I have no wish to attack Chopra, but I wish to strengthen a more substantial approach to the issues of aging, health and dying). 
 I am not typically a Danielle Steele fan, but I thought I would try something new and on CD to pass the time at work.  The story was just not my cup of tea.  It centered around a man named Peter who lived a life where I think you could say he was satisfied, but not necessarily happy.  The book wanted you to believe that he had compromised with his wife and her family throughout their marriage, but I never really bought that.  He went on a business trip where he meets someone whose more legitimately in a lonely marriage and within a few days of knowing each other, they fall in love.  The rest of the book deals with how that love affair affected them long term.    For me, this story just didn't do it.  
 Don't buy this book, it refers to applications written in early '90. Today it is completely a different story 
 This book is basically a compilation of different things, most of them pretty useless. In particular, all the mathematical part is in view of the recent developments of network theory, totally obsolete. It seems a better investment to buy a network theory book or a "real" sociology book 
 Disney is a joke and this movie is a joke.  I wish I could give it zero stars.  Why does Disney keep instisting on taking these dark, disturbing tales, such as Pocahontas, Alladin and the Huntchback of Notre Dame (which, by the way is really Notre Dame of Paris) and making them into cutsey kids films?  And, oh, lets give it a happy wappy, cutesy wutesy ending.  Screw that; this is a dark, sad and disturbing tale AND THAT'S THE WAY THIS STORY SHOULD BE!  What the heck story is Disney going to try to adapt as a children's film next?  The Scarlet Letter?  
 Like the heading says, this case barely fits on my new Gen 80 gig iPods, bulging at the seams and not totally covering the unit. I don't know what iPod this does fit well, but on mine, after literally hours of fiddling, it still is misshapen and awful. Nice clear cover over the screen, shame about the fit 
 Starring the star of "Shaolin Soccer" and his sidekick, this comedy spans the Pacific Ocean from Hawaii to Hong Kong.  It's the story of a man named Sing (yep, same name as the "Shaolin Soccer" hero) who is transformed after being caught in a platonic affair with the wife of a Japanese yakuza boss.  He then tames a school of unruly brats and conques the evil boss and his underlings.  The movie has some funny moments, and the last few minutes are quite funny as Sing dresses as an old woman (must be a Hong Kong celebrity of some sort), but overall it feels just stupid, pointless, and crude.  The subtitles, poorly translated and edited as always, scroll by too fast.  The computer-animated special effects bring to mind "Men in Black" and even "Roger Rabbit", and Chow's acting looks like a shadowy Jim Carrey at times, but this is pure Hong Kong trash.  Definitely not as good or memorable as "Shaolin Soccer" -- except the sexy Asian kitten from Singapore who plays the yakuza boss' wife 
 To be honest, I almost bought this book. When I have thought considered for about 2 days at home, I decided No. Here comes the comments, I don't really like the hair, I always wish to buy a book that is very comprehensive about hair modelling and perfect body modelling. In contrast, the body part which is being modelled of that character is great and quite appealing.   Bad news is, in this book, the polygonal hair is way too bad and unappealing for a game character. Unlike Kate Walker from Syberia, she has a very beautiful perspective because of the realism of her hair(very detailed) and the textures that suit her body structure. Not to say that the textures of the girl in this book is bad, but it looks like a tattoo clumped to her naked torso and legs. Looks so unreal !  And the other things is that, the functions were mostly based on 3DsMax 3, and the functions are slightly different from 3DsMax 4. Just beware of that. 
 If you have read these in the paper you are no doubt aware that Family Circus is trite and vapid. But if you think that this book somehow contains the jems that you somehow missed, please don't be fooled. I picked this up at a friends house after asking myself "why would sombody buy this?". The answer is This is the most undesirable gift to ever grace a white elephant gift exchange. If you want to see everybody scramble to get rid of a gift, just throw this waste of paper in the mix, but please don't buy it yourself 
 Whenever you want find something from the book, chances are you can't find it. Moreover, some chapter go to too details while others not enough. Would not recommend to buy if you do want learn Verilog 
 I don't know about anyone else, but this book, with it's constant reviewing of past events just made me more sad than inspired to create art.   I am a painter, not a writer...so forcing myself to write all of the time just wasted valuable practice time. ( I also work full time and have a busy spouse that I like to spend time with) so every precious second that i can spend on my art I grab up.   I guess, for pepole who are in emotional distress, this book can teach you how to use art as a thereputic tool for recovery and self esteem. That is fine. For busy, self motivated artists who already enjoy making art...this book isn't going to deliver those fun moments of "get-up-off-your-behind" inspiration. For an energetic, get moving to make art book, read Danny Gregory's "the creative licence" instead.   In conclusion, this book has a lot to offer pepole who have had a troubled past and are working through a lot of anger and sadness, but that wasn't me. I just wanted to make art 
 I very much enjoyed the movie "Smoke Signals", which was based on Sherman Alexie's "The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven", so it was with substantial anticipation I sat down to read "Indian Killer" as part of a book club selecton.  Right away the language was easy and light, and the first few chapters flew by quickly. However, it soon became evident that the story and the writing in general would not hold its appeal for me.  It is set up as a typical "who-dunnit" albeit with an Indian flair.  We are treated to lots of stereotypical "observations" about Indians and about Whites, all from the other's viewpoint.  There is a desperate attempt to portray political incorrectness; however, it more or less boils down to a meaningless shouting match between people who have in some way been wronged. And the solution to the mystery is a complete let-down. All that for this???  I found various historical tidbits and descriptions of customs interesting; however, I often found myself questioning the amount of objectivity in certain factual-sounding statements. This became especially evident after a certain description of a neighborhood in Seattle mainly inhabited by Scandinavians.  The narrator explains the lack of trees in this neighborhood as a direct result of these Scandinavians' wish to emulate the "monotonous flat landscape of their homelands" and thus they proceded to cut down all the trees. Well, I can hardly think of a more inaccurate way to describe the mountainous and forrested countries of Sweden and Norway... After such a blunder, I became perhaps overly sceptical of the remainder of the story.  From the reviews it seems as if most people agree this is not Alexie's best book, and that his first work is far superior.  I will therefore conclude that I need to read another of his books to appreciate his writing and popularity, and all I can offer is that if you are reading Sherman Alexie for the first time, this is defintely not a recommended start. 
 I purchased the Deni 6000 without reading the reviews. What a dummy! It is too noisy. You have to hold it down or it will vibrate off the counter. It gives you shaved ice not chunks or lumps. I guess I purchased it because it was the right price. I now own the Waring professional ice crusher 
 This was a difficult book to read. The author had a tendancy to switch between scenes. No space, no line, no star. While this may work for Thomas Pynchon, it just made this book unpleasant to read. Besides this, the characters were a bit flat. I didn't like Druss much at all. I pictured him the entire time as a dwarf. The first half of the book I did not enjoy the plot much at all. Near the second half of the book the author hit his stride and reading was easy and fun. That's why I gave it two stars instead of one.  The end was predictable. Well, predictable except for the way the author pulled solutions for everyone's problems out of his posterior. The stuff at the end just felt like the author lost momentum and made up a way to tie off all the plot lines. Very unsatisfying. I know I won't continue this series 
 I had originally tried the Isotonic Ultra Contour pillow and wanted a cheaper version of that pillow so I decided to try this.   The description certainly made it seem as if this would be a worthy runner up to the Isotonic memory foam pillow. Boy, was I wrong. This pillow is extremely firm, to the point that it hurt to even sleep on. I didn't feel that it contoured to anything! It also seemed to build up heat. The overall experience was terrible. In fact, I woke up in the middle of the first night of having it and went and packed it up for return. If you are looking for a rock hard pillow, this is great I guess but if you are looking for something along the lines of the fantastic Tempurpedic pillow (or Isotonic) do spend the money and get those instead. The difference is astounding 
 I am a Liz Phair from the "Exile" era, and unlike many old-time fans, I've followed her every step of the way and taken the stops, starts and turns in stride.  I didn't even mind her self-titled album, which I found unchallenging but still catchy.  I continued supporting her, even traveling long distances to see her on a couple of occasions.  Sadly, I'm afraid it may be all over after this CD.  I ignored the advance publicity for the album, intent on making up my own mind.  And even then, I held off judgment, assuming the CD would grow on me--because it certainly didn't do a thing for me at first (or second, or third, or...) listen.  Today, I discovered the CD in a stack of rarely-played disks, and I realized I hadn't listened to it in ages.  So, I put it on to give it another try, hoping I'd missed something the first time around.  But I was again sadly disappointed.  There is little to like about this album, regardless of whether you're a fan of Liz's or not.  It doesn't have the pop elements that soured some on the last album, and that's exactly the problem.  This is bland, faceless music with no personality at all.  Were it not Liz singing, I'd not listen to it more than once, and I don't know how many more times I will, anyway.    If I wanted Sheryl Crow, I'd buy Sheryl Crow.  But this isn't even good Sheryl Crow, which is a really sad statement.  I may give Liz one more chance, but if her next offering isn't WAY better than this, then I'll definitely be giving up for good.  And I never thought I'd say that about her.  What a drag 
        This book was tiresome reading at times, with many mathematical tables of which were put in the book to provide an alibi for whomever might disagree with the man and how he came to the conclusions he had done. I must agree with one of the reviwers of this book --- " Who cares?". I mean ultimately, it will be the readers themselves that will judge what exactly was the greatest and productive findings in history.   The Techonologically inclined will say that Science is the master of all that is and the more liberal arts type will insist that the Arts is what defines a culture. The fact is that both do because both hold a sea-saw effect, without imagination there is no science and without science there is no reason for a human being to think beyond what reality tells him to be so. It is science that produces better paints, better materials that lets the Artist craft and produce --- so why pit them against eachother?    It is that point that I will give this particular book 2 stars, as well as the way it was made. The side notes in a terrible headache making Blue with white type was a horrible idea. The reading was very drawn out and I've read better on far more drier  material.  The fact the guy took a good few years of his life to do this seems kind of odd, and I question it --- one should wonder, why? Somone could have made the arguement that the West had a far more promenint mark on the world in far fewer pages and time then this particular author has done. 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 This was the first Hard Case publication book that I have tried.  It won't be the last, but I was hardly impressed with King's story.    I don't so much mind having a story with no ending (I got the point even without the author's afterword that was obviously meant to propitiate his regular readers who he correctly feared would be disappointed by this latest work), but couldn't King have given more of a mystery?  That is, after all, what is expected of a crime-mystery book.  I can't believe that I was asking too much.  Instead, I was treated to 178 pages of "Welcome to Maine!"   
 Don't buy this dvd. While the exercises are good, the dvd has been poorly planned. When you access the menu, you have the choice of going into the yoga or baby massage section. When you go into the yoga section, it automatically launches the introduction & preamble. Every single time. And it is not short-perhaps five minutes long.   Apparently developed by a mother. But, what kind of child does she have? When the babies are asleep, every personal minute counts. We don't have time to watch an intro every single time. And if the babies are with us while we do the same the dvd, same problem. The only question is who will get bored first, the mother or the baby 
 America was formed by Dan Peek, Dewey Bunnel and Gerry Beckley, three US military brats living in London. America generally sounds like either a third rate Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young or Barclay James Harvest (who were all ready a second rate Moody Blues) without any new ideas of their own. This 1975 compliation does however have the advantage of collecting all of their hits without wading through some of the painful filler on their individual albums 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 This book 4 Days in Eternity, by Wayne Marentette was OK at best. I highly recommend Psychic Gifts by Tiffany Snow ISBN number 0972962301, if you are seeking a book with "Substance" that goes much deeper. 4 Days seemed like an eternity when I was reading it, drags on 
 Eugene O'Neill's play "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a Pulitzer award winning, autobiographical play about his family. I must admit that though Eugene O'Neill is considered by some to be the father of American Theater, I did not enjoy reading this play. The Tyrone family's insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read. I also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension O'Neill offered no conclusion. The day in the life of the Tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends. No happy ending, no hope for the future, just despair. "Long Day's Journey Into Night" is a wholly depressing read that I really could have done without. However, after learning more about Eugene O'Neill's background, and the extent to which the play is based on his life, I began to have a greater appreciation for this play. O'Neill did lead a very hard life, therefore the frustration and despair I felt while reading this play demonstrates O'Neill's talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner. While O'Neill's depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending, it was appropriate for the play as Eugene's own family never got a happy ending. I did like the clever way O'Neill showed the Tyrone family's desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue. At the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal, loving family. The audience soon however, gets the suspicion that something isn't quite right, and that the family is tense. Slowly the family's skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members, but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up. Thus showing that no matter how hard the Tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well, their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth. Although I still believe "Long Day's Journey Into Night" to be thoroughly disheartening to read, the reader's emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to O'Neill's exceptional writing.  
 Although I was thrilled to see the entire Oz collection together at last, I was terribly disappointed with this edition.The print is too small and the book seems to be "all work and no play." I mean that it is so intent on getting the stories together that there is no time for little things that make children's books good, i.e. pictures. The binding is rather cheap looking and the page quality is see through.Save your money and buy a good hardcover collection 
 This is one of the worst books I've read!  It was poorly written, (lot's of type-o's).  I also did not like the authors writting style.  (he jumps around topics too much).  I have read a lot of IT Books this last year and a half(over 50) and this is the first book I came across that I had to write a review about.  I caution you if thinking about buying this book.  The book I am reading now is Data Network Design 2nd Edition (reprint by Mcgraw-Hill copyright 2000 and it says it contains select material from this book)  I don't know maybe McGraw-Hill screwed it up royally because the other reviews I've read are all high marks 
 If "Havoc" was Anne Hathaway's "all grown-up" vehicle, she needs to check the engine.  Hathaway heads up a cast of almost starlets such as Bijou Phillips and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in this drivel.  Hathaway and her friends, the "PLC" as they call themselves, are products of upper-class Palisades in California.  Bored with their seemingly bland lives, they adopt the "gangsta" mentality of the rappers they listen to and idolize.  In truth, they're nothing but a bunch of unlikeable, snot-nosed posers.  We've all encountered this type before.  You see them at the mall wearing the most expensive "Rocca" wear and and "FUBU" even though they have no clue as to who or what they are actually idolizing.  They think that they have no identity of their own, so they latch on to the nearest cultural group that they can find in hopes to be something that they are not and never will be.  In this tale, Hathaway's group has a run-in with a Latino gang.  Drawn to these outlaws, Hathaway and a few of her female friends join the gang for an all-night party.  Hathaway then returns with one of her friends (Bijou Phillips), and the two take the downward  spiral into supposed gang life.  In the end, however, something happens to them when they decide to actually join the gang.  Their actions cause a number of things to occur.  The results of those actions are status quo for their social status.  Although the film is pulled down by a lot of over-acting (Gordon-Levitt seems to have channeled Jamie Kennedy's "Malibu's Most Wanted" character, B-Rad), the real deal killer is the actions of the supposed street-tough Latino gang headed up by Freddy Rodriguez.  First of all, I'd think that a real gang would have taken out the "PLC" without flinching.  Secondly, had four "innocent" little girls actually made it into the gang's party, I'd think that they would have ended up either raped and dead or strung out on some sort of illegal substance.  Instead, Rodriguez backs off on the posers of the "PLC" and seemingly falls for Hathaway's character enough to let her and her friends live out their fantasies of being in a real gang.  Full of characters that warrant no sympathy and an overly nice street gang who allows little girls to live out a lie, "Havoc" is a dud.  Unbelievable, uneventful and definitely a rental 
 There were too many characters, disjointed plot threads, not much of a plot in the first place, and not much coverage of the overall march itself.  It focused on many obscure and unimportant characters who weren't that compelling 
 As fair as studies aids go, this one is not very good. While concise and simple, the book really lacks the aid aspect. This book is like buying a textbook and reading it. In addition, I felt it times it wasn't very useful. I would read the UCC (especially 2-207) material and feel like I wasn't any better off than when I left class. I would buy instead the Emmanuel's and/or the Emmanuel Flash Cards if you want a stronger study aid. Unlike those additions, this book lacks the useful charts and acronyms that help when you're trying to remember the series of questions to ask yourself on the exam. In essence, if you are going to buy only one guide, and you don't need a second textbook, don't buy this one. However, if you haven't been going to your first year classes this is a good book to buy 
 I LOVE Sly Stallone.  Love the man dearly, but wow, is this movie bad.  I really couldn't even make it all the way through, it was so bad.  As heralded as Stallone is as an actor, he really only made a few good movies.  The Rocky movies, Rambo movies, and Cliffhanger was pretty good.  Get Carter was an abomination 
 Before this misguided book was published, DDT was successfully reducing malaria deaths across the globe.  After it, and the subsequent ban on DDT, millions of people have suffered and died needlessly.  For example, in Sri Lanka in 1948, there were 2.8 million malaria cases and 7,300 malaria deaths. With widespread DDT use, malaria cases fell to 17 and no deaths in 1963. After DDT use was discontinued, Sri Lankan malaria cases rose to 2.5 million in the years 1968 and 1969, and the disease remains a killer in Sri Lanka today.  Carson' science is dodgy, her conclusions false and her prescriptions plain wrong.  Do not buy this boo 
 I never write in reviews but this is the worst cookbook I've ever bought.  We probably have 40 or 50.    There are only 101 recipes and 7 of them are for either rabbit or venison.  I don't know anyone who cooks either.   The index in the back is listed in page order.  I'm not making this up.  Usually you turn to the back and look up beef or chicken or whatever and it shows you the recipes for that ingredient.  When you look at the index here it gives the name of the recipe on the first page and then the 2nd page.   Don't buy this!  I'd give it a zero if I could.       
 The book starts with 112 pages of very basic information, information for the totally clueless newbie. If you have more than 3 months of investment experience or if you've read 2 beginner daytrading books or if you've surfed investment sites the last 3 months, you won't learn anything new here. The next 200 pages are references, website addresses, and stuff that belongs in a phone directory. Page 189 to page 313 is a listing of NASDAQ stocks!?!?!? All it shows is the ticker symbol, company name and which sector the company belongs to. NOTHING ELSE!!! I would have rated it zero stars if Amazon.com had such a rating. This book is all bun and no burger, I read my copy at the library (313 pages in half an hour). Leave this PoS on the shelf!!!! 
 I have to agree with the many who did not like this book. I got it from the library and tried to read it, but couldn't get past the self-indulgent writing style. It almost seems like someone was too lazy to edit this book or make it readable for the reader. Any writer can put down stream-of-consciousness thoughts, but it takes hard work and effort to edit and revise with the reader in mind. A writer should want the reader to enjoy the process of reading a book. A book is written to express oneself, but also for the reader. Without the reader, the book is nothing.  
 I was really disappointed in this book.  I do believe that many books on entrepreneurship are meant to be inspirational and therefore end up being unrealistic, and to be fair, I do think this book paints a more practical and accurate picture.  With that said, the book was very general, lacked interesting and relevant examples, and didn't add much value.  Furthermore, the book seems to be 200 pages but about 70 pages are a worthless list of universities.  The worst thing?  The authors repeatedly present italicized quotes of themselves, attempting to make their own thoughts and backgrounds seem even more important than they are.  Disappointing 
 This is the only Heinlen book ive read and it will likely be the last. The story starts out interesting enough - the human race travelling through space in a giant starship that they believe IS the whole universe. Through the course of events, the main character, Hugh, learns the real nature of the ship and futilly attempts to educate the population of his discoveries due to everyone else's religious beliefs about the ship - the universe as they know it. This is another interesting concept, however, the story is marred with dull characters  and a weak ending. I would recommend this book for children in grade school, but not for anyone who is looking for "serious" science fiction 
 Contrary to the previous review, I find that commenting on the quality of the mixing on this cd to be essential.  It has to be the sloppiest 'exhibition' of professional mixing that I've heard consigned to disc.  It just sounded like there was too much emphasis on getting as many tracks on in 70 mins, regardless of flow, or beat matching.  Very let down by this disc 
 Anyone that knows anything about Milken knows that the guy created millions of jobs, and contributed much more to society than people like James Stewart, who often act like parasites at the expense of others.  And what about Milken's life after this whole affair? I wonder what Stewart will write about in the sequel, since Milken has taken on a life of philanthropy basically unrivaled, and certainly contributes more to this country than most. Milken's creation of a liquid market for junk bonds allowed credit risk to be redistributed throughout the capital markets, effectively creating more capital, more jobs, and more wealth creation.   Anyone up and coming in IB, or looking to inform themselves of the 80's capital movement, please at least check out some other perspectives on the era.   Note: These comments don't apply to Boesky or the arbs who were doing nothing but breaking the law. I would argue a strong distinction between Milken and most of the other characters in this book 
 I am appalled that the publishers continue to pimp these books to lovers of Lillian Jackson Braun.  When you read these past few books, you are gradually disappointed more and more--and this one is the worst of the bunch.  I found the style annoying.  The book skims through the story.  It is sorely lacking in the rich details and characterizations that made the first 20 books so enjoyable.  When I finished this book--so short that it took me less than an hour and a half--I threw it across the room and into the trash.  What a waste of time and money.  There is no ending, the plot has promise--but is never explored in any quality or depth.  I think Quill should have eloped with Violet and ditched Platonic Prozac Polly and her evenings of sheer boredom. He needs a passionate affair--how long has he been in this sad relationship? The most interesting characters were ignored or forgotten.  I am done with this series.  I will just reread the first 20 and mourn what might have been.. 
 I read the entire book. That in itself keeps it from getting the worse review of one star, reserved for books so horrible I can't even finish but that is pretty much the only compliment I can give this book. This is the second Laymon book I have read (the first was Traveling Vampire Show) and his writing, to put it simply, just isn't that good. In the two books I have read it takes forever for anything worth while to happen and the dialouge is really bad. Also, I get this creepy oversexed old man feelings from his writing. It seems like he gets his rocks off writing ON EVERY PAGE about what sex thoughts the characters are thinking. Sex in a book is no big deal but do I need to read throughout the book that when a person moves "their skirt climbed up and I can see their skin....ohh man it's so nice and I am sooo hot".... That's basically the jist of his writing right there. None of the characters were particularly likable and I really didn't care or have any emotion invested in the ending at all, which ended pretty cheesy in my opinion. I put this guy in the same category I put Bently Little, the hack category. I am sure high school kids who haven't read much in their lives get kicks out of the 'naughty' writing and predictable events in the book but I think I'll go back to real suspense, horror and sci-fi authors like Philip Dick, Straub, F. Paul Wilson, CHUCK PALAHNIUK, BRET EASTON ELLIS, H. P. Lovecraft, Bradbury, Dan Simmons, McCammon and others rather than this junk. I advise you to do the same 
 I tried to listen to samples of the songs and you have them all wrong. I click on one song and get another from on the list. What gives anyway 
 Petra of all places. Supernatural protection, persecution, on ad naseum. The one drug on, and on, and on,  and on ......  Same tired story, persecution by Carpathia a lame attempt at evil incarnate and his lackies. Sorry..   I think the series denegrates Christianity rather then exalting it.   I've read all 12 and found it morose and condemning. The opposite of how I view Christianity is. 
 and that's what we got....the bird again.  Slowly paced, this story is mildly entertaining. I expected a bigger bang than what was given at the end...instead we see a blurred mythical big bird through water... It will keep your interest...but you will feel cheated by the end for wasting your time.   Rent, don't buy 
 No doubt, these lyrics and music are superb; after all, this is why I purchased this CD.  What wonderful memories!  But, this particular CD's sound quality is lifeless and dimensionless.  I didn't intend for this CD to be simply background music, as I like to become "drawn into" the recording, but that's all I can do.  What a disappointment!  I have ordered many wonderful CD's from Amazon that sound great, but felt compelled to write and warn others.   I give this CD at 5-star rating for its lyrics and music, but only a 1-star for it's sound quality.  With engineering like this, its no wonder so many would rather use free music-sharing services on the Internet rather than make a purchase 
 I live and work in China and generally love reading Chinese history, so after reading reviews here I ordered several of Spence's books.  His writing style in general focuses too much on minute details that are not interesting to me, such as poems and musings by historical characters (a lot of them!).  If you are doing research on a certain historical person it might be useful, if you are looking for a fun read this is not it 
 I downloaded a copy of this book from Itunes for my ipod. He was hard to understand. I don't think we need to know all about History. A little background information would have been enough. It was repetitive. He was abrasive and annoying. I did agree with who marketers are ignoring but these marketers aren't listening. Mainly this just kind of repeats what he has done in the past 
 This book may provide basic information for those just beginning to print their own photographs.  It will not teach them to print like a pro.  In the first 200 pages, the most erudite information I could find was and I quote, "...next, set the amount.  If you don't want a strong effect, a lower number here is best."  Really 
 This piece of Witchcrap COULD be better, ever so slightly, if they renamed it "Scottish Witchcrap: The lies and falsehoods of a Liar", and inserted inbettween everyline in bold, red text "Everything in this book is a LIE, dont believe any of it for it is ot of the truth". It would still be pretty bad, but then something in it would be true! If you dont get it I'm saying dont waste your time or money on this book 
 Educational advice from an unrepentant Weatherman/bomber of the '60s.  Not worth the trees destroyed to print it.  Avoid unless you are a rabid socialist 
 Got a free copy of *Shadow Man* and it's no surprise, for me at least, that nothing has changed in James Doss' appalling goulash of sophomoric humor, unbelieveable plotting, and comicbook characters.   There's more of that special sensibility that spews food over, "I know you are, but what am I?" The chief of police is asked if he was "discreet" about coming to a restaurant, and he says, "Yes, I came in down the chimney" and then, in case we don't get it (These are the jokes, folks!), muses that the restaurant owner doesn't get it. I laughed 'till snot got in my ears. And then, and then, there's that one other part, it's Sooooooo funny!!!!!  A woman falls in love at first sight with the hero, who of course falls back at once, at least until the scene is over. Muses she, after exchanging four or five words with him, "If only I had met this wonderful human being before I gave myself to my oaf of a husband!" But face it, every female human in Dossland falls in  love at first sight with Charlie Moon (used to be Scott Parris, but the franchise took off when Charlie got to be head cutout), who obligingly falls in love with them, not just stupid ole' lust, understand, but gut-wrenching, weeping eternal love. Just like real life. Why only last week at the market, a woman looked at me and I looked at her, perfect strangers, and we both thought, as if coincidentally, "Him/Her! The one I've always wanted. Oh my glory. My eternal love!!!! Darling!!!!!!! No wait! That one, next to him/her!"  A murder occurs to get things rolling that is so hopelessly stupid and predictable you will groan repeatedly for a good ten pages after. A woman is shot to death in a restaurant, and the restauruant owner, discovering this unfortunate incident, worries that the other diners might be upset if they see the corpse. No doubt. First thing any Doss human would think of upon noticing that one his customers had been shot right between the eyes and gotten icky brains on the walls. And the police chief to whom he expresses this emotional commonplace simply accepts it as normal. And there is some confusion because the "crack marksman" who shot her precisely between the eyes actually meant to kill a diner at another table. No, I can't explain that more clearly. Well, let me try. He was aiming at someone else and hit her as if she were the target, a perfect bull's eye.... No, I give up.  The "conclusion" of this farrago is so utterly unsatisfying that you will dread, among other things, the possibility that Doss thinks his new villian is so neato that he should be brought back in another book. The "other book" is out, and one can only hope that Doss' attention span is as mature as his sense of humor.  The popularity of these moronic novels is a sad commentary on contemporary literacy. Read Kirk Mitchell, Margaret Coel, and the master even in his failing years, Tony Hillerman. Give this crud a flush 
 this is basically a walkthrough but they dont tell you that i was dissapointed when i finally get it, but thats just me its up tu yo 
 Scanning the cover of this book, I was intrigued to read what spiritual insights the women interviewed, had to offer.  However, I did not even make it that far into the book, because I simply found the Introduction so deep and heavy.  After the author discussed her "spiritual evolution", my head began to swim.  I can empathize with the difficulty of her (the author) having to endure a spinal fusion (operation), but I'm truly confused by her response to the aftermath of this surgery.  The author writes, "I retreated from the outside world-and ultimately went deep within...For two years after, I continued to wander through Hebrew teachings, Buddhist tracts, Christian mysticism ("What's that???" I, the reader, am wondering), metaphysical philosophies, Native American prayers and Islamic poems... My reading became a feverish, almost obsessive thing.  The words of timeless "souljourners," from Hildegard of Bingen to Buddah, from Jesus to Gandhi, from Teresa of Avila to Lao Tzu, and from Socrates to Albert Einstein, brought immense relief.  "Ah, now I see...."  At this point, I, the reader, could not figure out what had suddenly become so clear to the author, that she felt the need to include the sentence, "Ah, now I see."  And I also couldn't see how one person would have the time (not to mention the interest) to read so many diverse and often highly unique sources of literature.  I stopped the book at this point, decided it was simply way too intense and New Age-like for me, and am glad I made the decision to not purchase it for my wife's upcoming birthday 
 Ok, I like to be scared.  I like good ol' traditional scary stuff!  This book was just (for the most part) weird! The tales were weird, the author comments were weird, and most of the stories were pathetic.  I mean, some of them were definitely worth the read, but it's not worth the fifteen bucks this book costs.  Used, five bucks, MAYBE, but I would strongly suggest spending your money elsewhere--I'll let you know when I run across an anthology worth fifteen bucks, but it isn't this one 
 Don't know what it is about this book, but it just didn't do anything for me. The plot is original and intriguing, but something just didn't work for me. It wasn't the characters, some of whom were likeable. It wasn't the villians, whom were quite cool--who doesn't like aliens, giant scorpion/crab/spider monsters, and derranged ape-people? I think it was the books predictability that made it a tedious read. Lumley never truly generates any real suspense or a sense of urgency, so as creative as some of the foes are, they're not terrible effective. I understand there is a sequel. Maybe I'll read that some day. If you're really into sci-fi, give it a read. It just didn't click for me. Real rating: 2-and-a-half stars 
 I thought this book would be great and was really looking forward to making some of the recipes, but I have to admit I'm disappointed with the recipes and with what I've baked from it so far.  I was surprised that so many of the recipes called for vegetable shortening instead of or in addition to butter.  I know the book itself explains that shortening is used to achieve a certain texture, but I have read in other baking books that shortening is a crutch and doesn't deliver the flavor punch of pure butter.  So I was a little skeptical, and then reading through the recipes, although they are very clearly written, there aren't a lot of extra tips on technique or anything for individual recipes.  The book already assumes a level of competence.  I made three recipes from the book: the essential chewy sugar cookie, the essential chewy chocolate chip cookie, and the Fudgy Brownies.  All three recipes tasted delicious, so I can't complain there, but the brownies came out a little tough for my tastes, and both the cookies spread too much -- way too much, and I even refrigerated the dough for the sugar cookies. I consider myself to be an intermediate baker and have made these cookies from other recipes in the past with better results, so right now I'm wondering if I should even try any more of the recipes in this book or just give up.  I think it's okay for a "base" cookie recipe book, but you would need to look elsewhere for better techniques or to tweak the ingredients 
 This book could have been an interesting novel, but that's about it. Way too many inconsistencies...like the carbon monoxide incident. Yes, carbon monoxide is an odorless gas, but the exhaust of a "Briggs and Stratton" engine is far from odorless. The fact that his daughter suffered carbon-monoxide poisoning and was rushed to the hospital, (her lips were blue), yet the firemen allowed the rest of them to remain in the house while they "aired" it out. Six hours later (after being delayed from the hospital for an hour and a half) David went to pick up his wife and daughter...YEAH RIGHT!!! As a diesel mechanic I know all too well the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning...it takes a long time to get over it. His whole mission was to reveal remote viewing to "save mankind", and can now be learned from him at $1,200 a class. What a humanitarian!!! Also his mentor and good friend, Mel Riley, is working with Lyn Buchanan instead of Mr. Morehouse. In this book 5 + 5 = 12. 
 I have always loved books by Debbie Macomber, but this one is the exception.  It seemed forced and disjointed--would not recommend at all...maybe this series should come to an end 
 LeAnn Rimes music is NOT country. She has never been country and never will be country. Her music is just crappy generic pop fluff. If you whant REAL country music try listening to Patsy Cline or Hank Williams 
 Much as I admire Judt's writing and breadth of knowledge, I'm appalled that he allowed this book to appear without source notes and bibliography, which are relegated to a website. I imagine this was a compromise he reached with the publisher to enable the publication of an overly long manuscript, but it renders the work largely useless to serious readers 
 Ms. DeMello spends too much time acting as her own apologist as she explains how she acquired "insider" status in the tattoo community while still remaining an impartial observer.  One thing I found particularly objectionable in her book was her apparent opinion, insinuated several times, that only women with "the body beautiful" should get tattoos (much less display them in public -- horrors!)  As a woman (liberated, one assumes), Ms. DeMello should know better.  This is one book which is going to end up in a used bookstore rather than in my collection 
 I suppose I was expecting something differant...more of a focus on the apartments. It just dragged on and on. I really was not interested in the individual investments of people (no matter how famous). Photos would have been nice. I was expecting a history not an book on economics and investments 
 This book is a republication of what appears to be "modern" methods of the 1950s.  By the data, illustrations, tools and materials described in this book I conclude that the republication was not updated to  the methods of the 1990s.  For example, data quoted is from 1957 through  1960, the term "vinyl" is not used and the material is not  described, and all tacking is literally done with tacks and not staples. If  you are looking for a book to understand the methods of the past, then this  is it.  But don't expect to learn about truly modern methods and materials 
 Both my children get Thrush very easy so I purchased this product to sterilize the bottles and nipples with every use. My kids still get thrush and this product is terribly messy and the bottle look horrible afterwards. If my kids keep getting thrush, obviously this product does not work 
 This book was recommended to me by so many people--and intelligent people at that!--but I was highly disappointed.  Not only is it not written well, but the ending is anti-climactic.  The dialogue is written poorly, with no real personality to it; characters' motives often go unexplained; the fantastical/magical elements of the story appear sporadically, as do the main character's special powers in the kitchen; additionally, the extensive description of the recipes bog down the plot movement.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.    
 The sheets and comforter in this set are very scratchy and stiff and you can see right through the sheets.  I would not recommend the set, very poor quality.  I don't even use the sheets on my son's bed because they seem so uncomfortable 
 I can't believe the other people giving this high marks. I love the wheel, but darn if this isn't just terrible. There isn't even a single on it; I can't believe the studio released it. Thank god I got a promotional copy and didn't have to go buy it in the store. The Catherine Wheel needs to get back together--quick 
 large storage volume: 2 GB, mp3 player sound quality is ok, but the voice recording sound is mixing lots of noise, it is not a good voice recorder, change battery very 3 hours, it is not a good power efficient player 
 I have to say that if I had it to do over again, I never would have let my son see the Fisher Price catalog and pick his Christmas present. He saw the Shake n Go racetrack and wanted it and the Mater and Lightening McQueen cars immediately. I am not so happy about it because it takes a lot to keep the race going. The cars don't go more than 3-4 turns around the race track before they have to be shaken again and then by the time the race is over, your wrist hurts. My son is only 3 and he doesn't know to shake it enough so for him, it's just not that fun. He likes it but easily gets discouraged with it when he can't make the cars go more than one lap, if that. I would NOT recommend this for 3-5 yr. olds. Maybe the older kids, but I wouldn't buy it again. I wish I could get my money back, but the box and all it's wrappings went out with the Christmas wrap to the trash. Do Not Waste Your Money 
 What really bothered me about Hudsucker Proxy: Capitalism is the wonder of the world providing food and subsidence to everyone, even Communist slaves and Fascist toady's under a democratic people; yet, Hollywood insists on blasting Corporate Culture, when the overwhelming majority of businessmen are not only honest, they are exemplary.   So much Hollywood talent and money wasted on a bad idea, so what else is new?  The Coen's have jumped the shark with this take off of the American Screwball Comedy of the 30's.  I cringed every time Jennifer Jason Leigh tried to imitate Katharine Hepburn's classic gargle.  The poor actress may have destroyed her career with this stinker.   I can't stand Tim Robbin's politics, but must admit that he is the best actor to play a fool in the movies.  He almost carries this farce.  Paul Newman; however, is collecting a check.  He's been collecting checks since the 50's.  His salad dressing stinks too.  I'm amazed at how much money the Coen's command in Hollywood on such flimsy pitches.  I loved Fargo and enjoyed The Big Lebowski (not as much as some cult fans), but this film, why did they bother? 
 I loved the idea of the Clapper. I live alone so the clapping sound wouldn't bother me and I looked forward to the convenience factor. My first Clapper lasted about 4 months and then mysteriously stopped working, but the dead unit did smell suspiciously funny - like an electrical short. Did I learn my lesson? Oh, no! I went ahead and purchased another Clapper some months later. The night before last, the lamp I connected this one to started blinking. I checked the lightbulb and it was OK. It was only went I got down close to the Clapper plugged into the outlet that I heard the dreaded sizzling sound and saw a flash of electricity. Once again the Clapper crapped out, this time in a different lamp, different outlet. Will I never learn? Thank goodness nothing happened due to the highjinks of this faulty device. Can you say "housefire"? Again, how dumb am I? Is the unit UL-approved and, if so, have any other complaints been lodged about it? How does one find this out? I like my gadgets, but "buyer beware" on this one 
 I purchased this book after it was recommended to a friend of mine. While reading it I felt as if I had found the cure for my PMS and heavy/painful periods.  I ran out and got some Natural Progesterone Cream that was recommended in the book, and started using it. Well all I can say is to proceed with caution. After using it for just a short time, I began to have a re-occurance of my depression symptoms.  I have since stopped using the cream and am slowly returning to my normal self.  When I did a net search on the side effects of too much progesterone I found many people with my same experience.  This book is very one sided, and he does not talk much about the negative aspect of using the cream. Please consult with a physician before starting this stuff on your own, or at least be aware of the possible side effects so that you can stop the cream as soon as you see them.  This book has helped many people, I guess. But I'm not one of them 
 I have read everyone of Ludlum's books and it is a disgrace that this book has his name attached to it. I struggled through the first hundred pages waiting for something well written and interesting. It never happened. I don't quit many books before they are finished, but I just couldn't stand this any more. 
 Well it seems as though staind have opted for the same verse-chorus-verse-bridge-chorus formula which made the very rich men with break the cycle. its a safe bet and provides them with yet more money, i have nothing against staind, in fact a couple of songs of dysfunction and "btc" were very good, but you do tend to get bored of the same set of songs being played in de-tuned guitars.  As soon as i heard pay to play i knew they wouldnt be repeating the success of "btc". Most of this album is dull, the title is fitting and aarons droning becomes frankly annoying after a while. songs like intro and fill me up raise the eyebrow slightly and falling down sounds like it should be on btc. the album doesnt quite grab you and its quite disturbing that a man of this age is so angry and depressed.  Maybe theyll get another album out if theyre not dropped. once again im not out to get staind this review is true 
 This book is by no means a true story! It is totally fabricated and full of lie after lie after lie. The way Jim Shutze objectifies these troubled teens as sex crazed spoiled brat murdering monsters is absurd. I think Jim Shutze is a pedophile who got his rocks off while writing a fabricated pornographic novel about a serious and sad chain events that led to death of a monster. Check out Acceptable Sacrifice: Based on a True Story of Abuse and Murder if you want to hear the real story written by a friend of The main charecter. This book is a better read and more of a true story than this piece of crap smut book will ever be 
 I was about to order it online w/out even looking through it thinking that Sofia Coppola could do no wrong.  Well apparently she can because this book was highly disappointing.   Like the reviews below me have stated, it is simply the script and some low-quality photos on plain paper.   so glad I didn't purchase it 
 Worship in Spite of the Truth.    Unfortunately in this book, Professor Frame frames his discussion of the reformed doctrine of worship with a rhetorical rubber hammer.  As such it is nothing but one big extended session of begging the question in nicey nice tones and oodles of extraneous Scripture reference. He can't see the tree, never mind the forest, for all the bugs on  the bark. But he does accomplish a few things of note.   One, he completely divorces the  term "the Westminster Standards" from its original definition, which included the Directory for Publick Worship and the Form of Church Government, along with the Confession of Faith and the Larger and Shorter Catechisms. That way he can castigate the supposed extraconfessional strictures and burden of guilt of Puritan worship on modern presbyterianism, such as the Directory which really only further sets forth the practical implementation of the elements of worship in Chapt. 21:5 of the Confession.   Two, he completely ignores the distinction of "good and necessary consequences" found in the Confession 1:6, which is critical to the presbyterian and reformed understanding of  the Second Commandment as opposed to Three, the  strictly literal take on the commandment that he advocates. All Frame can say is that the Second Commandment only forbids gross idol worship and nothing more. "(T)he second forbids the worship of and god (even the true God) by means of idols (pp.37.38)." Yet the proof texts for the Regulative Principle of Worship -  "Whatsoever is not commanded - explicitly or implicitly - in Scripture, is forbidden in the worship of God " - in Chapt. 21:1 of the Confession include the Second Commandment.   Even further, the Larger and Shorter  Shorter Catechisms on the Second Commandment are only too explicit   re. the RPW and his ommission of their statements only too obvious in his  restricting the commandment to gross image and idol worship alone. In  other  words, the  omission of good and necessary consequences is fundamental to his fundamentalist take on the Second Commandment contra the Confession and Catechisms and the subsequent omission of the commandment from his exposition of the doctrine categorically decides the question to his competence on the question. In the negative. Decidedly.  Four, he will  redefine the "circumstances concerning the worship of God. . . common to human actions and societies (WCF 1:6)" so that five, in the end his doctrine/definition of worship- he wants to substitute "applications" for the "elements" of worship - can be considered faithful "to the general rules of the word, which are always to be observed." But in that his applications seem to be only a confused  combination of circumstances and elements, the water is only further muddied.   All in all, not a bad days work for just a few little errors. Yet like those who have gone before him, Jordan and Poythress, and those who have followed him, Horne, Schlissel, Leithart and Gore, Prof. Frame merely demonstrates his incompetence to profitably discussing the confessional doctrine, never mind substituting something in its place, in that again, he can't/won't  even give us the correct confessional definition.The regulative principle of worship is the good and necessary consequences of the Second Commandment. "Whatsoever is not commanded - explicitly or implicitly - in the Scripture, is forbidden in the worship of God" as set forth in the Confession and Catechisms of the Westminster Standards.   	Even further, let the reader beware. If John Owen, a Puritan who helped  write the congregationalist version of the Westminster Assembly's  Confession of Faith ten years later in 1658, could say that all  occasions of false worship follows upon the ignorance, neglect or weariness in the exercise of true faith in divine worship (Works 5:437), it ought to be no surprise that some of those who have attacked the reformed doctrine of  worship these days on various trumped up and supposedly "covenantal" grounds, are now also attacking the doctrine of justification by faith based on the same type of shallow and superficial arguments and misrepresentations.  Frame so far, is merely part of the assault on the worship of the reformed church, while others like Schlissel  have gone on to assault the gospel of the reformed church in espousing NT Wright's gospel.    
 While it has multiple sizes, the earphones do not fit well. They also do not have clear sound coming through them, unless you press them firmly into your ear. Lots of vibration sound and actually makes it sound like they are blown 
 I recently bought this DVD and was extremely disappointed.  The sound and light quality were both awful.  The band was totally uninspired.  This live effort pales dramatically next to "Live at Budakon."  The voices are worn out, the energy is gone.  It's out of tune and the audience is minimally involved.  After watching it once - it's off to the dust bin!  (For a much better live concert - try Queen live at Wembley, Styx return to paradise - or even Journey 2001 
 I tested this out as soon as I got it and was not thrilled with the results.  The steamer barely took the wrinkles out of a satin shirt after I used almost the entire container of water.  The product might work better on cotton or a sturdier fabric.  In a pinch, if you have the time to go over the garment numerous times this item is for you.  From what I have read this is one of the best of the travel garment steamers.  Maybe my expectation were a little to high. Pros -Easy to use -price (same product at Sharper Image for lots more) Cons -Helped but didn't get all the wrinkles out 
 I can tell you this is probablt the hardest book you'll ever read. Its uses differrent language that you cannot understand. The boy Jethro talks so wierd my mom couldnt even understand. If you have this book as a book  report tell the teacher everyone who read it told you it was hard because  it really is. I have a Civil War book report due and I picked this book  because my brother read it but he's some kind of genius. So I hope this  will help you to pick another book.Unless your in Middle School or 8th  Grade this book is way to hard unless your some kind of genius 
 Before I say anything about the book, I must admit to the fact that I am not a fan of Billie Holiday's music. The only reason I read this book was that I have read three of Julia Blackburn's other books. In fact, when I checked this book out from the library I had no idea whatsoever that it was written about Billie Holiday or that it was even a biography. I was reluctant to read it after discovering the book's content and purpose but I decided to give it a try because I happen to like biographies. I must also mention that I am not a fan of Julia Blackburn's writing. The first book I read of hers did impress me but 'The Book of Colour' and 'Old Man Goya' (also a biography) bored me to death and sometimes at certain moments, they did not even make sense.  First of all, I was very disappointed in Julia Blackburn for crediting the entire work to herself giving only a handful of acknowledgements to Linda Kuehl the woman who actually interviewed a hundred or so people and gathered countless pieces of information whether or not they were useful in any way. Linda ended up committing suicide because she could not figure out a way to take the information that she had gathered and turn it all into a book. A couple decades later Julia Blackburn decided to take up the project and after reading through Linda's research all that Julia did was come up with the chapters. It wasn't that difficult and I doubt it took her more than a couple months just to "write" this book. In my opinion, she did not write this book. Linda Kuehl was not even given a place on the jacket of the book underneath or more appropriately before Julia's name. She was the one who literally put her heart and soul into the creation of this book and all she gets is a puny acknowledgment at the back of the book after the bibliography.  Secondly, the book focuses mostly on Billie's drug abuse, sexual habits, and other parts of her miserable lifestyle. I'll put it simply. Billie Holiday used drugs the way she allowed men to use her. She indulged herself recklessly without a care as to who she might be hurting (because yes there were indeed several people who actually cared about and loved her) just as her boyfriends and husbands sadistically and maliciously used her for sex, money, and career advancement. She was a pathetic excuse for a human being. She was sexualised far too young thanks to a careless, indifferent, and self-obsessed mother and the environment in which she was raised. Several accounts in this book may cause one to think that she was a shy girl when she was young however the evidence that she was a prostitute, drunk, and drug addict from her pre-teen years. She never had a childhood so when she was an actual adult she attempted to recreate her lost childhood by staying up all night, proving that she was disrespectful, discourteous and immature, and doing whatever she pleased despite the fact that people were relying on her. She turned a blind eye and allowed her name to be permanently sullied whilst her managers and nearly everyone involved with her money management stole from her, refused to pay her many debts, and forced her to live in squalor.  Thirdly, no one seems to know anything about Billie. Nearly every interview in this book was told from either a drug addict, a drunk, or senile. Bad information and blatant lies were produced as facts. Stories were told from so many different points of view that no one knows what the truth was exactly. To make matters worse half the people who talked about Billie either met her once or twice and didn't know anything about her and most likely concocted stories about her so that their names would be put in a book or continually confused Billie with other people. This was not the work of a professional.  In my opinion, Julia did not properly piece together the information she had. She herself made frequent notes that the "facts" did not make sense and were probably being confused with other events, people, etcetera. This was the work of an amateur about a naive child masquerading as a woman who allowed herself to live a miserable, pathetic excuse of a life so that she would never be alone. I have absolutely no respect for Billie Holiday after learning what she obviously intentionally subjected herself to. She was not meant to be admired. She was apparently meant to be a portrait to show our children and adults to view as someone whose example is not meant to be followed. I must thank Julia though for inspiring me to never listen to any of Billie's music for any reason whatsoever. I wouldn't want to encourage anyone I know to fall victim to Billie's lack of talent and integrity. By the way, numerous people in this book mentioned that Billie could not sing and that her voice was hollow or flat, proving my point further. Billie was a slave to alcohol, drugs and men who beat her 
 This book has its good points. If anything, it helps you put into words what you want  from a supervisor, but it is not very accurate. The online test does not account for a difference between when 2 of their options are both exactly like you, or if they don't describe you at all. This messes up the results, and it did not describe me very well. I am not just in denial. I have taken a lot of personality type tests, like the Keirsey Temperment sorter and have a pretty good idea of my strengths. So, although this book is pretty good in making you understand the importance of incouraging your strengths, it still leaves you wondering about how you fit in to their terminology.  As for using this book as a manager to better serve your employees, I'v seen it done and it does not necessarily work because the strengths spit out for people were not wholly accurate. The company I work for has done this, and most of the people who were shifted around to better serve their strengths (according to this book) are very unhappy in their new positions.  Your money can be spent better elsewhere. I say its only worth about $10 
 I was skeptical from the beginning about this movie seeing as how it was based on the ridiculous book by Barbara Branden and I must say, all my worst fears were confirmed when I viewed the movie. It could not have been worse than if it was written, produced and directed by someone who detested Rand, but then again it was. The movie portrays Rand as some kind of mind manipulator that preys on the weak and crushes them to be devoured. Rand was the most intelligent thinker of the twentieth century and her ideas challenged two thousand years of religious and cultural beliefs. The individuals involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves. Rand and the rest of us deserve better than this. This movie is on a level of depravity I can't even describe. 
 This is the intelligence level of people who like the movie: "man dude this is a must see about time we all no jesus was black not the blue eyed painting that was push out for so long like they say time will tell and the dark will turn to light and oh there still hanging black folks to this day."    I'm sure the black community is thrilled to have so many people like this as members.  
 go for Frank Stitt's Southern Table which is what a real Southern cooking book should be. This book is very pretty, but not well written. It's simply kitschy, and the recipes are not good at all. I made several things from this book, and they did not work. I would not advise buying this book. I'm sorry, but Tanya Holland is not a 'real' chef, maybe one of those many people who write cookbooks and put in pretty pictures to sell it. Just my personal opinion 
 A fan of the Notebook, I was dissapointed to see that Sparks has hit cruise control. There we no surprises here, and the depth of the characters could be measured in centimeters - especially the doctor, who is very one dimentional. I think it wouldn't have taken him that much more time to flush out the story, but, well, he didn't.  It doesn't mean I won't keep reading him, I just hope that he gets  his bearings back. So far, the Notebook is still my favorite 
 As I waded through page after page after page, I began to think of a group of Hollywood scriptwriters sitting around a table.  Each is trying to top the other by dreaming up more outlandish and depressing situations for his/her characters.    "A Fine Balance" is totally depressing, one tragedy after another all the way to the last page (601).  By the end of the book, I was convinced I was reading the screenwriters' list crammed into a novel. 
 This is junk. Since the end of the Soviet Union, it appears that "swarthy" Arabs are the new evil which the - guess what? - handsome, dedicated, sensitive-because-his-true love-died, intelligent, military-minded white guy has to single-handedly defeat and, of course, save Western Civilization from the narrow, evil-yes, "evil" again-tentacles of Islamic terrorism. And, as is the case these days in this whole genre of trashy spy novels, "Islamic" MEANS "terrorist."  And our Golden Boy does what we expect him to. This is so trashy and predictable, I feel Ludlum ought to pay us all back. Don't waste your time. 
 This is in response to reviewer Natasha Lofft's claims that she is the half-sister of Natalie Wood in the review of Gavin Lambert's "Natalie Wood: A Life," dated on May 23, 2005.    Natasha Lofft is the daughter of Maria Gurdin's first love, Captain George Zapalov and his wife Nina.  This story originated from a fantasy that Maria Gurdin, Natalie Wood's mother, harbored for years because Captain Zapalov was her first love.  Maria Gurdin first met Natasha Lofft while vacationing on the Russian River when Ms. Lofft was a teenager.  Maria Gurdin, it must be noted, was a woman who suffered mental illness and Alzheimer's for many years before she passed away.  George Zapalov had blue eyes and Maria Gurdin had green eyes.  The two of them together could not have had a brown eyed child.  Also, Nina, Natasha Lofft's real mother, had brown eyes.  How could Maria have given birth to two kids around the same time?  If Natasha Lofft wants to prove that she is truly Natalie Wood's half-sister, she should pay for a DNA test and stop wasting people's time with this fantasy 
 this book is not worth buying at all.  it seems that the author is cocky and stroking his own ego with some of his stories.  the information in this book is not useful...it's about cheating people at poker...but it is really about his stupid stories filled with inapporopriate language.  it also seems that this book could have been cut down in half if you take out all the stupid stories and repeating stories...I recommend "Gambling Scams" by Darwin Ortiz, much better and more useful 
 Oh how superior are these skeptics, these "Brights."  This book is undoubtedly flashy and clever; and yet it contains blunders of an elementary nature. Take the definition in chapter 11 of the standard scientific theory that, "human beings have developed over millions of years from less advanced forms of life, but God had no part in this process."  The last phrase is an addition by the Bright to suit his case, and is no more justified than a person of faith claiming that science can prove the existence of God.  Observations of nature are completely silent on the matter of the supernatural.  We may argue that our observations are consistent with the character of God, as a believer; or indeed that they are consistent with the absence of God, as the "skeptics" would hold.  I might find the book a little more tolerable if it was less smug, less certain of itself, indeed a little more skeptical.  As a scientist, and a believer, I am also a skeptic, and thus uncertain of most things, for who knows when new evidence will require a change in approach.  It seems that these "Brights" could exercise a little more humility and a lot more skepticism. 
 Wow...where do I begin? This book is so, unbelievably stereotypical from start to finish. With the exception of the final (and somewhat redeeming) "twist" at the end, I found the rest of the novel to be a huge waste of paper. Malladi introduces us to a "typical" South Indian Brahmin family and is quick to throw in just about every negative issue you can think of when in need to criticize Indian culture. Dowry? Check. Chauvanistic alpha males? Got that too. Caste system? Arranged marriages? Abortions? Ethnocentricity? It's all here, in a convenient package for your reference. Honestly I'm surprised Malladi didn't throw in a depraved pedophilic uncle as well, just for good measure. The story has an unlikeable protagonist in Priya, who comes across as quite pretentious. It's a little hard to believe that someone who has lived away from her country for a mere seven years begins to question little things like wearing a salwar kameez to a bazaar. I myself am a born and raised Canadian of Indian descent and when I visit my grandparents in India, I have absolutely no problem with "doing as the Romans do". Why? Because it's what is done in the country. And seeing as most people respect the values of every European and Middle Eastern nation they visit, there should be no reason why one should not respect the values of this nation as well.  Priya goes on to fight with her mother. And then her grandparents. And then her aunt. And after this, miraculously, empowers every female in the house to "rebel" against the constrained, stifling, chauvanistic, primitive culture they exist in. Did I mention it was primitive? The truth is that many (if not most) South Indian Brahmin families already have relatives married to Americans; in fact, it has reached the stage where a lot of the older generation are quite pleased to hear that their grandchildren have done so (and if not, for the most part they just accept it). Malladi insists on portraying a family that apparently exists in the Stone Ages when it comes to all the aforementioned issues.  In addition, there is minimal, if any character development at all; Priya just traverses from issue to issue without attempting to see the other side of things. She does not mix the positive with the negative, or attempt to reconcile the reader with the fact that many of the issues faced in India are eerily similar to those in the US--caste discrimation? What about racial discrimination? Malladi could have done so much with this, especially considering that (spoiler ahead) Priya's fiance is black. She could have compared discrimination faced by lower castes to, say, Nick's experiences with discrimination (and I hate to disappoint you, but it still exists). In the world painted by Malladi, the main point of contrast is the "backward" ways of South Indians with the "inclusive, modern" ways of Americans (as represented by Priya).  Now, that's not to say that the book doesn't have its fair share of laughs. I had to smile at the deference of Priya's father to her feisty mother on a few occasions. The mango recipes also added an interesting touch, as did the final revelation of Nick's ethnicity (to remind one that being American does not necessarily refer to being white, as obvious as it may seem). It's when Malladi attempts to tackle the "serious" issues that the book fails (which is, sadly, most of it).  The bottom line? If you subscribe to the views voiced by Priya and enjoy one-sided arguments, you will probably love 'The Mango Season'. I suspect that this book will not particularly appeal to second-generation Indo-Canadians (or Americans) such as myself, however, since the issues being dealt with are so cliched and do not really apply to most of us (or our extended families in India for that matter). If you have a burning desire to read a book by an Indian author however, I would probably recommend 'The Namesake' by Jhumpa Lahiri. Though it does not tackle exciting topics such as dowries and beatings, it is a poignant look at the life of a Bengali family and the issues they face. Lahiri's prose is wonderful too.  Better yet, I would recommend reading a book on Indian culture and understanding the roots of "primitive" traditions before suffering books such as 'The Mango Season'. 
 I read this book in 2002 way before the Iraq invasion seemed probable.  After reading it (and believing that I was reading thorough reporting) I supported going after the WMD in Iraq.  However, now that we've seen how Judy can manipulate facts and her proven track record with no WMD found in Iraq I strongly suggest you read this book with a skepticism to truthfulness.  Some of the non-Iraq WMD reporting was very interesting and I learned a bit from that, but how do I separate fact from fiction?  As a result of being 100% wrong in her reporting and Judy's recent comments, "the analysts, the experts and the journalists who covered them -- we were all wrong," which is not true (read John MacArthur, Ian Williams and Joby Warrick), I think this book loses its credibility.  You may want to read it just to attempt to discern fact v. fiction 
 ...and that emptiness and boredom and blankness are the only emotions which author transferred to me as his reader through the medium of his words and it feels like a disease which is called "I am one of GenXers". While being not exactly the effect the author probably aspired to achieve by his novel, it perfectly matches with the true state of lives and feelings of the people like the ones acting roles in his story. And by this, the work proves the eternal unity of the art and real life, both always creations of the creator.. 
 As others have noted, the "Charlie Brown Suite" is a ponderous, overblown arrangement of Charlie Brown tunes accompanied by orchestra and with little improvisation. Noises from the audience (squeaking chairs, etc.) are clearly audible during the quieter moments of the suite. According to the liner notes, Guaraldi's son has uncovered a lot of unissued material on reel-to-reel and other formats. The selections here are from the collection of pianist George Winston, a Guaraldi fan. I hope the remaining material, which he hopes to issue in the future, is better than this. The three tracks aside from the suite are more interesting; however, if you're looking for Peanuts music, you'd be much better off sticking with the three other Guaraldi Charlie Brown CDs currently available 
 I found the section about Allah being moon-god full of errors and deceptions. Perhaps authors doesn't know that Quran calls moon a creation of God and instructs the believers to niether worship sun nor moon. Did moon-god created moon? Given that the Aramaic word for God is Alaha, then using twisted logic of author, it could be proved that Jesus also worshiped moon god. And the Arab Christian even today address God as Allah. Are they also worshiping moon-god? (... 
    After reviewing this book I was very disappointed. The title should have been "just another picture book of a few guys bikes". The title "standard catalog" is very deceiving. The content does not even scratch the surface of the vast array of of bicycles built by Schwinn down thru the years. There are no charts of models built, no production numbers, no serial numbers, really nothing in the way of valuable information to the collector. Nothing more than pictures of a select few bicycles and some cheesy history thrown in for copy. Even my untrained eye spotted several inaccuracies in the pictures of the restored bicycles shown.    I will say that the photography is quite good and the paper quality is great. My "new" copy arrived with the binding separating and some pages coming out. This would make an excellant book to keep next to the commode in case of emergency!!!    Perhaps the next time the author decides to tackle such an undertaking, some amount of research would be in order instead of relying on the Schwinn name to sell a book. I'm not into burning books but this on comes close 
 I was looking for a book on JPEG files so I could write a program to compress jpeg files for internet use.  After reading this book I did come away with some insight on how JPEG compresssion works, however, the code examples in the book only work with JFIF JPEG files.  The book says that JFIF format is the most commonly used, but I was unable to compress many of the pictures on my computer.. 
 Reading this book ten years after it was written made it very hard to get into it. For one thing, the author still talks about the USSR and East Germany, and those countries faded away so long ago that the whole book seems dated. It's hard to suspend disbelief and imagine this book was really written far in the future. 
 Although this text does cover a wide range of safety topics, it is somewhat dated and contains a farly large number of typos.  Therefore, the reader has to be careful.  The book needs to be updated and the typographical errors corrected.  If that were to be done, it would definitely be a five star book 
 Fine cut, diamond texture whatever, it's missing the thing vital to really be popcorn salt and that is the flavor that true popcorn salt has. Slightly buttery, very strong, and always good. There;s a trend lately to re-lable regular salt as popcorn salt, this trend needs to stop 
 i felt this book was not only written horribly, but this woman just came across as immature and self centered, despite her horrible childhood. the entire time i was just annoyed by her. i felt that the whole book was just a bunch of reiterating and repeating. i DO NOT suggest this book to anyone 
 First off, I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Secondly, I have not actually read the book.  However, I have studied many religions including other Christian religions, Islam, Judaism, and Buddhism.  Also I have read the excerpts from this book provided on the main website.  That gave me enough information to know that most of the information is false or has been twisted to provide a pejorative view point on the church.  As far as I can tell the book doesn't mention the fact that the children are being taught strong moral values like honesty and chastity.  These are attributes that seem to be lost in most of the world today.  Now this does not mean that members of the church are perfect and that they don't make mistakes but at least they are trying.  Moreover, there is no sign, in the excerpts, that all of the humanitarian work that the members of the church and the church itself does every year is ever mentioned.  Well of course not we wouldn't dare paint a real picture of the church if it makes it look better than what he may believe it is.    Here is a quote from the excerpts "Over sixty thousand fully-trained, adequately financed and prepared Mormon missionaries are serving in all parts of the United States and in over 124 countries around the world."  I was one of these supposedly "fully-trained" and "adequately financed" and "prepared" missionaries.  I don't know what the author considers "fully-trained" and "prepared" but I know that I would not have considered myself fully-trained.  I served as a missionary in Mexico.  I arrived there after 8 weeks of language and teaching training.  Being a linguist I also know that 8 weeks is hardly enough time to learn a foreign language let alone teaching skills.  And the reason that the missionaries are "adequately financed" is because many of them save up money for years or their parents provide the money for the missionary.  In cases where the family is not able to provide the money for the missionary to serve then members of the local congregation also can choose to help.  So what this really comes down to is if you want to know about any religious group or any other organization why do you go to someone who is obviously biased against it.  For example, when I wanted to know about Catholicism I went to my Catholic friends.  Same thing with Lutherans, Jehovah's Witnesses, Muslims and Jews.  If you want to know the truth about something go to those people that actually know.    If you want to know about Mormonism talk to a Mormon.  You shouldn't feel any pressure to become a member of the church yourself.  But you can learn and decide for yourself if the church is a good thing or a bad thing.  As a final note I know that many people who are not members of the LDS church are happy when their children make friends with kids who are members of the LDS church.  Because more often than not those children have higher moral values than many other kids in this day and time 
 Work outside the home or stay at home mom? --there is no one right way -- It is sad that people can be so close minded to only see their side as the "right" side.  There are many types of people and situations --there can't be one right way --and not everyone has choices.  Stay at home mothers may want a voice --but believe me, most working mothers want a voice --many act as though we work for our own benefit --yes, we may benefit in some ways --but many went to work specifically to benefit our families --things such as medical benefits, a decent neighborhood, etc. In the end, some may have been fortunate enough to offer other advantages such as educational opportunities or memorable family vacations after providing the basics --- Or perhaps, the opportunity for them to know their father who is able to work near regular hours since there is another income.  For some, having the father work extensive hours and have minimal time with the kids so that the mother is home works well to meet their goals.  For other families, it does not.  For mine, we originally had no choice --a bit over 16 years ago, I went to work leaving our one year old thinking I was doing a horrible thing.  I did it because there was no other way --my husband was a Architectural Draftsman making $15k per year (no med benefits).  Because we believed me being home was the right thing, we did everything we could to be able to have me at home.  He bartended on the weekend and took his office's after work janitor job when the janitor quit --I did accounting work at home and tried coordinating waitressing eves.  In the end, I had to go to work full time, we could not make it and we needed benefits.  The world was very unsupportive of me and made me feel like a bad mother for doing this --I did not want to leave my daughter, I did not want to go to work, my husband listened to me cry at lunch each day --I did it for my family.  --That one year old is now 17.  I also have a 12 year old.  I ended up continuing to work as by the time I may have had somewhat of a limited "choice", my kids were in school and my views had changed.  My working has brought benefits to my kids, my home and my marraige.  I have a very happy marriage of 20 years.  My husband is an active parent.  Have I missed previous moments because I worked?  Yes --and that does make me sad --but I also know I have had other moments that are valuable--and my kids have had significant moments because I work --with me and others.  No matter what, I am a happy person which I feel might be the most important ingredient to a good mother.  But that is me --what works for me and my family certainly may not be the best answer for all because we are all different.  I was fortunate to find a way of life that has worked for us. -- My kids?  Very happy, well adjusted kids who I am very proud of.  A couple days ago my daughter, senior in high school was discussing this issue and said I will definitely work --I was surprised and asked her why --she said that when she sees all her friends with stay at home mothers, the mothers seem very unhappy and do less for their kids than I do --(referring to college visit/app process, driving places, spending one on one time, working together, etc.)  My response was that you have to wait and see --you don't know what choices you may have --and being able to stay at home, if only for awhile can be a very wonderful opportunity --and -certainly -not all stay at home mothers are unhappy.    There is no right answer and it is a very small and close minded person who can't understand that.  As women, as mothers, I hope some day we can support each other rather than knock each other down to make ourselves feel superior.  
 This book is tedious to read.  The help it gives is mediocure and common sense.  It basically is that inorder to combat stress you have to priotize, and choose what is important to you.  You dont need to read 12 chapters to learn this from this book.  I feel it could of been said in two chapters.  The author's other books are better, especially "Sheet Music" 
 I'm a long time fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries, and have read all the others. Unfortunately, "Hard Truth" does not live up to the quality of Ms. Barr's earlier works. It feels very contrived. It also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups. This book just does not meet the expectations I've come to expect from the series. 
 Dave Barry's Bad Habits has comedy fiction writer Dave Barry trying his hand at the non fiction market.  Although he achieved quality work in this genre with later attempts such Homes and Other Black Holes, this book was clearly just cashing in on the success of his fiction with little effort put in whatsoever.  There's lots of references to Commies which either means Barry was extremely paranoid and brainwashed by his government of the time or he is retelling the same joke over and over again throughout the book, a joke that isn't that funny the first time and is really irritating when repeated and repeated and repeated.   Barry also insists on telling us his personal stories in this book, obviously the publishers had a word in his ear with future non fiction books as these stories are hardly evident in those books but unfortunately they are here and aren't that interesting.  Dave Barry can write some really good stuff, both fiction and non fiction.  Dave Barry's Bad Habits unfortunately is not one of those occasions. 
 While the suit fits and looks great, my wife had a problem with the fact that the manufacturer placed a label on the outside of the suit.  It's really the placement that bothered her.  There is a black tag sewn into the middle of the rear seam, which from a distance, looks like one had an accident in their trunks.  Thanks, but no thanks.  These shorts are being returned 
  I've read a bunch of real estate books since I bought my first apartment building in 1975. This is a light weight book for beginners with no real examples of actual deals made by the author. That may be fine for single family houses that any amateur can buy and manage in his spare time. When it comes to buying a 25+ unit apartment building for a million dollars or more, you better know a lot more than anything in this book. The book makes references to a web sight that seems to be abandoned, making mention of upcoming events that were six months ago. 
 We bought this DVD because it was recomened in the "others who bought this product also bought" category - this Comedian can't compare to the quality of Jeff Durham's Arguing with Myself - it's a different level entirely and boring 
 I've had this thing for two weeks.  Coming from the Blackberry 8700c, this phone is a big disappointment.  Work issued this and took away the Blackberry and I'm stuck with it.  All I can do is whine on the Internet, so here it goes.   The more I use the thing the less I like it.  Here's my list, good and bad.  * Battery life - attrocious.  Use the extended battery, throw away the standard one.  Trust me.  Grade: D.  * Navigation - cumbersome.  The keys are too small, the 5-way nav with buttons get pressed accidentally.  Workable if you don't have huge hands.  Grade: B  * Windows Mobile - I hate it.  Why do applications not quit when you end them?  Instead they stay memory resident and you have to manually cancel them using the task manager.  The menu is pre-loaded with goodies to buy from Cingular, how convenient.  Grade: C+ if you bother to learn the shortcut keys.  * Java is broken, Google email doesn't work.  Maps DOES work with the new version, thankfully.  Grade: C.  * No standard headphone jack.  HELLO??  This is suppose to be an MP3 player, right?  Somebody explain to me why this is OK.  Grade: F.  * Phone quality - Grade A.  Yes, they did something right.  The phone works great, reception is great, speakerphone is great.  Bluetooth is great.   * Outlook & email - This is workable, but difficult.  You can write an email, you can edit your schedule and tasks, but it's not easy.  If Blackberry gets and "A" (and it does), Blackjack gets a C.  It doesn't synch notes, so if you're an Outlook Notes person you're just left out, sorry.  Why??  * Hardware quality - Very good, B+.  The thing really feels solidly built.  The screen is vibrant and attractive.  The camera seems to work fine, although I may use it twice per year.  In short, if you really want to get work done on your phone get a Blackberry.  If you want a phone that does a lot of things poorly but looks nice, this could be the one for you. 
 my car adapter lasted for about a week and then it broke and my case riped on the 2 day  
 to my dissapointment, not everything by the original daevid allen era gong is indispensable. this is radio gnome invisible pt. 1 with  the finest space rock lineup anyone could hope for but the final result of this album comes of sounding like a tentative rehearsal where in many places allen scats some of the songs' improvisations and their arrangement lacks coherence and development. instrumentation is limited to supporting the vocals and chants and rarely gets the opportunity to expound any ideas or feel each other out. in the end, daevid allen displays some infectious song writing ability but it appears that the new members just weren't ready to record yet. this is steve hillage's first appearance for gong but you wouldn't know it as his guitar is barely noticeable. things change remarkably for the next albums 'angels egg' and 'you' which are two of the greatest psychedelic albums ever recorded 
 I found it very hard to believe that the people that put this "greatest hits" CD for Tevin Campbell left off several if not one of his biggest hits.  The track I am referring to is "Alone with You" from the "T.E.V.I.N. Campbell" CD.  Although many of his other great tracks are present, the fact that the above noted song is missing has deterred me from purchasing this album 
 I know this play is suppose to be a classic and a master of it's genre. But if this is the best this genre can produce, this genre must be worse than "Plan 9 From Outer Space". The play is trite and cliched. It's whole meaning is that everything is meaningless. Is it just me or is that a bit ironic? Unless you have to read this play for school, don't read it. If I had gone to see this play in a theatre I would have walked out after 5 minuntes. Why can't people write good and decent plays like Shakespeare or Sophoclese. (I know I spelled them wrong, Sorry.) This new genre of pointless dialogue is, well, pointless. I wonder if all of these playwrites are writing these plays and laughing at the fools that think they are good. Beckett is probably laughing in his grave because he is still fooling people. If you like non-sense, and you like to look like you are philisophical, go ahead and read it, but don't say you weren't warned 
 My friend and I ordered each ordered copies of the paperback version of Dr. Shapiro's Picture Perfect Weight Loss Shopper's Guide.  We were both extremely disappointed.  The paperpack edition does not contain any illustrations!  This experience is unique as I have never seen such a difference between hardcover and paperback versians of any publication.  It was the illustrations along with the text that made the hardcover edition so worthwhile.  That old saying that pictures are worth a 1000 words is even more significant with Shapiro's book!  Consequently, I am returning the paperback edition and ordering a copy of the original hardcover book 
 In the history of the Oscar for the best song, I think that the winner for 2005 is, by far, the worst of the lot. How could they award such a silly song, if you may call that a song? Noisy, untuned, monotonous (as all that kind of music is, actually), with nothing to say and absolutely forgetable. I haven't seen the movie and, after listeining "It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp" (even the title is silly)I will not, even though it's in the video rental shelves getting dust all over: nobody cares for the movie. I think the members of the Academy should be a little more careful in giving the Oscar to well-deserved songs. I'm not saying that they should only celebrate Roger and Hammerstein kind of tunes, but several songs from "Brokeback Mountain", for instance, deserved - at least - to be nominated. The nomination and award to the H&F main song seems to be a bad joke against the Academy. The rest of this album simply follows the same musical (?) pattern, with the same monotony, the same silly lyrics and an absolute lack of melody. I wouln't recommend this album to anyone who likes music based on harmony, melody and meaninful lyrics since this is quite the opposite. AWFUL, from the beginning to the end 
 Despite the opinions of other reviewers on this site, this is not a well written book.  I am speaking of the Future Interests section in particular.  In order explain concepts, the book uses terms that are defined later in the chapter, and simply gives examples without clarifying.  I think the authors are capable of explaining these concepts in an understandable way, but fail to do so.  This is evident once you use the Gilberts outline written by Dukeminier, where concepts are well defined.  Perhaps this is a ploy to sell more Gilberts.  Regardless, the textbook leaves much to be desired 
 Mr. Bennett shows a sad, vindictive streak in this book, which I had not expected from him.  He acts as if the whole point of politics is to win debates, using whatever vitriol necessary to score points, with no regard  for civility or morality.  It is nice to see that for all his  liberal-bashing in this text, he found better ground in the future, for in  his book on virtues he explicitly makes the point that good, moral people  can be liberals or conservatives.   If you can ignore the rampant hatred,  he makes some decent points.  The section on drug policy is a great read,  much nicer than his assault on teacher unions when he supposedly is writing  about education.    I wouldn't really recommend this book to anyone, though  it has some positive features.  There are more open-minded and insightful  political writers out there, like Michael Lind, Richard John Neuhaus or Jim  Wallis.  Let's not confine ourselves to the angry complaints of a bureacrat  like Bennett 
 This is Nick Warren's second release for Global Underground.  I hate to be the spoiler in a perfect 5 star rating from previous reviewers...but this is by far his worst compilation under this label. Don't get me wrong, I think Nick Warren is the greatest DJ on the planet.  Even for his versatility alone.  I just never cared for this phase in his brilliant career that this album falls into...his hard techno sets.  From 1998 until 2002, he loved this genre and predominantly mixed tracks like those found on this album.  Personally I hate techno and hard techno so I am biased when it comes to compilations that are predominantly from this genre.  You may love both these dics if the opposite holds true for you. It was really difficult to give an album with Nick Warren's name on it 2 stars, but it lacks that special "Warren element" that even his other techno heavy Global Underground releases had (ie. GU011:Budapest, and GU018:Amsterdam).  Maybe what I perceive as the "Warren element" is the inclusion of some great progressive trance and progressive house tracks which are completely abscent from Global Underground 008:Brazil. Disc 1 gets 2/5 stars and Disc 2 get 3/5 stars from me. Thankfully he ultimately ditches techno by 2003...right around the release of Global Underground 024:Reykjavik.  Yeah...that's the stuff. 
 I did not like this book because:  It was too short.  It was only 60 pages.  60 pages of paper stapled in the center.  The information could be helpful to some If they had never read anything anywhere else ever about carpeting. I didn't feel like this "book" was worth the money.  I think there might be more informative resources at a more economical value for the carpet buying consumer 
  When I think of the sex pistols, I think the Monkeys did it better as a boy band. Let's face it, dears, that is all the sex pistols were: a marketing ploy. They are f-----g NSync for another generation 
 Normally I like this author's stuff, but this was not one of her better efforts. Maybe next time 
 If you are expecting the Disney's Mary Poppins, you are best making another reading selection.  Unfortunately, my expectations may have tainted my reading experience.  The book is filled with fun imaginative adventures children would enjoy.  However, Mary Poppins is stern and hard.  Her tightly guarded compassionate side does pop up during different events, but overall she treats the Bank's children with a harsh and sometimes demeaning hand 
 This CD sounds like MUZAK. It is not Argentine tango. It's not even ballroom tango, the kind danced at Arthur Murray's or Fred Astaire's. It sounds like background music. 
 This only worth reading if you enjoy reading about women peeing!  Having to pee, going to pee, talking about peeing, peeing in the ocean, peeing on the ground.  Or if you like to read about women endlessly drinking tea. Drinking herbal tea, pouring tea, making tea, putting milk in a pitcher for the tea--on and on and on--Or if you want to read about how old men can't perform in bed because their arms hurt, their ex-wives call, they're too prissy, they're too selfish--blah blah BLAH!    This book is just an endless recitation of menopausal problems, sex problems, relationship problems, bladder problems--Good God--give it a rest!  I used to like Nancy Thayer's books but this is just superficial junk. 
 The kids had fun with this, but the goo is very hard for young kids to mix without making a mess. It starts to set very quickly so its hard to get enough out of the bowl and into the molds.  It was okay, but definately not worth $25.  My 6 year old has just as much fun playing with cheap spices and a bowl of water 
 I grabbed this after getting the Raising Chickens book by the same author. Amazon reccomended this book after I purchased the raising chickens bookm and since I planned on building a coop, I figured this information, along with the raising chickens book would be enough. But, much to my dismay, this Bulletin is more of an exerpt of the book. All the same information is covered in a chapter of the book. Don't waste your money on this at all if you get the other book 
 A deluge of Irish jingoism that will drown even the most loyal Greeleyites. Pointless, plotless and clueless. Avoid at all cost 
 Like many people have repeatedly said, Bigger Faster is not a good album. 4 Non-Blondes are the epitome of a one-hit wonder band. Anyone thinking about purchasing this album needs to seriously rethink what they want to do, because the only song they'll want is "What's Up". Even that one song on repeat listens is going to get old after more than one listen. And then it starts to latch onto your brain stem and slowly kill any function your brain was capable of. It's really a dreadful song in retrospect. Linda Perry (doesn't she look like a post-op Perry Farrell?) undulates like a dying cat when she wails "Hey yay yay Yay yay yay Yaerggggghhhhh-- What's going on". It's simply grotesque. I remember that several bands in the early 90's tried their hand at this quasi Folk/Grunge conglomeration, and results were disastrous. Another one of these acts in question was Blind Melon. Sure, everyone (myself included) loved "No Rain", but if you bought the full-length album, you'd wished you hadn't 
 What idiot put together this soundtrack? It doesn't have the key songs. The mood setting songs. The good songs. How can you leave Closer or Heart's Filthy Less off this soundtrack? This sounds more like one from a sappy ass chick flick rather than a psychological thriller. Instead of NIN or David Bowie the put in Billie Holiday and Marvin Gaye. That just screams serial killer. Not saying anything bad about them, but they wouldn't be my first choice to put on the soundtrack this should have been. It's really pathetic. 
 Back in Mid-November of 2005, I tried to buy this title and for some odd reason the computer/router whatever it was wasn't able to find my address and ended up not sending me a copy though I can't complain because I did get my money back. It's puzzling to have this kind of experience. I wasn't foreign to buying things from Amazon. But now after reading several reviews I guess I should be grateful not to get one because it sounds like this particular package might be a total waste of time and money.  I love the Beatles for many reason but I'm not likely to pay 60 bucks on Ebay for the special MPI version. I might however wait for a better version that is sold at a reasonable price if Miramax or whatever studio decides to re-release A Hard Day's Night on DVD.  I hope this is helpful or atleast inciteful 
 I have read all of Galen's books, God rest his soul, but I was really disappointed with this book. It's a collection of things about how good a photographer he is. I already know he was a great photographer but what I wanted is some ideas how I could get better. After 200 pages or so, I gave up reading the rest. Some info. is useful but 90% of the 280 pages were just plain boring 
 This book is now five years old. It has no information on any Palm device likely to still be out there. A waste of money. 
 Oh, Awesome! More Cheap DVD releases from Warner Home Video containing only 3 episodes! Could it get any worst than this 
 If you enjoy being dizzy (and I don't mean with delight or excitement) then this is the book for you. It constantly is hopping you backwards and forward in time, not only that, but you are constantly hit by a slew of new characters (all peripheral and mostly unimportant) aunts, uncles, friends, sons, dentists, doctors insurance sales men...MAKE IT STOP! Enough is enough. I read this book and it would end up irritating me to the point of putting it down. I like an interesting and complex plot line as well as the next person, however, this seems self serving and written just to show you how damn clever Mr. Straub is and how stupid you the reader are for being unable, or unwilling, to follow along with this meandering and endless tale.  I normally like most things but I really hate this.  Very disappointed 
 Daniel Pipes said about this book:  "With uncommon skill, Shlaim has managed-in the confines of a very small volume with very large margins-to pack misjudgments, arrogance, and lack of sense into 1994's worst book on the Middle East."  Well, is that true?  Probably.  But just to show everyone that I am not only tolerant and soft-hearted, but generous, I'll give this book not just one, but two stars!    You see, there are plenty of facts in this small book.  In addition to the misjudgments, arrogance, and lack of sense which it does indeed abound with.  Shlaim claims that the 1973 Yom Kippur War broke the diplomatic stalemate in the region and led to peace.  He's not the only one to have said this.  But I wouldn't consider saying something like this on a dare.  I'd be laughed out of town!   Could I say with a straight face that the way to start negotiations towards peace is to launch a war of aggression against a neighbor?  No.  And just how strong is the peace between Egypt and Israel anyway?  Not very.  It is more a cease-fire than a peace, with a constant barrage of anti-Israeli propaganda from the Egyptian side.  After that, we see Shlaim explain that land-poor Israel can have territory or peace.  Really?  I think it is more reasonable for those who want peace to permit land-poor nations to buy or keep something closer to their fair share of land.  In my opinion, Israel is more likely to have both territory and peace or neither of them than one or the other.  And the author says that Israel can have territory or American support.  Again, this could well be a false choice.  Even if Israel, for some reason, can not have both American support and territory, why ought one expect it to have American support if it does not have territory?  Shlaim sums up the problem of the Arabs versus the Jews.  Security pleases the Jews.  Fairness pleases the Arabs.  I wish this were true.  Let's see.  Fairness.  Does that mean letting everyone, including Jews and Arabs, buy land throughout the region and keep it?  Does that mean a Truth and Reconciliation session or two where the Arabs can apologize for their violence and aggression against Levantine Jews?  Sounds fair to me!  Shlaim is totally out of line to pretend that it is unfair to not steal Jewish land, or that it is unfair to allow Israel to stay on the map.  As for the Oslo peace accords, Shlaim praises them as the beginning of a new era.  Plenty of people were extremely suspicious of Oslo.  Shlaim was wrong here.  And those who were suspicious of Oslo generally had the right reasons to be suspicious.  I think that ought to make us more than a little suspicious of Shlaim.  Now, what does Shlaim recommend?  It is simple.  America is simply too much in favor of Israel!  Shlaim thinks we need a more "even-handed" approach.  And that (this was written before 9/11) America ought not "bolster Israel as a strategic partner in an unwinnable war against an imaginary Islamic threat."  Wow.  Imaginary.  But unbeatable.  Shlaim really took a strong view here.  I think 9/11 showed that we're dealing with a real, not an imaginary threat.  And in the long run, why shouldn't a war in favor of truth, justice, and human rights be winnable?  I see no reason to give up without even trying.  If you want to learn about war and peace in the Middle East, try some other book 
 After killing off Gwen Stacey in the last trade arc, Bendis drops the ball with three weak story lines, starting with a truly insipid "Freaky Friday" body switch between Spider-Man and Wolverine, with Mr. Bendis stroking his ego by adding his image to apologia introductions. Next, the Human Torch still needs half a semester to get his high school diploma; no No-Prizes for correctly guessing which school he picks in this mushy tale that reads more like a Marvel After School Special. The Ultimates and Dr. Stephen Strange phone in appearances in our final story, a wordy, half-baked attempt to place Strange in the Ultimate universe. "Superstars" marks a new low in the USM trade collections. Readers on a budget and those with some standards can safely give this one a pass. 
 Rabbit Redux is by far the worst of the Rabbit series and for one reason - the character of Skeeter.  Never have I read a book where the author allowed such an annoying character to hijack his story.  What Jar Jar Binks (that annoying character who never shut up)was to Star Wars-The Phantom Menace, Skeeter was to Redux. After a while of putting up with the boring and endless rantings of this character, I began skipping pages. I hate doing that but I had no choice. I found that it didn't matter much anyway - nothing Skeeter said brought anything to this story, nor does it to the following two Rabbit books  The book was good overall, but why did Updike have to devote so much of the story to Skeeter and his mindless rantings.  
 This had some great moments: better understanding of animal behavior, the debate between different religions.  But the only way I could finish it was by speed reading.  It's claim to be a story that will make you believe in God was the most unbelievable part.  Where did that even enter into the book?  Pi was spiritual and loved God but there wasn't anything that made this survival story make you believe in God more that the next 
 The quality of all the movies is poor-comparable to or worst than VCD. I watched the first 2 dices and lost interest in the rest of the movies. It is more worthy to buy 1 good DVD movie than 50 lousy poor quality classic.  
 I really wanted to like this book. At page 60 I found myself asking, when is it going to get funny? Unfortunately it never did. Expecting some laugh-out-loud moments a la Bill Bryson or even some interesting insight like that found in Paul Theroux's work, Queenan Country, alas, provides neither.    The book is basically a diatribe on the aspects of Britain that annoy the author. In the tradition of curmudgeon literature that many, including me, find funny, Mr. Queenan certainly tries hard, but he just doesn't hit the mark. There's one passage on English literature and how generations of American students have had to suffer through untold volumes of dull, incomprehensible claptrap and I thought he was onto something. In the end, however, it comes off as bragging about a bibliography, what the author has managed to digest and check off a reading list of the world's great literary works. For someone who can't stomach classic Brit lit he's certainly read a lot of it.   In addition there are numerous references to English entertainers, authors and celebrities I've never heard of. Was this book written for a British audience?   The title is a bit misleading. Rather than recounting a pilgrimmage we're subjected to chapter after chapter of petty rants seemingly accumulated over a quarter century of visits to his wife's home country. All in all I'd have to say the book is tedious at best 
 With the exception of some pages that have been added in the back on braided rope this book is horribly outdated.  The newer section is just reprints from Sampson rope splices which are available on the web.  Unless you are restoring an old square masted sailing craft don't bother 
 Based on a true story?  If this is true then it is more horrible than being a fictional fantasy.  Did anyone witness this woman being raped?  People are just going on a murder's word that she was rape by these men.  I made two previous attempts to try to explain my point but as I started reading the other reviews I found one that explains everything I was trying to say.  One review stated the following:  I gave this 5 stars because men who rape women deserve an awful death.  Why?  When is it justifiable for a man to take revenge by killing a woman?  This movie was a fantasy and I feel sorry for a person who thinks it represent reality.  To state that anyone should have the right to take the law into his or her own hands is a crime.  To defend your self is one thing but to intentionally want to kill is simply murder.  The fictional female character (not the actor) in that story should be sent to prison for life for her alone deciding to be the Judge, Jury and Executioner.  I also despise movies where the man does the same thing.  But, it is only a movie.  I gave this movie 1 star because you have to give it one.  Yet, that one review makes my point about the majority of these kind of movies.  Movies should stick more to reality when they are doing a film about something that could happen.  If this movie really is based on a true story than it is sick. 
 Funny how people always vote a review to be "not helpful" when the reviewer expresses an opinion the voter doesn't like...  If you are a mickey d's binger who gets pissed off when people expose the fact that their food is utter garbage (or, if you are a Mc-Exec), you'll automatically hate my review or any others like mine.  But if you're here to really see what someone who hasn't been mc-brainwashed, hopefully this review will help you.   This book tells an accurate tale of the solely profit-focused means by which mcdonald's has grown into the fast food empire it is today.  Sure, it's a capitalistic wet dream.  But what this book doesn't cover is how Mickey-D's exloits workers, vales corporate profits over franchise success, and feeds people McGarbage that can't even be called food, all without being honest about its products or practices.  I'm sure devoted McEaters and McCapitalists will trounce my 1-star rating & review, but that really just proves my point.  Read this book.  But if you care to know the WHOLE story, be sure to also read something presenting another view - such as Fast Food Nation 
 I BELIEVE THE SPELLING OF THIS QUEEN'S NAME IS WRONG - ALL THE DOCUMENTS AND BOOKS I READ REFER TO HER AS    " HATSHEPSUT&quot 
 It seems as if every time I want to use the camera, the battery is dead. I find that if I charge it and try to use it the next day, I should expect very much. I'm going to purchase a new battery and see how that goes, but I shouldn't have to do so 
 First off I have to say that I learned a lot more about modern piracy on the high seas than I ever knew before.  This issue is something that needs to be dealt with before it becomes a thorn in the side of our world trade.  I must add though, that this book is so redundant that it feels as if you are reading the same page over and over again throughout each chapter.  I was not impressed and it DID NOT keep me on the edge of my seat.  Bottom line here is that yes I learned something new, but my time could have been better spent with another book or learning something else 
 I bought this cookbook expecting it to have a few fun, easy recipes for wraps that I could toss together with stuff I had around the kitchen.  Although the recipes and certainly the pictures look delicious, fun and easy they're not.  It's not uncommon for recipes to have over a dozen  ingredients.  When I want to toss together a little lunch, I don't have  time to track down 1/4 cup chopped pickled ginger or 2 cups cooked jasmine  rice or 1/4 teaspoon orange oil.  I have yet to make a single recipe from  this book, despite having owned it for over nine months 
 I recently borrowed this as an audiobook from the library because I need something to occupy my mind while I scan microfiche at work (boooorrring). I actually haven't finished this book yet, but up until what I listened to tonight, I hadn't made my mind up yet on how I felt about it. I was going to see it though, but now I'm not sure if I will.  I don't even know where to start about what I don't like about this book.  Before starting this book, Ms. Picoult should have spent a little more time researching laws and procedure regarding kidnappings, especially proceedings following such a great span of time. I'll be the first to admit that I don't know much about law, but it seems quite unrealistic that Delia's father Andrew Hopkins (or should I say Charles Matthews?) would be placed in maximum security prison in a matter of a week. I find it hard to believe that on his first day, he would get beaten and practically raped (I can't remember if he was or not). I could be wrong, but if 28 years have passed, wouldn't the statute of limitations passed, and even if they hadn't, wouldn't the mother need to press charges in order for anything to happen? And wouldn't it mean something that they were in a different state?  Now, even though everyone else seemed to love her, Delia was incredibly annoying (and the actress who read her "monologues" in the audio version was equally annoying). Women authors tend to make their female protagonists characters that supposedly have a lot of depth that usually have several men in love with her. I have seen many women in real life who pretend that they have this effect on men, but rarely ever do. It just seems like a fantasy of Picoults, and a very boring one at that. Ah, a love triangle, gee, like THAT's never been done before. One instance that sticks out is when Delia gets upset that Eric (her fiancee and her fathers attorney) doesn't tell her about a court appearing, however, Eric didn't even find out until ten minutes before it was about to happen. But, even the premise for that is questionable: would that really happen? I mean seriously!  I also hated how the book shifted "voices" -- this is not a play, I don't want to read monologues describing the same events from a different perspective. I didn't feel as though it was necessary to divide this book into several characters. I half expected a chapter to be from Sophie (Delia's four year old daughter) perspective. I could really do without the exaggerated and unrealistic jail scenes or the indian lore. I also hated how the entire book seemed to be composed of different memories or thoughts that really made no sense, and then later incorporated into the passage, also not making sense. For example, Eric narrates this dream he had about Sondra, who is some beautiful girl he imagined. She turns into a rabbit and runs into a bush. Later, Ruthann tells a story about a rabbit that shoots the sun with a bow and arrow and causes the earth to burn up. Somehow he connects the two because of the rabbit, when really they have no cohesive connection. Also, between the three childhood friends (Delia, Eric and Fitz) they talk about their memories constantly, as if that is the only thing that binds them together. Real friendships don't compromise of only discussing things that happened to them in the past... but it does in this book, because the author so desperately wants you to know that they are a really close group of friends. To me, it just seems pretentious.  What's also pretentious is the various passages that are supposed to reveal some new idea about life but really make no sense at all. One passage I remember is when Delia is talking to Fitz about memories and she suggests that maybe everyone has the same memories already in the head from when they are born, and maybe they remember things that never happened to them. I might have that a little wrong, because it's a bit confusing. It's confusing because it makes absolutely no sense. It doesn't even feel like it's remotely TRYING to make sense at all! The book is full of little things like this that just feel pseudo-intellectual, like Picoult is forcing her characters to have depth when they really want to be stereotypical.  All of the characters seem a little edgy and totally basket cases. Delia gets incredibly upset for not remembering what her life was when she was FOUR YEARS OLD. For goodness sakes woman, I have maybe 2 or 3 memories from when I was four years old or younger, and most of them don't make sense except for the fact that I know what my parents have told me. By the way she acts, you'd think she was 12 when she was kidnapped.  Also, she seems to recover memories all the time... man, I wish I could do that. It just seems a bit implausible, that's all.  The book is saturated in gooey, sappy imagery, metaphors, anecdotes, memories, subplots, and so on. I am not so quick to totally bash an author, but it's this type of pretentious writernese dribble that I loathe. If I wanted some sappy, melodramatic dimestore paperback I would have read one of those instead. I expected better from the synopsis on the back cover. Overall, and I say overall without even finishing the book (I haven't even gotten to the meth lab part with the father yet, but it sounds pretty ridiculous), that this is definitely one of the most horrible books I've ever read, bar none. Do yourself a favor and skip this one... and definitely don't pick up the audiobook. The voice actors and actresses are incredibly annoying to listen to 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
  Everything about the cover of Profoundly Disturbing - the shaky letters, the posed fright on the creased poster, the phony rating, the chapter titles mimicking credits, the dirty-looking border, and the display copy's warped cover, making it look used - fairly screams, "DON'T PAY TOP DOLLAR FOR THIS BOOK!"  (Fortunately, amazon has discounted it.)  When did paperbacks start costing $24.95?  Especially one by Joe Bob Briggs - has he abandoned his working-class supporters?  His earlier paperbacks were less than $10; even hardcover editions of Cosmic Wisdom and Iron Joe Bob weren't $20.  Why is this book's price so high?  A look inside shows where some of the cash goes.  Glossy pages that reflect the light's glare make it hard to find a comfortable reading position.  The text is split into two columns, divided and almost surrounded by red borders.  Little red movie-related symbols cross the top of each page.  Why the obsession with red?  Has Joe Bob gone Communist on us?  Movie posters introduce each chapter.  And some awful fonts are chosen for the first paragraph of, and various statements from, each chapter.  In short, style trumps substance.  Why does Joe Bob require special effects?  He IS a special effect.  Well, he was.  Here, he makes his case for the movies that most influenced public tastes and later film making, some of which are known more for promotional antics than artistic merits.  He discusses how the idea for each movie originated, summarizes the plots (revealing each ending so that if you've never seen the films, you'll not be interested now), attempts to interpret those movies that make no sense, tells why he thinks the movie is important, and goes over the careers of the key actors, directors and/or writers involved, scattering trivia throughout.  At the end of each chapter, a guide covers related movies, often repeating information from the chapter.  While competent, the writing rarely rises above standard research reporting, and often failed to maintain my interest.  For example, I took 3 breaks while reading about And God Created Woman.  Why would any red-blooded American man make Brigette Bardot boring?  In his Reservoir Dogs chapter, Joe Bob condones plagiarism.  Does it follow that he steals from other writers?  If so, who?  I thought his style and outlook were unique, but if not, I'd like to read what his victims wrote.  Citing sources is common courtesy:  copying for profit or glory is theft.  For the money, too much is missing from this book - say, about 150 pages.  The index is incomplete.  It lists only movies, ignoring all of the people involved, as well as the innovations introduced.  Maybe Joe Bob felt that his coverage of Deep Throat was getting (ahem) long, but he fails to note that Linda Lovelace's nipples are never shown in the movie.  He doesn't explain the 1969 Naked Came the Stranger hoax.  He claims that, other than Linda, Carol Conners and Harry Reems, Throat actors had no later roles:  he completely overlooks Dolly Sharp, who, as Gloria Leonard, appeared in several X-rated movies through the 1970s, including one that he mentions, The Opening of Misty Beethoven.  (She also published the glossy adult magazine High Society, and hosted an adult cable TV show in New York City.)  Deep Throat was probably Gloria's best performance, though; she subsequently refused any on-screen anal scenes.  Now that's disturbing!  Joe Bob asserts that The Texas Chain Saw Massacre introduced the chain saw as a weapon.  Not so - it was used a year earlier in Last House on the Left (granted, in self-defense).  He notes Saw's influence on metal bands, but neglects its effects on punk:  Johnny Rotten enjoyed the movie, and the first Ramones album includes a song about it.  Several more movies could have added bulk to this book, including The Birth of a Nation (1915), Birth Control and The Hand That Rocks the Cradle (both 1917), Triumph of the Will (1935), M (1951, or the 1932 German version), Night of the Living Dead (1968), A Clockwork Orange (1971), Carrie (1976 - Joe Bob mentions a 1977 movie called Ruby, also featuring Piper Laurie, which reads like a Carrie rip-off), Caligula (1980), and Basket Case (1982).  Night of the Living Dead was mentioned in early promotions of this book, but that chapter must have been cut.   The most glaring omission, though, is Joe Bob himself.  After he temporarily quit writing in 1997, he seemed to have undergone a humor removal operation.  Where is the social commentary laced with his acerbic wit?  Where are such characters as Bobo Rodriguez, Cherry Dilday, and Rhett Beavers?  Where is his uncommon wisdom, so desperately needed in this country?  Apparently, they're all in his distant past.  H. L. Mencken estimated that a good writer has about 10 years of worthwhile work before he burns out.  Perhaps, then, we're lucky that Joe Bob provided a solid 15 years of refreshing, opinionated literature.  His writing used to provoke my delightfully shocked reaction, "Did he just SAY that?"  Throughout Disturbing, I kept wondering, "Why am I still reading this?"  Film scholars might find this book interesting.  To me, Profoundly Disturbing is primarily disappointing. 
 The book is filled with good definitions about the winding road that is IVF-fertility treatment is packed with acronyms, abbreviations, and science, and the author does do a good job of explaining what all of the acronyms and abbreviations are.  The book flows well and has wit, but the constant underlying message is one of success!  IVF succeeds!  Just keep your legs in the air/take to bed rest/keep thinking smiley happy positive thoughts and it always works!  As someone who's been through a few rounds of IVF and ongoing still, it's not that easy for most people.  IVF is hard enough without infusing constant messages of false hope-I feel the author is irresponsible in suggesting that IVF can be otherwise 
 Dear Fellow Divas,  If you are searching for guides on how to tap into your true potential, reclaim your true power, and to unleash the Inner Goddess that we all have, I would recommend 3 other books.   This book, "The Modern Goddess' Guide to Life" was very disappointing and ineffective.  The 3 other books that I found much greater encouragement and truth were:  1)  "From Doormat to Diva!" by Merci Miglino.  Quick read and very practical about learning how to love and cherish ourselves.  Very helpful!  2)  "Release the Seductress Within" by Laurie Sue Brockway.  Quick read and practical.  The theme is the same (about "unleashing your inner goddess"), however, it is a more sensual and sexual book, but truthful and enlightening.  Very helpful!  The author, Laurie Sue Brockway, seems to have written the same book under a different title, "How to Seduce a Man and Keep Him Seduced".  I looked at the table of contents, and it has the same chapters and read an excerpt and it is the same excerpt as the book "Release the Seductress Within".  3)  "Dark Side of the Light Chasers" by Debbie Ford.  This is an incredible book that will change your life.  A much profounder book than the previous 2 I recommended.  The whole book is excellent, but Chapter 9 specifically deals with our Sacred Self (the Inner Goddess), b/c it encourages us to own our divinity, virtues, beauty, talents and achievements.    From Chapter 9, Debbie Ford states, "Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.  Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure....We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented fabulous?'  Actually, who are you not to be?  You are a child of God.  Your playing small does not serve the world.  There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you....And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same....not only is it okay to say nice things about ourselves, it's imperative..."    Acknowledging our good qualities is necessary in developing self-love.  I have found this to be so true in discovering the Goddess within me.  So good luck girls.  By reading these 3 other books, you will be able to 1)  Reclaim your true power, and 2)  Awaken the True Inner Goddess within 
 I was unimpressed with this book. Many in my class struggled because of the way the book was thrown together.    My main problems are the lack of explanation for key concepts, other than a reference to a cut-down case and the questionable decision to use cases that don't clearly explain the issue at hand.    I was thrown off at first when I couldn't find some of the cases in Lexis or WestLaw.  Rather than relying on an on-topic US SC case or even a Fed circuit case, some key concepts get examples that are unpublished lower-court decisions where the judge makes either the wrong decision or the right decision for the wrong rulings.  The book does not point out the error of the court when it does this.  Most of the time this happened, my professor would point out that we should ignore this case and learn the concept from a study guide or his class notes.  In an ideal BA book, the authors wouldn't try to trick students by giving them bad examples of the law (or without explaining that the examples have faulty legal logic).    If you are reading this review, you are likely either a law student or a law professor.  If you are a professor, please think twice about using this book.  If you are a student, you will have no choice in the matter.  If you find yourself struggling then read the Lexis and Westlaw briefs or get the High Court Summary for this book.  My school bookstore didn't have the HC summaries for this book, but Amazon did 
 The gist of the argument herein is that since Westerners either A) arn't Muslim or B)arn't native speakers therefore all their reporting is biased.  It is an interesting theory, and given it one must conclude that therefore the West should either A) only hire muslims to report on Muslims or B) not report on the Islamic world.  This is not however the conclusion.  Rather the conclusion is that the West becuase it is 'bad' and 'colonial' is projecting a false image of Islam everywhere it reports about it.  Let us take some examples and see what this is talking about.  The argument is that the west is always biased and always giving us the wrong view of wonderful islam.   1)  Saudi Arabia-where women cannot drive, cant vote and can be beheaded for adultery.  All this is a fact but apparently to report these facts would be biased, thus by doing so the western media encourages the unfair analysis that muslim countries discriminate against women, even though they do.  2)  Chechnya, Bosnia and Israel- in both cases the media is strongly pro-musim in the West, however this is overlooked in this case.  In a case where the media is pro-Muslim this book simply ignores the fact.  3) Afghanistan and Pakistan:  to islamist states where blasphemy is illegal, where a woman can be beaten by her husband and where a woman who is raped can be killed by her family.  WOnderful, and if the media reports these things then the media is anti-Islamic, becuase it dared to report something that might make westerners who are used to this 'colonial' idea that women are equal, wonder about Muslim societies where they are not.    The myth is clear and the argument is clear.  90% of Muslim countries have laws that discriminate against women.  For the media to report this would be wrong becuase then westerners might getthe idea 100% of Muslims discriminate against women.  Since this is the basic argument here then probably the conclusion should have been that no culture should ever be allowed to report about another culture since by doing so the one culture might be coompared to the home culture and thus it would be biased reporting.  Total nonsense.  Seth J. Frantzma 
 I just purchased the Toshiba HD-A2 HD-DVD player and I love it.  I was unpleasantly surprised when the HD side of the disc would not play on my machine.  I had already registered my player and was told my Toshiba to upgrade my firmware.  I received the firmware disc today, installed it and the disc still won't work.  The Standard DVD side works fine, but what's the point.  So I'm sending the disc back to Amazon.  Beware of these hybrid discs! Many other HD-DVD owners have had similar problems.  Happy Feet, Army of Darkness, and other hybrid discs to name a few, may not play on your Toshiba, even with the firmware update.  Recently, Universal decided to kill hybrid discs altogether for future releases and are reissuing current releases as HD-only.  I'm 99% sure this was done because of playback problems like mine.  Bravo to Universal for nipping this in the bud right away.  Besides, if I wanted to buy the standard DVD, I would have.  But I want my HD! So when Children of Men is reissued, I will buy it again.  Until then I will stay away from the Hybrid Combo DVD's until they are all discontinued and re-issued.  By the way, Children of Men was awesome in the theater...it's killing me that I can't watch it in HD yet.. 
 Melody Thomas' writing is so painfully awkward that I had a hard time getting through It Must Have Been The Moonlight.  Worst of all is her dialogue, which is an endless string of non sequiturs.  Here's an example of a paragraph that I found really annoying:  "You're a wonderful man, Michael."  He was wonderful.  Really, really wonderful, with beautiful eyes, a roguish tilt to his mouth, and she liked him a lot, maybe even fantasized about falling in love with him once too often.  "But there's nothing else between us."  She said he is wonderful; that is a quality apparently pertaining to him, Michael.  Michael's character, good or bad, is a different subject than what may or may not be between them.  She never says what actually *is* between them - she goes straight to "nothing else" - nothing else than what?  What are the opposing terms here?  She just skips between two melodramatic statements.  If some dialogue is jerky and melodramatic, fine - but the whole book is like this.  Aside from which, the attitude she expresses about her feelings in this paragraph lead to another thing I didn't like.  Brianna and Michael are poorly conceived, inconsistently portrayed characters.    Sometimes Brianna is very "wham bam thank you ma'am" with Michael, and then the next minute she'll burst into tears the second she sees or hears something to indicate that he is not 100% devoted.  I understand that people don't always feel logically, but you'd think she'd at least get herself straight about what she wants, and what she's willing to say to Michael - but she doesn't, she just does whatever will suit the drama of the moment.  Michael is the same way.  Is he a hardened and heartless agent of the crown?  Is he a nice man who likes to play with babies and talk to old ladies during his spare time?  Is he distanced from his aristocratic past and upbringing, or is he chomping at the bit to jump back into high society?  Who knows!  It depends on which page you are on.    Thomas also has a real "tell don't show" attitude about her writing.  Somebody will say something like "Brianna has an insatiable love of life and all people are drawn to her" but I never sensed that in her at all.  She didn't act it out.  Or else they'll say "Michael is a real womanizer" - but at no point in the book do we find out that he's had sex with any other woman, ever.  Their relationship progresses in the oddest fits and starts.  I think it's the "tell don't show" thing again - Thomas will *say* that there is some sort of magnetic attraction between Brianna and Michael, and then Brianna and Michael will have a conversation full of melodramatic non-sequiturs and irrelevant declarations about their romantic history or childhood, but I never *saw* the spark between them.    And there is this pretense throughout the novel that Brianna and Michael have some sort of purely physical relationship, and they need to work past that to a meeting of the souls or whatever...but this is ridiculous, too, from the very beginning neither of them thinks of their attraction purely physically and their interactions aren't particularly sexual.  Frankly, I thought this book was poorly written, trite and cliche-ridden 
 After Two Moon Junction and 91/2 Weeks I expected a lot when I watched Wild Orchid last night. Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed. I don't mean to imply the movie is totally awful or the worst movie ever made. It's not. But the movie had nothing unique about it at all and lacked a certain something. The expression "When you got it you got it" holds true to movies and "Wild Orchid" didn't have it.  It's not Mickey Rourke or Carre Otis fault. Their both attractive people who seemed to try hard with the material on hand. But the material just wasn't interesting. It lacked subtlety. The worst part of the film is the horrid, trite dialogue; 'I'm afraid if I touch you you'll disappear', 'If you want me, come and hold me right now'; you've *got* to be kidding me!! Zalman King should learn to quit while he's ahead (take a look at the Red Shoe Diaries, for example: the same story recycled multiple times, shamelessly using David Duchovney to draw viewers because it wouldn't attract a single one without him (or, at least none out of high school and not desperately looking for some late-night nudity...) This film is the same, it uses 9 1/2 Weeks, and Mickey Rourke, to draw viewers even though it can't stand on its own feet because it's so unoriginal and poorly written...never mind the acting (what was Bruce Greenwood *thinking*???)  Wild Orchid held neither the fascinating complexities and characters of "91/2 Weeks" or the dreamlike imagery and compelling mystery of "Two Moon Junction." It was just sex. It held none of the sensuality of the above mentioned. It's too bad because there was a lot of potential there. It was very much a letdown, in this case what you see is ultimately exactly what you'll get. Just don't expect anything more then that, again I wish this movie had been made differently, the main word that comes to mind when viewing wild orchid is "typical".  
 This novel is absolute dreck, at the best. I don't think I could ever pick up another Grisham novel without vomiting. Pelican Brief was Okay. But, I honestly cannot read him again, because of this.    The reason for this one star rating is this.  First, the protaganist is a stupid punk kid, who by the end of the novel you are actually hoping gets shot or SOMETHING!  Second, 496 pages filled with "blah blah blah" There wasn't enough content to constitute a five hundred page novel. Maybe one hundred, and then it would have been decent.    Third, When reading about a murder mystery with the mob involved, you would at least expect more blood-shed, or more death. Especially since this is targeted at a group that enjoys those kinds of things.   Fourth, although written at a fourth grade level no fourth grader should be allowed within three hundred feet for all the swearing that takes place. Speech and the written word, are signs of intelligence, Vulgarity is something people use when they don't know how to convey something accurately. Honestly every page has at least some.   Now you know,that unless you want your socks bored off, you shouldn't even look in the section that has Grisham in it. If you want to read something light, that's believable, not Fantasy and not Romance, read Crichton. 
 I thought the original was pretty good, but this sequel was pure torture to watch! I'de rather eat a giant roach, than watch this movie again! Without question, one of the worst comedys ever written 
 This is poetry? I know she calls it free verse or some nonsense but I don't agree that she can call this poetry. She should just call it a book of song lyrics that never made it into any songs. She could've called it a diary and it would have been fine. Poetry? I'm not so sure. Some of the poems don't make any sense. Some of them are boring. And none of them have any rhythm. I'd call this a collection of witty anecdotes or something, but not poetry. It just isn't poetry. I can't stress that enough. How does reading Bukowski give her a license to suck 
 I'm a big fan of Ms. Ely's book, Saving Dinner, so I was very excited to find her study guide for kids.  However, I was disappointed to open the box and find only 32 one-sided pages, loose with no binding at all.  Of these, only 21 pages are worksheets and parent guides--the rest are a food diary!  It's cleverly designed and kid-friendly, but not worth $8.95!  In addition, the information is heavily weighted toward identifying carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.  Good info for kids, but I was hoping to steer my picky eater toward fruits and veggies and there was little information on the their benefits.   
 If you find yourself reading a poorly written book (like this one), find something else to read.  If the ideas are good, then someone else said it some place else.... and the odds are that they said it better.  And I didn't find much of their argumentation particularly persuasive either.  They got two stars, since there is a quite a bit of information in the book.  They get that extra star for effort 
  As with most other kids I thought this book was not worth writing. While reading the description it sounded fantasticly exciting. In the beginning it actually sounded like an interesting piece of history. By the end it was one of the most boring books I've ever read. Now I have come to realize that just because a book wins the Newbery Medal does not mean that it is a good book. With 1,000 good books one book can be published because it is pollitically correct or is spewed out by a good author. I have no doubts about Elizabeth Yates but I think that Amos Fortune is a book about a man that had a good life, but one that was not nessicarily worth writing about 
 This book lacks vision and structure. First of all, there is hardly an introduction. Next, we are confronted with a calendar that lists some random things having to do with personal finance, but which is not part of any greater plan. From beginning to end we are bombarded with lists, the thought behind them remaining unclear. Finally, the appendices (7 in number, on a book less than 200 pages) look like unfinished chapters that did not fit in for some reason. For one of them, that reason is obvious: It lists several ways to BORROW money. But if you have to borrow money, why invest? Or: if you invest, why borrow money? This chapter did not fit in because it does not have anything to do with investing in the first place.   The first sentence states what this book is about: 'This book is intended to help you keep your money, whether you just have a few dollars or a few thousand.'   Indeed, this book is not so much about how to MAKE MORE money as it is about how to KEEP your money. So the emphasis is really on everything low-risk and low-profit. You get information about savings accounts, certificates of deposit and bonds, something about mutual funds, but not much information about how to pick your own stocks.      All in all not a 'high value' investment 
 This book looked promising when I purchased it-the collaboration of a photographer and writer to produce a book that gives "voice" to the cat.  I was disappointed that the reality did not live up to the promise.  The photographs were not outstanding, I have seen better in several similiar collections.  The narrative was truly disappointing.  I felt that Roy Blount Jr really has no understanding of, or true appreciation for, cats.  While he may have lived with cats in the past, and may have fond memories of some of them, the words he gave to the photographs fail to capture the essense of cats in all but one or two instances. I would highly recommend any of the willow creek books (such as "What Cats Teach Us", "Bad Kitties" or "Cat Rules" in place of this book 
 Alright, when I first got this cd, I was really excited to put into my cd player and listen to it, but when I did. I was very disapointed. I mean all it is "WRAAAA", and "ETHHHH" and "AHHHH" - - if I wanted to hear that, I'd just scream to myself. I knew they were a "screamo" band, like that can even past as a legidiment kind of alternative rock music anyway. But, that's all it was. No real lyrics, no beats, nothing. Also, I understand that some songs feel the need to say F#@! for a dramatic edge, but every song had it in it and there was no point of it emphizing a word in it anywhere, it was like they were 13 and were trying to say it in every other line, so they could impress their friends or something! I was appauled. This is not a superb album, whatsoever. I wish I could return it. Their first album, I suppose was better then this. The only song I can stand hearing is "buried a lie" -that has a ounce or so of meaning beneath the lyrics if you really try to think about it. If you're thinking about buying this cd, listen to it yourself. See what you think. This is just my opinion on this senses fail cd. 
 With all respect to Mr. Hawking - this book should never been published. I'm not blaming him, but all others who are responsible it went to market.  Let me explain a little bit  Most of buyers of this book, are buying based on Hawking reputation from "Brief history of time" (which is excellent book). What we have here - pictures which doesn't have any relation with text (at least not valuable and are far to big - taking space in other words, you'll not buy book of 60 pages for 35 USD), changing from one subject to another, explaining the basic things somebody who is reading such a book should already know (spin - 2 pages) and then jumping to complicated things (M-theory - mentioned in 1 row) without explanation. Some jokes and comments I don't understand.  I bought this book 6 months age and came to approx 1/3 of book (poker between Hawking, Newton and I think Einstein). I didn't have nerves to read more ... this is first book in my life I didn't finish.  I never thought I'll write review, especially not like this and especially not for book of Mr. Hawking, but I felt cheated. There are so many other excellent books on same thematic, try them, forget this one.  But anyway, my 3 year old son was extremely happy by disintegrating this book to more then 1000 small pages ... lucky him.   
 If you must use this book for class, save yourself a lot of headache and get Emanuel's Outline or flashcards on the subject or Gilbert's Outline.  This book is very difficult reading compared to my other other law books.  Law professors should really stay away from it 
 I give this book a 1 star not because it wasn't interesting - it certainly was, but because the ending absolutely floored me!  Aghgh**&&*(7#!!!!!  I never thought it was going to end like that - where was the justice??  I feel like something is missing.  I want to reach into the book and smack Alex! Please tell me there is a follow-up book where Sam gets what's coming to him!!! -- Oh, and Daphne too 
 My friend and I both bought this gun. We both charged it for the recommended time and it never worked. I could throw BB's with my toes faster than this if the gun worked on a good day. In ten minutes only 1 BB came out of the barrel and it just rolled out. It doesn't work, 'nuff said. All it's good for now is to be my back scratcher. Buy a pack of bendy straws to shoot BB's, they will work better than  this gun. Thank you for your time. Good nigh 
 I got this for my husband for Christmas, and it still isn't working.  He wanted it to listen to baseball games on the XM in our bedroom.  Well he's made every attempt to put the antenna in the right area outside of our house and we still can't get any reception.  He finally had to order another $50 antenna from XM.  Hopefully this will make it work 
 I have to state from the start the only book I ever liked by V.C. Andrews was "Flowers in the Attic."  The dialogue was simplistic but at least the story was interesting.  I read the next in the series and it was terrible.  I read the third in the series and gave up midway.  Someone gave me Broken Flower and having nothing else to read I am attempting to read it but I won't last long.  To a degree the characters are the same as in Flowers.  Last night I read Ian who molested his sister is going to be a doctor.  How many times can this story be rehashed?      The mother's grief over precocious puberty is so over the wall it is pathological, especially in this day and time when it is common.  I had a child with precocious puberty and that was 15 years ago.    Usually I am happy that people read no matter what they read but I hate these characters.  I hate these storylines.  I feel badly that people don't read books of better quality.  
 Not only did my kids seem very bored by this book, but I was a little disturbed that one of the very few suggestions of activity was a mother monkey "smacking" her baby 
 Kuhn, like Popper before him, noticed a very important truth but failed to see it clearly and mixed it with a terribly harmful mistake. Before explaining that truth and that mistake, I would like to clarify the meaning of the term paradigm which Kuhn used in presenting his ideas. As he later acknowledged, he gave two different definitions of this term: (a) a paradigm is a successful model that is imitated to acquire new scientific knowledge, and (b) a paradigm is made up of all accepted knowledge and the methods and means of acquiring new knowledge. These two definitions become one if we assume that the concept "model" covers all accepted knowledge and the methods and means of acquiring new knowledge. The use of terms that are not clearly defined facilitates making mistakes.  The truth noticed by Kuhn is that no knowledge can be proven to be valid in a general way using deductive logic, experimentation and/or observation, or any other method. The reason for this is that all empirical testing of knowledge can be done only on a limited number of singular phenomena. This also means that no general knowledge can be produced through deductive logic, experimentation and/or observation, or any other method. General knowledge is produced by "generalizing through induction," in Newton's words, what is learned from a limited number of singular phenomena through deduction from the related empirical data. But Kuhn ignores where induction is used in scientific work, as he admits when he says, "somewhere in this maze lies the problem of induction." Those who read Kuhn can profit from learning that general knowledge cannot be produced or tested using deductive logic, experimentation and/or observation, or any other method.  The mistake made by Kuhn is that he presents the truth that he noticed, i.e., the nonexistence of a method of general validation of knowledge, as if it were related only to theoretical knowledge, or theories. He often uses the terms theory and paradigm interchangeably, for example when he talks about "paradigm shift" and choosing between rival theories. In reality, empirical knowledge is just as impossible to validate in a general way as theoretical knowledge is, the reason being the same in the two cases. Kuhn's mistake on this point makes theoretical knowledge look less reliable than experimental knowledge. In experimental work, the validation of a hypothesized knowledge is done by deducing it from the data, whereas in theoretical work, validation is done by deducing from data not the theory that is being tested but some consequences deduced from it. I explained and exemplified these operations in detail in my books.   Those who read Kuhn should avoid sharing his mistake, which closed some disciplines of science, notably psychology, to the construction and use of theories. A survey showed Kuhn as the author most frequently quoted by psychologists. Knowledge supplied by a theory in its field of validity is as sure as empirical knowledge, and in this sense, skeptics can say, "it is only scientific knowledge" just as they say, "it is only a theory." A theory is derived, not deduced, from empirical knowledge but transcends empirical knowledge. Psychologists need to learn how this is done by physicists if they want to make psychology a mature science with theories instead of "schools" like philosophy and the arts.  Kuhn also sees no difference between science and philosophy, evidently because he ignores the process of the validation of knowledge. Plato said that philosophy was only about possibilities. In opposition to this, science produces knowledge that is tested in relation to some singular phenomena and is then generalized through induction and accepted as generally valid in a certain area of reality.   Kuhn's solution to the problem of how to choose between rival theories is that Europeans have a yet non-understood ability to choose the right theories. This is an Aristotelian tautology befitting a philosopher ignorant of the methods of science. Feyerabend remarked that Kuhn failed to explain the mission of science. 
 I bought this book to prepare for my relocation to Qatar (from Australia).  The book is so out of date it is downright useless. For example, even basic information such as visa requirements is wrong (you *can* get a tourist visa when you turn up at Doha airport). And recommendations about what's on, what's good, what's bad are meaningless - many of the things described don't exist any more or have been superceded.  I was seriously considering sending my book to Lonely Planet and asking for my money back, but it's easier to hop onto the web and complain instead. More useful too!  Having said that, I don't know of any other guides to buy instead. My suggestions are:  If you're planning on moving to Qatar, do. Quality of life here is fantastic, except that outdoor activites are curtailed by the heat most of the year. Recommend you get in contact with someone who lives here for tips.  If you're planning on a holiday to Qatar, don't. There is almost nothing here for tourists, except for 4WD'ing on the dunes which is unique and fun (go for Arabian Adventures, they're the best operator). I would recommend instead Oman (for the scenery and Arabic culture) and Dubai (shopping, astonishing real estate developments)  Back to the book: Completely out of date, and you can pick up the history bits off the net. And I'm just talking about the Qatar section here, no comment on the other two countries (but I would *really* question why you would want to go to them 
 I'm sorry to say, this work will not rate very highly on my scale.   The author is brilliant, not to mention right on the things he says. It's just that the writer's style is so abstract and nebulous that he's absolutely maddening to try and follow. One moment, he'll be talking about how religion evolved, and the next he jumps to an illustration that takes half a page and uses language that is so illusive you ask, "What in the world is he saying now?" I got so excited in the first chapter while things made sense, and then noticed how he drifted here and there, making good points and then totally abandoning them.   I bought this book three years ago and just recently finished reading it because I had to keep going out of my way to put it down and come back to it!! It never seemed to get better. I gleaned a few good points and enjoyed it...well...sort of, but the author is so unclear at times that it drives you nuts - and this is coming from an atheist who agrees with the philosophical position of the author!  Overall, I really cannot recommend it unless you are a VERY slow, contemplative reader who doesn't mind an unorthodox read. Other than that, the book is packed with some good info. I just wish I could have gotten to it more easily.  (JH)  www.ministerturnsatheist.or 
 I have trouble listening to this album; every song sounds near identical to KsE or As I Lay Dying, just not as good.   I guess it's actually a pretty solid album, if you don't mind the repetitiveness of the songs and lack of inspiration.  Some people may recall that not too long ago, Caliban had their own sound, but this record and the previous have turned them into just another metalcore band 
 The only reason you should buy and read this book is if it isrequired reading for a class. You are buying an advertisement for Fast Company Magazine. The writing is sketchy at best, and the examples are vague. You  get access to their Web site for online tests, but the site is poorly done  with typographical errors. There are other better texts on organizational  behavior 
 I had to read this book for an AP class, and it put me to sleep everytime i picked it up.  The author rambles on about the same things that went on in her life throughout the whole book, and she adds the most pointless details and situations.  The whole book is base don her views and opinions, so I really didn't care for it .If you don't want to go to the store to buy sleeping pills, just pick this one off the shelf and you will sleeping like a baby 
 I don't really know what was worse about this book, the ridiculous plot or the ethnic stereotypes.  Skip it and watch some grass grow instead, if you're that bored 
 This DVD set is just plain awful.  Obscure, bottom-of-the-sewer episodes replete with authentic 1950s television broadcast quality.  Avoid this purchase like the plague 
 If you have not seen the movies the author writes about the book is hard to understand. It was hard to read and I found it quite boring. 
 I just got this book and I am utterly dissapointed in my purchase.  First off this book talks a lot about some interesting concepts of animation, like secondary action, but fails to show you what the hell is it is.  I had to look in another book to figure it out....bottom line, the book is very wordy.  The artwork was very minimalistic and every thing is totally based on a stiff cut system.  So stiff, that the walk cycles dont even look right!  If you like generic Icebox type animation, dive right in because thats what this book will teach you 
 This book contains sound advice and concrete steps that, if followed properly, will help enhance and improve your self-image. According to the founder of Psycho-Cybernetics, Maltz Maxwell, the concept of self-image is irrefutably the most important aspect of our lives; once we have gained a positive self-image we will feel much better both mentally and physically. Thus, self-image is crucial to maintaining mental and physical health. Maxwell goes even farther holding that whether or not we succeed in our professional life depends to a great extent on how we view ourselves. Having a positive self-image makes it much easier to achieve our goals. One way to improve our self-image is to revise our thinking and to stop focusing on negative events. Also, the way we think about the aversive events in our life must change, it is imperative that we do not dwell on them. Instead of allowing these events to impair our self-image, we should act on them by actively finding adequate solutions. More importantly, the events to which we have no immediate solutions or over which we have no control should be completely ignored. Another important point made in this book is that we can control our emotional responses and this is an extremely powerful tool. Subsequently, we can decide how we want to feel or what we wish to think, according to Maltz.   The basic principle of Psycho-Cybernetics is actually quite simple: what you think in your conscious mind eventually becomes automatized in your subconscious mind. This means that if you decide that you believe in yourself and that you control your own life, these beliefs will soon be stored in your subconscious mind. An analogy is appropriate here: when learning to drive a car, initially you have to coordinate a number of different steps. As practice makes perfect, gradually these steps become automatized and you will no longer need to consciously monitor every step in order to drive. This is a crucial process because once your positive self-image becomes an inherent part of your subconscious mind then the process will be complete.   While this book is interesting and many techniques found in it are useful, there are shortcomings. First, it is common sense that positive self-esteem and self-image play a pivotal role in every individual's life. We all know that optimistic thinking promotes not only mental but also physical health. Moreover, techniques outlined in this book do not constitute anything new or revolutionary; people already know that they must challange their false beliefs and replace them with new ones. Like all other self-help books, even this one tends to be simplistic, repetitive and occasionally tedious.   Psychologists have long known that human behavior is dynamic, unpredictable and extremely complex. To explain why we think the way we do in one book is impossible. Most authors of self-help books tend to downplay the significance of highly important factors such as childhood in shaping an individual's personality. Even those vaguely familiar with psychology know that a cognitive theory (the one on which all self-help books are based) has serious drawbacks. Thus, in order to fully understand how self-esteem works we must take an integrated approach, the one involving the findings of cognitive, behaviorist, psycho-analytical and biological theories. Failure to interweave these theories will inevitably result in simplistic and flawed analyses. Simply telling someone to be optimistic will prove insufficient in the long run.   Popular psychology, I like to call it sensationalist, frequently promises fast results with no or little effort but almost always offers seriously flawed and superficial analyses. One final comment: whenever you come across a title of the book that sounds too good to be true, then skip it. Despite its oversimplified analysis, Psycho-Cybernetics does however provide an insight into the immense importance of self-esteem/self-image in every person's life. Please note that it is not my intent to discourage you from purchasing this book. On the contrary, it is always best to read it and decide for yourself.   
 I'm all about buying pretty things, but this pretty thing pretty much don't work the way you'd want.  While the iPod Nano is in the case, neither outlets on the bottom are accessible-- more importantly, the headset jack.  
 I have always considered Fodor's travel books to be the best.  They covered the highlights of each country in terms of a brief history, what to expect, places to visit, restaurants and where to stay. Their reviews were concise, accurate and covered a range from moderate to expensive.  Most refreshing was an absence of the pretentious attitudes that often characterized other guides. (Frommers being the worst offender.)  I've visited Belize before, but since it had been a few years, picked up Fodor's Belize 2007 guide. First thing I noticed is it is now one complete book devoted to the country, where in the past it was grouped under the title of "Central America".  In this case, more does not translate into better. Much of this book is irrelevant filler.  Most disappointing however is that the writers seems to have "phoned it in" while lounging by the resort swimming pool.  In short, if you love expensive hotels or trendy restaurants, this is the book for you.  If you are interested in visiting more of the real country, try another publication.  For example, Dangriga is a fascinating part of Belize, but lacks traditional tourist infrastructure. While it may not be the most popular part of the country for the Fodor writers, I would expect at least an update of hotel descriptions.  Sadly, some are easily two years out of date.    Yet another example is seen in the coverage afforded to Belmopan, the capitol of the country. Belmopan is also not a major area for tourism, but people do visit. There are some small hotels and B&B's available, nothing fancy, but clean and friendly. Yet the only listings shown in the 2007 Guide are for resorts located many miles away (One suggestion is at least a 45 minute drive from Belmopan.  Its a beautiful air-conditioned jungle lodge but so far away, to list it is absurd.)  Again, the writers may not like having to stay in a small hotel, but they should at least list them for others who may visit.  Not surprisingly, the only place this book excels is when it comes to Ambergris Caye and San Pedro.  It does give a very good listing of hotels, restaurants and activities.  While the focus is on the more expensive, it does cover a representative range.  I hope this guide does not mark a new direction for Fodors.  I personally enjoy staying in more upscale accommodations, but would not avoid a section of a country simply because there are no 4-star hotels.  A good travel book should give a complete range.  I stopped using Frommers because of this arrogance.  I hope Fodors is not following in their footsteps 
 The book provides no exciting findings for strategic decision makers. The only idea this book has is to distinguish uncertainties into four levels and it uses this four-level frame in its following discussions. And even the four-level classification is cliche. You can skip contents after chapter 3 without regretting anything 
 "Leaving Reality Behind.." is a myopic and biased account of a subject that just isn't that interesting.  Unless you were one of the eToys.com employees or one of the 'cutting-edge European artists' of etoy, the 'Toywar' was quite simply a non-event for the rest of the planet.  In essence, the authors (who clearly are sided and likely involved with the etoy camp) are trying to dress up a relatively trivial legal dispute over a domain name that is now about three years old.  Why is this interesting??  Throw another 'yet-another-dotcom-story' on the pile 
 There are only three books I've ever wanted to throw in the trash. This book is one of them. Schlesinger runs up and down the decades, around the nation, and across the list of characters in a disorganized frenetic movement that reminds me of nothing so much as my hyperactive, attention deficit disordered son during Saturday morning cartoons. One moment he's writing about Hamilton in the revolution, the next he's discoursing on Jackson's death. I picked this book up on the remainder shelf. I wish it had remained there 
 I am completely frustrated and upset with the delivery, or lack thereof, of the magazine subscription I received as a gift of Romantic Homes.  This is my absolute favorite magazine and my husband purchased a year's subcription for me from Amazon.com for Christmas 2005!  I still haven't received ONE magazine (it's now July 2006).  Amazon assured me three times, over the past year, it was coming, it's now July and I still haven't received the magazine.  I am so disappointed at the lack of customer service.  I urge you to NEVER buy a magazine subscription from Amazon.com.  This has been a horrible experience and I cannot believe that it has somehow become okay to run a business in this matter.  I am tired of empty promises from Amazon.com while I am anxiously awaiting my magazine.  Not only have I not received my magazine, the "people" at Amazon have NEVER offered a refund, a renewed subscription, ANYTHING!  I realize it's a measly twenty-something dollars, but this business practice is horrible!  I am also tired of speaking to people that do not speak English and are trying to help me.  Please do better Amazon, this is terrible!  Shame on you!  
 Just because it was written by a woman and in the past, does not make it good.  There were plenty of women writers during this time period, who we seem to forget today manage to outsell the men every time.  In the case of Nate Hawthorne, we can clearly understand why.    In Hope Leslie, Catherine Sedgwick's main goal was to persuade the readers that what they were doing to Native Americans was wrong, and that the English descendants were just as wrong in 1800 as they were in 1600.  Unfortunately, although her puritan characters, all stolen from history, are narrow minded, they are very kind.  This was not the case people.  They hung and pressed "witches," all right?  Do you really think they wouldn't punish Hope for breaking two Indian women out of jail?  And her little "the devil did it, maybe," excuse wouldn't have flown.  Also, this is not a feminist text.  I do not care what anyone says.  Simply because Esther realizes she doesn't have to get married does not make it a feminst book.  Esther would have married Everell in a heartbeat if given the chance.  Remember how she tired to sleep herself to death after he rejectd her?  If you must read this for a class, I will give you a short summary:   Magawisca:  Oh, you evil, white men.  You have killed my family and rained destruction on this land.    Hope Leslie:  I am pretty and my eyes change colors, but I will save you from jail Magawisca, while still believing in my heart that you are inferior, but a really nice girl.  [Stuff happens.  A ship blows up.  Everell and Hope help Magawisca escape.]  Everell:  Live with us, Magawisca, and teach us to be pure, like you!  Magawisca:  Thanks, you guys, but you have hurt my people so badly that the white man and indian can never be friends.  I will go to the wild woods now, and live in peace with God.  Esther:  I will go away and pretend it is not because Everell likes my best friend better.  When I come back, everyone will want me, but I learned my lesson with men.  My havishhaminess will be attributed to feminism for generations to come.   
 I bought Ray's book seeking insight into business and the personal qualities of a business man.  The book contains little business insight, but is a complete autobiography of one of the most successful enterpreneirs of the century.  Ray Kroc told his story with honesty and enthusiasm, but I am not richer for it.  This surprised me, since I deeply believe in the virtues of individual opportunity, and Mr. Kroc lived his life by this creed.  I was left cold by Mr. Kroc's single minded dedication to business during his entire life.  Maybe that is what it takes to succeed on the scale that he did, but it isn't something I would wish on somebody I cared about.  Ray's story taught me to make sure that my search for wealth and success does not consume me.       
 A reviewer below already mentioned Charlotte Church's recent disrespect for the Catholic Church. Just to elaborate, she now has a talk show in England where in one episode, she called the current Pope a "Nazi" and as part of skit dressed up as a nun and pretending to hallucinate as she ate several "communion wafers" that were stamped with a smiley face symbolizing the drug Ecstasy. Apart from that she smashed a statue of the Virgin Mary to reveal a can of fortified wine and also disrespecfully stuck a piece of chewing gum on a statue of baby Jesus. Last, in another episode she strapped herself to a crucifix as the singer Madonna did.   My question is why the hell did this little bi**h in the past record some of the most sacred music to Catholicism? The answer is easy - the almighty $. But if you're thinking about purchasing this CD, I think you should be aware of her recent conduct. And if you're Catholic I strongly suggest you to boycott her music. She really has gone downhill in the last few years. And with the fact of her smoking nowadays I'm sure her voice will be damaged not too long from now (although I was always of the opinion that it wasn't that great to begin with). I've never bought any of her CDs but if I had any in my possession they would be cut up with scissors and thrown in the fireplace to burn. Charlotte, if you're reading this I hope you rot in hell for your recent attacks against the Church. God gave you a gift and you kicked Him in the face.. 
 If you are looking to do major renovation work in rooms of an older house, then this magazine will give you some ideas, before and after pictures, etc.  There is precious little about minor jobs, improvements and fixes you may make on an older house.  There is a lot of showcasing new and expensive top of the line stuff.   My needs are more simple.  I want information on fixing and improving things in my house.  I am not a professional contractor.  For the major stuff, I will hire someone.   I have subscribed for three years but find that there is only one or two pages in each issue that can help me.  Their TV show "Ask this old house" is much more informative.  For magazines, I am going to try "Family Handyman" magazine instead.  
 I found this book extremely boring.  While there are few interesting parts, Rousseau found it necessary to relate detail after monotonous detail.  Composing over 600 pages, this book would of been less tiring given half the length.  
 It is very strange that I have been asked to review a book that has not arrived.  Can someone please find out where my book went 
 This book is partitioned into two sections: "Basic Narrative," which is a summary of antiquity from the agararian communities of the ancient Near East (Mesopotamia and Egypt) to the fall of the Roman Empire and the emergence of the Christian community and; "Societies and Cultures," which is a more detailed look at those societies and cultures that fall within the book's qualifications and, to a certain extent, the relevance of those cultures to contemporary, Western society/culture. Every sentence if not every paragraph of the first section is a bold, arguable statement that begs further exposition, discussion or reading. Actually, it appears from the "Guide for Further Reading" at the end of the book, that the first section of this book may be a derivative summary of Cantor's readings of those materials. One might be better off reading those materials for oneself rather than relying on Mr. Cantor's synthesized book reports. Mr. Cantor's use of informal, laymen language makes this book further unsuitable for use as a reference or quotation within a thesis or other scholarly endeavor. The second section of the book loses some of the somewhat cavalier arrogance (which Mr. Cantor may have meant to come across as wit) of the first section but the disjunct writing styles within the section is perplexing. The created interview with St. Augustine is clever but the section on Civil Law lacks clarity and overall what has been cited as "authoritative insight" appears to be Mr. Cantor's ruminations or opinions. While the attempt to cover the breadth of the topic within a couple of hundred pages could be construed as either laudable or [a] folly, the result in this case is an embarrassing attribution to Mr. Cantor's erudition 
 This album doesn't offer "The best of Scooter" Only the best after 1998. All the previous singles like "Move your Ass" "Back In the UK" "Fire" and "The Age of Love" are not present here. It's a allright album for starters but personally I think that the music they made from 1994-1999 was the best and many of those songs are not here, while lots of newer one's that doesn't offer you the true sound of Scooter that are here aren't very good. I own "Rough & Tough & Dangerous: 94-98" that does include some of the classics and it also offers you some wonderful instrumental trance songs that really proves the genius of this band (We don't see that very often anymore though). While songs like "How Much is the Fish" "I'm your Pusher" "Call me Manana" and "We are the greatest" are all great songs you can find them on "No time to Chill" instead, other then that, get the album I recommended instead of this that isn't really their "Best of" anyway 
 I think that this book is pretty boring because it is about a dude that has to use his left foot all the time and it just tells about his life which if you ask me I don't think that he has one 
 No argument with the musicianship, which is sadly wasted on insipid songwriting and truly wretched lyrics. A song about a heartbroken lighthouse? Give me a freakin' break. 
 So not at all what i was expecting. I had heard a lot of good things about this movie over the years and when i finally sat down to watch it,i was terribly disappointed and confused.  
 I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.    The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized?   I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.    The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.    Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.  I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.  I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.  
 Well I am a fan of The Rugrats, those babies are so cute so I watched this movie and though the movie had a couple of funny parts it was only marginally and it's mostly a boring movie and just way too loud and obnoxious and doesn't live up the the hoopla it received from critics and doesnt live up to the Nickeleodeon TV show!  If you want to get a splitting headache than watch this movie but if you dont want to get a splitting headache from all the loud noises in this movie that avoid like the plague!  Watch the TV show instead. The original episodes and not the new ones with the horrible Dil and Kimmie who totally ruined the Rugrats 
 I found this book very boring. Tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but I kept waiting for something to happen. Poor Maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a proper American. I will read another of her books since she is so well thought of 
   Most people who buy a star atlas are just getting to know the heavens, probably with a telescope and lots of enthusiasm. I would fit this description, so it is appropo that I review the two atlases I have used recently. I compared the "Collins Atlas of the Night Sky, 2005" to Nortons 20th ed, 2004.     After the first few weeks I found myself using the Collins choice more often. Norton's is the granddaddy, of course. But sometimes up-and-coming authors try to raise the bar, and this seems to have happened here. I like the color coding and the superior layout of Collins, And I especially like the section #2, where magnified maps alphabetically listed by constellation are presented. When you see something in the sky you want to identify, you usually think "it's in Orion", and want to flip to that page. Easy. You don't think, "it's at about RA 05h, dec +7 deg.        Norton's, on the other hand, has an introductory text of basic astronomy tagged on. If you don't already have an astronomy text it might add something, but most of us already have one. I liked the descriptions of stellar time, tropical vs siderial vs synodic months.     The biggest knock on Norton's, however, is the star charts aren't as easy to read, especially in the dark. I found a few errors as well. For example, the entire chart #13 has no dots to indicate where the stars are under the overlay of the Milky Way. Evidently the printer forgot to make the shading of the Milky Way transparent on that page, so all stars in that area are erased. The labels are present but there is nothing to show the star's exact location, it's visual magnitude, whethere it's a double or variable, etc. This is a huge gaffe! The binding of the Norton's text is also weak, starting to come apart after only a month. I find it hard to pick out nonstellar objects as easily.    I'll still keep my copy of Norton's, as a reference, but if I had to do it again I would buy only one 
 I was VERY disapointed in this book. My 3 year old just started holding her poops in, and this was the only book I could find to try to help her. It covers things like trauma to the child, as where I just need to get the basics across to her. This is more for a 2nd grader, not a little one 
 From the book of Genesis:  4 And the serpent said to the woman: No, you shall not die the death. 5 For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as Gods, knowing good and evil.  Run as fast as you can from this New Age lie! Satan is deceiving you. Jesus Christ is not just another 'master'. He is the one and only Son of God. There are no 'masters'! Only God is master! So forget your pride and serve God in humility 
 This novel highly disappointed me and I'm a big James Patterson fan. The usual short chapters don't bother me, but this novel was running over with characters...okay...so I don't like too many characters that I have to remember. But I stayed with the book and when it came to the ending, I kept telling myself...NO WAY. But, it ended the way it ended. I purchased this one, but I think maybe I'll get the next Patterson release from the library. I think the two star rating pretty well sums it up 
 The book's whole concentration is on subjugating females to males.  It's about all the things females are to do to serve the male sex, particularly the husband.  There is almost nothing about what men or husbands are supposed to do for their wives.  If the material in this book is correct, why would any woman want to get married?  The way husband wife relationships are described in this book is that the relation exists for the benefit of the husband, not the wife.  A woman would be better off single than being in the type of marriage relationship this book describes.  If the material in this book is correct why would any woman want to attend church?  Her only function would be as a servant to lift up the male leaders of the church.  She would be better off spending her time elsewhere where she is permitted to use all her gifts.  This book is the best argument I know for why women should not marry or go to church.    
 Our entire book club disliked this book. We had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters. Howard, the largest presence in this story, feels like a blank at the core. Upon putting this book down, his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me. Characters such as Jerome, Victoria, and Carl were intriguingly introduced, but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text. Especially Carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all. As am homage to Howard's End, some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me. For example, the heart-to-heart connection between Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between Margaret Schlegel and Mrs. Wilcox did.   I thought Zora was one of the most interesting characters, and I like how Smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity. But Smith makes her smug a bit too often, and so feeling a connection with Zora is difficult as well - most of the time I just wanted to smack her. And I have to agree with the others that Smith needs to brush up on her American characterizations. There was next to no authenticity in that regard. Especially the Southern dialogue - laughable!  It also feels like Smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book...I understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts...but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling, unresolved, by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness.   Aaaargh...must go and re-read Howard's End to dispell the queasy feeling left by On Beauty 
 I have to admit that I didn't like this movie very much. It shows Tom Cruise's domestic circumstances but this subplot doesn't seem to be woven well with the rest of the movie. 
 After reading the reviews of this book here on Amazon, and running across mentions of this book in lots of other places that talk about comics & graphic novels, I was really looking forward to reading it.  But on the whole, I've been very disappointed.  Although the book covers a lot of relevant topics, it does so in a way that seems sloppy and self-congratulatory.  The book could do with a thorough proofreading to catch the numerous typos and other errors, and the author seems more concerned with impressing the reader than in making the topics easy to grasp and apply.  I'm really surprised to find that this isn't a better introduction to the art & craft of visual storytelling 
 I wouldn't say this is cheap in price considering the quality. It should  have been $1.99. Severe ghosting on a Gateway VX1120 through a LinkSys  PS2KVM4 switch running two DELLS, and two GATEWAYS with two machines  running SUSE LINUX. Horrible reception for every single machine. What a  waste of money 
 The hottest song is Murphy Lee's "Jungle Gym", everything else wasn't hitting at all 
 Back in the early 90's, Jane March made a big splash internationally with her uninhibited performance in the sexually explicit The Lover. Granted, the role didn't give her much to work with, but from a physical standpoint she made a big impression on a lot of filmgoers, including me. The movie garnered her a lot of notoriety and she had every opportunity to use that as a spring-board into a legitimate movie career. Unfortunately, choosing the unbelievably stupid Bruce Willis vehicle Color of Night as her follow-up probably killed any chance at a career that she had.   I've always found erotic thrillers to be quite a dubious genre. Most of the ones that I've seen, while sexually explicit, aren't really erotic. Nor are they thrilling in any way. This movie was following on the heals of the tremendous success of Basic Instinct and almost every studio was chomping at the bit to come out with something similar. As a result we ended up with some terrible films like Sliver, Jade, Body of Evidence and this film, Color of Night.   The plot goes something like this. Bruce Willis is a psychiatrist who has a patient dive out of his office window, going splat on the sidewalk below. He is so traumatized by the incident that he loses the ability to see the color red(!). He decides to take a break by visiting his psychiatrist friend played by Scott Bakula and hanging out with Scott's therapy group. He hopes that he might be able to make some sense as to what has happened. Scott's group is a motley crew of screwed up people, from a woman who is nymphomaniac, to a weird androgynous young boy. Bruce ends up meeting a beautiful young woman played by the delectable Jane March and he quickly falls in love with her. We get treated to explicit scenes of the two of them screwing in the pool, the bedroom, the bathtub and the shower. Meanwhile someone murders Scott Bakula and starts to wreck havoc with Bruce. He tries to figure out if it's someone in Scott's therapy group and on and on and so forth.   The movie is really quite laughable due to the fact of how serious Bruce Willis was apparently taking this movie. Virtually everyone else in the movie seems to have their tongue planted in their cheeks with their performances, but Bruce seemed to think that this might be an Oscar contender. Add to the fact that the plot is absolutely atrocious and contrived beyond comprehension, and add way too many red herrings, and the movie quickly becomes a chore to watch.   About the only thing this movie really had going for it was the explicit, but decidedly unerotic sex scenes. They really come across as more silly than anything else.   The only thing that I enjoyed was getting to see a slightly older Jane March in the buff and looking better than ever. What a smoking body!  But, like I mentioned before, she got a lot of the blame along with Bruce as to why the movie turned out so terrible and as a result, she has appeared in very few movies since. I still think that if she had been given the proper chance, she could have been a great actress, but people have all but forgotten about her by now.   It's really surprising that this movie didn't kill Bruce Willis' career. But I guess if he could survive Hudson Hawk & Bonfire of the Vanities, he could survive anything.   BTW, the version I watched was listed as being the "R-rated director's cut" with 17 additional "steamy" minutes added back into the film. Since I never saw the original cut I couldn't tell what might have been added back into this version. There is some fairly explicit sexual content and a shot of full frontal Bruce Willis nudity in the pool scene but nothing that's too strong.  Avoid this movie like it was herpes.   Color of Night is rated R and contains strong sexual content, nudity, graphic violence and strong language. 
 RACIST.  This word summarizes the book.  It's thoroughly anti-semitic. The author believes in the superiority of the "Aryan Race", and tries promote it throughout the book.  He even refers to black people as savages 
 I ordered "Elvis - 30 #1 Hits" and this CD was fine. Along with that order, I ordered "Elvis 2nd to None".    The CD case was damaged, and the actual CD contained songs in it that were damaged...  Unfortunately it was a gift that I gave someone in another state, which makes it too complicated to return.. 
 I never got this book and I have tried numerous time to get my money back and I have only gotten the runaround. Why wont you respond to the fact that I never got this book and is anything going to be done about it. 
 I've seen ethan hawk's best performance ever in this movie. it was great. Wiona ryder and other actors were great too but it was not even a memorable movie. it has a predictable sipmle story that made no sense at least for me. maybe I'm not right but in my opinion, this movie does not worth to buy. does not even worth to rent. but gh the movie itself does not worth anything but it's soundtrack issome channels may show it occasionally. It's worth to be watch once at TV! By the way, I forgot to mention that this movie has a great CD soundtrack, really great. worth to buy 
 I remember reading "The Chamber" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out 
 This novel was not fun to plow through. I made it, but it was a chore.  First of all, it seemed like Honor was hardly in the book! We spent a lot of time sitting around in the government offices of Haven reading through political gobbledygook.  And there's a central plot device that Weber keeps repeating and repeating over and over, but he never actually displays to us so that we can go "oh wow, yeah, I'd be fooled by that too, no wonder what happens happens". It's like he has this conceptual idea, but can't execute it concretely, but he's so in love with the idea that he tries to make it work anyway. And being David Weber he has to repeat it over and over. And over. We get it already. It's a piece of machiavellian genius-- but not one you can actually show us because you can't actually come up with the hard copy. *rolling eyes*  If you cut Weber's repetitions down to like, 5 per character trait or plot point, the book would be a hundred pages shorter, I swear. He does that all the freaking time.  But I didn't believe for a second that anybody who has been described as as intelligent as the new leaders of Haven would be as blind as they are shown to be in this novel. Nor am I convinced that no one on the Manticore side would read through the subterfuge to take the correct course of action. When people pull political rabbits out of their behinds, especially when it's a simple direct action that it seems like they could have just done in the first place and saved us all about 600 pages of drudging through politics... oh man I get frustrated.  It's like this inexorable tide that Weber wants to come in to shore, but he doesn't have a really plausible, much less interesting, means of making it happen.  I sure hope the next one has Honor back to kicking buttinsky, more treecats, maybe some romance finally for the poor lady-- I mean really, she had her lover murdered, she lost an arm, lost an eye and whatever else-- give her some happiness, she's due, and I want to read that story!  Yeah, I'm gonna read the next one, but I'm sure gonna be wary 
 Bought Ken Henderson's Guru's Guide to T-SQL, hoping to build on my (very) basic skills as a beginning developer.  Looked very promising and I was really looking forward to working through it using the code in the book and on the enclosed CD.  However, there is no cross-reference in the book to which files go with which code samples, resulting in a lot of hunting around to find the right files.  And then, quite a few of the code samples simply won't run.  Even with the corrections referred to in the Errata section on his website, I got many more errors than I can fix.  Between trying to find the correct sql files from the cd, and trying to fix the errors, I've pretty much abandoned the book altogether.  Not much use trying to learn from bad code.  Wouldn't spend the money on this one, if I had to do it over 
 That is a good book for the beginner of toxicologist. However, many existed errors may mislead and confuse the beginners. So I recommend that we'd wait for next edition 
 This book says absolutely nothing about the condition that America is in today; it says nothing about American history, nor the American people. It is just a collection of mindless warblings, fatuously childish ad hoc remarks by a doddering old fool who has made a career out of bootlicking the racist right. I would not recommend this even for kitty litter. Burn it 
 Gates has missed the cluetrain.  Microsoft is still engaging in the us against them corporate mentality, and this book reveals why.  He's so focussed on the boardroom mentality that he seems to have no clue what his CUSTOMERS want.  It's all about how the internet can serve the company, rather than how the company can fill the needs of the community 
 What a waste of time.  There is no spirit of realization behind the words.  It just made me want to go direct and read the words of Parmahansa Yogananda directly and not waste time on this ego trip 
 Why on Earth, given the hundreds of songs Rod could record from this era....did he choose certain songs that he cannot possibly enhance?  "Love Hurts?"  So do my ears after hearing Rod soil a perfect Nazareth song.  "Everything I Own?"  By Bread?  Rod, could you not gain access to the Partridge Family catalog?  "If Not For You?"  Rod, Olivia Newton-John did a better interpretation of Dylan....35 years ago!  "Still The Same?"  What a sad, fitting title for this collection.  The sad part is, thousands of sheeple are buying this dreck, giving Rod a license to steal yet again.  I gave it 2 stars.  There are two songs that aren't that bad.  The first single, "Have You Ever Seen the Rain," is a note-for-note remake of a CCR song that can't be topped, but Rod's version is safe and listenable...perfect for today's AC radio.  And the Eagles' "Best of My Love," which like most songs on this collection, is way overplayed already, is a good arrangement.    The rest is either awful, or background noise.  Rod should be embarassed.  But of course he isn't.  
 I got that title after to have read the generally very good reviews. I was however quite disappointed by this movie, its average plot, average acting (especially "Mark") and rather clich ending 
 I have researched 1031 extensively ---this is the  worst book I have read on the subject-- . I would not buy anything frm this author again. I returned it for my money back---- DONT WASTE YOURS!! 
 I had thought that this was going to be a day to day calander (its not). Besides that it seems like Mr. Larson has lost his touch with humor, I wont purchase another one next year 
 This is a very good book on the subject of Oedipus, but not quite the best book on Sophocles or Oedipus. I  liked both Bates' "Sophocles-poet and dramatist" and Weinstock's "Sophokles" a wee bit better, but  that may be just my personal taste. Knox has a very bad habit of insisting  that, by playing with the translations of tense and the shifting of  meaning, and the redistributing of stress in a given sentence, that whole  new meanings of the text can be 'discovered'. This is a very lazy,  haphazard way to engage in critiquing, for it is not research. And Fagle's  translation is plodding. Takes the poetry right out of the text 
 I read all Jonathan Kellerman books, but this one put me to sleep. I was disappointed. I also think he should resolve this love interest and get Robin back. Allison needs to go. His books were better with Robin. These issues get boring after awhile 
 where are all the rock songs? i need to know sum from sum 41 and mest, and any others thanks if someone could or would respond 
 I was disappointed with the fictional story-line and somewhat offended by the stereo-types employed by the author.  Not only were the so-called Wiccans stereo-typed, but they practiced Satanism?  My bigger issue, however, was with the stereo-typical portrayal of the "Christian" characters.  Indeed, among many self-proclaimed Christians, a better job certainly needs to be done in actually living life from a sound biblically-based perspective.  I agree that there is indeed spiritual warfare taking place in the lives of Christians, but rarely is it so neatly packaged as is the case in the fictional story-line that comprises the beginning of each chapter in this book.    I think that this book would have been better had it stuck with the exploration of the similarities and differences found within Wicca and Satanism.  It would have even been interesting, as another reviewer had suggested, to compare similarities between the modes in which Christianity is practiced versus the modes in which both Satanism and Wicca is praticed.  Christians need not fear comparrison if what the Bible claims is actually true; if Jesus Christ truly is God, the redeemer of all who profess His name which, is my belief.  I sincerely believe that this is the belief also of the author.  His attempt was sincere.  I did learn about some interesting connections between Wicca and Satanism that I haven't seen in other sources, so for this, I am glad I have the book.  
 I unfortunately could not get through this book. T.R just went on and on, getting a bit carried away with his own wit and literary skills. I wish  I could write a better review, but I can't get past the second chapter. Perhaps further on down the road I will give it another try. In the meantime I recommend all Tom's other novels. 
 There is very little in this book that the average fitness-minded person does not already know. Granted, it does provide some ideas how to properly structure your training, and also a few exercises (esp. plyometrics) that are unique to this book, but on the overall does not have detailed enough information on surf-specific workouts. Also, the instructions for some of the more complex strength exercises such as the squat are dangerously inadequate. While such exercises may be highly productive if performed with correct form, the description in this book does not include even basic aspects of the right technique, and may so set you up for injury. Even though this was one of the first, there are better books on this topic 
 One review says this book is "Part critical history, part personal memoir, part celebration, and part meditation." This is accurate - though some parts are larger than others. The critical history is very interesting - but the personal memoir, which dominates the book, is not. Gitlin has a lot of interesting and incisive things to say, but he dwells far too much on boring minutiae like who Tom Hayden's girlfriend was in different months 
 I have not recieved this product yet, therefore I cannot review it yet 
 The authors use of words make the British Redcoat seem foolish and weak. If this book is meant to be about the battles of the revolution then why are all the American victories listed and yet not all of the British ones? Makes no sense to me seeing as the British won most of the battles.   If you want to read a 'false feel good propoganda' type of book then feel free to go for this one BUT take everything you read with  a massive pinch of salt. It's these type of books that have completely churned factual history into a euphoria of false patriotic rhetoric.  Rebels and Redcoats will provide you with a far more comprehensive and factual base from which to look at the war from.   
 For an author who wrote such exceptional novels, I found this to be quite boring. He spent WAY too much (2/3 of the book)on plays, screen plays, directing & producing. Not enough time on the writing of books, since that's what really made him famous( and rich). I would have liked to know more about the back story of his novels; where he got his ideas from, characters & places. 
 I love historical novels.  I really like a good romantic tale woven into those stories. For that reason I read and enjoyed "Katherine" by Anya Seton.  I later tried "Green Darkness" and was disappointed... and then tried Seton's "Dragonwyck" and really didn't care for it either. I saw these rave reviews over "Avalon" and decided to try another republished Seton book one last time. People, it is a chore to finish. I am doing so out of a sense of obligation... this book can't hold my interest at all.  The writing is simplistic.  The "romance" is dull.  The story is painfully slow. The characters are FLAT. I just don't get it. There are so many wonderfully written historical romances out there - all I can think is that the reviewers who've raved about it aren't regular readers of this genre and therefore aren't comparing it to other books & authors such as Sharon Kay Penman, Nicole Galland, or even Elizabeth Chadwick (more pure romance set against history than a blend of the two). I just can't recommend this book 
 The standard Hallmark background music plays for hours on end. The world seems to be coming to an end due to a super nova. This mini-series will never come to an end.  Do we tell?  Who do we tell? Is there an evil plot to the end? Will Dr. Austin Sheppard (Peter Fonda) find time enough for love? Will an evil being abduct Brooke and Haley? Do we really care?  We get to watch some great acting by Tia Carrere, born on 1967 as Althea Janairo, 11 years after she gained acknowledgement in the blockbuster film "True Lies" (1994). And let's not forget Peter Fonda who played Frank in "The Passion of Ayn Rand" (1999). 
 I know APR is supposed to be one of the better poetry magazines out there, and I think it has one of the highest circulations of any poetry magazine, but it's more of the National Enquirer of poetry magazines. It's a large, newspaper-style format that contains mostly bad poetry and dull articles. You'd be better off subscribing to Poetry, The Hudson Review, The Texas Review, Tar River Poetry, or any number of other journals 
 For the price this book is a huge waste of money. It seems like it was rushed out with no regard to all the errors, disorginization, etc, in the book. It's just a rehash of commonsense and information that is readily available on the internet for free. 
 About 6 years ago I saw a 20/20 feature about this generation's greatest author Thomas Pynchon, and how incredibly acclaimed and mysterious he is.  So I figured I would check out his work.  I had begun reading fairly intensely and wanted to see what all the buzz was about.  I picked Vineland because it looked intriguing, and hey, anything that features lesbian ninjas can't be bad right??  Well, unfortunately the 20/20 segment was far more intriguing than this book.  I honestly don't understand what all the buzz is about.  Maybe it's because I didn't live through the 60's, or didn't grow up in Humbolt county.  But I certainly don't "get" Pynchon at all.  The man has an incredible imagination, but the problem is that the stories he concocts lack almost everything that I treasure in literature.  The characters are quirky, but I don't care about them.  The circumstances are ridiculous, but rarely to the point beyond a half-amused chuckle.  The "plot" wanders all over the place but ultimately leads nowhere.  If there's a point or theme that the author is trying to convey, it's hidden far beneath the depth which I would care to dig.  Looking back, I can't remember the characters, or the resolution.  I just remember it being a very disjointed story.  It's sad to me that someone with Pynchon's obvious mental and literary prowess, can't use them to write something that is moving, or teaches you something.  Something that sticks with you for life.  My recomendation to people who are considering reading Pynchon: if you like Tom Robbins, go ahead and try Pynchon.  For those who want something a bit more substantive, read John Irving.    Note: It IS possible for some of us to enjoy Stephen King, as well as, the acclaimed "literary" scribes like Saramago, McEwen, Umberto Eco etc.  It just takes a little less pretension, and an open mind.    ...and for the record, the lesbian ninjas were a big disapointment.        
 This book would have been more suitable as a graduate level business course text book rather than as a "suspence" novel.  It was boring.  Although Ludlum is a favorite author, this boring attempt at  suspence took him down in my estimation 
 Owen does a remarkable job of making himself look like a complete jerk.  He comes off as arrogant, showing little empathy towards Debra's problems earlier on in their marriage ( eating disorder, depression, social anxiety).  He writes about very private matters in his book that have nothing to do with the legal trouble Debra was in, but instead are very embarrassing to her.  He comes across as a husband with no compassion.  It's ironic that he goes on and on about Debra's poor choices in boyfriends over the years, and how they were always so controlling of her....and then he goes on to tell us how mad he was because he was a tidy person and Debra didn't keep the house tidy...and he didn't approve of the way she dressed!!  Seems to me that he was no different than the other guys she dated.  He repeatedly reminds us of how smart he is, his GPA, jobs, earning potential, etc...but then admits that when they separated, he sticks Debra with the credit card bill that still had a balance from their wedding and honeymoon to pay off!  He says it was in her name, so she can have it!  Owen shows how little a man he really is in this book. Debra did have horrible things happen to her as a kid, and maybe if she could have married a man with compassion in his heart, she wouldn't have gone down the road she did.  I feel very sorry for Debra after reading this book 
 This was the first Harper story I read and it was dull. I enjoyed the Sookie story series. I won't be buying any more stories with this character. She just bored me and was pretty pathetic. 
 I remember seeing CHILDREN OF THE CORN right after reading Stephen King's short story version in his classic book, Night Shift. I was excited because King's story was such good scary fun. Well, I watched the movie and was amazed at how awful it was. While the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror, the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze. King's story was short (like 10-20 pages) and sweet, w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields. The movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter. The running time is 90 minutes, including about an hour's worth of padding. COTC would have made an excellent addition to one of King's anthology movies like CREEPSHOW. As it stands, it's bloated and pretty boring. Of course, Linda Hamilton is in it, which is why I gave it an extra star...        
 This thing just doesn't work, don't bother.  It won't stay upright no matter what you do, so there's no way for the kids to play any form of tether ball with it.  Looks like it would be fun if it worked.  The most entertaining thing about it was that the dog kept barking at it for some reason. 
 I bought this book after purchasing another book on Frontpage that was way over my head. I bought it thinking that it would be basic enough to begin to learn how to use Frontpage but it is not. It is similar to the other book describing features of Frontpage that I do not understand. I have used other "Dummies" books to get a start on a subject but this did not help me at all. I think it would have helped me to have some examples of how the pieces go togather. There are plenty of technical works on Frontpage to go to once one has a basic idea. In the beginning of the book John writes that "it is assummed that the reader knows how to use the keyboard and the mouse" The reader has to know much more than that to get a benefit from this book. It is probably a very good book for someone with some experence with the basic concepts, but it was not helpful at all for me. I went out and hired someone to build my webpage 
 I contemplated purchasing this online, but decided to take a look at it in a bookstore.  I'm glad I did.  If you're interested in learning yoga poses, look elsewhere.  Even if you're after a book that captures the beauty and art of yoga, look elsewhere.  The photos looked grainy and the book is so short and fat that it won't lie flat.  Keep shopping 
 This book was chosen by my office reading group.  It was generally felt to be a disappointment.  I for one really liked the writing style and prose but wondered why simpler words were not chosen.  Some felt, too, they required a dictionary by their side.  It was definitely a book one could easily put down.  There wasn't much in the way of character development and the story lacked intrigue.  The ending, too, was a disappointment 
 Reasonably interesting book but not if one is specifically interested in the periodic table or its evolution.  Only one or two chapters are actually on the periodic table.  In addition the final 40 or so pages consist just of a "catalog of elements", essentially a complete list of all the elements, the dates they were discovered etc.  This is nothing more than a page filler for a book that is well written but rather too superficial for anybody really interested in chemistry and physics 
 the author seems to write backwards. it requires too much effort to unscrambe 100 words to get at the 5 meaningful words. i personally dont have the time to suffer through it 
 needs to collaborate. I've been following him/them since the first Melody Makers albums and they were better, sometimes backed by The Wailers, Stephens contributions, whatever.etc, His solo stuff is thin and he's being left behind which is a shame, he's surruonded by tallent. The fire and hunger are sorely lacking and withuot them can you make Reggae 
 How to Write a Book Proposal explains how to get a non-fiction book published. It explains various important aspects pertaining to writing effective non-fiction book proposals. The aspects highlighted are how to test-market the potential of a book idea, choosing the best agents and editors and trying to influence publishers to make a good offer.  I have read several hundreds of books but somehow with this book failed to impress me. I was in the process of writing my first book, but I could not find this book to be of much practical use to my book writing project. The title of the book to me did not relate to the contents and the flow appeared haphazard. Each chapter in isolation could be readable and make sense but one chapter does not logically lead to the next. I read this book having completed reading another one entitled "Writing Nonfiction- Turning Thoughts into Books by Dan Poynter". The contrast could never be starker. I had hoped that the book would be a natural follow on after reading the delightful little book by Dan Poynter. However, I was very disappointed and the book was a waste of my money. 
 Not sure this is the book to study for the PMP. Agree that its missing the tools techniques and concepts but he made it clear up front he was not going into it. Also, the intergration knowledge area is missing. I think if he went into the format of the exam , it would really serve its purpose better.  Read this after you have read the PMBOK and another REAL PMP EXAM prep book! This is great to read the day before for leisure with no pressure 
 Any book by Damodaran is far better for business managers and portfolio managers.  For portfolio managers, estimating the cash-flows is a small part of the valuation process, the easiest. As the financial field and practice is becoming more and more quantitative, the cutting edge of asset pricing is to estimate time-varying risk premiums. Actually, almost 90% of variation in stock prices come from risk shifts, not from news on company cash-flows.   If you are interested in asset pricing i would suggest a mix of damodaran (20%) and "Asset Pricing" by John Cochrane (80%) 
 I think I've read most of Mr. Woods' Stone Barrington novels, enjoying them thoroughly - BUT this is a sad addition to the collection. He just called this one in - unrealistic plot, unresolved plotlines, bad dialogue.......I think he's unfortunately succumbed to the 'publisher's lament': "You just HAVE to release another Stone novel this year!" There's no pride of authorship in this book - it's strictly a throwaway....and the circular bin is where it's ended up...... 
 I'm not a mathematcian!  The book teaches Calc in a way that makes mathematicians (like my professor) very aware that they know WAY more Calculus than their students (who have never taken it before).  The examples in the reading section are quick and simple, and the problems are longer and more complicated.  If you are a math major aspiring to write complicated algorithms, you should love this book.  If you're like most of the people in Calc who are taking it because its a required part of your major, it's really not very helpful.  P.S. I did get an A in Calc, but still dont like the boo 
 I bought this for my husband because his feet are very rough on the bottom.  I specifically ordered this one since the head was bigger than the other ones I found on line.  I tried it on myself first.  It has NO power to it at all and if you put any pressure on it, it will come to a stop.  After a few seconds with it on, it started to smell of burnt plastic.   
 The author Thomas Carlyle presents the history of the French Revolution as a prophetic poetry of his intellect, and rightfully burned on his presentation for review.  As reading this book realize the great store of words and meanings that suited his direction rather than the true nature of the French Revolution of the peoples.  What an awful book 
 This book does not give an accurate or chronologicaly coherent description of the birth and rise of Islam.  The authors of the book are not Islamic historians, they are art historians writing about an age and culture that did not produce significant works of art.  To a person unfamiliar with Islam it seems complete and accurate 
 I bought this DVD to show to my world history class. I was very disappointed when I opened it up and saw that there is no DVD menu (it just starts playing as soon as you put it in) and that there are only 4 or 5 chapters, which are set up sloppily (like in the middle of people's sentences). The result is that it is difficult use this DVD as an instructional tool. The first part gives a history of the Armenian people and their persecution in the Ottoman Empire. It is a little dry, but it may be suitable for older students (I teach tenth grade). The explanation of the events that caused the genocide is well done, as is the documentation of the genocide itself. The rest of the movie talks about the politics of remembering/forgetting the genocide, and is pretty good. Unfortunately, there are not a lot of student-friendly resources about the genocide (my students' textbooks don't even mention it), so teachers are put in the situaton of using so/so resources to teach about an important subject. If I can find a better DVD I will definitely buy it for next time. All-in-all, I am angry that the DVD's presentation is of such a poor quality. I would have expected more from PBS 
 Considering how hefty this volume is, I was hoping to find recipes to produce well-cooked, flavorful meats with nearly any cut of meat I had in my freezer, using everyday ingredients I would normally have on hand. Not necessarily so. This is more of a gourmet's cookbook for those with time to cook, access to big-city delis and a liking for fussy sauces. Example: Puebla-Style Tongue in Chipotle Chile Sauce; Cured Pork Loin Roasted with Parsnips in Maple-Vanilla Sauce; Caribbean Pork Braised with Limes and Oranges; Sauteed Filet Mignon with Corn and Chile Cheese Sauce. There is some basic information on how to best cook some cuts of meat, but not enough to justify the price of the book, and the recipes rely heavily on the fancy ingredients. As a side note, if you don't like to include alcohol in your cooking, this is not the book for you! The recipes and tips on cooking pork ribs were good 
 I purchased this book because it was assigned as a part of a literature curriculum for 7th Grade. I am very glad that I read this book before allowing my 12 year old son to read it. This book is about gang violence (although it is initially sugar coated as being fairly harmless pranks assigned to frightened students by one of the gang leaders.)  The book is also about angry, jaded, hateful teachers and administrators in a religious school and how they allow the gang to function in order to serve their own purposes.   The ending has the one student who stood up against the gang being beaten up quite severely for his disobedience (while the administrator of the school looks on from a nearby hill.)   Before he is taken away in the ambulance, the student tries to tell his one and only friend to just do what the gang and the faculty want him to do.   The message here is do not buck the system, no matter how corrupt the system is. Within the first few pages the book refers to masturbation.  (Another re-curring topic.)  I knew that it was questionable whether or not I would allow my son to read this book.  I read the entire book myself hoping that there would be a redeming message in the end that would justify the rest of the book.  There isn't.   This is the first book that I have ever thrown away rather than passing on to someone else. Save your money.  I don't care how many awards this book received.  It is pure trash 
    After using an inexpensive Krups machine for 2 years, my wife gave in and we agreed to buy this Delonghi EC701.  The 1st machine we got had a cracked plastic water tank and a broken tray.  DeLonghi customer support is outsourced and worthless andreplacement parts were out of stock and backordered.  We exchanged it for another and the power button did not work-to keep the unit on, you had to physically hold down the power button. Finally, the third machine we got was totally DOA! It wouldn't even turn on.    Finally we were told that they were getting alot of these machines back, and customer service told us to steer clear.  Buyer Beware. We went back to our $50 Krups so far 
 Easy to set up and worked great for 2 months then it just stopped working.  Horrible customer service!  Will never buy from this company again! 
 I think this is the worst movie I have ever seen! And confusing too! The are a lot of bad flash backs, and fast-fast forward scenes of boats tied up in a dock, with the sun coming up or down.   Lew(Dominic Purcell) is laughable as a sign painter.  There is actually a scene where he is bent double hammering over his head on to a sign he's working on, that is down on the ground and half burried in the dusty dirt! You can tell he dosen't have a clue to what he is doing!  Then after he finds out about the planned kidnapping, he is supposly sneeking, and peeking around bushes. Like a man of Purcell's size(he's 6'1"or so, and wieghs about 200 pounds) can sneek around in someone's front yard and not be seen?  Come on! I kept waiting for someone to call 911 to report a peeking Tom!  I have to warn you that there are a lot of sex scenes!  Bad ones at that! I guess the director wanted to get them over with-real fast-to move on to the next badly written scene!   At least you get to see Dominic Purcells nude butt! Which maybe the only reason to see this movie, if you like that sort of thing!  And Purcell gets beaten up alot-by everyone in this movie. I kept thinking 'come on Purcell your a big guy, you can take that little guy!' And worse a woman beats him up too!  I saw this listed as a comedy, well maybe a comedy of errors!  While being intervied Dominic Purcell dosen't even mention this movie, when he lists all the movies that he has been-in.    And that should say something about this movie, if the guy who starred in it, would NOT even SAY he'd been in it 
 A clock radio that you have to fumble for a remote to use....I don't think so.  I have the older models (CD & Clock Radio) and they are nice but the new model is irritating.    I also have the IPOD player and at least the volume controls are on the system.  I can't keep a system that I have to locate a remote to operate. 
 As other have stated, the performance is excellent.  My wife and I watched this in vegas and thoroughly enjoyed the show.  With that said, my review is for the extremely poor job the video editor did. They used some kind of filter on many of the shots.  They change camera angles 50 times in 1 minute to the point that is unbearable and painful to watch.  You do not get to see the dancers perform any full steps because the angle switches before they finish it.  Additionally they use these slow motion segments that totally ruin the moment and create the unsynchronized dance with the music.  I have to sell my copy because I get nauseas watching it.  I hope they re-make this DVD.  I think my 7-year old daughter could do a better job editing...and we could use the additional revenue stream... 
 Disappointing. I wear size 37 Birkenstocks and these are one half inch shorter than my other clogs 
 Complete waste of time!  I am done reading Robin Cook books for now..The story line for this book is so stupid I am amazed Mr. Cooks editors even allowed it to be printed..I'm not sure about the hospitals where Robin lives or works at, but in the area where I live, if just one patient died there would be an immediate investigation, but here we have several patients die from unknown causes and the characters just move along like it's no big deal..The Wilsons even allow their daughter to be admitted!!!  Give me a break!!  Like I said..don't waste your time on this one!!  
 This is just a re-hash of the stereo CD, it's not "re-mastered" for multi-channel playback. You'd be much happier with Pink Floyd's 30th Anniversary Edition of the album "Dark SIde Of The Moon" or the Eagles "Hotel California" or Elton John's "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"; these artists took the time and spent the money to do SACD right. Peter Gabriel is just trying to suck more money out of your pocket without any value added in return. Sure it's a slightly better recording than the original CD but certainly not worth buying again 
 But ... maybe this book is required after all.  I mean, the last 3 books were written as if Stephen King threw in whatever ridiculous thought popped into his mind, so maybe we do need this to explain what the hell he was thinking!  One reviewer wrote in his review that this book is NEEDED, not something that you just want, so I guess I may be on the right track after all.  Now that I look closer, I see that this lofty Concordance was published in 2003, which means that it only focuses on the 1st 4 books.  Ah, the good old days, when the Dark Tower series seemed so good and before King's creativity was knocked out of his head when he was hit by a van.  It's true, you know - just compare the 1st four books to the last three and you'll se what I mean 
 LOVED Olivia and the Missing Toy, wished I'd read Olivia Saves the Circus in a bookstore because I wouldn't have bought it.  Very disappointed 
 I was very pleased with the book,"Wurthering Heights" and the service in sending it to me.   THank you. 
 I give this movie 1 star because it lies to the viewer. This movie is NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula, but a rip-off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the story. If it was named something else or even kept the name Dracula out of it to begin with but called him a different name I'd give it 5 stars.  If you want to see the real Dracula story first read the actual book by Bram Stoker, then watch the silent film Nosferatu. Nosferatu is the only Dracula movie that gets the story right. Dracula is a monster, he's not a star crossed lover at all and wasn't intended to be. People wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply isn't one. It's a horror tale, not a vieled porn book, and certainly not a love story. If anything the ones that fail to understand Dracula time and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being anthropomorphic toward him 
 I really began to by liking this book about a Gina whose grandfather is dying and although he forced Gina's mother to put her up for adoption when she was born, has decided to make amends.   She arrives to find her grandfathers stepson Ross is gorgeous and running the family business. Fine by her as she asserts repeatedly that she doesn't want anything from the man. She is just there to meet her grandfather then head back home.  With in the first few chapters the grandfather dies and when the will is read low and behold Ross and Gina must wed. Suddenly Gina is interested in keeping her shares rather then selling enough to let Ross have a controlling vote in the business.  Flip Flop: all of a sudden, she is getting married, and spends lots of money, has little to do with her adopted family, and is so suspicious of her future husband its amazing she hasn't completely turned green.  The cast of characters surrounding Gina and Ross are far more interesting then Gina herself and how Ross fell in love with her is beyond me. She flips flops on everything from the money, to a trip to England, to weather or not they have sex.  I would say read another Kay Thorpe this one isn't one of her best. 
 It never ceases to amaze me how conservatives prefer a brief read to something written in depth.  Perhaps some things are much too challenging for narrow minds.  I couldn't help but read some of the reviews, and I can never understand how conservatives can say liberals always have to revert to name-calling and using the word "stupid", and yet they constantly pepper what they say with insults themselves.  Typical.  I used to respect anyone's opinion, and I still try to, but when people clearly ignore facts and cling to their biases, without considering what they can see or use common sense, I have to call a spade a spade.  This book is funny only to those who find drivel funny.  It's not even well-written.  
 ok they either have the wrong description or the wrong photo/title. the review is for Invasion of the Boy Snatchers. com'on people!!!XP only 1 star for the idiots at amazon.                                                               
 Gave up after 64 pages, what a sham, the heroic hero calls his SEAL buddy Harry, the man's name is Dan Harris, the President is called Woody for no explained reason as his name is Robert X. Hayes, Ramstein Air Base, Germany is called Ramstein Air Force Base, the White House security people will let just anyone in to see the Pres, you can't be serious, "the hero's lean biceps bulged under the fabric of his black polo shirt he was wearing" did we have to be told that he was wearing the shirt after being told of the bulging business, either consign this joke to the trash can or give it to a person that you really dislike. Minus 3 stars 
 ...particularly one who falsely refers to himself as a prince and who produces trash like this. When Doves Cry is an unashamed rip off of MC Hammer's excellent Pray and the title track is far too long for my liking. Save your money.  
 Started the book and put it down as I was not very interest in hearing the author's personal journey as I was interested in learning this style of self defense. The illustartions were too small and the exercise routine was left until chapter nine!!  I however feel that there will be some positives from reading the book 
 I read the book to find a new gems of wisdom from the prophet.  It became clear that the book is full of virtues that very few would quibble with.  However, you would think that a modern prophet would give at least one quote from the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, or Pearl of Great Price. But there is not a singe one.  Upon reading the book, everyone will see that we believe in the Bible, since it is quoted every few pages. The book stands for everything Christian that everyone will agree with, and stands for nothing that is uniquely Mormon.  No mention of the restoration of the gospel, Joseph Smith, eternal families, or any of our beliefs from the plan of salvation.  More and more, we seem to downplay who we are, a part of mainstreaming which all members should objectively admit is occurring.  
 I think Denise Austin does a decent job in some of her other videos, but this isn't one of them.  She lacks any type of warm up in this one and often looks like she's just trying to make up steps in order to fill the time slot.  The moves are not well choreographed and very awkward.  Some may find encouragement in the times Denise gives the camera a bug eyed stare and says "We're burning butter.... yeah" but I found it annoying.  I think there are much better workouts for the money out there 
 i had high expectation on this product since i was very satisfied with previous Revere purchase. but this time i was completely disappointed. the saucepans and stockpot have extremely thin walls. as a result, they are to be handled with care, otherwise they will be out of shape easily. 
 I found this book to be overly simplfied and not very helpful accept maybe to the most novice sculptor. The appoach is that of amateur craft not serious art. I thought the photos of examples to be most uninspiring 
 I truly believe in the power of the mind. In so much as we can control our own thoughts we have tremendous control over our own moods and lives and can consequently impact the lives of those around us, but on a psychological level only.  The authors' attempt to link the power of thought beyond our own bodies through actual physical phenomenon, like vibration, is unscholarly at best.  The authors backup their claims with citations of the work of other "scientists", but a little investigation shows that they are simply backing up junk science with more junk science. The reference to work of Dr. Masaru Emoto's with ice crystals, for example, not only has no bearing on their subject matter, but has been discredited for its lack of scientific rigor.  Had the authors stayed in the psychological realm and not ventured into the physical sciences they might have maintained their creditability and produced a truly interesting piece of work. Unfortunately they did not.  
 this movie is dissapointing, albeit the great perfomances by both Garcia Bernal and Cecilia Roth. Cecilia Roth plays the role of a mentally unstable woman in her 40s who falls in love with 22 year old Garcia Bernal. The movie fails in giving the audience enough to make the story-line believable. Never understood why/how Garcia Bernal falls in love to a woman that only gave orders, didn't show her face and almost didn't talk. This just an example of many other events that come out of nowhere. The ending is abrupt and one is left with the feeling of having wasted 2 hours 
 The introduction was the only part of this book that I found worth reading.  In it, Shaheen gives an overview of racist stereotyping of Arabs in Hollywood films.  The introduction was interesting and left me wanting more details and more in-depth discussion, but the rest of the book completely fails to follow up on the expectations raised by the introduction.    The bulk of this thick book's 600 pages is devoted to an alphabetical list of films, each with a capsule summary (usually less than a full page) of the how Arabs are portrayed in that film.  There is no detailed discussion of the content of any of the films.  So this is a reference book, rather than a book of film history or scholarship.  But, a reference work is only as good as its indexes, and the indexes to Reel Bad Arabs are woefully inadequate.  There is an index of least and most racist films and of key films, an index of alternate titles, and an index of all films by name. And that's all. There is no index of films by date, by genre, by director, writer, or producer, or by the categories of stereotypes that Shaneen discusses all too briefly in his introduction. Unless you already know the title of the film you wish to refer to, the lack of detailed indexes make this book all-but useless. 
 This book is a work of fiction, a sad display of the authors fantasies and exaggerations.  If Geoffrey wants to write fiction, why does he have to plaster a real person's name on it.  In another country, he'd have been ordered to make retribution for his slander, and this sorry excuse for a book would have been pulled off the shelves.  It's very sad that he feels a need to make his living this way.  I encourage him to go write about Bigfoot.  That is the only subject his skills are suitable for.  George lived with quiet dignity in an insane world.  No one deserves to have lies and exaggerations of this kind printed about them, least of all George Harrison.  
 When I had first heard of Dream Boogie, a 700-page biography of the late Sam Cooke, I was ecstatic.  Up until that point, I had only known of one other biography of Sam Cooke - You Send Me, which I haven't gotten around to reading.  I eagerly bought a copy of the book from my local Barnes & Noble, expecting an enormous gem of truth about Sam, that would prove to be both through and entertaining.  For readers of this review, there is now a third Sam Cooke biography, written by Erik Greene entitled:  "Our Uncle Sam".  Who is Erik Greene, you may ask?  He's Sam's great nephew.  But let us return to Dream Boogie.  Peter Guralnick is known as the definitive biographer of Sam Cooke, having written liner notes for digitally-remastered CDs and much more.  Peter Guralnick worked on writing and gathering the materials for Dream Boogie for more than fifteen years.  Therefore, one might well assume that he would write an enormous gem of truth that proved to be both through and entertaining.    Let us begin with the good points of this 700-page biography.  Peter Guralnick chose to interview a large portion of the Sam Cooke family, something Daniel Wolff did not do.  Naturally, Erik Greene did.  Guralnick includes commentary from his father, his brothers, his sisters, his business associates, his close friends, and most importantly, his widow.  Barbara Cooke, ever since the death of her husband, has never conducted any interviews regarding Sam for the past forty years.  Naturally, she provides a unique but also a brutally honest commentary regarding her life and Sam's.  However, Guralnick does not deviate from his course - he is still extremely through (to say the least) in the actual history of Sam's life.  He doesn't miss a single thing.  In my opinion, there is a flaw to this.  In the art of writing, if you're too through with a subject, you will bog the reader down immensely.  Guralnick gets an A+ on this one.  Throughout the 700-page biography, Guralnick succeeds in providing the reader with so very much information that is indeed interesting, but not important to the overall history of Sam.  He also succeeds in doing the exact opposite over the more important and memorable aspects of Sam's life.  In the 1950s, he stood up against the police in Memphis after the police told him to push the car to the side of the road.  Specifically, he told him:  "Sir, my name is Sam Cooke.  If you haven't heard of me, your wife knows me.  When you get home tonight, you ask your wife if she knows Sam Cooke.  I don't push no car.  This is my car, my brother ran out of gas.  I'm not pushing it.  You want to put a ticket on it, put a ticket on it.  But I don't push no car.  Not mine, not yours, not nobody's elses.  I'm not a pusher.  I'm a singer."  Sam then proceeded to sit back in his car, his brother came with the gas, and they left.  The police left them alone.    Depending upon your interpretation, this could be seen as one of the first steps for Sam regarding the Civil Rights Movement, which led to his greatest composition, "A Change Is Gonna Come", an African-American response to Bob Dylan's "Blowing in the Wind".  This also leads to another flaw in Guralnick's work, a complete lie over an important television appearance of Sam.  Daniel Wolff also makes the same mistake.  In February of 1964, Sam appeared on The Tonight Show and it's known that he sang "Basin Street Blues" as the performance still survives.  However, according to both Guralnick and Wolff, Sam also sang "A Change Is Gonna Come" on the same show.  I'm not sure what Wolff does in an attempt to prove this, but Guralnick uses a cue sheet with a similar title to "A Change Is Gonna Come" to prove that Sam did indeed sing the song.    I recently contacted a Carson archivist, and Sam never sung the song.  It took me a day to figure it out.  Guralnick worked on this book for more than fifteen years.  If he went through such work to that the song was planned, why wouldn't he check the log book of the episode to see if Sam sung the song to be completely sure?  During the days of The Tonight Show, some guests would exceed the length of time they occupied and therefore, some guests would never make it onto the show.    Perhaps that's not a very big flaw in the biography of Sam; it's only a single event.  Consider this.  On the eighth page of the biography, there is a picture with the caption "A very young Sam Cooke".  The eighth page and Guralnick makes a major mistake.  It's not Sam.  It's his brother, L.C.  Three months after the book was released, the mistake was corrected.  If Guralnick cannot properly identify a photo of the person he's writing about, what other mistakes is he prone to make in the book?  Perhaps the biggest mistake Guralnick makes is stating that the official version of events concerning Sam's death was how it went down.  As I read the chapter regarding Sam's death, I seriously considered whether or not Guralnick was employed by Allen Klein, whom Sam was planning to fire.  Who was Allen Klein?  I don't know too much about him myself, but I do know that he swindled the Cooke family out of the royalties of Sam's catalog with help from one of Sam's daughters and his widow.  I do know that he also conned The Beatles as well as The Rolling Stones.  That's about it.  Yet, he uses Allen Klein's and Barbara Cooke's commentary exclusively.  If you do a Google search about the death of Sam, you'll find an analysis of the "official" version of events that pokes five large gaping holes into the official version of events.  In addition, the coroner's inquest was a complete joke and contradicted itself numerous times.  Daniel Wolff didn't believe the official version of events, Sam's fans don't believe the official version of events, and Sam's family doesn't believe the official version of events.  Pretty much no one believes the official version of events other than Guralnick.    I'm not sure what Wolff does to debate what really happened that night, but Erik Greene includes a report in his book that is extremely different from the official version of events.  Well, you may say that he would naturally do that, considering Sam was a member of his family.  Instead of using the "facts" from the coroner's inquest and related events, Greene chooses to tackle the mystery of Sam's death via a pathology report.  Scientifically speaking, I believe that it's quite accurate.    Here's the rather discerning part.  Peter Guralnick is known as the definitive biographer of Sam Cooke.  But of course, no biography doesn't have its flaws.  However, keep in mind that I do not cite all the mistakes made in Dream Boogie.  I can probably cite four or five more off the top of my head.  But I think I've trashed the book enough.  What's the worst part?  The flaws in Dream Boogie, known as the Sam Cooke Bible, could be perhaps passed off as truth by a less-than-familiar (historically speaking) Sam Cooke fan, and are blatantly obvious to the die-hard fans of Sam Cooke.    If you want a good biography of Sam that is entertaining, through, and truthful, either check out Wolff's biography or Greene's biography, which I highly recommend, which was by a member of the family of Sam Cooke 
 Let me start by saying I am an avid Sci-Fi reader, the longer the book the better. I believe a good story takes a long time to tell ala Harry Turtledove. So when I read the plot and saw the book size, I thought I was in for a good read. I could not have been more incorrect. Here are my bullet points:  1) Excellent plot idea, but I think Baxter forgot what is was after the first 12 pages. I have never been a part of such a plot trainwreck as this. Its like he compiled a dozen different stories into one without any of them going anywhere. 2) Character developement was horrendous. He needs to take a lesson from Harry Turtledove or Kevin Anderson. Those guys can present twenty or more characters, make you remember and love each one, this guy can't do it with two. 3) Science. About the only thing this guy can get across, but its not involving, its like reading a NASA technical paper, done with lots of coffee. 4) Writing. He needs to take a lesson from Jack McDevitt. You need to make the book an incredible journey independent of the ending. I begged for the ending just to finish the book. If Nemoto was one thousand years old, I felt like it half way through the book. Baxter's writing style is cold and easily forgotten.   The plot to this review, skip this book. It goes everywhere and nowhere all at once. I implore Baxter to work on his writing style and present more concise plot lines, eliminate all the extra about prehistoric men crapping on themselves on Jupiter's moon and stick to the plot. The editors need to quite screwing around and edit these books. Like previous readers, the book could have been cut in half.. 
 Let me start by saying that I know firsthand how hard it is to pull off a believable thriller. I wrote "Process of Elimination" - a complicated story about a private investigator who becomes entangled in a political murder conspiracy. I worked hard to make the story both fun and smart - things I enjoy in a book. Of course their are also hefty doses of realistic combat, sex, and engaging characters. If interested, you can find "Process of Elimination" on Amazon. End of my shameless plug -- on with the review.  In the past, I have enjoyed Patterson's works - most especially those featuring Alex Cross. The stories are entertaining, but I think what I like most is his character development. As readers, we feel like we know Alex, Nana, and the whole peanut butter eating clan. The good news is that Patterson keeps us right "in the family" with 4 Blind Mice. The bad news is that he's lost something in this latest book... believable storytelling.   The story starts off with the brutal murder of some women. An army sergeant is convicted of their murder. The evidence seems overwhelming - DNA, murder weapon, witnesses. He calls in Sampson to help clear his name before they put him to death for a crime he didn't commit. So in my opinion, the story gets a good start. But from that point on, well, it just gets stupid. I laughed as I read the story, and I don't think Patterson meant for it to be so outlandish that it was funny.  What's wrong with the story? Let's start with just how quickly they put Sampson's buddy to death. He's convicted, and wham bang, he's dead. Uh -- yeah, sure it works like that. Then there's the impossible murder scenes. Let's see, three grown men rush into houses, brutally slaughter the inhabitants, then paint their faces or bodies. Yet no neighbor sees or hears a thing. No physical evidence is left at the scenes (not even bloody footprints). Everything goes impossibly perfect for the murderers. And not just once, but over and over. In fact they kill police, prostitutes, hikers, you name it. Not only do they kill them, but they create stooges to go down for the perfect murders. And no one ever finds a drop of evidence? Hmm...    Fortunately, to complement the world's luckiest set of bad guys is the world's dummest detectives. Cross and Sampson actually discover who the murderers are through someone else's help - they can't do it on their own. They then go and cause trouble with them, why I'm not quite sure. They then go back home and go shopping for groceries. It's like they think that the murderers aren't willing to hop a flight and come find them. I would think if you're rousting a group of brutal murderers, you might actually take a few precautions. When they finally do have the "big shootout," Cross and Sampson use their tiny intellects to rush into the cabin, guns a blazing. Of course they don't hit anyone -- both need more target practice I think. There is way too much galantry and not enough thinking going on here.  Don't get me wrong, the whole book was entertaining and fast paced. But more so as a satire of a real police thriller. If you need a good laugh, pick this one up. If you're looking for something more intelligent or serious, definitely look elsewhere. 
 The fact is this guy does not give the most solid advice for directing.  He rips on Spielberg, and basicly calls martin scorsese a Hack.  He tells you that a good idea is to sleep with your producers to secure you job, just a lot of things that are not that helpfull.  He does have some good things to say, but you have to dig through so much crap that it's not really worth it.  There are plenty of other good books out there, and this would be one to pass on 
 This film may possibly be the worst about this topic ever made. The performances are terrible. Particularly Lance Henrikson as Lincoln. He appears to be doing an impersonation of Gregory Peck playing Lincoln and a very bad one at that. The portrayal of Booth seems to come about from the makers of this film watching too many 90s serial killer shockers. I particaularly like the scene where Morrow is wearing granny sunglasses that make him look like a reject from Strawberry Alarm Clock. His portrayal of Booth as the crazed maniac is laughable. The sets however are very credible and appealing. Overall a terrible film. Avoid it unless you are in the mood for a good laugh 
 I hate when non-Christians attack Christian books and claim to have read them.  This isn't one of those cases.  I am a sincere Christian who loves half of what Yancey writes and finds the other half to be somewhat forced.  I bought this book with lots of anticipation.  I loved the title and was eager to explore its contents.  After several weeks, I was only able to make it halfway through the book.  Boredom stopped me in my tracks. Not one of Yancey's best efforts.  I'm not trying to be mean, rather, just want to give the purchaser a true observation.  Don't get me wrong, two of Yancey's books are SPECTACULAR.  Those would be "The Jesus I Never Knew" (Which I consider to be the best book ever written) and "Disappointment with God" (Which also was spectacular).  If you want a good book, read one of these two works of Yancey's.  As for "Reaching the Invisible God," I wouldn't buy it 
 When I got this book I was expecting some good advice. But what I found was a bunch of ridiculous crap. She suggests that all meat eaters are "blocked vegetarians" ... they really want to be vegetarians but they have fears. Give me a break, she couldn't be more wrong. The book does not offer practical advice and just adds to the idea that vegetarians are weird people. Trying telling a meat eater you think they are a blocked vegetarian and see the roars that will get you. This author offers a fantasy world, it's not based on reality. Plus she starts the book out with bumper stickers and saying about vegetarians... like vegetarians don't also have bumper stickers and saying about meat eating? Please! She portrays us as victims of meat eaters, and misses the idea that groups like PETA are out there making vegetarians look like complete idiots. If you want to read this book I would suggest you get it used or at the library, it's not worth buying. It's good for a laugh only. "Blocked vegetarians"... LOL! Give me a break 
 i liken this book to fitzgerald's "tender is the night." and that is not a good thing. people of no substance plod through hundreds of dull dull pages. are people really this shallow? this empty? probably. but, my god, do i have to read about them? no. i do not. i simply could not finish this book (and that is rare). i wasted valuble reading time for about 300 pages, then had to admit it just wasn't working. because of all the critical acclaim this book recieved, i was very much looking forward to reading it. what a major disappointment! i am truly puzzled by the positive response this thing gets from so many people. great writing? really? i just did not see much of that here. shouldn't a book have at least one interesting character in it? it seems that dullness is making a comback in critical circles these days. too bad 
 Wow. Good thing I didn't buy this book.  Looking at all these reviews there seems to be two catagories of people who rate this book.  The normal people catagory and the bling bling people who cash in on this book only to recommend their own books. And when you look at their profiles and see what books they have reviewed it's very little. It's obvious people want to cash in the name of the books ("Men are from Mars....)  One reviewer talks about his sex drive being improved then recommends his own book.  Seriously, shut up.  We live in a society where sex sells and the idea of if you want to be beautiful you have to get this book.  Don't be fooled. This book is BS and you will feel bad because another diet didn't work.  There are better diet books out there. John Gray is just trying to cash in in the weight loss craze just like Dr. Phil.  AND if you truly want to lose weight and need discipline weight watchers is great. If you are reading this you are a smart consumer don't invest in this poser, wanna be diet book. 
 Albeit you'll learn many things about Area 7 & 8. Although you'll learn about chemical  and nuke weapons, this book's really boring. Each chapter begins with a persecution. So, how many persecutions could you read in a book? How many times the book's hero can save himself or being save by other person? At half book when you're still reading persecutions, you'll know that Schofield and Gant will survive. About the inexistent love story that of course is pathetic I won't write more. So if you like my kind of books (check my listmania! list) don't read this one 
 A friend of mine works for an petrochemical exploration company.  They specialize in determining potential locations of oil deposits by drilling cores into layers of sedimentary deposits and looking at the evolutionary sequences of micro-fossils which were accumulated millions of years ago on ancient sea-floors. Oil (and coal) deposits formed when decaying plant matter became buried under sediments and underwent subsequent chemical alteration.  The plant material requires millions of years to be converted into oil or coal. (They're called fossil fuel for a reason, you know.)  When you analyze a drill core sample, and if you find particular micro-fossils of species that only lived during a certain geological age that corresponds to the age when oil deposits formed, then you might be in an area where oil can be found.  Her company gets contacts from huge oil companies to help them make multi-billion dollar decisions on where to drill for oil based partly on the information obtained by looking at micro-fossils.  Oil companies have been doing this for decades. Don't believe me.  Find out for yourself.  Search the internet for websites about oil exploration micropaleontology.  Next time you fill your tank, consider the role evolution played in both the creation and the discovery of the gas you're pumping into your car.  I own stock in the company my friend works for and have made some nice returns on it.  I also have a relative who works for a medical research institute that uses DNA analysis to find out how viruses and genetic defects cause disease.  He's working on therapies for several types of cancer.  They use genetic mutations and evolutionary histories of diseases to understand how cells, viruses and diseases operate.  They've already had success with some drugs and I've made money off of a drug company's stock as a result.  The science is way over my head.  However, based on the logic of this book, you have to conclude that genetic mutations can't be studied with any certainty because it seems they can occur only if and when God wants them to.  I don't know how I'll be able to break it to him but I guess someone will have to tell him that his research is simply a waste of time.  I know that seems at odds with the fact I've made money off the stock market . . . but Phillip Johnson wants me to have an open mind after all, and, let's face it, he's so much smarter than these people.  I can't imagine how insulting it must be to intelligent, dedicated, highly educated, hard working, honest, professional people like these, who use the principles of evolution in their day to day work, in billion dollar industries, for them to hear people say that evolution didn't happen or that it is just an ideology. (I should sell the stock in these companies soon, before they crash when word gets out that evolution is a myth.)  Folks, there is a tremendous amount of information supporting evolution. In all honesty, it is downright silly to contend at this point that living things have not evolved over the eons.  It is simply a fact of life.  It is not a religious belief or an opinion.  I urge you to truly inform yourselves about evolution from sources other than creationists or  IDers or whatever they call themselves.  Look at the depth and detail of information supporting evolution.  There are many websites about it. Check them out.  Look at some professional research journals on subjects related to biology, geology, palenotology, etc.  Ask yourself, "Can this tremendous amount of detailed information accumulated by researchers for hundreds of years really be fake or incorrect?"  "Are all the thousands of highly intelligent, highly educated people around the world who are currently conducting research on evolution, as well as those using it in their daily work, all wrong?"  "Would scientists at the most prestigious universities in the world really deliberately lie about this?"  "Why would they risk being caught in a lie and ruin their professional careers?"  Please, be realistic about science.  And, by the way, you can be Christian and fully accept evolution.  I do.  So do the friend and relative I mentioned above.  Of course, I guess we're just closed-minded. 
 There ARE some good ideas in here. Unfortunately I just couldn't get past the fact that it is such a thin book with a lot of rehashed stuff. 14.95 is a lot to pay for a magazine, even if some of the ideas are OK. Also, Ms. Stewart doesn't seem to feel the need to test her recipes out first. When following ANY of her recipes, allow a little extra time for recipe adjustment. 
 King certainly lends a high-profile to this collection of latter-day noir writing and tough-guy procedurals, but I believe he created something a little too far outside the readership's expected genre for this series. The setting and characters are recognizable (now trite?) staples of his beloved Maine coast, and he works at bringing their "down east" mannerisms to life with language that rings of "Bert & I" lobstermen. I wasn't particularly caught up in the aged newspapermen's tale of their quest to identify a mysterious dead man found on the local beach. And the ending ... well, um ... the ending is definitely an open-ender. King cleverly covers himself by adding a disclaimer of sorts that the story won't appeal to many readers. Yep. You got that right, Stephen. No gunplay, no boozers, no saucy dames, no double-crosses, no slangy patter, no real satisfaction for me. I suggest Hard Crime afficionados skip this entry and look to some of the heavy-hitters from the past 
 I purchased this book on the strength of the reviews I saw here, and was seriously misled by the title, the self description, and the reviews. This is by no means a survey of the extant Chinese mythology, nor even a readable book. It concerns itself exclusively with the earliest strata of Chinese myth, which are preserved in verey fragmentary form in later sources. It does quote liberally from these, but the references are, even in full, so short as to be nearly useless. They are snippets and bare mentions of lost tales, not anything one could call full myths.   The book is valuable as a reference work for those concerned with  this early and almost entirely lost layer of Chinese literature, but the interest for the non-specialist in this byway of archaic Chinese religion and lit is hard to fathom.  As for methodology, there is none. Birrel invokes Eliade and Dumezil (which is nice) and Levi Strauss (which is useless) among others, and cites many parallels from Greco-Roman myth. But there is nothing that could be called substantive analysis or insight.   This is in fine just the sort of useful, dilligent, careful and intellectually mediocre volume that wins the praise of captious academics. To recommend it to the intelligent general reader is an act of malice or stupidity 
 It's too bad most Americans have only read one book on globalization, i.e.,  Firedman's middlebrow, misinfomed tome. Friedman makes "arguments by assertion," assertions based not on documented facts, but on stories from friends and elite CEOs he visits --not even one footnote reference. Yet his book influences business and government leaders around the globe. By what it leaves out, it does nothing more than misinform the American people and our leaders.  Actually, the world isn't flat; it's tilted in favor of unfettered global corporations that exploit cheap labor in China, India and beyond. Instead I suggest you read, "The World is Flat?" by Aronica & Ramdo. This concise monograph brings clarity to many of Friedman's misconceptions, and explores nine key issues that Friedman largely ignores, including the hollowing out of America's debt-ridden middle class. To create a balanced exploration of globalization, the authors cite the work of experts that Friedman fails to incorporate, including Nobel laureate and former Chief Economist at the World Bank, Dr. Joseph Stiglitz.   Refreshingly, you can now gain new insights into globalization without weeding through Friedman's almost 600 pages of ill-informed, grandiloquent prose and bafflegab 
 -Everyone expressing a erudite opinion about Clausewitz or "ON WAR" has completely missed the point here.  -The question is NOT whether Clausewitz or "On War" is an essential read for everyone interested in military hsitory or military affairs. THAT is a moot piont to the Nth Degree.  -The REAL question IS - WHY would you pay $595.oo for a book that has the same identical information as another book for $30.oo ?!?!?!?   -That is the ONLY question regarding THIS particular version of "ON WAR".  -Its the ECONOMICS, stupid ! 
 Lilly has always been the self-proclaimed feminist, but her influence on Mia definitely showed in this latest addition to the Princess Diaries series. Problem: Mia wants to attend the senior prom, but her boyfriend Michael doesn't want to, and it's only through him that she can go. Instead of considering what he wants, she whines and tries to subtly coerce him into going to the dance. She convinces her classmates to hire Michael's band to perform at the dance, further showing her true colors as it goes against even the band members' own wishes. The value she places on herself and her own desires, above the desires of others, is utterly selfish and disgusting. I strongly recommend NOT reading this book, it really made me dislike Mia as a character.  Why is the prom more important than respecting someone else's wishes? If Mia and Michael were so compatible, they wouldn't be split on this issue. From her insistence on the prom (which also seems uncharacteristic for her to want so badly), to the feminist view that men are oppressors and women shouldn't take their husbands' last names after marriage, Lilly's cold disregard for Boris' feelings and later hypocrisy over him and Tina, to the hateful quote that women need men like a fish needs a bicycle, and Mia's goal to "mold" her little brother into the perfect (read: pussified) boyfriend...shame on you, Ms. Cabot. You make masculinity something to be suppressed and ashamed of, when it should be revered.  Also, as some reviewers have said, 15 is a bit young to be exploring sexually, and it's illogical for Mia and Lilly to join in on such behavior. Since when does turning 15 equate with 'becoming a woman'? Kind of an odd thing to say 
 Here's a list of what's wrong with this item:<br /> 1. You'll stain your wrist trying to screw in the hex and other screws.<br /> 2. The wood is cheap and can split when screwing in screws.<br /> 3. The wood panel for the drawer was warped and didn't fit.<br /> 4. It's from J.P. Products - who doesn't provide customer service during listed business hours, nor do they have a web site.<br /> Overall: avoid this product. It's a shame Target is willing to offer such an inferior item.<br /> 
 The review title says it all.... 
 I got this book in hopes that it would tell me something about diet and arthritis.  It is mostly about eliminating things from your diet, in order to isolate food alergies.  In general, I was unimpressed with this book.  Other than advising that you be conscious of food alergies, it is little more than advice on healthy diet.  You can get that anywhere without paying $20.  "Eat your fruits and veggies."  There.  You've read the book 
 I returned this biofeedback software and hardware. I was happy with Amazon's quick credit back to my credit card, but i found this purchase totally lacking. The games it had you play were boring and i wouldn't suggest buying this for doing biofeedback 
 It looks nice but the lid touches the top of the butter and sticks to it 
 Although it looks the same as the HG Wells story and the 1960 movie, this bastardization of the source material turns a frightening story about man's nature into a mildly fun sci-fi outing. Alexander's motivation for building the Time Machine is entirely different, and what he learns 80,000 years in the future could have been deduced by a more probing scientific mind (that is, if it was used to dealing with less than scientific cinematic time-travel paradoxes).  So the first half of the movie wreaks havoc on the source material and pales in comparison with the fabulous creativity of the George Pal version. We don't even find out anything about what we are about to see!  But things get worse is in the distant future. Although the writing tries to dance around the fact -- they have de-fanged the harsh reality of the Eloi and softened the horriffic underpinnings of their naivete. Instead of unknowing sheep, they are new-agey world-culture pluralists. The dichotomization of the human race really makes little sense. And there is no Rod Taylor running about castigating the apathy of his hosts.  The only reason why I give the film two stars is because it is one of the only genuine sci-fi films in years, and I found some of the special FX (the moon) and Jeremy Irons, cheesy as they may have been, fun 
 Who is her editor?  The main character self-analyzes to the point of nausea. We got it. We do not need the author to explain to us what she is trying to say.  I felt, as the reader, that the author did not trust me to "get" her own work. It would have been a much better novel had she given her readers more credit. Not to mention, if she grew up in a cold family, with no experiences to open up her sexuality and sensuality, I did not buy that one boyfriend would all of a sudden be a panacea to a lifetime of suppression. 
 Last Minute Knitted Gifts is one of my favorite knitting books, so I bought this book hoping to find lots of inspiration for cute sewing projects.  Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with it.  Many of the patterns (scarves, blankets, dishtowels, a sarong) involve not much more than buying a large piece of fabric and hemming it. Some projects are not sewing projects per se, but rather involve felting (felted rocks?  Seriously?), or simply using fusible interfacing to attach fabric to things.  While the results of all of these types of projects aren't unattractive, I'd rather use my limited crafting time to create, rather than embellish, and I certainly don't need a book to tell me that if you hem a piece of fabric, you can call it a blanket.  As for the actual sewing projects--well, some are cute, but if you can't find versions of them for free on Craftster or the crafty blogs, you're not looking very hard.  There are some cute projects here--a darling felt bunny, a patchwork pillow, a hooded towel that would make a great baby gift--but overall, I think anyone who is interested in more than basic beginner-level fabric projects would be better served by Amy Butler's In Stitches or Denyse Schmit Quilts. At the very least, I'd look at this book in a store before you spend the money 
 Rubbish. There is no such thing as Zionism as represented in this book. There is no global, centralized political body of any Jewish anything, and there never was. Israel is not run by "Zionists". The original socialist Zionists died out decades ago. It was merely a movement to establish statehood for a few people who were admittedly, communist. It had nothing to do with world power or money and the religious world and vast majority of Jews were against it. There are a few religious "Zionists" but that is completely different. They are a minority and have no real power or desire to do anything other than to live in Israel 
 There is frankly no 'truth' to be found in this publication.  Aside from the previously circulated speculation regarding Hillary Clinton's political aspirations and orentation, her knowledge of and duplicity inside the Lewinsky affair, and her march to the Senate, this work is void of anything but base conjecture and one-sided analyses which offer no depth and villify the women's movement in 21st century America at large.  I had the double misfortune of perusing this volume via CD.  The material is made far less credible by Mr. Klein's own wheezy and wet-sounding reading of his work.  I address this first because I am part of a large number of technoservants who spend 8-10 hours per day with no diversions during a monotonous coding job but for headphones, and I want explicitly to warn any readers from the audio version of this work.  It begins with an inane and unintentionally ridiculous buzzing sound from somewhere at the top of Klein's palate and carries on with sardonic emphasis placed on repeated terms such as:  'lesbianism', 'leftist' and 'aspiration'.  Spaced at roughly equal intervals (making one further question the very validity of research), Klein gleefully quotes Mr. and Mrs. Clinton, their aides and supporters, and the altogether too-rare addition of Clinton apoligists in making vulgar statements.  A professional narrator understands the proper treatment of the profanity that occurs (and is only attributed to the Clinton camp) in situations such as this, and Klein clearly does not.  Klein's very decision to narrate his own narrative is a poor one, and further displays the partisanship that he clearly wishes to convey with every written word of it.  As to the substance, and contrary to the title, there are no revelations about Mrs. Clinton contained anywhere within this narrative.  And I sincerely mean that - Klein has acheived no investigative credibility in simply regurgitating what is already known about the Senator.  The speculations regarding her sexuality (or, as Klein would argue, her very lack thereof), her role in Mr. Clinton's sexual escapades and the Lewinsky affair, and the politicking that took place in New York are either matters of public record or outright conjecture that would make Kenneth Starr look like a law-and-order hawk.    With reference to what the title leads the casual browser to believe is the centerstone of the book (what she knew about the Lewinsky affair), Klein does nothing but recirculate rumors and ideas that any half-informed person has already heard:  that Hillary knew about Bill's affair with Monica, that she did nothing to stop it, and even that she was reponsible (!!!) for it because it was her connections that lead to Lewinsky's entrance to the White House.  There is a contradictory juxtaposition here - Klein leads the reader on into this affair shortly after explaining that a young Hillary Rodham launched a verbal tirade against harrassment of interns while an intern herself.  Klein mistakenly presumes that everyone will nod at his faulty logic (that Hillary became the enabler of a concept she defames), yet it actually illustrates that Hillary is what she claims to be:  her own woman, independent of Bill himself.  As a disclaimer, I do not support Hillary Clinton.  I believe that she is a disengenuous person, willing to sacrifice her own rather confrontational ideas in favor of pursuit of public office.  But Klein makes this argument foolish.  His barely disguised anymosity for the Democratic party at large and his not-at-all disguised disdain for feminism which borders on outright sexism within this very narrative (he frequently charactarizes Hillary's crowd as a group of butch supporters of what HE has dubbed 'lesbianism') is nothing short of inane.  This narrative is poorly organized, and the silly quips with which he ends each of the far too numerous 'chapters' are representative of, well, nothing at all.  Possibly the saddest commentary I can offer is that this narrative is wrought with inconsitency on both an intellectual and factual level (as Klein altogether too often relies on sources who 'jumped ship' from the Clinton camp and he treats his conjecture as actual evidence, often citing 'facts' that are no more than his own speculation of Hillary's mindset), and has no organization to fall back on except the aforementioned large number of 'chapters'.  This work just rambles on and on while saying, well, nothing.  Finally, readers may chuckle to see that Klein has printed a number of glaring grammatical errors:  at one point he says that Hillary wore contact lenses that make her eyes 'bluer'.  In summation, this work needs to carry the disclaimer:  "Paid for by the Republican National Commitee" in exactly the same way the Michael Moore's "Faranheit:  911" needed a discalimer for the Democratic party.  That way the casual browser or, in my case, the frankly interested citizen preparing to make voting decisions for the 2008 primaries would just keep browsing.  There is nothing in Klein's work that suggests any effort on his part to search for the 'truth' he erroneously claims to offer; only the 'cut-and-paste' [... 
 As a life-long nudist, I was very disappointed with the DVD compared with the theatrical release that I saw in the mid 1980s. The theatrical release opened with many shots of the nude beaches, and continued this theme quite simply and unashamedly throughout the whole movie. Many nude beach scenes have been deleted altogether from the DVD and the few remaining scenes are cut drastically, in my view detracting badly from the spirit and freedom of the Greek islands at the time portrayed in the original movie 
 All Covey is saying in his longwinded book, basically, is this: Listen to the people you love. Put the family first in all your decisions. Blah blah blah and something about synergy.  The writing is horrible, and the metaphors are overused. I also dislike Covey's plagiarizing material from the Bible and not acknowledging where he gets his "inspiration".  In one passage he equates the Bible and other books of scripture with "Chicken Soup For the Soul" as "wisdom literature".  Despite being a supposed devout Mormon himself, obviously he's afraid to mention the Book of Mormon in that passage. Perhaps he's afraid of scaring away potential pigeons--I mean, readers.   This was a book my book club decided to read; otherwise I'd have never even tried to get past the first few pages. I wonder how a man who is on the road more often than not can really interact with his own family and give "us", the poor ignorant masses, advice on our own families. In one passage he even says that other people's advice may not apply to our own situations. Then how can he expect us to take his advice?   Don't waste your money. If you absolutely must read it, get it from the library. Covey doesn't need your money, he has a huge house with a basketball court and indoor pool. He's doing fine. 
 PRIVATE RESORT is the kind of movie that was geared towards young adult audiences in the mid-80s when sexual awareness and exposition were the hot ticket in theatres.  However, I'm sure this film is one that Johnny Depp, Hector Elizondo and Rob Morrow aren't proud to have on their resume. The movie's plot is slim, and neither Morrow or Depp have any screen presence in this early stage of their careers.  Elizondo tries gamely and pulls off a few laughs, but he's not at his best either.  Most of the film's laughs come from Leslie Hope as a slightly off kilter cosmic bimbo; Dody Goodman as a dotty old lady who knows karate and Tony Azito as a bumbling hotel security guard.  There's lots of slapstick, some of it works, most of it doesn't.  You can do better, folks 
 Hello!  I was STUNNED by how badly written this book was. ESPECIALLY as one of the authors is supposedly a department chairman at Cornell University! The same unimportant items are repeated over and over and over throughout this short (large type, few words on page) book. Paragraphs or sections start out describing something, get a third or halfway through the thought, then stop abruptly with the authors apparently forgetting to include the needed information to finish the paragraph or section.  The Columbine school shootings are mentioned repeatedly, for no particularly useful reason that I can see, other than to "cash in" on the incident. A single mention of this incident would have been far more than enough to make the few points they wanted to make about it.  A totally useless 8 page or so section, goes on to describe special needs of RICH(!) parents to deal with their children! Special care was taken to describe how wonderful the rich were who could save wealth (I would imagine that this is how the authors view themselves. WHAT was this doing in this book in the first place???). No such special section on child advice was included for either middle class, or poor parents. I found this section to be particularly insulting to just about everyone.  The authors in several places in the book say directly or indirectly how wonderful they are, or how wonderful their book is. This was galling and completely unneccessary.  While touting the book as offering detailed advice on child rearing, this is in essence an outright lie. The little advice they offer is so vague as to be virtually useless.  To save all of you the trouble of reading this book, here are the few points they made: love your child, listen to your child, give your child firm structure and guidance. That's about it. This is just about as detailed as they got with their advice. As you will note, their "advice" is virtually useless in helping parents with specific child rearing problems.  I have read NUMEROUS, much, much better books on child rearing; that quoted research, and then, IN DETAIL, gave many specific, detailed techniques that any normal parent could use with their children. Not ONE single detailed technique was EVER mentioned in this book. NOT ONE.  While research is quoted in this book from time to time, it is mainly along the lines of, "Ain't life horrible nowadays?" In other words, they mentioned many problems, BUT, no solutions. Virtually NO studies were quoted that described solutions to parenting problems.  I am still stunned that Simon and Schuster published this (the hardback edition). I could have forgiven the very poor writing if there had been useful parenting information in this book, but there was none.  I would have given this book ZERO stars if I had been allowed to.  MANY other books are available that are light years ahead of this book in every possible way; please look there for child rearing advice.  Kar 
 Not enough mention of the confrontation between Darth Vader and Lando Calrissian 
 I fell in love with Robin McKinley with the novel Beauty, her first write of the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale.  It was an amazing novel, and I was excited to see she had rewritten the tale a second time.  Rose Daughter, however, falls sadly short of McKinley's other work.  The writing style is difficult and choppy to follow, too many sentences are strung together to make the words flow smoothly.  This was the greatest drawback to the novel and made it much inferior to Beauty.  At the story's finish, you realize the novel has only spanned a few days, but it felt like centuries to wade through McKinley's over-wordiness and failing attempts at a more "advanced" writing style.  What is more, Rose Daughter isn't different enough to even have points for originality, or a very clever plot.  I would definitely suggest against purchasing this book, and instead sticking to Beauty 
 The author argues that we Americans have been throwing our weight around.  And that we ought to embrace multilateralism and international law.  Well, that sounds really good.  Just what could be wrong with that?    The main problem is that even if we Americans have been unfair and unjust, there is little reason to believe that we'll be better off if we give more power to an international group.  Such a group could be united against us, and it could make things worse for everyone (and really bad for us Americans).  Probably, we'd be assured at the start of the group's good intentions.  But after we conceded enough power, we'd get double-crossed.  Well, there isn't too much chance of that!  The United Nations, the International Criminal Court, and others have made their intentions pretty clear.  And so does the author.  We're talking about a wolf in wolf's clothing.  I think one important issue the author deals with is the Arab-Israeli conflict.  As he says, "On no issue is the gulf between America and the rest of the world greater than on" this.  Well, given that the issue is so important, what does Prestowitz say?    Well, he refuses to blame the Arab side for the failure of the Camp David negotiations.  And he says that Sharon's walk on the Temple Mount was about as bad an idea as one could have.  Okay, I have a few questions:  1)  If the Arab case has any merit, why is it promoted almost exclusively by terror and lies?  Does he think that such terror and lies ought to be opposed?  2)  Why does the author think it proper to ethnically cleanse Jews (but not Arabs) from the West Bank?  Isn't that a little arbitrary?  And why does the author think this injustice is essential to bring peace closer?  3)  Given that plenty of members of the Knesset had been visiting the Temple Mount, why does the author think that a pre-approved visit by Sharon was so obviously a bad idea?  Has it occurred to him that refusing to let Sharon do something so ordinary might have severe ramifications in itself?  And just why is it that the author feels that a Jew visiting the holiest Jewish site, in the capital of Israel ought to be a casus belli?  Does this mean that the author thinks that Jews ought to be special in not having any rights in their own capital or at their own holy sites?  Oh yes, some folks have boasted that the author is a conservative.  But I'm judging his book on its merits, not on the author's purported politics.  In any case, I'm a liberal.  Had the author been more honest with us, I think I'd have been more willing to look at his advice.  As it stands, I think the one star I'm giving this book is generous 
 From about the second page of this book, I was shaking my head in disbelief that anyone would publish it. The characters and their relationships are so poorly developed you are left with a blur of images lacking connection to one another. Add to that the stereotypical characters (the men are all violent and lusting either for girls or boys, the women are all "large-assed" or fat with the exception of Ella).  And the gratuitous sentence or two at the end of each section about various characters' sexual proclivities was so completely dumb, not to mention kind of repulsive (I like a good sex scene as much as the next person, but Tuck's descriptions are completely banal).  Oh wait, there's more. The Spanish is ATROCIOUS. It's hard to believe that Tuck had a translator for this book. It's pretty clear that whoever copy edited it neither reads nor writes nor speaks Spanish. Half the names are grammatically incorrect. Many of the words are just plain wrong ("vita" means life in Italian, not Spanish, for starters). I felt embarrased for the author. Does she know that her book is full of errors? The one word that comes to mind when thinking about this book is: SHALLOW. I sincerely hope that readers don't mistake this book for historical fiction. The author clearly knows little about Paraguay and its people and history, and clearly doesn't care, from her superficial treatment of it. 
 ... and while it may be a quality item, it is definitely geared toward adolescents, not younger children. There was nothing that addressed the needs of dads for girls under the age of ten 
 Just STOP listening to music altogether. PLEASE, PLEASE JUST STOP SMOKING HIS POLE AS WELL, ITS CLEARLY EVIDENT IN YOUR REVIEW.  To everyone else, listen to all of Eminem's albums before this one. Actually you probably have unless you live in a bubble.  That is all 
 Here's the deal:  Janet Evanovich is writing for the money.  The series hit its climax at To the Nines. Ten Big Ones was a disappointment, and Eleven on Top had none of the fun its racy title promised.   The Barnaby series are manufactured pop romps (though I'll still read them), and are bound to burnout soon.   The thing is, I think Evanovich knows this. I think she understands that her writing style has become stale, trite, and disappointing. Looking for inspiration, she has turned back to her early work.  Evanovich published 10+ wonderful suspense/mystery/action/ROMANCE novels that pop up on Ebay occasionally. I've read some of them, and they really are quite fun. Even better, she is rereleasing them for the mass audiences.   Anyway, the first of these books was Full House. She repackaged this with fairly disappointing conclusions, but continued the series with (in the wrong order) Full Tilt, Full Blast, Full Speed, and now, Full Bloom.  These novels were fun, exciting, silly, and fresh. This may be because Evanovich teamed up with Charlotte Hughes. Anywhichway, with Full Bloom, Evanovich has slipped back into her old writing style: the twenty page setup, the quick burnout, and two hundred extra pages of nothing.   I ended up skimming the end part of this book, and it was still slow and painful. Try and guess the mystery by reading the summary! You probably will. Try the other Full series, and get her old romances: The Rocky Road to Romance, Love Overboard, and Back to the Bedroom 
 The refrain is "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs". Why would any reasonable person want to "Take It (America) Back" to the good old days of dialectical materialism. It didn't work then; it won't work now. I am not arguing that Carville is a "neo-Com", but there is evidence in his book to support that argument.   By the way, although Carville claims to be a "ragin Cajun", he was not born in Acadiana or even Louisiana. He hails from Georgia. He did attend LSU, but he must have flunked the courses on the Enlightenment.  This book proves that a specter is haunting America, the specter of James Carville, Howard Dean and Hillary Clinton. 
 The title pretty much lets you know what you're getting. It's a grade-C howler but not as blatantly funny as I was hoping. Directed by exploitation film specialist Eddie Romero from a story that originally came from Jonathan Demme (long before directing "Silence of the Lambs" and "Philadelphia"), this low-budget 1972 action movie was obviously filmed in the Philippines but set in some anonymous third world country. Playing hooker and small-time drug dealer Lee Daniels, blaxploitation superstar Pam Grier plays the first half of the title role, while long-forgotten Margaret Markov is the other half, Karen Brent, an unlikely Patty Hearst-like political revolutionary looking to partner with her comrades to overthrow the oppressive local government. Naturally antagonistic toward each other, they are in a women's prison camp where they wear inexplicably bright yellow mini-skirts as uniforms. Run by a closeted warden and lecherous matron, the prison is just an excuse for a lengthy shower scene and some half-hearted cat-fighting as Lee and Karen are pitted against each other. Of course, they escape but shackled together a la "The Defiant Ones" and continue the cat-fighting until they attack a couple of nuns to steal their habits.  Meanwhile, various groups of unsavory men are in pursuit - the loutish drug lord looking for Lee who stole $40K from him, the rather passive revolutionaries looking for Karen, and the incompetent police (who suffer the humiliation of exposing their privates to the drug lord). Needless to say, everything eventually comes to a head but not before gratuitous nudity by a number of Filipino women, a dog wears Karen's panties and some of the worst of 1970's men's fashion (one beer-bellied revolutionary wears a leather halter top with a straight face). There is a rather sad ending, but what's truly sad is how much of the potential black comedy is missed entirely in this hilariously preposterous exercise. Sadly, Grier is disappointing in this outing because her character is not allowed much to do beyond dealing with all the "jive", while Markov is an Amazonian blonde whom I am convinced is trying desperately to be credible. Since no one displays any talent for acting, the rest of the cast is not worth noting, except balding, bug-eyed Sid Haig, who uses his standard psycho persona as the drug lord. The 2003 DVD contains only the original trailer as an extra 
 I got this book because it was highly recommended by a college professor.  I thought that it was entirely too wordy.  I would skip through paragraphs because it was just too much.  I thought the story plot was interesting and could have been fun to read, but Tom Robbins came off sounding pretentious because of his overuse of words.  It could have been much better.  
 Do not buy this dvd unless you like interviews! All the great names that appear do not even sing with Monroe! Yap,Yap,Yap! Maybe one song included! Should not be listed under music! It's a documentary 
 A poory written, racially charged work by a bitter, probably mentally ill schoolteacher that gives the illusion of having a "key" to historical development. In addition to the cycle of history thesis, he identifies eight civilizations and their birth to death cycle, Spengler points to a nation's "will" and race as the key to a "kultur's" success.   This is the sort of crank theory that held an appeal to National Socialists and amateur history buffs for whom decline mythology holds an attraction-- facts be damned.   Interesting as an historical footnote but dismissed by anyone with a serious foundation in history and historical analysis. 
 I had great results with this product with the first use.  However, when I used it the second time, the triangular pad lost all of its abrasive surface, leaving me with a smooth, useless triangle.  I replaced the triangle, thinking I had a "dud", but had the same thing happen with the second pad.  The cream will work without the pad, but not as effectively.  If the manufacturer can come up with a pad that has a more permanent surface, they will have a winner with this product.  On a positive note, I love the facial product

 Shedaisy does NOT have the staying power. In a few years everyone will be saying "Shedaisy WHO?" Their music is very forgettable! 
 I usually enjoy Ann M Martin's books very much, but I'm not too impressed with the information in this book. A previous reviewer pretty much said it all- also I would not be happy to see an instructor that would let a collision almost happen. I know I didn't begin cantering for a few months after I began riding, as did most of the other riders my instructor trains. But I must say that the book has a wonderful writing style for that age group. =O 
  The theme suggested by the title is fine, but the author does not stick with his agenda. This book is full of erratic observations, not least the notion that Jung was a fellow traveler with the Nazis. Anyone who has read Jung at all well, would know that he devoted considerable energy to the task of trying to understand the 'unreason' which seized hold of the German spirit (Jung actually regarded it as a kind of collective 'posession' by the spirit of Wotan). Unlike Heidegger (and Nietzsche), Jung remained grounded in the positive values of Western civilisation - including democracy. He did not turn his back on 2,500 years of Graeco-Roman/Judeo-Christian culture. To allege that he did is sheer nonsense and exceedingly poor scholarship.   Unfortunately, Wolin seems utterly unable to see that there are paradoxes in life - and human reason. In his assessment, America comes out as the exemplary source of 'rational' culture - as against a quirky Europe, prone to unreason and crippling scepticism. But, in its present mode -dominated by Neo-con philosophy, advocating 'full spectrum dominance' ('Amerika uber alles,' we might say) - some scepticism seems needed right now. There is a new 'Macarthyism' at work in the USA - and it is driven by hubris and UNREASON. 'Star wars'is hardly the attribute of a 'rational' culture. America has few friends in the world today  - and why? Because its current administration has abdicated from the principles ostensibly lauded in Wolin's book. Quite rightly, that worries many Americans - and platitudes like those served up by Wolin will not make the problem go away.    The zenophobia in Wolin's book is part of the problem - not part of the solution. For Wolin, even Europe is 'alien' - so, how much more so is he likely to find problems relating to other, non-caucasian cultures? In this sense - a fatal flaw runs through Wolin's book. He fears fascism - but advocates an agenda whereby one culture stands in judgement of every other, ready to use force - if needs be, in any corner of the world - to protect and assert its alleged superiority - and that, by definition - is fascism. Paranoia and reason don't make good partners. 
 I bought this album because I loved the title song.  It's such a great song, how bad can the rest of the album be, right?  Well, the rest of the songs are just filler and aren't worth the money I paid for this. It's either shameless bubblegum or oversentimentalized depressing tripe. Kenny Chesney is a popular artist and as a result he is in the cookie cutter category of the Nashville music scene.  He's gotta pump out the albums so the record company can keep lining their pockets while the suckers out there keep buying this garbage to perpetuate more garbage coming out of that town.  I'll get down off my soapbox now.  But country music really needs to get back to it's roots and stop this pop nonsense.  What country music really is and what it is considered to be by mainstream are two different things. 
 A rather toothless attempt at rewriting Strunk and White, or Chicago into "fun." Reference books shouldn't waste this much space on casual conversation. Get to the point--get Elements of Style, Elements of Grammar, and Chicago rather than this handbook 
 the first album was so good - walking the fine line between cheesy pop and beautiful sentiment. this one is just all cheese. the guitars have been replaced with 80's (the bad 80's) sounding synthesizers and the hooks, which may still be there, are just buried under layer after layer of production. i can't even believe this is the same band. i played it for several friends who i turned on to the delays without telling them who this was. the reception was..uh..not good 
 This vacuum cleans reasonably well, but I have a few significant gripes which will prevent me from buying a similar model when making my next vacuum purchase, which seems to about every 2 years. I've finally decided that we may go with an "heirloom" vacuum next time, such as an Oreck, since the lifetime of any sub $100 vacuum is just ridiculous.  My complaints: 1. This thing screams like a banshee! It is indeed light, and reasonably powerful, but it literally hurts my ears to use it in small rooms. It does not roar, it emits a relatively high pitched scream. I have had big, small, and medium size vacuums, and this thing easily is louder than all of them. I haev a 2 1/2 horsepower Shop Vac which is much quieter than this vacuum. 2. Wheels barely extend below the bottom of the vacuum, so it requires a bit of effort to roll over anything but very short carpet. Wheeling from room to room, say over hardwood while tipping the vacuum back, also cannot really be done. 3. The filter is hard to clean, as it has a flange that extends down over maybe 1/3 of one side. I often have to stick my finger in the space between the filter and the flange to get a significant amount of gunk out. Gross. Tell me how this is better than a bag 
 Great Book for domains with child domains but for simple starters it is not what I thought it would be.  Limited detail in the migration and even more limited in basic tasks.  The book is good just not for starters.  I recommend something else 
 Only one-third of the book covers what a typical Rich Dad Poor Dad reader would expect: how to use corporations to protect one's assets.  The information in this section is really helpful and interesting, especially for beginners.  The author provided great examples to illustrate key points.  The writing overall, however, could be improved by having better summaries of each chapter and by defining every new legal term used in the book (for example, the book never defined "indemnification" but it used it frequently).    Another one-third of the book covers how to start a company and take it public (have it listed as a public stock).  I don't think any typical Rick Dad Poor Dad reader has this purpose in mind for their businesses or real estate purchases, so this second part of the book is utterly useless and irrelevant to most readers.  The last one-third of the book basically lists the laws for incorporation for each state, which is useful, but I'm sure the author could have provided a webpage to list all this information.    Another thing to consider is that this book might be outdated.  It was published in 2001, and laws may have changed by now (this review is written in early 2006).  For example, the double-taxation policy of dividends was changed after the publication of this book.  I think the author might have overcome this by providing updates to important relevant laws through a website or something similar.    For all these reasons, I'd recommend the interested reader to explore other sources first.  Unfortunately, I can't recommend other books yet.  If there doesn't seem to be any other good sources, then consider reading this book only if you can buy it used or borrow it from the library. 
 I found myself after reading the book. Sincerely hoping the movie will have a different spin. This is an unsatisfying sequel to the novel Get Shorty. I love Elmore Lenord novels but this is a dud 
 This book is a course requirement; otherwise it would not have been purchased.  In my opinion this is unquestionably the worst textbook I have every read.  I have read a lot of textbooks, over 60 boxes worth, both as a student and a professor.  Some have been a good read, others not.  In all of them I have found at least something worthwhile.  Not this time.   This is the most confusing, redundant, turgid, and poorly edited book I have ever read.  There seems to be an inverse relation between the amount of text devoted to a topic and its' complexity, e.g. "percentaging (sic) a table".  The discussion, in chapter 16, on correlation and regression is without a doubt the single worst presentation on the topic I have ever seen.  Since this is the 10th edition, you would think Babbie and the publisher would have gotten it right.  They didn't.  I think a more appropriate description is a first edition repeated nine times.   Babbie may be a fine instructor and a prominent researcher, but this is a terrible piece of babble and banality.   I would give the book a zero if the system allowed it.  
 I'm a fan of Elvis and a fan of most of the music on this album.  I'm rating this 1-star not on the quality of the music, but on the quality of the product.  I have over 500 albums in my collection and have ripped all of them to my PC for use with my iPod.  This is the ONLY album I own that I cannot add to my digital collection.  I  have to admit that I kind of have a guilty conscious when it comes to buying music, and I've paid for 99% of my collection as opposed to "acquiring" free copies.  I paid for this album just like all the others, but because of SONY/BMG's "copy-protection" software none of my computers will even recognize it as a CD.  Yes, I can listen to it in any other standalone CD or DVD player, but what does that mean?  I can enjoy over 7000 songs on one convenient storage device but have to keep this special disc set aside for my "protection".  I know I'm kind of ranting, but SONY's CP issues have been well documented and I'm not alone in my frustration.  Just remember people: it's Elvis.  The same songs of his have been rereleased 100 times in 100 different packages.  You can find all of these songs somewhere else. 
 The problem is the central character, who appears to be a capricious supernatural monster with unchecked power to tyrannize and confuse all of the supporting mortal characters. The standard of morality portrayed in this book, especially the first half, would shock the Marquis de Sade, the Comte de Lautreamont, William Burroughs, or Henry Miller. Child abuse, polygamy, disfunctional familial deceit, jealousy, revenge, ethnic cleansing, racial chauvinism... you name it, all described without any hint of moral repugnance. The second or newer half also revels in anti-family rhetoric; the principal character repeatedly demands that his colleagues abandon wives and children in order to serve his purposes 
 With incredible verbosity and circumlocution Morganthaler encourages churches to become more authentic in their worship while becoming more culturally relevant in their worship style, and thereby attracting the unchurched.  Citing many surveys, she includes the research of George Barna and George Gallup who conclude that the unchurched person is not looking for worship style, but the Bible and its meaning, and a church's beliefs and doctrines.  Decrying market-driven approaches to filling the pews, that is, style versus substance, Morganthaler goes on to prescribe changing the worship experience to make it more 'real'; just a different form of style change.  Morganthaler encourages churches to be welcoming, tolerant,  and inclusive.  These words resonate well with the majority of revisionist church leaders.  Her premise is fundamentally flawed:   	"The corporate worship event is at the very core of our individual and corporate  	Christian identities.  Worship cements our perceptions of God and of the world  	around us.  In short, it sacramentalizes our world view."  Within this obfuscated prose, she identifies not theology, not truth but the "corporate worship event" as the core of our Christian identities.  This presumes the shallowest of approaches to religion and represents, sadly, the depth of teaching prevalent in a majority of American churches.  Morganthaler reveals her lack of Biblical understanding when she states that: 	 	"Separatistic worship is in no way an accurate representation of God or God's  	church.  It is not a divine design ... it is a human invention."  She fathoms neither the Old Testament temple design, nor the jealous nature of God, nor 2 Cor 6:17: "Therefore come out from them and be separate, says the Lord".  If we want the visiting unbeliever to be convinced that God is among us, Paul explains that we should focus on prophesying (1 Corinthians 14).  Does Paul identify worship in this role?  Morganthaler mentions in passing that church attendance is going down "in all but one sector of the population".  Curiously, she neither identifies this sector, nor pursues the reasons for this difference.  While identifying reduced attendance as an American phenomenon, and admitting that church growth in Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe is significant, neither does she pursue the differences between the American churches and these others around the world.  It is precisely for the reasons Barna and Gallup identify that these other churches are growing.    While rightly identifying disillusionment with mainline denominations to illustrate the move into non-denominational mega-churches, she does not admit the root cause of this disillusionment: a great number of American churches do not preach the gospel.  Their theology is not biblically based and they do not adherre to the teaching of the Apostles.  The major cause of decreased church attendance is that there is no compelling message in a majority of churches, because they do not believe or teach that the Bible is the word of God.  It's not so much that they do not worship "in truth", but that they do not teach truth.  Morganthaler ignores this obvious assessment and instead perseveres to her pre-determined conclusion that it is the experience of worship which is not 'real' or culturally relevant that causes visitors and the disillusioned not to return.  While her call for willingness to break the molds of worship style, both traditional and modern, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit is welcome, her lack of emphasis on the gospel as the primary tool of evangelism, and her elevation of worship to this role is misguided.  This confusion, no matter how much plausible evangelical terminology it is wrapped in, is still confusion 
 Esposito sure has a nice way of glossing over the truth.  The heart of the matter is missed and the fundamental force behind the Islamic faith is left in the corner of the closet somewhere.  Since he shared his ideas, and we do have 1st Amendment rights, here are mine - the Islamic faith and the teachings of the Koran are to drive the believer of these misconceptions with a goal of world domination - religiously and if necessary, violently.  How blatant and how clear the Koran is.  How necessary for us to realize that to stop the core of this terrorism is to stop the spread of this "religious system", or dare I/we say - militant system?  It's also time to put an end to political correctness 
 Is the first time I tried to read an E-book and the experience was very unconfortable. Unconfortable to read, impossible to record as a file, only to read in 1 PC, and at the end, impossible to print! Please try another way to sell electronics books 
 Who wudda thunk it?  Chris Russo can read and write 
  Author Joshua Harris, who have scored (no pun intended, mind you) a great hit with his first book on the subject of dating called I KISSED DATING GOODBYE, spawned a sequel documenting his courtshipping days with his now found wife called BOY MEETS GIRL. This time Harris had come up with a third installment on the subject of Lust, particularly on the aspect of human sexuality.  Eventually the book just went on as being more of a stuff to only propagate organized churches' ideals rather than to convey to its readers what its premise supposedly have guaranteed: a book to help Christians overcome their problems with sexual temptations - presenting a certain idea of dependence to the common church communities' norms (chapters 8: "Lone Rangers are Dead Rangers") although it did affirmed that the key to total deliverance from sinful problems IS a sturdy connection with God (chapter 3: "You Can't Save Yourself"), which at the same time apparently only show the inconsistencies of what are the currently and commonly accepted prevailing concepts amidst the church circles of our day; along with their popular explanation regarding God's salvation - that runs like a confusing pretzel logic, which only go around in tangled circles, proclaiming that being Salvation is only attainable by Grace, one has no real need to obey God, and yet they would strain a gnat to follow into their church's system, or otherwise condemnation is not too far around to be driveled out into the particular if one wouldn't submit into the dictates of their church's ideals.  Thus, unfortunately this book never delivered; and in the long run, Harris stated it so in the book that he has no solution and there is no secret method at all in overcoming the lust problem.  Harris' book NOT EVEN A HINT live up to its title under the constriction of being a completely impotent material to help anyone who has a great problem with sexual temptations.  And not as to dismiss or belittle every person's own strengths and capacities regarding an individual's own area of weaknesses - I find it crazy on the author's part to have strong sexual problems when it comes to seeing a copy of lingerie catalogues. I mean being that he is a Christian, and married to his wife, which would mean that he loves his wife synonymous to his devotion and commitment with his wife in that respect, presumably - and in being thus out of his respect for his wife - sure enough although its automatic within a male's psyche to have that sexual suggestion in the mind whenever the sight of an `insufficiently' clad woman comes along - he would've not have a problem at all with that and be tempted to indulge in it; or otherwise there is something wrong with his own perspective as a Christian, and for that matter: about his love for his wife and how she really meant to him. 'Cause if one is really in love and needless to say devoted out of that condition to his wife - he wouldn't have the knack to look lustfully at nor desire any other women at all but his very own wife (believe you that!).  Thus at this point, it only gives the idea that Harris should've taken more time in analyzing his own personal condition, and learn more about the topic at hand before coming out with this book on the subject.  The aspect of a person's sexuality is the most private and personal thing that each person possessed. As occultist and book writer Donald Michael Kraig wrote on his book MODERN MAGICK, "Therefore, sex is totally involved in our psyches. Control a person's sex life and ... you control the person." Kraig cites that the matter regarding sexuality is the very aspect wherein those who'd like to manipulate and control its subjects within a group, sect or cult is the very effective means to do so and is indeed used for "brainwashing" methods. It's crazy that in most church communities these days, they even control matters of courtship within their members.  Not for the purpose of trying to peeve away many "christians" that perhaps this little review have done enough already for those who are so Up with Joshua Harris (as he's someone who's in the camp of their church's idealisms) - I think so-called Church of Satan founder Anton LaVae presented a more better idea regarding the method to solve the problem of sexual urges (although I bet that his motives could be moot as far as his sincerity goes, under the context that he's on for the faade of trying to assert an appearance of some idyllic pretense against the Christians, and that it's not for the sake of plain earnestness in itself) - that one could have the means for sexual release or relief, through indulging in sexual fantasies without committing to involve anyone upon it. Such as in example - one would masturbate without fantasizing to involve any real person within those fantasies, but are such that are consisting only of self-created images (kinda like in the movie COOL WORLD) or of a fictionary person visualized for those sex-fantasies. Therefore under that context, not only would the individual be free from the act of fornication but is also not guilty of committing any mental adultery towards another person .  Deliverance from sexual struggles involves one's own personal acceptance, understanding and knowledge about his or her own sexuality.   There are other books and resource materials that are much more helpful than this one by Joshua Harris that are available out there. Hence regarding the topic, NOT EVEN A HINT scores not an inch of any helpful doze for its readers.   Rather, Smooch unnecessary church demands goodbye. 
 What do you get when you combine some of the worst musicians in the world? You get G-Unit! So we have 50 Cent and some other no name idiots that I don't give a sh** about. The lyrics are horrible! You have one guy rambling like an idiot about how he has lots of money and that he has more prostitutes than anyone. You have a retarded DJ who plays beats that are headache inducing. And you have that random female singer who sings about how she's a slut and telling little girls to act all girly and all of that bullsh**. It's sad because at my school this stuff is king. There's a bunch of idiots wearing their G-Unit t-shirts while I come to school wearing a kick-ass Iron Maiden shirt. A couple of girlies say that heavy metal is scary and say that G-Unit owns this world. The title of this review says it all..G-Unit are the decline of humanity...:' 
 This review is for the Criterion collection DVD edution of the film.  Bad Timing directed by Nick Roeg is the story of a psychoanalyst played by Art Garfunkel who is having a relationship with another man's wife. The story begins with her being rushed to the hospital after a drug overdose and the previous events are shown in a series of flashbacks. A police inspector attemps to ascertain what has happened as well.  The film contains some graphic sex scenes and is not for the easily offended.  The DVD contains some bonus features which are an interview with director Nick Roeg, producer Jeremy Thomas, and actress Theresa Russell, a theatrical trailer, a slide show of production photos and posters of the film and some of Roeg's other films and deleted scenes 
 I get the story line but 5 grown women need to suicide!?  The one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night.  Why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself!?!?  It is not matching the character 
 I have just purchased this chest. The first thing I read from the packing box was this product is not intended to protect computer disks, CDs, tapes, videos. This was not mentioned at all in product description on 3 to 4 website that I checked before I decided to buy it. I was more than disappointed. I feel that the seller was evasive... 
 I wonder how accurate the rest of the book is when the author, Mr. Kershaw, did not care to notice that Dawson City, the Klondike, and surrounding region are not in Alaska but well inside Canada. He makes these erroneous references often 
 I watched the first 15 minutes of movie. Thanks quarantino, I bought this for 20 bucks, I won't recover my money if I want to sell it. I want my money back now. Nobody will buy this vomit. All quarantino's movies suck. Do me a favor Quentin: change your profession to a cleaner or something like that... You may do it better. PS: the only star is because Amazon doesn't give me other choice. I would give this movie "-5 
 I have no idea where Warner dredged up these desperate, anxiety ridden mommies fretting over Baby Einstein and private schools. As a stay home mom, by choice, I resent the implication that all women who choose to stay home are mired in a unfulfilled tedious life. And as far as these crazy women running themselves ragged - Ladies, you made a CHOICE to book your kids into a gazillion activities. My children are at their most creative with a few blankets, the kitchen table and some cardboards boxes. Remember making kitchen table forts on rainy days? And I am pretty well convinced neither of my kids are going to end up mentally impaired, at the bottom of their class or having their college admission applications rejected because I wasn't tutoring them in conversational Japanese rather than coloring in a color book together each afternoon. And if the childcare system/motherhood support system is so great in France, then move back to France! Encouraging the US government to provide some pie in the sky support is naive and short sighted. Instead, look to cultivating your community and embracing your neighbors as friends and helpmates rather than competition. Making true connection with others in community is a rare and splendid thing. Here on planet Earth, despite the anxious paranoid feeling we are all supposed to be feeling, the Joneses don't give a hang if we drive a Mercedes and they  really aren't out to get us 
 I was so disappointed in this version! I have a "Joy" from the mid-1950s and one from the early 1980s -- I would chose either old one over this one any day. The print is terrible and the tone is smug and elitist. It doesn't act as a foundation for cooks -- it assumes you already know everything! PLUS, despite my not using it very often, the binding came apart and pages came out (after less than two years.) Find an old "Joy" on ebay and you'll be happier 
 Wow. This story is full of characters who I think were supposed to by sympathetic. . . Before I was even a third of the way through, I was hoping it would end with some sort of catastrophic event that killed every character in a terrible, horrific, painful manner.   The author managed to take a pretty interesting idea - rewriting the genetic code of a man using DNA thought to be from Christ - and made it dull and very predictable. The mosr amazing feat is that at the same time, he manged to write several characters who were all in need of a .45 cranial injection. The only character I dind't want dead soon into the book was Freddy. I liked him.   A very disappointing book, which is a shame, since it shouldn't have been. The base idea was interesting, and worthy of exploration, but the author didn't have the courage to see it through, and instead decided to go with old, worn-out plot twists that anyone could see coming from a mile away. 
 I've just returned this camera for poor facial image quality after using it extensively for months.  My regular camera is a Fuji Finepix S602z which is large and bulky, but, takes superb facial shots.  I tried the Casio due to needing something small to carry in my purse for special events and I'm heartbroken at the incredible photo opps I've had that resulted in poor facial quality.  Don't buy this camera if you care about what everyone looks like.    I've just ordered the PowerShot SD1000 because of the facial detection feature on it.  Hopefully, it is better since I don't want to have to carry my bulky Fuji to get great facial photos.  I'll review the Cannon  once I've had it for a few months 
 It's important to know in considering this book that it is pretty much Morell's thesis, so if you dislike dry, academic work, it's probably not for you. While the book addresses many of the issues that intentionally childless women face (especially the 'compensation' and 'regret' stereotypes), it really hesitates to delve deeply into the sociopolitical/psychological causes and implications. I felt the book was far too heavily reliant on extensive and repetitive quotes from Morell's survey respondents- as such, it really prevented the narrative from gathering speed or developing into something powerful or revelatory. The scope of the research and the profiles of the intentionally childless women presented by Morell are extremely limited, as she herself acknowledges: mostly middle-aged, Caucasian, heterosexual, and married/in an LTR. In short, this book is the first of its kind, and it is groundbreaking. But as a feminist reader and a happily child-free woman, I'm ready for the next step. 
 "Playback" is Chandler's least of everything.  It's his least funny, least compelling, and least believable novel.  Most Chandler/Marlowe novels stretch credulity in the big picture by using far-fetched coincidences to tie plot threads together.  A few of his books--especially "The Big Sleep" and "Farewell, My Lovely"--are so good, I don't even mind.  But "Playback" stretches credulity in little moments.  And in such moments, the dialogue is often painful to read, to wit: "Don't kid yourself.  You're a dirty low-down detective.  Kiss me."  Ugh.  The stale cliche of the resisting female melting in Marlowe's arms after some forceful manhandling is beyond tiresome.  It's annoying.  I'm not sure what the opposite of unputdownable is (must be putdownable), but whatever it is, that's "Playback."  I waded through its scant 166 pages, and I felt like I was fighting a riptide the whole way.  This book is for the diehard Chandler/Marlowe fan in the same way that "Pylon" is only for the diehard Faulkner fan or "Answered Prayers" for the diehard Capote fan.  Chandler published "Playback" five years after "The Long Goodbye."  You'd think in five years he could've mustered a better piece of writing and re-writing.  But, figuratively speaking, he mailed this one in 
 I was hoping that this book would go through the history of technology leading up to the ESB, discuss how the ESB solves the problems presented by previous solutions and talk about some best practices for building ESBs.  Unfortunately, the whole book goes right into the sale pitch telling you that ESB is the solution to problems that we previously were unable to solve! And, ESB appears to have no downsides! And, there are some great vendors out there that can solve all your problems!  EAI didn't work for you? That's because Hub-And-Spoke doesn't scale. But, the author doesn't spend any time on what people did to address these problems. How about distributed components? Of course, they didn't work... no exactly sure why, but ESB solves the problem!  The redeming part about this book is that it does provide a good overview of what an ESB is. It also provides you with a lot of terminology that may be new to you.  However, I wouldn't buy this book again or recommend it to anyone. Instead, I would recommend a lot of other good books on SOA that tell you about how we got here and how the technology pieces are around to help support new solutions to previously hard problems 
 I was excited when I heard about this.  Sorry, I can't handle it.  Bare, buddy, you should stay in retirement if this is going to be the result of your new efforts 
 I couln't even finish the book.  It was one big boring story of Xerox and what they did and did not do.  There were other examples but I could not keep my eyes open 
 A regular Amazon shopper, I couldn't have been more disapointed when I opened the box to find that this was not the awesome score from Cast Away.  The picture and title are just misleading.  You shouldn't have to read the fine print when buying a CD.  I wouldn't have purchased if I knew this was not the music from Cast Away 
 Actually Amazonia reads like an extended episode of Jonny Quest, only not as sophisticated. One of the characters (and I use the term loosely) travels with a pet jaguar. The military contingent are equivilent to Star Trek's "red shirts" -- expendable extras who exist only to get killed. In Amazonia, they are killed by giant mutant creatures. The sections involving an obligatory and chiched romance and the author's occasional lectures on the value of the rain forest (spare us, please) are absolutely must-skip reading.  I know it's supposed to be mindless fun, but this is all a little TOO mindless. I'm a big fan of Preston and Child thrillers and this falls far short. 
 I really hoped this was gonna be a good one.  Its about a teenage boy who has an affair with his teacher and they runaway with an eccentric anarchist.  It sounds entertaining.  The plot is interesting.  The writing is decent.  The problem is that Tussing is horrible at writing and developing characters.  They are so flat.  It would probably make a good movie but its not enough to make a good book.  
 And what for? I'd have expected some noise reduction in the songs of the first CD (for example, try The Partisan). The original recordings were noisy. This remastered version keeps all the noise, but now the sound is even poorer than in previous releases.  All in all, the selected songs are a good representation of Cohen's musical career 
 I found this book very boring. Tyler does a good job on detailing the charictors but I kept waiting for something to happen. Poor Maryam never developed into a person she was so caught up in trying to be a proper American. I will read another of her books since she is so well thought of 
 This book is not written for those of us that have been overindulging for years.  It is written for the folk that are on the verge of becomming an alcoholic.  "You must still be in the early stages of problem drinking" "You've engaged in problem drinking for 5 years or less"  It is stated numberous times in the first few chapters that the program is not for problem drinkers.  She goes on to define the alcoholic, and state again that her program is not for YOU!  I want my money back 
 I blame Yoko Ono for helping split up the Beatles (I think the Beatles were on stormy seas anyway, but Yoko was definitely the iceberg and John steered the ship right for it).  "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" IS about Lennon's love for LSD, despite the same type of lying he tried to deny in the "Beatles Bigger Than Jesus" backpedaling.  (Come on: McCartney just admitted that "Got To Get You into My Life" was about weed!). Yoko Ono has hijacked the Lennon legacy all these years for her own nefarious purposes.  She's just sold Lennon's likeness as an "action-figure doll," for Pete's sake.  And we're still dealing with the talentless half of the Lennon/Ono union.  First Yoko.  Now Sean.  The Instant Karma Lennon sang about all those years ago is still tormenting us--which is a meaning I'm sure John never saw coming.  The ultimate horror of what all the hippies wished upon their enemies--the Government, the Establishment--has come back on them.  SELL OUT is what they all did.  Lennon would be horrified.  I suppose there is some form of justice that the Ono bloodline is completely devoid of talent or shame.  They can put out as many CDs as they want, they can engineer tribute shows to John without inviting any of the Beatles or the son who could sing (Julian), and they can use that unholy alliance they have with Rolling Stone magazine to put their faces out there as much as they want (the last time I saw Sean, he was on the cover under the heading, CHILDREN OF ROCK STARS).  But the same kind of status-quo and denial and propaganda they cursed back in the day...is now their standard-operating procedure. It's almost funny 
 I finished this book but I had absolutely no real desire to find out what happens in the end. I found the characters to be quite unbelievable and hostile to one another. It also had waaaaay too much ranting about today's managed health care system. It will become quite obvious that a doctor wrote this book if you do plan on reading it. It seems that the only intention is to scare the public about the meatpacking industry and insurance's limitations if you get really sick. Like a previous reviewer said, it is more a non-fiction than a fiction book. If you want to read a story about how our industries meat is very contaminated where the so called "hero" of the story is an arrogant, selfish, managed care hating doctor...this is the book for you.     
 Reading this book, I was so aghast at the awful writing that I hardly remember what the plot was about. The only reason I forced myself to finish was because I had paid money for the book. I've learned two important lessons: First, next time I find a book at the used book store which looks "new" I'll know its because the book was so bad the previous owner didn't read it. And second, no more Rita Mae Brown! Anybody who was a fan of her older works should look else where 
 Sorry but i totaly disagree with all these positive reviews.I'm a fan of war classic films but this one is a mess.Nothing is moving,action is zero and filming is poor. we are very far away from dirty dozen,battle of the bulge,midway,enemy below etc.... a total waste of time and money 
 Don't be misled by the cunning title. This book is of use only to the most vapid and self-absorbed therapists or social workers.  I resented almost each of the 184 pages that I read in excruciating agony. Don't get me wrong, I was enthusiastic at first, then I started reading it. Her writing is less than inspiring. "Why?", a reader might ask, is an assessment important? Ms. Lukas is quick to respond that without an assessment, we wouldn't know what the problem is. It's insight like this that earns her a far, far down in the Amazon bestseller list.  I was watching this episode of "American Idol" last night, and saw this kid singing. I thought to myself, Wow!, this kid is good! I hope he wasn't abused! This is exactly the kind of caring that Ms. Lukas calls for in making assessments. I seem to have all the right attributes. Time for the next chapter, although it's going to be hard to top this one!  In her best moments, Ms. Lukas almost overcomes her powerful sense of self-importance to convey something useful, but never quite makes it happen. It's a shame that this book ends up as just another pointless slaughter of perfectly good trees. This wasted paper and wasted my time. Ms. Lukas again attempts to use her innovative "Powerpoint Bullet-point" style of writing to convey a sense of urgency, but comes up dry, like the Sahara on a hot California Friday afternoon in Summer, when there hasn't been any rain in a long, long time. I am reminded of the review on the back cover of the book, where Mr. Strean lauds the book as "highly readable." I would have to, like, totally agree with him. My initial analysis suggests that this book is composed of largely english vocabulary loosely organized into a framework of sentences and paragraphs. I didn't have the time to get much further than this, however, because it all seemed so schizophrenic. She hops from one half-finished thought to the next with the frequency of a cheap portable radio.  Why is there no zero star rating 
 Just as a note, I picked up this book at a local used bookstore, in one of the boxes by the exit listed as "FREE." I guess that would be a sort of portent for what was to come next.  The plot is simple and almost cliche enough: ten people gathering for a 30-year college reunion. Ten different stories basically, plus one recount of a dead graduate. These people are in their early fifties, with each little story/chapter reminiscing on their lives after college graduation.  As a previous reviewer has stated, yes, the major flaw with this book that had the potential to be quite good is that all these people are being whiny, whiny, whiny. Now. Of course, everybody has their own right to be sad and whatnot, but these people seem to take it one step further. I'm gonna just get to the point and state that I absolutely abhor the women in this book (except for two). The rest, sadly, are basically just emotionless bitches in some way or another: one thinks she's 'incapable' of falling in love (and note, she was an art major, haha), another is some blonde with 2 husbands because she wants it all, another, I think, gets what she deserves after cheating on her husband. And so forth. And the men? The men, they just basically sit there, brood a little, and take this BS from the women. Not that I'm saying to go and beat the gals up, but at some point, a guy will have to realize that he was being f***ed over by this lady, true love or not, and has to move on and stop wasting precious time over what has already been done.  So if this is adulthood, or rather, being middle-aged--a bleak overview of their failed love lives so far and nothing else--then I think I'm gonna kill myself before I turn forty. The ending was simply ridiculous and not really an ending at all. The conclusion, the characters, it all just made me angry. It could be that O'Brien's intention was to pick the saddest group of lovestruck losers you've ever met to poke fun at them. But if your some heartbroken idiot who can't get over your unrequited-love situation and wish to indulge in a story that shares your pain, this is the book for you. Now, on a personal note, I've known love too, and experienced its pain, but this is just ABSURD. If your fifty, feeling sorry for yourelf, and still aching over what happened years back, stop watching Lifetime and go read up on people who REALLY suffer; our fellow humans in third-world areas and countries that practice political oppression 
 Dr. Diehl would have you believe that all military accident investigators are corrupt, while operators are innocent victims of ignorance and subterfuge.  Having had some experience with the USAF mishap investigation system, I would agree that their are many problems.  I would not agreed that the system is as corrupt as Dr. Diehl would have you believe.  I have read many reports that have probed the depths of human factors.  I have read none that simply label accidents as "pilot error" without probing into details on why error was made.  I believe Dr. Diehl has done a great "disservice" to those many investigators who did their very best to find the true cause of accidents and to prevent their recurrence.  He has written this book to appeal to the emotion of the reader... if you were to remove the adjectives and superlatives, the book would make a very thin paperback 
 Ernest Hemingway dies on page 161 of this 300-page book and so does author Valerie Hemingway's story. For that reason this book merits only two stars. Early in her story of meeting Hemingway in Spain in 1959 at age 19, Valerie is aware of the author's magnetic and dominant personality, "Around him everything came to life....There was an urgency and vitality that...did not ebb."  When she stays focused on the story of Ernest Hemingway, this is an endearing look at the older, struggling Hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness of an innocent Irish girl who entered his life during the final drafts of "A Moveable Feast."  But the youthful time spent with the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her subject. As a result, her recollections are thin and easily available in other sources such as A. E. Hotchner's "Papa Hemingway." The two years she spent living and traveling with Hemingway through Spain, Paris, Key West, Cuba, and America, share as much space as her weird marriage with Hemingway's strange son, Gregory (apparently the other "bull" referred to in the title).   It shows the continuing vitality of Ernest Hemingway - even in death and over 40 years later - that a Valerie Hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of such a great man 
 Another unspeakable album from the most unspeakably overwrought, over-produced and over-rated rock band of all time.  Did I mention over the top? Let's face it, Queen was a group of crypto-fascists, working hard to put a human face on Thatcherism.  Ghastly stuff.  K. 
 I was very disappointed in this book after hearing John Maxwell promit this book on the Inspirational TV Networks. He said this book was for everyone - and would teach about being a leader in every aspect of life. I took the online "test" to establish my own leadership skill review and potential. It was a total waste of my time and the results were exactly the same things I entered. He promotes needing to read all his OTHER books so one can understand this one. Totally a waste of time and energy. The skills of leadership that he mentions - are the basic ones that any person would already know - and only seemed to apply to business - not everyday life or the everyday housewife as he promoted. Very confusing and disappointing. 
 The audio is delivered in a monotone that almost puts you to sleep. Not a good thing while drivin 
 Maggio's list of biased words includes many everyday words and expressions that are part and parcel of the English language. If everyone were to follow her lead, our language would be much poorer. In the quest to remove everything from the language that might give offense to anybody, Maggio ends up with a list of censorship guidelines. Publishers should avoid following her list, as it gives permission to censors of all stripes--whether from left, right, feminist, anti-evolutionist, crackpot--to say that something offends them and take it out of the language 
 Love John McCain.  Don't love this book.  Between wonderful stories of individual courage, this treatise on courage and what causes people to react without respect to fear is totally unreadable jibberish.  It makes no sense at all 
 These speakers are big in size but short on performance.  Except for the price tag, not much else excites one about them.  They make a good surround sound system with the Sony 3 speaker set for surround sound, but for listening to music you are better off with a set of good bookshelf speakers with a decent sub.  These speakers lack bass inspite of their size, and sound quality is poor at higher volumes 
 I'll keep this brief since you can read many lengthy reviews.  I feel like the characters have lost their voices.  The characters do not grow or change, and are nothing like the warm humans they were in the first books.  Even the main characters are cold archetypes here in these later books.  I keep hoping I'll open a new Goodkind book and it'll be fresh and I will want to know the characters more, but they're just gone.  I tried to start the next book, and it was worse.  Unfortunately, I'm just done with this series.  
 After reading Tarnas's superb Passion of the Western Mind I was really looking forward to Cosmos and Psyche.   What a disappointment.  I have never read such utter drivel in my life.   Hundreds of pages of utter humbug in which he attempts to relate events in human history to the position of the planets and stars and their supposed astrological characteristics.   A thesis made all the more absurd by the fact that one of the planets in question (Pluto) has recently had its planetary status recinded.   I can't believe anyone could apply such a huge amount of intellectual energy, time and unecessarily obtuse multi-syllable vocabulary to such an absurd topic.  The descriptions of the various astrological influences which are supposed to be brought to bear on our earlthy activities is so broad ranging and the variety of occurences in human affairs so vast, that of course it will be possible to find hisotrical events to line up with planetary influences - get a life.  I then read Richard Dawkins' "the god delusion" and the contrast in styles was overwhelming. Here we have a clearly articulated argument which complelety steamrollers all the pseudo philosophical nonsense that has been perpetrated for the last 1600 years and still depressingly is by many people.  I mention this only to contrast the style of Tarnas which seems to assume that the paucity of his intellectual analysis can be hidden behind impressive sounding pseudo-philosphical vocabulary. Erudition clearly doesn't correlate to intellectual robustness. 
 This is a book like the dozens of other career change ones out there - you can find this information in publications from years ago, and with much better advice. No new information, and would only help lawyers who would lack the imagination to think of "legal publishing" or "in-house counsel" as career options. Truly unhelpul 
 I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend, but after reading this book I'm frankly not sure the friend read this book. I was really looking for a thoughtful answer to the question in the title, but I now suspect the title is a gimmick to sell more books in a post- September 11 world.   This book is actually based on three lecture series by the author, and at the end a quick chapter titled "Conclusion" does not reach a Conclusion and does not answer the title question.  My guess on What Went Wrong? Corrupt, self-serving leadership, more interested in enriching themselves rather than transparent decision-making. The Indonesians have a term for this, KKN, for Corruption, Collusion, and Nepotism.  I would give this zero stars if possible, but there are some interesting historical tidbits that might warrant 1 star. 
 My daughter loved this fish and it worked great in the bath 1 time then it never worked again. We tried to replace the batteries but nothing worked. She still loves to play with it but it does not swim anymore 
 You may want a home business for a second income, or maybe a whole career change - there are thousands of options for earning a living now. I started homebusinessadvisers.com in 2004, and this is a book I read in preparation. It was useful for an over 40 woman like me. There is so much info around, it's hard to filter through it. In the end my own website has become a place to review the latest home based business ideas. Thanks to Priscilla for the initial ideas.  
 I received a 12-piece placesetting of these dishes for our wedding. After using the dishes for about six months, cracks have appeared in the glazing and edges have chipped/flaked off bowls and plates. The dishes have not been used extensively, and it appears that even light "everyday" use by two people is too much for them. Lenox recommends using low temperature dishwasher setting and low temperature microwave use. Even following those instructions, our dishes have cracked and chipped. When I called Lenox to complain, they told me they would have to send a formal letter of authroization, at which time I would be asked to mail them the damaged dishes (10 dinner plates, nine bowls and one salad plate). One of their quality control specialists would examine the dishes and call me back I would not recommend this line from Lenox. I am awaiting the authorization letter, but overall, I am very disappointed in this product and the company that buit its reputation on quality and high standards. I would not recommend these dishes.   
 I ordered two of the authors book's based on raving reviews from a friend, not actually this title but another. I ordered this one as well and must say what a total waste of money. The first section of the book is about the authors travels and how she claims she was visited by the Virgin Mary...umm yeah right, there isn't much practicle help in this book at all, only her boring tales of travel around the globe. The second part of the book is a list of goddesses and their qualities. don't bother with this book, it a time waster and $$$ waster I can't believe Hay house published this work of junk. After reading this authors other works I do feel she is very very over rated and has taken the angel working brigade thing a little too far and people have jumped on this band wagon if that wasn't the case this author would be unknown because her writing is terrible. The misleading promises on the back of the book should be taken off as well "Manifest anything you want instantly"...I didn't find anything in the book even about *helping* your life, it was all about her travels...Like I said a total joke..I won't be so easily led when buying books by spiritual workers again. 
 The movie is frustrating and a big disappointment. And, what is the point of everything being so white?  Is there some deep meaning here or something?  This movie is exasperating 
 To be honest, I've never been that impressed by the kind of programmes the History Channel puts out - too much emphasis on entertainment and not enpough on decent research, historical accuracy, etc.  So it was no big surprise to find this programme seriously "skewed", as a previous reviewer put it.  This is a thoroughly lacklustre product which suffers from the same shortcomings that I already mentioned.  So rather than waste my time and yours reviewing something that isn't worth watching in the first place I just want to direct your attention to "The Real Da Vinci Code" released in May this year (2006). It still isn't the definitive investigation - you'd need more than a couple of hours to cover all the relevant topics, but it has this offering seriously outclassed in every department- even as straight forward entertainment! 
  I'm completely unable to understand or explain what it is that people like about this book.    First and foremost, yes, there is a rape early on in the book.  I don't feel like I'm doing you a disservice in revealing this since most of the reviews here also mention it.    I read the reviews and was not immediately repelled by the thought of a protagonist who had committed such an act.  Obviously, it is a despicable act, but I thought when I bought the book that it would be the starting point for development of a complex character.  I was interested in the inner struggle that would ensue, ala CRIME AND PUNISHMENT, but I was WAY off.  The rape serves absolutely no purpose that I can discern.  It happens and then the story goes on with barely any attention given to it.  The protagonist does away with the act with a simple, "I don't want to think about it" type of thought.  And then he does.  He is seemingly untroubled by it, and it seems that all thoughts of the crime are simply banished from his thoughts.    This might serve if the character was a psychopath, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  He feels concern about many other characters in the book.  This concern contrasts sharply with the aforementioned act and ultimately subtracts from the credibility of the tale.  Furthermore, all of the characters who are aware of the act are unbelievably tolerant of it.    Books and movies can take some liberties with the suspension of disbelief, but an implausibility as glaring as this, really distracts from the novel.  It transforms the book into a random series of events having nothing to do with one another.  This is not the book's only problem.  The author drops you into the world together with an unsuspecting protagonist, who doesn't know what is going on - fine.  The problem is that neither does anyone else.  The protagonist cannot get answers from any corner.  This is irritating.  The story proceeds and events take place that don't make sense to the protagonist and don't make sense to the reader.  No explanation is given and no pieces fall into place.  This makes it very difficult to continue with the story as there is little payoff along the way.  Also, the book follows the same hackneyed fantasy mold of confronting the great evil, followed by the long sojourn, a meeting with those in the know, and followed by another long sojourn.  This type of fantasy scenario is played out and was tiresome to this reader.  Finally, I found the character's disbelief of his environment to be unbelievable.  The author counts on the reader's forbearance way too long on this count.  Basically, the protagonist lives for weeks on end under the delusion that "it's just a dream."  Please.  This protagonist's use of this type of coping mechanism would be very short lived.  It's entirely implausible to think that any person would operate under this type of assumption for long periods of time.  I give the book two stars, because the concept of transplanting a modern man into a fantasy world of magic and supernatural power is refreshing (though not altogether new -- see Terry Brooks, MAGIC KINGDOM FOR SALE - SOLD).  Also, the source of magic power is new and intriguing.  I would have liked to the see the concept employed by a more skillful writer.  My recommendation:  pass on this one. 
 What a joke! I have read alot of books on faeries. After reading all of R J Stewarts` books and Faery Teachings by Orion Foxwood this seams like fiction. I could bearly bring myself to finish it. I can`t beleive the author is the UK`s top authority on faeries. Very sad. 
 For all the talk Stossel makes about how he exposed all that he claims to hate, he grants himself a nice big fat deal of a job at ABC. The only reason Stossel switched from liberal to libertarian was his opportunistic behavior. For all that he claimed to expose, it was the ordinary folks doing it for him while he stole the credit. Stossel would be better off exposing fundamentalists in the Arab world if he cared to prove himself worth anything other than a pile of dirt talking dirt 
 I thought the original was pretty good, but this sequel was pure torture to watch! I'de rather eat a giant roach, than watch this movie again! Without question, one of the worst comedys ever written 
 When this film version of "Much Ado About Nothing" came out, there was a great deal of critical acclaim for it. I disagree with all of this acclaim.   Kenneth Branagh's production has taken a lively Shakespearean comedy and turned it into a bloviated not-very-funny movie. Shakespeare comedies should be done fast and with a certain silly madcap fun to them. This production is so slow, I had trouble staying awake. It is so bogged down and so full of its own self importance that it becomes a dead bore.  This is the worst version of Shakespearean comedy I have ever seen, either on stage or on TV or in the movies. (The worst production of any Shakespearean play I have seen was a UC Berkeley theater department production.)  Please compare this 1993 movie version of "Much Ado About Nothing" to the Joseph Papp's 1973 TV version of the same (based on his New York Shakespeare Festival production). The latter is fast paced, lively and madcap. Mr. Papp moved the story to the turn of the century (1900) and incorporate additional comic elements by adding keystone cops to his version without cutting lines. Mr. Papp's version is done in the true spirit of Shakespearean comedy. It is delightful.  It does not have the big stars (Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson) but does not suffer from their absence.  My experience in the past is that any Shakespearean production that has to cut out some or many of the Bard's lines is one in which the cuts have been made to make room for non-Shakespearean bloat devised by the director.  This is not the first time I have disagreed with the general consensus on a production of a Shakespearean play. Not sure if this means I am idiot or that I have higher standards for Shakespearean productions than others.  
 I think if your decorating style is very "over the top" Brittish Proper, you may like this book.  While I liked looking through this book one or two times, it is not one that I take off the shelf for inspiration very often.  I didn't find any "secrets" on decorating in this book - except for putting fringe and tassles along the ceilings and in corners - YUCK!  It is a book with pictures and tips you would expect to find in a five dollar magazine 
   This book was a disapointment for me. I am going to vacation on the northern California coast this Fall and was hoping to learn something from this book, but it is mostly just the well worn mainstream information that doesn't need retelling. It completely omits the area I'll be and the areas it does cover are handled more effectivly in other books. The pictures are great, though 
 I acquired this unit about a week ago to serve as a docking station for a new laptop computer that does not have any of the traditional ports on it.  You must install the software that comes with it to use the serial or parallel ports, and I had to reboot my computer to get the parallel port working.  (Note that the serial port appears on a non-standard setting, mine is COM4, so any software must be directed to that location.)  I have not tried the serial port, but the USB and parallel ports appear to work fine.  However, beware that the PS/2 ports on the unit do not work the same way as built-in PS/2 ports.  A keyboard and mouse plugged into them will perform their basic functions. But, if you have an advanced mouse or keyboard with extra keys or other options, they will not function through the docking station.  It appears that the PS/2 ports on the docking station are wired to always appear to the operating system as some form of generic Human Interface Device mouse and keyboard, rather than recognizing whatever form of keyboard is plugged in -- as happens with built-in PS/2 ports.  Because of that, I could not find a way to get the computer to match the special mouse and keyboard drivers required for the advanced functions to those devices when connected to the docking station.  Kensington support ignored my first two requests for help on this issue, and then suggested I contact the keyboard and mouse vendors -- which does not make any sense because the devices work fine any time except when they are connected through the PS/2 ports on the docking station. I had to find another way to bridge my keyboard and mouse into a USB port to get them to work.  For that reason, I probably would not have purchased this unit if I had known about this issue.  However, if  you only need a parallel and serial port, as well as two USB ports, this unit will work fine.  
 This is one of those books where you like the idea of the book but not the book itself.  This book didn't really make me feel anything. I never got so that I cared about the characters. I never came to feel that the characters cared about each other either.  This is one of the books that you know you read but you just can't really remember later on. I wouldn't recommend this 
   Pushing the envelope for explicit, over the counter home videos, 9 SONGS (Tartan) is about one year of sex and rock'n roll in the life of two lovers.    Matt is a young glaciologist.  He meets Lisa at a London rock concert.  That night they start an affair.  In between attending more concerts, they make passionate love.  It's for real and explicit.  Nine live-concert song footage is intercut with their coke-snorting, sexual encounters creating a sometimes ironic reflection of their intense physical but otherwise rather bland relationship.  And finally, all this takes place in the memory of Matt as he flies across the vast frozen wastelands of the South Pole.    This unscripted film is part musical, part drama, part documentary and part performance.  It raises questions about the difference between pornography and art. Controversial and much buzzed about, this not fully satisfying experiment is of interest mainly as a novelty item by a usually innovative and creative director for what it could have been.  And of course the sex.  A special feature eliminates everything but the concert performances. 
 I agree with the readers who found this book disappointing. Yes, the survivor of abuse has different needs than the partner who hasn't been abused, but this book doesn't really shed any light on having a relationship with this person. Instead, I highly recommend Miss America By Day by Marilyn VanDerber. This book gives true insight into being with a survivor of abuse 
 This video left much to be desired. The dvd was cheaply made. I urge you NOT to buy this video!! This is $20 thrown out the window. This video was filmed in someones house. I would never buy this if I knew!! 
 China cannot be trusted and Robert Sutter tells us why. In pages after pages, the author gives ample reasons that, as a rising power, China has to be watched carefully.   According to Sutter's theory, historically, China has had hegemonic ambitions. Not only she portrays her own struggles as of universal significance, she also keeps a close watch of countries around her periphery as if they are naturally within her sphere of influence. Her political leaders are hypersensitive to criticisms and tend to behave defensively. The Chinese plot their policies and strategies, not much guided by principles but mainly on a case-by-case bases. They are more likely to go after short-term gains than for long-term benefits. As a result, Chinese foreign policy tends to be capricious and disruptive. In Sino-US relations in particular, China has been long suspicious of U.S. ulterior motives and is actively hedging against U.S. policies through bilateral and regional actions.  In the same vein, Sutter views China's recently totted "peaceful rising" with suspicion. Whether China has truly renounced aggressive posture in her international dealings, or she just says so to "bid time" in order to secure economic growth, remains to be seen. As how to engage a rising China, Sutter sees Bush administration's approach as a potential model:  keep her at arms length, do not give any unwarranted expectations (as Clinton administration has purportedly done), and stand firm.  My personal observation is, although there is some truth to many of his assertion, Sutter's ultimate fallacy is that he uses a liberalist standard to criticize China in order to justify U.S. own realist strategy.   For example, Sutter interprets China's proposal of opening its agricultural market to ASEAN countries as a way to undercut Japanese or Korean positions (p82). This is so anti-liberal for its Machiavellian motive, he seems to argue, it is yet another example of why China cannot be trusted. But even if we put aside the merit of such a decision in itself, and to look at parallels in U.S. policies, such a criticism is as unjustified as it is hypocritical. Since the WTO meeting in Cancun, U.S. Trade Representative has repeatedly offered to cut U.S. domestic agriculture subsides, not only to advance American agenda, but also to put pressure on the Europeans. The consensus in this case, however, is that America is exerting her leadership role in promoting Free Trade.  In his "China's International Relations" essay in Samuel Kim's book, Alastair Iain Johnston observed that some of the "China Threat" talks are self-fulfilling prophesies (has anyone mentioned Cuba being a victim of such prophesy?) I'd argue China Skeptics such as Sutter are no different. China's in U.S. crosshair today is not entirely her own fault, it is more or less because what she is or what she can be, especially in a world according to the U.S. For example, other world powers-that-be, like the European Union, is never that concerned about China's potential as another USSR. Other than some spousal disputes like economic matters, E.U. and China are getting along just fine---if not too close to U.S.'s liking, as in the recent case of proposed lifting of arms sales ban by the E.U.  Even the herbivore countries living along the fringe of the dragon's cave are not so concerned with impending subjugation as a result of China's rise---as Sutter implies what could happen. On the contrary, some of them are acting as brakes to U.S. check on China. Even Australia told U.S. not to automatically count on her support had a conflict in Taiwan Strait broke out.  If Sutter does not consider himself as part of the China bashing gang, he must hold a very high standard of who is--- maybe the likes of University of Chicago's John Mearsheimer? Around the same time I read this book, I heard a media interview with James McGregor, a businessman/author. Although his criticism of China is no less harsh at times, he is at least coherent---China is just another business opportunity. If your objective is to make profit, you will have to learn to live with reality. Unfortunately, for analysts like Mr. Sutter, their job is to constantly look out for the surreal 
 That's what I want to know. To all you men who are threatened by feminism, don't worry. We still don't get paid as much as you do, we still take your last names when we marry, and by the time Bush is through, we won't be able to get abortions either. Are male engineers and soldiers typically harrassed on the job, subject to domestic abuse, rape?  In nearly every society, men have universally assumed the superior role in every aspect of life (except, perhaps, childbearing, which they're not capable of doing). I'm sorry to hear that Thomas Ellis "losing patience with feminism, political correctness... and basically everything." To make it up to him, we'll all go back to be properly submissive housewives. We'll leave college, stop voting, and exist entirely for male gratification--just as we did before feminism. Will that make him feel properly superior?  Don't tell me that men are "the inferior sex" until wives take the wheel, husbands take wives' names, and a "First Man" finally graces the white house. It's time that modern women say "enough is enough" to yet another backlash against our dignity 
 A few years ago I read "House of Sand and Fog" by this author and thought it was great.  That's why I was anxious to read this earlier novel of his.  From the blurb on the cover I learned it was set in the late 60s, during a time of political turmoil in America.  I therefore thought the author would use his talent to bring us back to a time and place that created major changes in the American landscape.     Well, the story IS about young man's coming of age during this period.  But it never deals with any of the real conflicts that were going on at the time.  Instead it is about his romance with a young woman and family relationships.  And, frankly, some of the people and situations he describes are just not believable.  There's the story of his mother, who died when he was a baby but left behind a diary of her life. The boy's father never got over his grief and his recreational activity is playing guitar and playing poker.  One of his friends teaches the boy to play the harmonica and we all see that this is the boy's calling.  The girl he romances comes from a strange family.  Her father,  a nut-job communist, is a house builder and tries to force Communist ideals down the throats of the men who work for him. Naturally, violence erupts.  This is all supposed to happen in a little Massachusetts town that is so backward that the main characters don't even have a TV.  And this is in 1968!   The Vietnam War is just a backdrop to the story.  I never got a feeling about the real undercurrent of conflict and change that was happening in the country.  Mostly, the story was about a budding love and its consequences.  I was soon bored but I pushed myself to finish the book in hopes it would get better.  It didn't 
 If you believe that all men are out to get you, if you believe that all men are potential rapists, or if you believe that sex is a weapon men use to opress women, then this is the book for you! I imagine you will read the book while looking tentatively over your shoulder, fearing some evil man may pass by.  I always weigh every book I read objectively, trying to find a balance and see both sides of the argument. However, Andrea Dworkin makes this an impossible task for any sensible and rational person.  Even a cursory inspection of this book will make it a glaring certainty that the themes here are paranoia, hate, and fear. If you believe the psychotic rantings of Andrea Dworkin, all men hate all women (this isn't a negotiable idea), and sex couldn't possibly be an act that a woman might consensually enjoy with a man. No, if you believe the ravings of this madwoman, all men are rapists that use sex to "keep women in their place". No woman ever "really" wants to have sex with a man. But, alas, women are forced to have sex with men. And if a man ever sees a woman experiencing happiness, he immediately devises a way to rob her of it. Give me a break.  If you enjoy or agree with these kind of theories, don't have a penis, or are lacking common sense, then you will love this book.  It's funny how Andrea Dworkin preaches (high and blind in her lunatic ivory tower) about the need for a woman to control her own life, yet goes on to tell women that they cannot be happy with a man or enjoy sex with one, which takes away the exact choice she rages about. One thing she professes, in no uncertain terms, is that if you're a woman that does not agree with her, then you are a detriment to all woman. In the real world, we call people like her dictators.  Even more irritating than her inane diatribes, is her complete and total lack of credible evidence or argument. There are no facts, only paranoid opinions. Andrea Dworkin truly believes that the whole of the male species is out to get her.  What's really disheartening about all this is that there are so many women fighting for true equality (and not the complete subjugation men). Unfortunately, paranoia is contagious, and a few other women have turned to this sort of radical feminism. Studies have shown, time and again, that the vast majority of these radical feminists have been either raped or molested at some point in their lives. So it's safe to say that these women are extremely biased, provide no evidence of any kind, and make up blatant lies to support their "cause". And yet they purport to speak for all women. It's clear that these women, just like Andrea Dworkin, are the real detriment to women everywhere.  But I'm not worried. Most women, like myself, still love men, and will continue to ignore the ravings of the lunatic fringe. And that makes the radicals madder than anything.  I can't believe I wasted 2 hours of my life reading this ridiculous drivel 
 So I've got a bookstore, and it seems like everyone who ever attempts this book calls it tedious and gives up. So why is it that I see so many positive reviews here? Myself, I thought the authentic feel was a definite plus, (much of the time I did feel that I was reading an ancient memoir) but as for being "a page turner," as somebody else called it, you've got to be joking. This book is one of the slowest novels I've ever read. I did it on audio book and I kept falling asleep. It was a lot like sitting in Driver's Ed. after lunch and trying to keep my eyes from going out of focus. Creighton has written some pretty fun stuff, some of it even mildly thought provoking, but his is neither. Timeline and the two Jurassic Park books fit well into the whole "roller coaster of a book" thing, and personally I thought Sphere was great.  I realize that there isn't too much in the way of popular Viking fiction out there and so I suppose if you've got to have a Valhalla fix you could check this out, but I'd still recommend the Kirk Douglas movie "Vikings" over this book. Or maybe the book "Grendel" by John Gardener, which is based on the same epic poem. But this book just feels to much like a boring history lesson. 
 I have ordered this item since Aug, now is Nov, but i still havent received it 
 I find this book extremely confusing.  Many names were utilize throughout the book which makes it hard to follow.  As an individual who is not familiar with the Mongolian  history, the author fails to elaborate or explain the details of why a character does something.  In this sense, I find the book disappointing.  It is also disappointing that it does not go in depth of Gengis Kahn's warefare strategy.  TWO THUMBS DOWN 
 I agree with another reviewer here, Tiger flatten his swing. I don't know why Mr. Andrisani think Tiger changed his swing to more upright. Anyone who compares Tiger's 2000 swing and his swing now would see that Tiger's swing has flatten out.   Yes, I do agree with Mr. Andrisani and think that Tiger has a fuller swing now than his old swing, which is more of a three quarter swing. But it is obvious that Tiger changed his swing plane from upright to a more flat swing plane and the fact that Mr. Andrisani thinks the opposite really baffled me 
 The pretentious photo of the author in a flowing ballgown on the back cover should have been the first warning.  I've never read a Danielle Steel before and I won't be speeding to the nearest Barnes & Noble to get another one.  Other reviewers have commented on the annoying amount of repetition;  I picked up on that before reading the reviews.  There have also been suggestions that Steel needs an editor.  For gawd's sake, she writes for one of the biggest publishers in the world!  They must have hundreds of editors but perhaps, just perhaps, they are intimidated by the prolific Ms. Steel.  Then there are some worldclass gaps in credibility.  Nobody could be as eccentric as Stanley and run a powerful (and megarich) conglomerate. There's no way a house as large as The House (in the center of San Francisco, no less) could ever be bought and restored for $750,000.  The oh-so-happy ending is as predictable as the setting's weather.  Ms. Steel has made a lot of money from her readers.  They deserve better than this 
 I have all of NR books. This is one of the few that I have not been able to read. I have carried the hard cover book since it was first published, from MA, to California now to New Hampshire. When packing space is premium this book is not worth taking up space. I have read up to the first 50 pages and can not progress from there.  I move on to the next contract in 3 weeks and Blue Smoke is going into storage. That will leave room in the suitecase for her next book... A JD Robb I believe. I was so glad to read the other reviews that had the same problems with reading this book as I did 
 LOUSY!!!!  The handle design makes the Cuisipro grater extremely difficult to hold.  There is a BIG space between the drum and the hopper and big pieces of cheese fall through. I grate a lot of cheese, and I am sorry I bought THIS grater 
 I agree with another reviewer: this CD isn't worth writing home about.  Anthony has a good voice and with the exception of Charlene and Where I come from, the other songs fade into boring Muzik for me.  I've tried several times to get into this Cd, each time, it becomes nothing more that white noise 
 While there are some amusing, interesting parts I was disappointed about the lack of details. The book is written for a non finance audience. There is nothing wrong with that, the title just promises more than what's really in there. 
 This ranks right up there with the Blondie reunion CD as completely unnecessary.  Why?  These guys are RELICS.  And I wouldn't care if the music was great (i.e. Joe Strummer & The Mescaleros new stuff) but this  is just awful.  Why are they still trying to act like jittery teenagers?   And the Spedding songs here are just wretched, at least the Shelley-penned  numbers are merely bad.  By all means, buy Singles Going Steady or  Operator's Manual, as they are priceless landmarks of punk rock, but leave  this Modern dreck in the rubbish tin.  I picked it up for half-price and  should have known better 
 The author tells us little about John of Gaunt, but a lot about his personal inclinations.  I quick read but with little substance 
 This story is full of surprises, which really made me want to keep reading. In one point of the story Palmer tells the "gang" that he does not want to become a wringer. This surprised me greatly because I thought that Palmer would become a wringer so he could keep his friends. I learned to always show your feelings and don't do something that you don't want to do just to get friends. I recommend this Fiction-Horror genre to readers of all ages.   
 For the first time in reviewing films, I found myself immediately uninterested in this story.  I don't know if it was the way that it was filmed or the story behind the characters, but it felt bland, overused, and completely unoriginal.  Within the first thirty minutes, I found myself rather apathetic with all the characters and the story.  I felt as if I had seen this structure before, and Tart was providing nothing new to surprise me.  After thinking that it may just be my mood, I stopped the film and chose to start it fresh in the morning, but the same feeling persisted.  I just didn't care.  That is not a good sign.  The characters were bland.  When I say bland, I literally mean that by watching them develop, you will never have any flavor hit your palate.  The story seemed recycled, nearly to the point of plagiarism.  Now, I am not saying that Christina Wayne stole this story, but she added nothing fresh to the perspective.  The casting was horrid, the underlying symbolism and themes were so far lost that no critic could find them (nor the characters), and the stories were vague and sloppy.  You knew nothing about anyone or anything, and instead of pushing more emphasis on the characters, we instead found ourselves with drugs, minor sex, and money pushed into our faces.  These are themes we have seen in every film since the dawn of film time, yet somehow could not be creatively captured by Wayne.  What immediately pulled me away from this story?  It was mainly the characters.  I have seen most of Brad Renfro's work, and honestly he needs to redefine himself.  Director Larry Clark has defined him, and oddly he cannot get out of that stereotypical character.  Within the first twenty minutes of Renfro's screen time I was bored.  I knew exactly what he was trying to portray and why.  It was spectacular nor impressive, just repetitive.  He needed to bring some excitement or suspense to his role, instead of just blandly playing this random socialite.  Without a strong character, the final climax of this film comes instead as a letdown.  Renfro did not showcase the best of his abilities in this film.  While I am on the subject ... nobody showcased the best of their abilities.  What is going on with Dominique Swain, outside of Lolita, I don't believe she has really emerged as an actress, and following-up with roles such as Cat Storm doesn't help. Bijou Phillips was the only actress that I witnessed actually try to bring something remarkable to the screen, sadly due to everyone else's horrid acting, she was lost.  Rambling here and there, and honestly nearly forgotten about during the second act.  Melanie Griffith was a pointless cast and most of this film's budget probably went to her TWO scenes that she was in.  Maybe the rest of it went to the random guy from The Kids in the Hall, who desperately needs to place himself far away from this project.  My biggest problem, outside of the acting, was the pacing of this film.  Nothing, and this is hard for me to say, but nothing gelled together.  There were so many sub-stories happening throughout the course of the film that no actual substance was formed.  The robberies, the teenage "angst and woe", the wealthy socialites learning how horrible real life is, the random Kids in the Hall guy, and even the ending just felt rushed and horribly edited together.  With this shoddy craftsmanship the whole story never really formed any true shape.  Family structures were never defined, characters were never given any emotion, and all we are left with are bits and pieces of honest leftovers.  Wayne did not complete the task at hand.    While I hate to put the entire burden on the director, with this film I am left with little choice.  With a horrid title that just screamed the complete opposite of what this film was about, with amateurish directional ability the cast pretty much was able to give every emotion in every scenes, leaving us with disgusting acting and poor developments, and with vague storytelling it is hard to place any "good" behind Tart.  This was a film I had heard nothing about, and after viewing it I can see why.  All Wayne has done with this film is random take excerpts from other films that have done a better job of defining all the elements above and cut all together to make the film Tart.  It is hard for me to say this, but Wayne ruined this film.  While I don't believe there was much to fully take from the story, any remaining elements of excitement were drained as Wayne took the helm.  While most of the time you can credit some of the story, perhaps strong acting, or even the music, in Tart you can credit nothing.  From the opening sequence until the end, I felt like I was swimming through very lumpy oatmeal.  No consistency, no strength.  Overall, this film is a waste of your time.  If you are searching for some deep symbolic elements or possibly some banter on our society, you will not find it in this film.  While I know that was what Wayne was attempting to show, the final product seems like it was edited on an Etch-a-Sketch.  It was an embarrassing film to sit through, and encourage nobody to pick it up.  Wayne threw to the wind all the teachings of her Columbia University education and destroyed two hours of my life.  Avoid at all costs!  Grade: * out of **** 
 George Strait can make good music and albums, but the songs he did for his only movie Pure Country sound flat and dull.  Heartland's the only good song. The rest of the album is a wastleland of dull ballads and uptempo country songs that would be better sung at a lost bar in Arizona.  I was a little disturbed that an artist of George's high caliber would record these songs.  Avoid this one at all turns!  
 OK, so do you really love MUSIC? Are you "sure"?  Well, if "yes" read on and if no "DON'T".  First of all, there is absolutely NOTHING in this album which is worth liking. If you really want to listen to a boy-band who can sing, then opt for Westlife or Backstreet Boys; not *NSYNC. I'm sure you won't get to listen to individual voices beacuse there aren't any! Ha! Everything is so tech-ie that you don't actually get to hear individual voices.  Secondly, "looking" cool isn't not always music. Just look at Westlife or even Boyzone. I'm sure those guys are nearly not as cool as these *NSYNC fellows. But these guys can hardly sing, or should I say you hardly get to hear their "non-modified" voices.  Finally, a sincere advice. If you value your bucks and don't wanna spend it on something useless, "DON'T BUY THIS ALBIUM!!!" Even if you do you'll regret it later. What, don't believe me? Think I'm stupid old fellow, well here's a deal - Just listen to the sample tracks on this page and you'll know what I mean! That's all, thanks for reading 
 Juana La Loca and her obsessive love for her husband Price Phillip is one of history's more fascinating chapters. Juana apparently refused to be separated from her husband's dead body. She was eventually imprisoned as mad, although it's unclear whether she was simply extremely passionate (...), somewhat neurotic, or actually truly mentally ill. Director Vincente Aranda opts for the first theory. Juana (Pilar Lopez de Ayala) is tremulous and doe-eyed -- when she meets her fiance Prince Philip (Daniele Lioti) the two are so overcome with passion they demand to be married on the spot. Philip then carries Juana off to the bedroom, and from then on (according to the movie) Juana is a slave to her rakish husband. She wants to have sex constantly. Of course Philip's a jerk, and loses interest, and Juana goes mad. There is really only one way to make a kind of movie like this, and that's as an unabashedly enjoyable bodice ripper. The dvd headliners seem to play up this aspect: "Sex so hot the ladies in waiting eavesdrop!" Unfortunately, Aranda is actually quite prudish. He seems to think that this movie is really an impassioned feminist film about how passionate women are punished. Perhaps for this reason, we never actually see Juana and Philip have sex. Thus, Juana's sexual obsession is less palpable for the viewer. The movie also pays some lip service to the political machinations surrounding Juana. Ultimatley, Mad Love loses steam. Part of the problem is the casting of Lioti -- he looks like Fabio, but really cant act. And Philip is such a murkily written character -- is he simply a cad? A Machiavellian monarch? Like many historical dramas the movie is shot in long, uninterrupted takes and a rather still camera. It is never sunny, and no one ever smiles it seems. It's not bad for a film to play fast and loose with history. Juana la Loca's story is ambiguous enough that it can afford some modern revisionism. But for a film that wants to be a bodice ripper, a compelling costume drama, and a feminist statement, ultimately the movie ends up being none of these things. A disappointment 
 this book has slowed down my guitar learning process enormously, basically because it took away the fun from playing. a guide that I would recommend to every beginner out there is found at http://guitar.about.com/library/blguitarlessonarchive.htm and is strangely enough free. 
 This book came highly recommended and got some great blurbs, but in my opinion is quite overrated. The writing isn't particularly good, and there really isn't much meat. There are actually no REAL descriptions of most of the action. For instance, we know she and her two pals hated turning to cannibalism, but that's all (compare/contrast to "Life of Pi" by Yann Martel, which if full of gory detail of being stranded at sea, but that's what makes it real!). By the way, when one starving animal eats another starving animal, they still starve to death, because of the lack of essential fatty acids. Most mainstream fiction editors appear to have little if any knowledge of science, unfortunately. I came away from this read with very little in the way of vicarious experience and only a few (repetitive) visual images. It reads like a pretentious but untalented teenager's diary 
 Looking for a supplementary text for my Numerical Analysis course, I had my students pick up this text-  I have found that other Outlines give a lot of excellent worked examples and provide good summaries- Not this text.  If you are a beginning student, go get yourself a real text (I would highly recommend Burden and Faires, or the new text by Tim Sauer).  This text offers little to no insight into the algorithms or the analysis, and spends way too much space on one dimensional interpolation problems.  If you're simply looking for summaries of algorithms and practical advice on implementation, a much better text is the "Numerical Recipes" books.  In summary, I'm not sure who the audience is for this book-  There are many, much better, options out there 
 Some photographers think what's erotic is what's hidden and left to the imagination. Two Thirds of the pictures in this book are fig leafed with shadows or clothing, leaving plenty to the imagination. Think of playboy magazine in the 1950's or Vogue or Madamoselle magazine today.  Many of these are stylistic, but not very erotic.  One in three of the photos in the book are erotic, not afraid of nudity. Don't make the investment in this book if you want high level eroticism. Instead get "Shaven Angels", "Natural Beauties", "100 Naked Girls", or "Crazy,Sexy Girls".  
 I just recently purchased the Red Variant of this figure and was excited and pleased to have both a nice looking action figure as well as the piece of Apocalypse.  But as I was setting him up, trying to move his leg it just snapped off at the hip joint. Hence the 2 star durability rating. I have never had this problem with the Legends line before, and was very disappointed, especially since it was the variant figure. Some superglue fixed the problem, but at the cost of some articulation. He is on my shelf now and looks great, but if you're giving the toy to younger children, be cautious. Like I said I have never had any problems like this with a Marvel Legends Figure before, so hopefully it was just a fluke. The figure is still well worth getting, and in fact I am going to pick up the Green version sometime in the near future 
 I do not understand ow anyone could give this a decent review.  I just finished the book last night and I must say that the entire storyline is weak.  The heroine is an insult to women everywhere; she is ditsy, easily manipiulated, taken advantage of sexually by every male she meets... I could go on and on.  The main problem though is that she would have been dead after the first few hours if this plot had any credulity to it.  In fact, I knew the book would be a tired plot as soon as she witnesses a gruesom murder and does nothing to report it, but rather goes back to her hotel room to take a bath - PLEASE.  Do not waste your time & money - move on to something else 
 I've used the Schick Quattro for about 3 years now and have been happy with it.  I thought I would try out this powered M3 razor to see what all the hype was about.  Many of my friends said they got the best shave ever using it: No razor burn, bumps, or nicks etc.  However, the M3 gave me more razor burn and nicks than any razor I've ever used! Could it have been that I wasn't used to the Mach 3 blades after using a Quattro for years?  To rule out blade differences, I subsequently tried the Power Quattro and obtained similar, albeit less drastic, negative results.    In particular, both the M3 and Power Quattro really did a number on my neck area.  I even had people comment on how abused my neck looked after shaving with these two razors.  Both Gillette and Schick assert that vibrations diminish irritation and lead to a superior shave.  In my case, I believe that vibrations actually lead to more irritation!  My personal experience with these razors, and my cynical nature, lead me to believe that vibrating razors are just another ploy by the shaving industry to get people to buy more product (i.e., aftershave creams and lotions to cover up the mess that such razors create).    My advice is to avoid these powered hybrids alltogether and stick with a regular Quattro or Mach 3 razor. 
 I read this book just coming out of high school, 8 years or so ago.  At the time, I subscribed to Harris's dating philosophy.  Having just come out of a few defunct relationships, this book provided the answer that I was looking for: our commitment-phobic dating culture is the problem.  The solution: pursue relationships in an extreme, counter-culture fashion.    Now that I'm older, married, and a little wiser, I see this book for what it is:  a knee-jerk reaction that is a reflection on Harris's inexperience and immaturity at the time.  Having come out of a few bad relationships himself, he identified what he thought was the problem (the commitment-phobic dating culture), and scoured the Bible for "proof-texts" that coincided with his solution for the problem, like any good evangelical would do.    Why not to follow the relationship advice this book prescribes?  Well, I'm sure for many people it will work out just fine.  Just like dating works out just fine in establishing lasting relationships with many people.  The big danger I see in this book (and Boy Meets Girl, for that matter), is that natural, healthy sexual desire is going to be stifled to an unhealthy extent.  This could very well create long-term problems in the relationship, the way repressing any kind of feeling for long periods of time does.  Why do preacher's kids often end up in so much trouble?  Because they repressed the need for rebelling and discoving their individuality as adolescents.  These kinds of repressed behavior have a way of catching up with you.    Obviously, we cannot always be acting on every impulse.  That would certainly screw a person up faster than regimented discipline.  Like most things in life, a person needs to find a healthy balance.  Now for some people, saving any kind of physical contact until engagement can be perfectly healthy.  But for the vast majority, I suspect not.  Ultimately, you are going to need to find this balance yourself, and if reading this book is part of your quest to do so, then take what Harris says with a boulder of salt.  
 I was given this book as a Christmas present,it had been bought second hand first published in 1971  Ruth i'm sure has grown in experience as an author and as a medium since righting this book as has I hope Arthur Ford has  grown in experience since passing,but the undercurrant of this book was I feel racist and neochristian. and yet evan though we view the spiritworld through this narrow viewpoint it still does give a wide discription of the spirit world...if you are looking for an open minded view of the spirit world among many I would recommend Doris Stokes,Stephen o brian,Derreck Acora,Gordon Smith,Toni Stockwel 
 I purchased this gate to keep my daughter out of the kitchen.  Unfortunately every time you walk through the swing gate you have to readjust it, which makes it impossible to close with one hand. Even if you don't care about the one-hand feature, it is still a hassle to adjust.  I do not suggest buying this gate. 
 In his book The Resurrection of Christ: A Historical Inquiry, Gerd Ludemann examines the question of the resurrection by employing historical-critical methods.  Briefly put, this approach assumes that what is recorded in the New Testament, especially with regard to the divinity of Jesus, is largely the result of mythmaking by those who would benefit from elevating him to god-status.  Additionally, it presumes that the fields of modern science and psychology, along with their underlying metaphysics, should inform inquiries and shape the methods used to investigate past events.  The methodology also requires adherence to Enlightenment period philosophies.  Finally, it tends to reduce historical events and the motives of people primarily to power struggles.  Under this framework, Ludemann analyzes the resurrection accounts found in the New Testament and also some non-Canonical books.  Following this, he characterizes the early Christians' faith in the resurrection as a self-deception.  He justifies this result with a historical reconstruction complete with psychoanalyses of Peter and Paul.  Ludemann concludes that we can no longer be Christians because Jesus of Nazareth did not rise from the dead and that the largest religion on earth is based on a fraud.  He explains, "For two thousand years an abiding faith in Jesus' resurrection has displayed enormous power, but because of its utter groundlessness we must now acknowledge that it has all along been a worldwide historical hoax" (190).  Professor Ludemann's loose and circuitous arguments regarding the scriptures leave ample room for dissection and pointing out flaws in logic and exegesis, but space does not permit.  Instead, I will focus on particular concluding remarks to illuminate the incoherence that results from his untenable presuppositions and method and the inessential and superfluous nature of his resolve.  To begin, Ludemann accepts the fact that no resurrection implies human existence is meaningless.  While he should be following the path of Nietzsche, he espouses hope that virtues can somehow recover meaning.  He petitions, "We strive to create meaning in our lives by living in humility, wisdom, and love" (210).  But why should we live by these virtues to create meaning in our lives?  Suppose some people find meaning in narcissism and selfishness, or perhaps just benign apathy.  Shouldn't they be free to live by those values instead?  Ludemann may say yes, but it seems the author wants to use the imprimatur of Christian virtues to bolster his life philosophy while denying the supernatural God that gave the founder of those virtues his authority and power.  If Jesus taught that we should love others, but his resurrection is a myth and deception as Ludemann teaches, then ultimately the meaning Christians strive to create is groundless and therefore futile.  The professor also admonishes that "belief" somehow points to a weakness in humanity, and implies that it is not appropriate in our scientific age (204-05).  But immediately after disparaging belief, he champions his own.  He dogmatically informs us that he is persuaded to "Live in a house built on a solid foundation rather than a priestly domicile suspended in the sky" (205).  Presumably, this "solid foundation" refers to beliefs that can be constructed only by human intellect.  He further asserts, "Like Bertrand Russell, I believe that when I die my body will rot, and my selfhood will vanish" (210).  Having discarded orthodox Christian belief, he trusts in human intellect, naturalism, and nihilism instead.  The author merely exchanges one belief system for another.  Does he not see his own inconsistency?  Ludemann finally concludes, "Henceforth, I am no longer cowed by the notion that death is a punishment for my sin.  Nor do I hope for a resurrection...Indeed, accepting my perishability gives rise to a truer Easter vision.  Now freed from the undertow of fear and in defiance of the absurd, I can join myself to all humanity by striving in all things to give the best that is in me, and to dedicate my efforts to the welfare of my fellow-voyagers" (210).  In this final assertion of naturalistic dogma, he aspires to greatness in assisting his fellow human beings.  However, he seems to think that his newfound freedom from the absurdity of a God who would raise Jesus from the dead, is what serves as the impetus for his altruistic ambitions.  But this statement of belief is independent of his polemic and consequently his argument loses all force.  I have tried to show, in limited space, that Gerd Ludemann's naturalistic assumptions produce incongruities and self-contradictory reasoning.  Assuming there is no supernatural realm requires him to conjure up fantasies to circumvent the plain meaning and simple message of an ancient text.  In point of fact, I don't think professor Ludemann, in his quietest moments, really wants to live, or die, with his convictions.  The first Christians willingly died for their testimony to seeing Jesus alive again after his crucifixion.  We even know from Josephus that James, the brother of Jesus, was executed for his beliefs.  If Christ wasn't raised, why did all of them die for what they knew to be a lie 
 We selected this book for our discussion group this month.  And I started reading it several days ago.  The first half of the book went slowly; it was confusing and uninteresting.  The second half picked up with some tension and interest.  And the ending just triumphed with sadness and melancholy feelings.  I watched the Patriot/Broncos game while reading the story.  And the storyline followed the game 
 I am so glad that Christians around the world have such a good leader (sarcasm).  Mr. Robertson is obviously off his meds.  Let's see, assassinate the leader of Venezuala and the Israeli Prime Minister is being punished by God which is why he had a stroke.  This is obviously a sign that Jesus left Mr. Robertson in charge.  But then again, at least Pat has yet to see a 50 foot tall Jesus in Tulsa, OK.  God has a way of reconciling those who manipulate his words ... see Jim Baker and Jessica Hahn.  When the Lord comes knocking at your door Pat, how are you going to explain yourself.  I hope you have not hired Tom Cruise's publicist 
 I bought one of these last year, and put it up in our yard just five feet from the fence dividing our yard from the neighbor's yard.  This device completely failed to stop the neighbor's barking dog.  I could detect no effect whatsoever.  Save your money, and try something else.  I wish I could tell you what works, but we're still looking 
 My book club read this novel. I'll admit it's well written; I couldn't have made it to the end if it had not been. However, it was impossible to relate to the crazy experiences the protagonists in this book had. I am a mature woman who found these two young men hopelessly dangerous. Almost every decision they made was senseless. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone over thirty 
 While I was reading/assembling my computer I found the book to be poorly written, with not nearly enough specific info.  I was very frustrated, and needed to purchase a different book to correctly assemble my rig.  Since then I've read 15-20 other books related to computer hardware/software/networking affording me a fair amount of perspective.  This book ranges from badly outdated general info. to just plain incorrect info.  I can say now with confidence that using only this book as a reference will almost guarantee an improper assembly of your computer.  You will be frustrated and you will probably waste a decent amount of money 
 Having no great fondness for B. F. to begin with, from the little I know of him and his work, I thought I'd give this a try just to see what the Grand Old Man of conditioned rats and pigeons had to say about Utopias.  What kind of Utopia would be imagined by some guy who saw no essential behavioral difference (and presumably no other important difference) between rats and humans?  As I had expected, I had a distinctly uneasy feeling about it well before finishing it-by about p. 60, in fact-but I couldn't clearly define or articulate it.  So, like anyone looking for easy answers, I Googled the book, and the first citation on the page was "A critical review of B.F. Skinner's philosophy, with focus on _Walden Two_", by Edward Rozycki (1999, based on a 1995 article for the journal _Educational Studies_).  And Rozycki made amply clear a few points which seem to have escaped all the raving enthusiasts of the book, such as:  (1) Skinner was a lousy scientist, who explicitly rejected some of the fundamental tenets of the scientific method, such as considering all the observed data.  In the book, Frazier says, "To go to all the trouble of running controls would be to make a fetish of scientific method."  Although Skinner kept telling everyone he was an empiricist and not a theorist, most of his work is basically theory based on what he chose to consider the world to be.    (2) His "vision" is fundamentally totalitarian (Roz tactfully avoids the term "fascist," but I would not be that polite).  As Frazier says, "Each of us has interests which conflict with the interests of everybody else. ...  Now, `everybody else' we call `society.'  It's a powerful opponent and it always wins."  Substitute "State" for "society" and that's pretty clear totalitarianism.    (3) The reason everybody in the community is so blissfully happy is that anyone who is not blissfully happy is made to feel unwelcome by the community and subtly cold-shouldered out.  About anyone who is "incorrigible," Frazier says that "it's more likely that he would long since have gone of his own accord."  As Rosycki dryly notes, "The point is not elaborated on."  I don't think it needs to be.  So, given my impression that Skinner's starry-eyed Utopian vision of a "culturally engineered" bliss of humanoid pigeons is one of the most terrifying things I've read since the daily news, I fail to see why everyone seems to think it's so wonderful.  I think it's a dreadful vision, just as dystopic, in its sinister way, as _Brave New World_.  And it's a boring read to boot 
 Theres only one word to describe this ppv and thats S**T, WHY did they have to ruin 2 matches(main events) what could have saved this event!

 This title is the bootleg title for a film called the The Ratings Game. I'm no sure why Amazon is selling this on their web site. The quality of this DVD is terrible, I was suspicious when I got it. The DVD case and the DVD itself look like they were home made. Having said all this, knockoff or not this is a bad film with a lot of big names in it. It's like they were trying to make something campy and failed big time. I expected more of Danny DeVito.  
 I started reading this book expecting to like it - it's historical, related to Little Women, won the Pulitzer, doesn't feel like fluff, etc. However I had a really difficult time getting into the book.   For one, the language sounded much more pretentious than historically accurate. I've read other works from the time period she's supposed to be writing in, and rather than feeling in keeping with that era, this book felt indicitive of someone who makes full use of her thesaurus.   Also, I haven't read her other book so i didn't enter this novel with a trust for the author. Consequentally, I found that as she mentioned connections to Little Women, I became defensive. She had not proven to me that she had the right to use this work. In some of her character choices, such as one of the first encounters between March and Marmee (I'm not going to go into details so as not to spoil the scene), I believe that she made a radical departure from anything that Alcott would have written of her characters, and that Brooks really did not stay true to the original.   The first half of the book is also really dry. This could just be my personal taste, but the first half moved so slowly! The book started to pick up about half way through. Overall, the story being told and the Civil War aspects weren't bad, and could be a decent story in their own right if she'd just speed things along at the beginning.  However, I think Brooks did the book a major disservice by linking it to Little Women. I bristled every time she mentioned an individual from the book, because she was really changing their characters (other than Aunt March). The choices that Brooks' characters made were not in keeping with choices they may have made in Alcott's book.   In the afterward, Brooks discussed her research and how she actually based the March family and particularly Mr. March more on the Alcott family itself than on the characters from Little Women, even commenting how the March Family in Alcott's book isn't very interesting, and how "Nobody in real life is such a goody-goody as that Marmee." If she felt that way, then why use them as the basis for her book? Seen in that context, her earlier *huge* liberties with Marmee's character seem to just be a way to "stick it" to Alcott: "ha ha, look how much more realistic Marmee is now! 
 The reading magnifiers I ordered 09/29/04 finally arrived 10/19/04 after a call to the seller. (Original order was shipped to Amazon.com so it had to be reshipped to me.) It only took 5 minutes or so to assemble one of the reading magnifiers, and it is possible to adjust it to just about any position with the clever arm.  The weighted base does keep it from falling over. Unfortunately, the thin plastic lense is such poor quality that it is very difficult to receive any benefit from the device.  If the user turned the adjustment knob too far, it and the nut that holds it together would fall off.  The nut is small and must be inserted into the outside of the adjustment knob to assemble the device.  The knob actually turns the nut onto the screw. Presumably the device is for someone with low vision.  If the small nut falls to the floor, I'm not sure someone with low vision would be able to find it.  My advice is to save your money and buy a quality device with a nice glass lens.... and if possible, try the device out before buying. 
 This series is WAAAAAAY TOO LOOOOONG. It used to be good, but now, it's starting to get BOR-ING! It has to end soon or else I'll sleep 
 Eight years ago today was the day Blondie's reunion album was released, and though it was great to see Blondie back together, No Exit just fell short on many levels. 2004's The Curse of Blondie(see my review also on Amazon)is a much better album and should have been their comeback. No Exit won't exactly take you back to the hooks that made Blondie famous. Harry's lyrics are wonderful in "Double Take," but the deadpan melody literally kills the song. Fans were also not terribly waiting for jazz standards("Boom Boom in the Zoom Zoom Room") or revamped demo tracks("Out in the Streets"), but the worst cut is the title song that includes a rap verse by Coolio. Both the band and Coolio could have thought of something more productive to sing about. The music isn't catchy either. All is not lost with songs like "Night Wind Sent," and Harry's own transformation in "Forgive and Forget, plus who would dare argue Blondie's potential to shake the pop world again when you hear "Maria." As the album's best track, "Maria" is a wonderful reminder of how Blondie, and Debbie, can still create an infectious pop song that leaves a template on the mind 
 I agree with the rest of the reviews.  I've read this series since its' inception, and enjoyed almost all of the books.  The sex has gotten stanger and more prevelant, but even through the last book it was still an adjunct to the plot.  This one however has nothing BUT sex.  No plot, no action.  If you took out all pages which contain sex you wouldn't have 5% of the book left 
 I would be very wary of the positive reviews on this product.  I find it hard to believe that such a piece of garbage could be thought of so highly.  First off, you must hold the top down to get the item being laminated through the machine.  This would be a minor inconvenience if this was the only problem.  The really bad news is that the laminate bubbles horribly, and it is hazy rather than clear.  How anyone would use this for photos is beyond me.  Next, the magnetic backing doesn't stick at all to whatever your laminating. It just falls right off.  There is absolutely nothing worthwhile about this piece of junk.  I bought this based on the reviews of the others here.  Shame on them for misleading people in this way.  If you want to use this as an arts and crafts type of toy for pre-kindergarteners, maybe.  For serious use, never.  Spend the extra money and get a quality heat laminating machine 
 I recently bought this projector (not through Amazon) and ended up having to return it.  It has a persistent burning odor.  I thought it would go away after an hour or two, but three days later and many hours, it was just as bad.  It was so bad that my wife opened up the windows in our house and it was in the 20s outside.    I liked everything else about the projector.  It was light and fairly small.  The fan was quite and the picture was bright.  If it didn't smell so bad, I would have kept it 
 I wont say anything about correctness, but in the end Ahmed Ali has been unable to convey the profound tone any of our holy books has, and definitely Kur'an does too.  The English is not in the least exciting or moving.. Finally the edition is a poor one, a uselessly big book, hard to handle when its paperback like mine. 
 This was my first Robert Ludlum novel and I am seriously disappointed. I don't know that I'll even finish it.  Characters have literally had the same conversations multiple times, as if the author isnt sure we were paying attention and they better summarize the plot again, just to be safe.  The writing itself just tries to hard and is, in a word, lame.  Sample line: "He crossed the room to the sink and picked up the dish liquid, Dawn, and poured some in the sink." Like we need to what brand of dish soap it is(!)?    From the summary on the jacket, this novel sounded promising. Instead, I'm fighting to stay awake, not caring if they ever catch the bad guys. 2 out 5 stars because I've managed to hang on more than half way. 
 It is difficult to believe that such a slow and dull book could be written about such a compelling subject.  The reviewers who have lamented the short, choppy paragraphs that irritatingly jump from one scene to another, without benefit of full explanation or connection, are correct to scorn the overall poor writing that makes up this book.  I had to read some paragraphs several times and even then didn't understand what I was reading.  It was nearly impossible to picture most of the action in my mind, as it was mostly just a jumbled collection of facts and anecdotes that rambled on and on and on.  The description of the fire itself drags on chaotically for fifty tedious pages, which incited one yawn after another.  The book lacks any sense of focus and the author uses a very poor choice of words in many instances.  For example, the narrative is littered with sentences like: "She made for the east exit..."  Okay, fine, but did she run, walk, crawl, hop, skip, jump, or fly to the east exit?  I just don't know what to picture there.  The word "made" says nothing descriptive and is therefor about the worst word that could have been chosen.  This type of problem occurs on every page of the book.  I haven't read anything else the author has written, so I hate to be so critical.  I wonder, however, why his editor didn't send his manuscript back to him with thousands of suggestions.  I felt as if I was reading a very hastily-prepared early draft.  I have read many gripping books about disasters and survival situations.  This just isn't one of them.  Compare "The Circus Fire" to "Into Thin Air," "Heart of the Sea," "Batavia's Graveyard," or "Ordeal by Hunger" and you'll understand what I mean 
 I don't for a second believe that Burroughs is telling the truth about his life -- but I gobbled up his other books anyway.  He's funny and there's something endearing about the way he writes -- yes he's gay, and yes that necessarily "colors" his worldview -- but talking about a job you hate, a family you loathe, and a partner who amazingly tolerates you are necessarily universal.  That said, he lapses here.  This isn't as approachable a book and the narrator is isn't so much funny as he is unlikeable.  By turns smug and arrogant, too much of this feels self-indulgent.  Chafingly, distractingly so 
 I remember this movie being really, really fun and great when I was 9. My wife wanted this for our video collection and I hate myself for buying this movie. All I need to know is why she wanted this today! If you have kids, which we do, they'll enjoy this for the first time, but after words they'll be as bored with it as I am. If you are looking for nostalgia, this is the movie, but if you are looking for a good dust collector, buy it quickly 
 From a parents view I definetly thought this sequel was violent compared to the first one.  We saw this at the the theater, and almost had to leave. If your expecting this to be just like the first one, you'll be upset.  For a  family with young children, I would suggest renting this before you buy it 
 I wasn't able to use this book at all. It was confusing and didn't have any useful information I feel I can trust 
 FOR THE LATE 1970s, the audio quality is surprisingly poor.  It can barely be called hifi, the sound seems to be intended for a tv set speaker. The costume are over the top and unmasculine for the men. I think that overall, this is a bomb. I would recommend the following DVD:   Mozart - Don Giovanni / Gilfry, Polgar, Bartoli, Rey, Nikiteanu, Salminen, Widmer, Harnoncourt, Zurich Opera (2001)  or with really great singers but from 1950s (still with good sound in colour):  Mozart - Don Giovanni / Furtwangler (1954) with LISA DELLA CASA !! 
 I enjoyed the parts regarding the S.S. Valiant, but the later part of the book simply didn't work for me. Except for Picard, who we of course know quite well from the series, the other characters were flat and uninteresting. We never find out what is motivating the alien attackers and they are the cardboard cutout enemy-of-the-week, boring. The whole "adversarial" situation with the 1st Officer also just struck me as odd and wrong, and was just not developed correctly or fleshed out beyond being another cardboard enemy for Picard 
 I listened to this audio book becuase it was lying around. It wasn't inspiring or enlightening. Too many characters and plot twists leave the reader wondering who is who and what is going on. It would have been more interesting if it was real. As one who hasn't read any other books by the author, my viewpoint stands in a vacuum.  The ending seems trite and fumbles for closure 
 Keynes was no doubt an influential economist.  His theories and 'expertise' on economics influenced the post-New Deal economic policies of the United States and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like IMF.  However, his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of Keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the U.S. particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation (an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to Keynesism.)  We have Keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government.  Read Planning for Freedom or Socialism by Ludwig von Mises instead 
 I don't regret having read this book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't already into Henry James.  The style is hard to understand, apparently because it was dictated, and the subject matter is even more obscure.  I don't think Henry James had much experience with children: even assuming that Maisie is twisted by her strange situation, she doesn't talk like any child I know or can imagine.  Weird moral undercurrents and jealousy take up most, if not all, of the novel.  I wouldn't take claims of this book's modernity too seriously - it's more on the byzantine side.  Read The Europeans instead: so much more fun 
 Anyone purchasing this book sight unseen will be profoundly disappointed with the overwhelming lack of clear color plates. Imagine a book about a basically unpublished subject of great interest and having it deny the  reader a full experiential exploration of the works described. This book is  suitable for the art historian only . Art lovers expecting a long needed  color plate book about Sargent's mural masterpieces will have to wait  longer. Too bad 
 I mistakenly believed the hype that this thing would PROTECT my computer from BEING KILLED, but instead, this thing has KILLED my computer FOR THE SECOND TIME IN 4 DAYS, EMITTING AN UN-STOPPABLE(i.e., CAN'T TURN THE FEATURE OFF) SHRIEK ALARM. How do smart, talented people idiotically convince themselves that a home product should have an ear-piercing shriek-alarm that can't be defeated / silenced?  In addition to doing far, far more damage than it can ever prevent, ask yourself -- do you want this un-stoppable ear-piercing shriek alarm going off in your house at 2a.m.? I BOUGHT ONE APC PRODUCT, AND SO FAR, THEY'RE 100% DEFECTIVE AND 100% DELITERIOUS TO THE USE OF MY COMPUTER & IT'S A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE IT'S DELITERIOUS TO MY SLEEP. 
 If you seriously collect or sell Hull pottery, skip this book.  Only the most expensive pieces have color pictures and valuations, but even for many of these you will only find small black and white pictures, and no  valuations. Furthermore, almost 25% of the book is merely reprints from old  Hull catalogs, with no valuations included.  Valuations are inconveniently  listed in the back of the book, which requires a lot of page flipping (very  convenient for the publisher, who only has to update this section, rather  than the entire book).  I get the impression that this book was merely  published to profit off the interest of collectors, but not really intended  to serve the collector's needs 
 As a student of health care economics (due to being employed in a managerial position in a health care enterprise,) I embarked on reading this book with great anticipation and was left with great disappointment.  My disappointment stemmed from faults in both style and substance.  As to style, the writing is replete with complex sentences with subordinate clause following on subordinate clause until one can no longer remember what the subject or the verb is, much less make any sense of the meaning of the sentence.  I read extensively in professional journals as part of my employment and feel that the stylistic mannerisms of this book significantly diminished its impact.  There were a number of simpler grammatical errors that should have been caught by the editors at Harvard Press.  I was dismayed that two so presumably eminent scholars should write in such a confusing and obfuscating way.  As to matters of substance, I was surprised that some of the more significant influences on the current state of the US's health care "system" were either ignored or brushed aside as being uninmportant.  The three that immediately come to mind are the complete neglect in discussing the impact that the cost of pharmaceuticals has had on the overall cost of health care, the impact that malpractice litigation and the threat of malpractice suits have had, and the incredible cost of the administrative labyrinths that exist for most providers.  Also glossed over is the exorbitant amount of money being taken out of the health care system in the form of profits for shareholders of for-profit healthcare entities (not just big pharma)and salaries and bonuses for the high-flying executives of these for-profits.  All in all, this book was so  narrowly focused on medical schools and medical education as to be nearly useless in explaining how we have gotten to where we are.  Critical Condition, by Barlett and Steele, is a much better book in describing the history behind the current state of affairs, and offers a much better solution than Richmond and Fein propose. 
 This is not a rating of the magazine - just a warning to check your Wish List address if you "wish" for magazines.  My son changed his address in his Amazon account when he moved 2 years ago within the same city. Amazon did not use this information to update his address within his Wish List. When I ordered $138 worth of magazines from his wish list last December, Amazon hid the street address "for privacy" - therefore I could not know the magazines would be sent to the wrong address.  In November, I asked my son if he'd like to have these magazines renewed and he said he had never received any!  After I spoke with Amazon, my son now gets a message when he goes to his Wish List that his address doesn't match the one in his account, so it's clear Amazon is now aware of this problem.  The publisher will not redo this Communication Arts subscription, saying the magazines were never returned to them, and Amazon has not responded to my request for a refund 
 What happened, Senor No-Name?  It's such a shame your talent had to end...  Honestly, this single is the current Prince standard.  Decent, better than a lot of other stuff on the radio, but makes you long for even a hint of the edge and vitality of his earlier, vastly superior work.  Hopefully the album it's on is better than the lackluster 2004 effort, Musicology, but don't expect it to be.  The lower your expectations are with Prince these days, the more surprised you're likely to be 
 I can't fathom why this book is beloved.  It's just awful.  Alright, that's a little strong.  The first third-to-half of the book is just awful:  tedious, depressing, tiresome, plotless.  Indeed, Lawrence put a sentence in that, amazingly, perfectly summarizes the first half of the book:    "The days seemed to grind by, with curious painfulness, yet nothing happened."  That really does say it all.  The protagonist plods through her dreary, depressing life, and nothing happens.  At times during this book, I got the feeling that Lawrence really wanted to be a botonist rather than a novelist, because he spends more time talking about every last plant in the woods than he does talking about any of the people in the story.  For a while I had to keep going to the dictionary to look up every plant I'd never heard of, until I finally just gave up.  Eventually, in the last third or so of the book, it starts getting a little more interesting.  But sadly, while it starts to appear that something resembling a plot is finally developing, in the end nothing very much comes of any of it.  But we DO get long, windy, insufferably self-righteous political nattering, of a Rousseau-ian nature:  all industrialism and capitalism is bad and we should go back to some idylic state of nature thing that never in reality existed (in reality, life in the state of nature is nasty, brutish, and short).  This is at its most ludicrous when the title character makes all these chicken-little doomsday predictions about how mankind is going to be basically wiped out in 100 years unless we give up industrialism/capitalism and all.  Well, the book came out in 1928, so he's still got some 20 years to not look like an utter nincompoop.  But I could tolerate the misguided ranting if the rest of the book were good.  It is not.  The biggest problem is the oppressive dreariness of it.  This stems largely from the fact that Lawrence only ever seems interested in writing about emotionally crippled people (so much so that I strongly suspect  that he was emotionally crippled himself).  Every character is decidely neurotic, each in their own special flavor.  The closest thing we have to a representative of mental health would be Mrs. Bolton.  The central character Connie does eventually get her head screwed on straight by the end of the book, but it sure takes her long enough.  I just could not identify with these people one tiny iota.  Repeatedly I just wanted to hit them for their behavior and emotional attitudes.  To its credit, the book does advocate an unabashed, unashamed joyous love of sex, something with which I am totally on board.  But that's about the only good thing I could find to say 
 The Upanishads, after the Vedas are the foremost scriptures of Hinduism. They are the central components of the Vedanta philosophy and have time and again inspired the minds and hearts of many.  Many people have tried expounding on the Upanishads, from Aurobindo to Max Muller; each sharing their own unique perspective formed by laborious study, rich life experiences and plain old hard work which constituted their epiphanies latter put to word.  Piparaiya's work is a very insult to these post-modern forerunners works in translating the Upanishadic ethos into english. There are a variety of works which can be purchased for freem from the "Divine Life Society" that far transcend this book in both quality and availablity; since they are free.  The upanishads are the heart of the vedantic thought, dont spoil your first impression by geting this second rate introduction to it. There are a variety of other sources and I DO NOT suggest this one.  Paramananda's the upanishads are a good place to start 
 That this selection sells for $1.25 is a surprise. The price appears to be inflated. This book falls flat in the prediction that "Norm distills a lifetime of experience into seventy short, simple lessons". Such as? Sharpening a pencil? We learn how to sharpen a carpenter's pencil...sort of. The reader sits white knuckled as we learn that a stainless steel handsaw was stolen from Norm's tool box. We learn that a level breaks when dropped from 1-1/2 stories. Who would have thought? Norm tells us that the combination square's uses could fill several pages of this 5" x 7" book. We learn of three uses and three of the most obvious. Cute? Warm and fuzzy? Ok. However, if one is looking forward to learning the secrets of 30+ years he ought to look elsewhere. The "Lessons from a Master Carpenter" are few indeed. Abram apparently could not share the secrets. Come now, no doubt that Abram is a skilled builder. Without a doubt he ought to avoid writing books and resume building. Pass on this one unless found at twenty-five cents 
 I understood that The Moonstone is a classic so I decided to read this to be culturally literate. Well the story line may be interesting but the writing is atrocious. It is curricular, bloated, and seemingly pointless. The characters just keep rattling. A lot of writers fill in the story with descriptions of time and place to give an atmosphere to the story. This writer (Wilkie Collins) just fills it with unrelated trivia. Every once in a while I would go back a few pages to see what I must have missed. When I read again there was nothing there to miss. Ether Wilkie is extremely monotonous or other writing from this period is and I am just now lucky enough to find out. I talked to others about this and they said; "Now you know why Sherlock Holmes is so popular"   
 Need I say more?  The ball flew off with the plastic connector and wound up in the neighbor's yard.  Thankfully no one was hurt 
 The kids (9,6) enjoyed playing with the projector which was easy to use but the images it projects are not at all 3-D.  The images are difficult to see with the 3-D glasses on and colorful yet blurry with them off.  Overall it was used for about 40 minutes in two years.  I'm sorry to say a complete waste of money although we have been happy with several other Uncle Milton products 
 I thought the book had very little value.  The author spent way too much time explaining why building your own home is a bad idea.  Many things can go wrong.  Most of us know that.  How about some encouragement and problem solving ideas.  Alas nothing of help.  The basic theme is to hire every expert known in the trade (including tree doctor), do nothing yourself, bring lots of money (double all your estimates, then then double the total), or better yet just save yourself the time and frustration and buy an existing home.  
 this piece of product was horribly engineered. it is very difficult to mount the tomtom 910 unlike the mount kit for the 700. Honestly  If I could return my tomtom 910 I would have done so immediately because of the mount kit 
 This book has great pictures and good design themes, but if you're looking for a book on how to finish a basement, this is no help.  I've gotten some ideas from this book, but I still don't know where to start with the actuall construction 
 This book is weak.  This is trivia and really nothing more.  I have caught Perry's articles on the national website he works for and I am unimpressed with both this book and his columns.  Extreme bias and inability to look at baseball as a game and a sport leave Perry  with a backwards "K".  Pick up anything from Bill James, Peter Angell or the Baseball Prospectus and you will do much better than this "writing."    
 I am a cartoon, and a comic fan.  I have been for years.  I think it is great that marvel has finally started putting out some great cartoon movies to show us in motion what these heroes can do.  The first Ultimate Avengers was cartoon-violent at times, but I thought that is was ok for my 5 year old daughter to watch.  But the second Ultimate Avengers, I thought this one took it a little too far.  There is a lot of hacking and slashing, a lot of really brutal fight scenes, and not alot of the Avengers.  Usually hero violence is punching the badguy out, or throwing him through a wall, but in this film they are trying to kill, and that is hard to watch with a child in the room.  I watched it once with my daughter, and ended up covering her eyes for portions of this film.  For me, I kinda liked it, but I won't watch it very often.  For my daughter, I wouldn't want her to watch it again 
 ... apparently his magic wand was malfunctioning.  To Baldacci's credit his writing style is his only asset when it comes to keeping readers interested and wanting them to find out who did what and why. That's why I gave two stars. But all throughout the book I constantly felt that I was reading yet another "blockbuster" garbage. The book did not add any meaning, I did not care for the characters at all, and Baldacci did a great job ruining the ending 
 I was hoping for something that would delve into the mind of a serial killer.  This, however, is kind of a generic re-hash of the chronology of the killings.  I found myself flipping through many of the chapters.  Also, there's way too much emphasis on the church pastor.  He wasn't involved in any way so who cares?    If you're interested in true crime, save your money for a better book--there are many. 
 i don't really write reviews, but i felt like i needed to say something about this one. maybe its me, but i couldn't get the pump to work. So i bought a new basketball. I bought a regular one, and bought a pump. I wish that infusion thing worked out, because it would have been great to deflate it, put it in my bag, and then pump it up again at the court. But my friend warned me they don't work so good. I'm just stubborn i guess. That's my 2 cents. Take it for what its worth 
 making clothes....think of the Butlerian strategy of it all!  Are they undoing gender? Wow! And on pennies a day, too!  Think of the androgynous gay boy who might wear the same clothes as his bestest girlfriend. Think of the subversiveness of it all!  Consider the fact that maybe the slave woman in Honduras made those clothes!  How Butlerian, indeed! 
 I read this book on the strength of the author's "See no evil." Worried about a sense of deja vu, I waited five months.  That was not necessary: This book provides little sense of place or character, seeming to depend upon your having read "See no evil" for that.  If it hadn't been for "See no evil", I would have stopped reading after the first few chapters.  Although the first chapter was promising, I quickly lapsed into speed reading (just short of skimming).  Just over halfway thru, I became so disappointed, I stop reading.  However, my curiosity - inspired by the author's previous work - got the better of me, and I picked it back up and skimmed to the end (encountering nothing to cause me to read for enjoyment).  The book's genre is the spy version of "detective thriller" - the hero runs from place to place collecting information from various "colorful" sources, with various "old friends" providing critical information that would have otherwise disrupted the frenetic pace.  The author does not have the kind of  writing skills needed to pull off a book in this genre.  I expected (and desired) some exposition on Middle East politics, but it often came across as excessive and preachy (obsessive?).  Novels can provide a simplified version of a situation to reveal underlying truths, but this book provides only a simplistic version - readers of "See no evil" may feel insulted, not just disappointed.  I expected that part of the book would center on bureaucratic politics and infighting within the CIA and intelligence community, but what was here was disappointing, poorly set up and very badly rendered.  The ambiguities and uncertainties I would have expected were slight and peripheral to the main thread of the book.  Dialogue is often poorly rendered - it took effort to track which character was saying what - but this was a symptom of the bigger problems.  If you have this problem in an extended exchange involving only two characters, there is a problem with the characters themselves and with the plot point that the dialogue is attempting to advance.  But some of the exchanges were so trite, I didn't bother to make the effort.  Characters are minimally rendered.  The plot is slight.  Transitions between scenes are often jarring.  Too many of the situations strain credibility.  The ending made me feel not just cheated, but betrayed (appropriate behavior for a Case Officier, but not for an author).  Read "See no evil".  Skip this book - It could have just as easily been produced by a writer whose only experience was reading other books in this genre 
 The first time I purchased this it came with 3 glasses broken. They quickly sent me another box. Well, in this, my second shipment, 4 glasses were broken. They need to write fragile or something on the box because the post man just throws it on the doorstep 
 Sorry I bought this book....it wasn't anything that I could follow thru on...guess I'll just stick to watching my 'over active fork'....T 
 This story went nowhere fast. Very unbelievable on so many levels. Jane/Chrira really bothered me and the way she grew into this pig-headed brat made the book hard to finish. I'll give her another try... but I hope Iris doesn't let me down again 
 We were very disappointed with this style trampoline enclosure.  As it only attaches to 4 of the eight legs, it essentially reduces your round trampoline to a much smaller square.  We were constantly trying to find ways to pull it away from the jumping area as it sort of "caves in".  We finally gave up and purchased a new one that attaches on the OUTSIDE of the poles that attach to all eight legs 
 Ugh! Worst narrator ever. Strange forced affectation and laughable accents and voices. As far as the book is concerned,I read the book a long time ago and enjoyed it for what it was--a mystery/thriller--not a piece of art. I enjoyed the whole trilogy in fact. This narrator is killing it for me though. I wouldn't be able to stand another Ellroy or any author for that matter, with this guy. He might be good in a different genre but this just sounds forced and odd. I wonder how Ellroy feels about this recording. 
 A MAN SEEKS VENGEANCE AGAINST A GANG THAT STOLE HIS MOTORCYCLE. STRAIGHT UP PREDICTABLE AND UNDENIABLY BORING. VAN DAMME LOOKS SO TERRIBLE IN THAT BEARD, I HOPE HE NEVER DOES A MOVIE WITH HIS BEARD LIKE THAT AGAIN. THE MOVIE IS STUPID, THE PLOT IS SO LAME, AND THE ACTION IS SO BORING. I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW A DIE- HARD FAN OF VAN DAMME COULD LIKE THIS! THIS IS A MOVIE THAT DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE TO BE IN STORES. THIS DEFINITELY AIN'T WORTH ONE CENT OF ITS PRICE. IF YOU ARE A VAN DAMME FAN, DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS MOVIE. A WALK IN THE WOODS IS MORE EXCITING THAN THIS. IF THIS MOVIE REALLY DOES APPEAL TO YOU, THEN YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T KNOW YOUR ACTION MOVIES TOO WELL 
 A good book to read if you are headed to Glacier National park and want practical tips on hiking in bear country.  Anna Pigeon is the main character.  She is a smart, self assured woman who can be manipulated by the stigmas of political correctness yet clever enough to fend off her adversaries.  As a mystery novel the summation is contrived and the pace of the work makes a chore of the reading.  
 It would be nice if the glossary on the CD-ROM went along with the book - makes learning confusing.  It would also be nice if ther was a uniform code of terms that went along with my other marketing classes.  I had to ask my teacher what we were going by - the book or the CD-ROM terms - teacher says to forget the CD-ROM - also, I bought it used so I didn't recieve the card with details on how to get into the website 
 This book has no idea what should be prioritized and what shouldn't. Also, the narrative is a rambling mess.  Ex: They spend 10 excruciating pages on Stalin's agricultural and industrial reforms, but contrive to cover the entire holocaust in all of 10 LINES! 'Nuff said!  I got a 5 on the AP exam quite comforably, but no thanks to this ridiculous book 
 I'd heard about Curves, and decided to check out this book from the library to decide if I wanted to try out the Curves system. As other reviewers have said, this is Atkins all over again. More than 2/3 of the book is about diet. While there is a SMALL section about the exercises, to be honest, I didn't see an exercise in there that was particularly original. Since I thought this was an exercise program, I was disappointed in the scanty amount of exercise information in the book. I was also disappointed in the Phase III. It requires you to weigh yourself every day to make sure you're not gaining back too much weight, and you go back on a low carb/low calorie diet as soon as you're 5 pounds over what you want to be. I understand the idea, but being chained to a scale is not what I had in mind when it said "without permanent dieting". I know there are people at a healthy weight who don't weigh themselves every day, and I don't think getting fixated on a magical scale number is healthy either. While the metabolism section was somewhat interesting, I just can't get excited about this program 
 The control of PowerPoint is excellet except the blank screen button is often accidentally pressed during the presentation.  The laser is very weak and dies often in the middle of a presentation-rather frustrating.  I liked the flash memory initially, but found it troublesome because it takes extra time for the PC to recongnize it and a folder always pops up 
 This book could have been written in 200 pages instead of 400 if James Frey did not repeat himself a million times. Although, the book is based on fictional characters the author could have developed the characters more by including more of the occupants from the treatment facility and told their individual stories to make the story flow and make the book more interesting instead of being so repetitive. This book however, did shed some insight on what addicts go through during detox. He could have been less descriptive in the sections where he described getting sick and throwing -up, and the very graphic descriptions he gave when taking his stitches out; even though his tactic was to show how brave he was, the reader could tell that it was all in his addictive mind! This book would be an encouragement for someone who is an addict and need something to pull them into reality to show them that they can kick their addiction and change their life before it is too late, like it almost was for James. It was just an okay book and we hope James Frey's next book will be much more interesting 
 The criticism that a lot of the perfume and aromatherapy community has leveled at this book has been that there is nothing in this book that is not already in print.  I'd be willing to agree with that.  Considering that Chrissie Wildwood is out of print, and that Arctander and Tisserand are hard to find inexpensively, this book is an okay stand-in for those which preceded it.  It is not the final authority however, despite the glowing reviews.  Get the original works from these three authors if you possibly can, if you consider yourself a perfumery scholar 
 THurow gives us scaring moments through all the book, to finish it with a ludicrous positive message of about just two paragraphs !  He did a good research about World Globalization, he blamed  old people all around the  world for the crisis in the Welfare State, he gave empty clues for solving  this problems. Anyway, its good to know the real face of Capitalism, as  Marx had predicted a long time ago, but that had been held at bay by the  Welfare State politics post World War II. But, like he says, theres no  other system available but Capitalism. In other words: if you are rich,  youll get richer; if youre poor, youre dead 
 You can use this case for storage which is what I do now. It doesn't allow me to click the buttons, the bottom two since it squeezes it already and it's down so I can't access them. Overall, it's ok for just keeping your player in there. I really recommend an invisible shield, it works better than this case for sure. This case is a bit bulky, but it's alright if you don't mind taking the player out to press the buttons to change songs and put it back in. Sometimes when you put it back in, it will accidentally press one of the buttons which can be annoying and pretty much is. Basically, if you want a case to keep it in this isn't too bad, but another product is better for sure. Either my case was jinxed or they are all like that. 
 These slippers are cute but the sole is VERY thin ergo, it's like walking on concrete. There is no arch support.  I would not buy them if either one of these things are an issue 
 What's the deal with glorifying gangster behavior?  This cat is a poor role model for youngsters with his swagger and gangster affectations.  The author needs to straighten out this feline 
 Bought two. Ran them all spring at opposite ends of the lawn. ABSOLUTELY no help. Not worth any money at all 
 We read this book for a graduate class on teaching other cultures. While I was disappointed at the lack of practical applications of the book, it did help to open my eyes to the idea of White Dominance. There are factors of a white-dominated culture that are invisible to us whites, and Howard does a good job of bringing those to light.  Much of the book is comprised of personal narratives, about Howard living in an economically-recessed area while attending Yale. It was then that he began to question his assumptions about racism, and the rest is history.  I do, however, believe that he is using this book as a way of marketing his REACH center, which is an organization that trains teachers in cultural awareness, and also designs curricula for schools.  Overall, this book is a good place to start when considering the implications and hazards of teaching other cultures, but just the book by itself does little to enlighten 
   No wonder Detroit declined if this book and Made in Detroit by Clemens are the best one can come up with for an explanation of Detroit's demise.  I went to Detroit Labor Day of 2004 and thought it looked liked it had been hit by a neutron bomb. I have yet to find a book that gives a truly thoughtful analysis of what happened to Detroit.   This book is unimaginably poorly written and disorganized.  Is the author dyslexic?.  Chock full of "more on this later" and "which I discussed earlier".  But this book has some amazing facts on the Republic of New African and Aretha Franklin's pastor dad's collusion with black militants.  So it is the better of the two books for insights.   Despite the bad writing I would have given it 3 stars for the amazing facts except it peters out badly near the end as the author, a former chief of the Detroit P.D., dwells on his definitions of good policing.   
 Tina is molested by her stepfather, who she thinks is her real father, until her mother finally tells her that he isn't. Tina is vague about the details of the abuse and doesn't actually say what happened, so the reader is left in the dark as to how far it went. She prays to God many times to make it stop (why'd he let it start in the first place?), but God is not listening at those times. Finally after many years of this abuse, her mother catches them together, and instead of kicking him out, sends her daughter to a school out of town, with the stepfather driving her an hour each way every day. The Lutheran minister they go to tells mother to keep the family together, and they don't need to involve the authorities because her stepfather says he's sorry (sorry that he got caught). Says it's just something about Tina that makes him do it.  Make sense? The mother works at Kmart and likes to have kids she doesn't care about, and the dad works "in an office".   The rest of her growing up is fairly normal. She has a boyfriend and he kisses someone else. Ouch. She goes off the college, and finds out her high school boyfriend is seeing her best friend. Tina doesn't seem too upset by this, she's busy with college and new friends anyway. Then he comes to visit her, tells her he got the other girl pregnant, but he really loves her. She quickly moves in with him. The other girl's pregnancy or resulting child is so unimportant that it is NEVER mentioned again. In due time, Tina gets pregnant by him and has an abortion. She says she regrets it. Gets pregnant by him again, has another abortion. Regrets this one too. However, she never talks about what her life would be like if she DID have these two kids by this loser. Nope, it just was wrong and she wishes she'd never done it, but never takes responsibility that is was her decision based on the circumstances she was in at the time. Having an abortion is just SO wrong, that you don't have to think about the consequences of actually having the baby. She seems to put the "blame" for her two abortions on society.  Talks her unmarried sister into keeping her unplanned pregnancy.   Breaks up with the impregnating loser, meets a "normal" guy. He wants to marry her, they plan big wedding with white dress and bridesmaids. She thinks she doesn't really love him, calls mother to discuss (why bother?). Mom tells her she better get married to this great guy. Tina decides she ought to do it in a few days before she changes her mind. Buys BLACK dress to get married in. Has small wedding. Has finished college, and EVERY job she wants, she GETS. Whines about working and traveling, so tired. Persuades husband to go back to college and get degree in engineering.   Husband is so smart that he figures finances and tells her they can afford a house. Has baby girl, his parents buy a crib she doesn't like (of all the nerve!). His mother tries to take over (helping too much)and Tina gets frustrated but won't tell her off. How much can a person be expected to take? Husband tells her she doesn't have to work anymore. They buy bigger newer house. Tina whines about packing and moving, so much work.   Gets pregnant with second baby (never notices when she's pregnant, always thinks she has a stomach virus). Getting depressed and tired with being pregnant and cleaning house, starts sitting in hot tub every night. Guess doctor didn't tell her this is bad for baby as it raises baby's temperature too much (already hot inside mother's body). Slips and falls on icy deck (not good idea to be walking on while pregnant), hurts back, whines some more.  Has second baby, too depressed and physically in pain to take care of self or both children. Medication not helping. Asks mom for help, she refuses, has to "watch stocks on TV for boyfriend" (has left husband finally). Guess husband's family doesn't want to help now? Church people help some, not enough for her. Husband begs her mom to help. She does. Twice. Apparently husband cannot figure out that he should put both kids in daycare while he works, pick them up after work, then  take care of them himself when they go home (just like a single mom does!) Never enters his head.   While Tina is at mom's house (not too depressed to  drive or go to mom's house), mom tells her to "snap out of it". This makes Tina snap for real, she jumps in car, drives to bridge, tries to jump off.  Cop grabs her (pictures are terrible, can't see what happened. Picture of car on bridge, wow).     Finally starts going to therapist, but her "faith" (now) helps more. Discovers "uplifting" Christian CD's. Faces fact that she and mom will never have mother/daughter relationship the way she wants it. Says mom saw her as rival for husband instead of daughter she should have protected. That's true.  This book is short (I read it at the bookstore), and its main focus is if you get Christ in your life, your depression will be lifted. But that makes no sense as she was praying and going to church all her life. Tina was searching, yes, but expecting to find the answer to her problems with God. This did not help before, and she seems to have tried to adjust things in her mind to make it that way after the bridge incident. The whole time she needed to look INSIDE herself. Yes, the abuse never should have happened, her mother was a terrible person, and all this affected her self-esteem. But she won't deal with it, won't get angry at mom or stepdad. Apparently she never sees any self-help books or anything like that, and relies solely on church and her "beliefs" to get her emotions in check (and this appears to be a very ineffective solution). By the way, Tina mentions that she cannot get physically helped by Reiki because it conflicts too much with the beliefs she's had all her life. The beliefs she's had ever since she was a child molested by her stepfather. Tina's not much of a one for upgrading her beliefs, which leads her to feeling stuck in certain situations.   Tina had a lot of things to be grateful for: nice husband and provider, didn't have to work, nice house, healthy kids, nice in-laws, college education, but she is not appreciative. Tina's almost constant whining about things that would seem very small to anyone else, negated any effect this book could have had on me as portraying a mother depressed enough to jump off a bridge. She just seemed spoiled to me.   For such a deep subject, this book lacked substance and seemed to tiptoe  around the issues. There is no calling a spade a spade - the whole thing is superficially written. Anyone who's had to deal with real problems, especially while depressed, will not "get" this book 
 Here is the first few lines of the chapter beginning on page 162:  Play is tactile...       Play is revealing... Play is active...        Play is cultural... Play is experimental...  Play is knowledge... Play is imaginative...   Play is curious...  In fact the entire chapter is 2 pages long consisting only of stuff like this.  The rest of the book is slightly better.  If you like this kind of stuff then buy it.  If you prefer something interesting to read and useful, I would recommend spending about the same amount of money on The Power of Simplicity 
 I usually like this genre, but I am giving up on this book after 40 pages. I thought it would be similar to The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls, but it's not nearly as engaging. It was as if I kept waiting for the story to get started. I even flipped ahead from time to time to see if it got better. It didn't appear to.  I also got tired of the bad language 
 I bought this book because I thought I was going to gain insights about organic gardening.  I was sorely disappointed.  The beginning chapters drone on and on about a move to a new home site...I grew tired of hearing detailed descriptions of the doomed home.  Also, while the author went on about eating locally to lessen the impact on the environment from long distance travel, I was disturbed to hear about the home she bought being leveled and taken to a landfill and to hear about her endless trips back and forth between her old home and new one.  Finally, I was disturbed by her chapter dealing with animal drownings and killings and disagree with her statement that "if we don't kill animals, we will starve".  I'm sorry I spent the money on this book 
 "Tribulation Force" picks up where "Left Behind" ended, and like that book, this one's slow. After the first one, I thought maybe things would start to happen in this one, but they don't. There are a few plot elements that are connected with endless filler. And none of the things that do happen in are completely devoid of suspense. There's one major event that we're told after the fact via a TV newscast. You might think that a book about the end of days would be interesting, but these authors obviously don't know how to write a thriller. It's just endless soap opera. This book and "Left Behind" should have been one volume. If all the books are the same pace, the whole series should have been a trilogy, but of course, then they would make less money.   Don't waste your time on it and don't encourage these talentless hacks by buying their books 
 Very disturbing book--on several counts. The flash backs in her other books orovided insight into the characters--how Beatrix had almost reached the point of no return, how Ian became a vampire, and why the poor guy needed counseling. All the flashbacks in this book provided was the fact that Stephan is a "bottom" without enough preservation to have a stopping point. I liked Ann, and I liked Stephan--in spite of the fact that he's an idiot. I wish Squires had spent more time on why someone who has lived for over 2000 years is too self-destructive to realize the so-called good guys are doing a head game on him.  Ann figured it out and she's been in an isolated area for 25 years. I also wanted more on Stephan's past--she dropped just enough hints to be annoying. On the whole, I thought two potentially good characters were wasted on nasty, destructive rape scenes 
 One does not have to "preserve... an idylic view of Russia" to recognize serious flaws in Politkovskaya's "journalism."  And those flaws go far beyond her disjointed, gimmicky writing style and unprofessional (frequently criticized as "screechy and imperious") prose.  While presenting factual problems which beset today's Russia, the book's title is deliberately misleading.  Politkovskaya cynically manipulates her readers into believing all Russia's problems were created by current president Vladimir V. Putin.  In fact, Putin inherited them from previous regimes:   The appalling conditions within the military were already entrenched in the 80's, during the Afghanistan War.  And control over business by organized crime, mafiya, and oligarchy soared in the early 90's.  Corruption of government bureaucracy, which defined the Yeltsin era, plunged the economy into depression, and beggared the Russian public.  Worse, Yeltsin's excesses soured the national consensus on "Western style Democracy," which came to be distrusted as "capitalist anarchy," enriching  the President's notorious "Family" and a handful of obscenely wealthy cronies.  Even the Chechen conflict, about which Politkovskaya has written extensively, began before Putin's time and had devolved into terrorism and jihad several years before September 11, 2001.      To be sure, these are all issues which Putin's administration has tackled, with varying degrees of capability or success.  These are important topics of better books, most notably one sharing the same title, by Liliya Shevtsova.  The latter is a Fellow of the respected, liberal Carnegie Endowment, and can hardly be accused of being a Putin apologist.  But Politkovskaya has political and personal axes to grind -- and it shows in her writing.  This is, after all, the diva of the leftist press who aspires to being the "Russian Michael Moore."  Her unflattering articles comparing Putin with George W. Bush (see for example: "Kovboy frendi" -- "Cowboy Buddies") have appeared in Novaya gazeta and leftist French publications.  The Russian liberal press likes to label Putin "the Russian Bush."  Politkovskaya might think she is being "cute" and original by constantly comparing Putin to Gogol's pathetic little clerk Akaki Akakievich.  (It is true that Yeltsin appointed Putin precisely because he was a comparative unknown -- a minor operative of the KGB and later assistant to the Mayor of St. Petersburg.)  But in belittling Putin in this manner, Politkovskaya is simply, unwittingly, aiding his vilifiers from the ultraNationalist Right and neoNationalist Left, who accuse him of being a "Western lapdog" and ridicule him as GWB's diminutive, orbiting "sputnik."  As the Carnegie Endowment's liberal Anatol Lieven warns: Westerners may dislike Putin, but they will probably miss him when he's gone -- particularly if the centrist party is replaced by nationalists or communists.  (Or nationalist-communists!)  And it is precisely these anti-Western, isolationalist racists and xenophobes -- not the so-called liberal "democrats" -- who comprise Putin's strongest opposition.        Of course, Politkovskaya endorses those misnamed "Democrats," who proclaim themselves such without the slightest sense of irony, while actually representing fewer than ten percent of the Russian population.  Fairly or not, these bickering minority parties are associated in the public's memory with Boris Nikolayevich (Yeltsin), the lawless '90's, and the criminal Oligarchs.  That Politkovskaya writes so glowingly of the Yeltsin era and so sympathetically about Khodorkovsky reveals quite a lot about her credibility with ordinary Russian people.  Shortly before Yeltsin's resignation, polls indicated his popularity had tanked to single digits, as low as 2 percent.  And currently, only 4 percent of Russians believe Khodorkovsky innocent; about 8 percent feel his sentence is "vindictive" or "too harsh."  (To put this in its proper perspective: many, many more Americans sympathise with "O.J." or "Jacko" and believe in their innocence, than do Russians for Khodorkovsky.) The vast majority of Russian people, some 75 percent, have a favorable opinion of their current President.  Certainly, some of his policies have their detractors, but most Russians credit Putin for their vastly improved lives.  Until recently, for example, there had never been a Russian economic "middle-class."  So Politkovskaya's criticisms are not well received at home.  Moreover, her oft-published sympathy for the Chechen Islamist cause, and her association with rebel jihad leaders, has earned her deserved reputation as a "Russian Hanoi Jane."   Famous as Russia's leading radical journalist, Politkovskaya's passion is undeniable. Therefore, a certain amount of personal and political baggage could be expected from her latest book; but it will doubtless find an audience among liberal and neo-con russophobes in the U.S. Government and NGOs.  (Dick Cheney probably loves this book.)  But hysterical claims that Putin is returning Russia to a Soviet-style dictatorship are regularly dismissed by Sovietologists in the U.S. State Department and elsewhere.  True journalism comes down to trustworthiness, and that is where Politkovskaya fails.  As with "Farenheit 9/11," which she has praised as an "excellent" model, "Putin's Russia" is a perplexing mixture of real fact and obvious political agenda.  Therefore, this book rates only two stars.            
 As for many of these kind of unknown groups, the music in the album is useless. In the meaning that this music has no use. It is not relaxing. It is not for contemplation. It is not spiritual. It is nothing but electronic esperiments that many vendors try to deliver under the name of "ambient". But ambient music is music. THis is crap. Well differently from TWO A.D. where probably the producers realized that crap is crap and no more crap was good to be sold, because people isn't stupid. TWO A.D. is light years away from this crap. Don't waste your money. Listen the the samples by yourself to grab what I mean. Sergi 
 who is this girl? this is not the same tomboy/dorky Gwen i know in a band called No Doubt. her image has totally changed and i dont like it. she cares too much of what people think of her now. with no doubt all their songs were deep in meaning and actually meant something! this **** is bananas. i could have wrote that!! no offense to gwen or anything, i luv her 2 death and im the hugest fan of no doubt but i cant accept her new pop sound. it just blends in with all the other artists 
 I've spent a year in England and have made >30 visits all together.  Here are my reviews of the best guides....to meet you r exact needs.....I hope these are helpful and that you have a great visit!  I always gauge the quality of my visit by how much I remember a year later......this review is designed to help you get the guide that will be sure YOU remember your trip many years into the future.  Travel Safe and enjoy yourself to the max!  Rick Steves' books are not recommended.  They may be an interesting read but their helpfulness is very poor.  They don't do well on updates, transportation details, or anything but the first-time-tourist routine and even that is somewhat superficial on anything but the mega-major sites.  Fodor's Fodor's is the best selling guide among Americans.  They have a bewildering array of different guides.  Here's which is what: The Gold Guide is the main book with good reviews of everything and lots of tours, walks, and just about everything else you could think of.  It's not called the Gold guide for nothing though....it assumes you have money and are willing to spend it. SeeIt! is a concise guide that extracts the most popular items from the Gold Guide PocketGuide is designed for a quick first visit UpCLOSE for independent travel that is cheap and well thought out CityPack is a plastic pocket map with some guide information Exploring is for cultural interests, lots of photos and designed to supplement the Gold guide  MapGuide MapGuide is very easy to use and has the best location information for pubs, hotels, tourist attractions, museums, churches etc. that they manage to keep fairly up to date.  It's great for teaching you how to use the underground and the double decker buses.  The text sections are quick overviews, not reviews, but the strong suite here is brevity, not depth.  I strongly recommend this for your first few times learning your way around the classic tourist sites and experiences.  MapGuide is excellent as long as you are staying pretty much in the city centre.  When you get to be an old London hand, remember that the classic Londoners guide will always be an A to Z (zed) map and guide.  If you want to go a bit beyond the central core of the city (perhaps to Windsor, Hampton, or further away) you really need the proper AtoZ to be able to find exact routes and streets.  Time Out The Time Out guides are very good.  Easy reading, short reviews of restaurants, hotels, and other sites, with good public transport maps that go beyond the city centre.  Many people who buy more than one guidebook end up liking this one best!  Blue Guides Without doubt, the best of the walks guides.... the Blue Guide has been around since 1918 and has extremely well designed walks with lots of unique little side stops to hit on just about any interest you have.  If you want to pick up the feel of the city, this is the best book to do that for you.  This is one that you end up packing on your 10th trip, by which time it is well worn.  Michelin Famous for their quality reviews, the Red Michelin Guides are for hotels & Restaurants, the Green Michelin Guides are for main tourist destinations.  However, the English language Green guide is the one most people use and it has now been supplemented with hotel and restaurant information.  These are the serious review guides as the famous Michelin ratings are issued via these books.	  Let's Go Let's Go is a great guide series that specializes in the niche interest details that turn a trip into a great and memorable experience.  Started by and for college students, these guides are famous for the details provided by people who used the book the previous year.  They continue to focus on providing a great experience inexpensively.  If you want to know about the top restaurants, this is not for you (use Fodor's or Michelin).  Let's Go does have a bewildering array of different guides though.  Here's which is what: Budget Guide is the main guide with incredibly detailed information and reviews on everything you can think of. City Guide is just as intense but restricted to the single city. PocketGuide is even smaller and features condensed information MapGuide's are very good maps with public transportation and some other information (like museum hours, etc.)  Lonely Planet Lonely Planet has City and Out To Eat Guides.  They are all about the experience so they focus on doing, being, getting there, and this means they have the best detailed information, including both inexpensive and really spectacular restaurants and hotels, out-of-the-way places, weird things to see and do, the list is endless.  Frommer's These are time tested guides that pride themselves on being updated annually.  Although I think the guides below provide information that is in more depth or more concise (depending on what the guide is known for), if your main concern is that the guide has very little old or outdated information, then this would be a good guide for you.   
 I've read all of Flynn's books. In fact, I just picked up Act of Treason. As I'm reading it, I'm reminded of how disgusted I was with his last book, Consent to Kill, only giving him the benefit of the doubt on this one.  Without giving away the ending, Consent to Kill is but an amateur attempt to keep a tired saga alive for the sake of a bestselling serial--that being the Mitch Rapp saga. To any real fiction writer, what Flynn resorts to in the book, in terms of Mitch's personal relationship, is quite sad; it's simply designed to keep Mitch "hungry" and "emotionally tattered" so as to allow Flynn to continue cashing in on the only story he's capable of writing.  The book started out to be intriguing, although I did ask myself how Flynn intended to keep Mitch going with the seeming direction our star spy was headed via the last novel. But, the story read like a tenth grader wrote it, a tired cliche designed for the sole sake of keeping Mitch Rapp and his million-dollar franchise chugging along.  By far the worst story Flynn has written to date. Skip this one 
 The daughter of a prominent Boston doctor is dead, apparently from a botched abortion (which was illegal in the late 60's).  Dr. John Berry's friend, Art Lee, is in jail for the crime, which he says he didn't commit.  So, Dr. Berry sets out to prove his friend's innocence, and runs into cover-ups and lots of secrets.  But there are many doubts, such as was the girl really pregnant, and did Dr. Lee actually perform the surgery, and why is Dr. Berry so interested in finding the culprit?  For Michael Crichton's first novel, it's not bad, but nowhere near as good as some later ones.  The plot is marginally interesting, but it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog didn't sound very natural.  Dr. Berry (who just takes the whole work week off to investigate) talks more like a cheesy "private eye" than a doctor.  Also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to explain various medical terms and concepts - nice to know but annoying to look up 
 The authors state in the preface to their book that their goal is to provide "a thorough approach to semi-Markov processes and their applications in reliability". This is an ambitious objective for a 222 page text, since a large body of research on Semi-Markov processes has developed over the course of the last forty years or so.  In the opinion of this reviewer, Limnios & Oprisan never even come close to their grand objective. Their book is simply too short, too terse and too condensed to give a thorough treatment. The authors realized early on that they would need to reference the vast body of literature. It is strange to this reviewer that their treatment, copyright 2001, chooses as its main references out-of-print French texts by Neveu (1964) and Janssen (1969). The authors' choice of difficult-to-find auxiliary references makes their treatment that much less accessible.  The prerequisite list here is extensive. The authors claim that all that is required is an understanding of Markov Chains, like you might find in Stroock's "Introduction to Markov Processes" or Norris' "Markov Chains". Furthermore, the authors claim to cover the following list of topics in the first 29 pages of their book (which comprises Chapter 1): measure theory, Laplace transforms and continuous-time Markov processes. In reality, Limnios & Oprisan introduce (barely) these and other topics including: stopping times, the Optional Stopping Theorem, stationary stochastic processes, martingale theory, Ergodic theory, strong Markov Processes and renewal processes.    In order to get through the first chapter of Limnios & Oprisan, you'll need an excellent background in these topics. I recommend Rogers & Williams 800 page, two-volume set "Diffusions, Markov Processes and Martingales", 2nd edition.  Chapter 2 runs a mere 18 pages and purports to cover "Markov Renewal Processes". I stopped counting how many times the authors give references to out-of-print books in this chapter. I also lost count of the number of times the authors use the phrases "it is straightforward", "it is easy to show", or "it is well-known", in the context of mathematical problems having none of the above properties.  This book is useful to the reader in one sense: it whets the appetite for an understanding of Semi-Markov Processes and Reliability Theory and puts this reviewer in the market for a well-written book on the topic.       
 I find this book personally insulting and full of revisionist conclusions. As a Romani who lost Grandmother and many Aunts and Uncles in the Porrajmos (the devouring in Romany)I am outraged that once again we, the victims of this insanity are blamed for the crimes committed against us. That ANY victims of the Holocaust are essentially blamed for their own demise is cruel and unjustified. I also contest, and detest, Mr. Lewy's conclustion that the Roma people were not racially marked for extermination: this is both absurd and untrue as withnessed by the nazi's own words, we were "lives unworthy of life, we were criminals due to our genetics, Germany must be cleansed of the Gypsy plague" etc. An inaccurate book full of racial sterotypes, the gist of which was used by the nazi's as justification for the extermination of the Roma in the first place and is still being used to justify the persecution of Roma today. Horrid book 
 This book is great if you want to know how to raise goats in Europe, please don't get me wrong, I am from Germany and I have nothing against how things are done there, but the way the book discribes the keeping of goats is not the way it is done in the U.S. There is a big different in how goats are raised for meat versus how people raise them for show/milk or even just a for pets with or without horns. No real serious breeder of a Dairy goat in the U.S. would keep horns on a goat or even let the kids nurse. On the other hand most Meat goat breeder will not dehorn their goat and are upset if they have a goat they have to bottlefeed. There are many different ways to keep goats in the U.S. and they are not adequately discribed in this book.  Even thought there is a part where they discribe the "Goats of the world" the breeds discribed in the "Buying Goats" do not represent the popular goat breeds available in the U.S. For example for the choice of milking goat, they only give a choice of white Saanen and colored Saanen and no other breed is recomended. Yes, one really popular goat breed for milk in the U.S. is the white Saanen goat and in the U.S., the white ones are just called Saanen and the colored Saanen are called Sable, and Sable goats are not that easy to come by in the U.S. The most popular goat breed known for its really good tasting milk, the Anglo Nubian goat (usually just called Nubian goat), is not mentioned in this part of the book. Also in the U.S. the climate can be from tropical to very cold and some goats are better suited for colder or warmer climate and this is also not covered in the "Buying Goats" chapter, since the climate in Germany where this book is written doesn't differ in termperature like it does in the U.S.  In Germany not many different types of medication are available over the counter and there you have to go to the vet to get most medications, and here in the U.S. you can get a lot of things you would need to treat the most common illnesses right in your local feed store.  The same with dehorning and castratin goats, the animal protection laws are a lot stricter in Europe and dehorning and castrating of goats is usually not done by the farmer in Germany, but taken to a veterinarian. Here in the U.S., of course you can take your goat to the vet for this, but most breeders will do it themselves.  There is a lot of good information in this book, that is the same in all countries like how goats will rather eat weeds/trees instead of grass or how they digest their food. But many other things, are just not the same in the U.S.  I could go on and on how things normally done in the U.S. are not discribed, but I would have to write my own book to cover all of it. The bottom line is, I do not think that this is the right book to get for a novice that doesn't know what is available in the feed stores or wants to know about what goat to get if they live in the U.S. But I do think it is a good book to get if you already have goats and would like to know how other countries take care of goats or like to read some information that you look at with a open mind and pick what might work for you.  
 writer talk about too much basic knowledges which are used for 3d game programming , but most of them like knowledge of math and windows programming we can find in other books even in the course we studied long long ago. wish writer take the 3d as the point and talk more about the newest technolegies arised this years 
 I bought this drive in late 2003, and it's gone through a moderate amount of use in a home environment since then. The positives first - though it has an 8MB buffer it is very fast, and can even stand its ground against some newer disks with larger buffers.   It does make quite a bit of noise and heats up a bit more compared to my older 40gig and 20gig WD's, and the newer seagates.   2.5 years after purchase, the drive started corrupting files like crazy. WD has tools on their site to check your disk status, and sure enough it was due for an RMA. When I checked the warranty status online, 6 months had mysteriously 'vanished' from my warranty period. The drive warranty had started 6 months before I'd purchased it! Anyway, it was still valid and they sent me a replacement very quick.  Still, this is my second WD drive to die, and I'm going with other brands from now. 
 I was hoping there would be some new info in this book, but there was none. ZIP!!! I still find it interesting that after running a stop sign and killing an innocent driver, that she still has NO comments. None of her friends think it was "a big deal" - that they all just "moved on."  Moved where? In the State of Washington she would be charged with vehicular homicide. It's a serious charge here. I can't help but wonder had it been Hilary Clinton, what the thoughts would be. Lots of reference to her "sorority sisters" - which was annoying. But in a way it helped me to understand exactly where she came from and why she is the way she is today. Don't buy this book 
 This isn't music. I never thought i'd see the day when the festival's headliner was a bloke standing behind a record deck. No instruments, no talent. Fatboy Slim and his irke have done more to kill live music than MTV. It isn't as if he writes his stuff. He 'samples' it, which means he takes about thirty seconds of a song and messes about with it via a drum beat. No wonder Jon Hiseman of Colloseum was supposedly so angry that a 'sample' was taken from the band's 'elegy'. A song is one complete piece not to be messed about with and ruined. This has no value whatsoever!Call me old fashioned but i believe that anyone who makes music must have at least some semblance of ability and not rely on other people to make your music (and fortune) I know this appeals to people who want to take stimulants in order to dance all night long, but in the cold light of day? Mr. Cook or Fatboy or whatever dumb name he masquerades after wouldn't know a chord if it bit him. This is a 'best of' (sic) i dread to think what is the worse 
 When Mr. Burnside first got this book published back in 1999, it was probably the best book on the subject, and helpful to consumers. The truth is, though, it is embarrassing by almost any standard today. The editing is non-existent, and that just shows the lack of thought that went into this. It was thrown together, and omits more than it conveys. There are far better choices now; most notably Wes Johnson's "The Manufactured Home Buyer's Handbook" that just came out. The latter is an outstanding book, well-researched, far more thorough, and much easier to read. It will also save you more money than any other book on the subject that I've read. If you're thinking about buying a manufactured home, do yourself a favor and buy "The Manufactured Home Buyer's Handbook" instead. You'll be glad you did before the ink on the contract dries 
 This is not one of Fred's better efforts,  the dancing is so so and Rita Hayworth is among his poorest dance partners.  Lacks the glamor and sex appeal of the Astaire/Rogers films.  In spite of these shortcomings the film is worth watching 
 Don't purchase this if you're expecting to get a 1500 mAh  Power2000 ACD-674 battery.  They sent a 1300 mAh Digicom battery instead 
 I purchased this unit from BB&B and brought it home.  I unpacked the unit, filled it with water and allowed the filter to soak.  Got everything all set and turned the unit on....NOTHING....no light...thought that maybe the outlet was bad and tried another one....nothing as well.  Back to BB&B for a replacement.  Brought the replacement home and noticed that the little stopper for letting water past the filter was broken off so the water would just flow out when the tank was held with the handle...figured no big deal, i'll just be quick getting it onto the base on starting it up.  Plugged it in and turned the unit on....NOTHING....no light AGAIN.    Like other posters, i wanted to hurl this thing into the street and drive over it with my car!!!  I am going to be returning this to BB&B and staying away from this company.  I guess i was being naive thinking that the more expensive unit is going to be the better built one....hahah 
 I had been using philips adapter that i got from Walmart and was quite satisfied with it until the wire broke when it got entangled. I bought this one just because it was MAXELL and i had to make 25$ in order to qualify for free shipping. But the moment i inserted it in my stereo i realized my mistake. It sounded terrible. The very same day i went to walmart and picked up philips adapter once again. You can try others as well but dont even think about this one... 
 First I want to state all the good things about this book - because they are certainly the principles of this book.  Dr. Andrew Weil's Eating Well for Optimum Health holds a wealth of information. Starting with the chemistry of how your body handles food and then explaining how that affects the goods and bads of what's out there is the basis in which Weil promotes his theories. In a world where foods become vilified and championed alike through various 'studies'... it can be intimidating to know what you should include in an 'optimum diet'. Weil clears a lot of this up and is pretty specific about what vitamins, minerals, whole foods and nutrients we should be nourishing our body with. All in all this is a great book on the science of food.  Now, for the bad part. I actually finished this book over a weekend, sick in bed, about a month ago. I was 'sick of being sick' as some would say and devoured (pardon the pun) this wealth of knowledge. After I was well enough to get back to my routine, I threw away almost every single food item in my kitchen, as almost nothing adhered to the optimum plan. I was still very motivated with my bare cupboards and then set out to turn my family's life around.   Dr. Weil makes it pretty clear that you are going to pretty much have to go exclusively organic, bar a few, and I mean few, fruits and vegetables. He even states that some non-organic fruits and vegetables are so toxic in their non-organic state you should never consume them - strawberries for example. Something Weil will also state is the pesca-ovo-vegetarianism diet is his diet of choice, because almost all meats are riddled with hormones that greatly impact our own bodies. The optimum food pyramid doesn't really include animal proteins, so if you aren't a vegetarian, you'll have some serious issues to resolve.  He tells you he loves food, and feels anyone who misses the point and stops enjoying food is wasting their time. I totally agree, but in practice, this book does just about that. Demonizing foods based on the fears of cancer and inflammatory disease can be a difficult pill to swallow, particularly if you've consumed these foods all of your life. The nature of label reading and being a smart consumer can literally drive you insane. It's certainly beneficial, we know that, but making it a lifestyle will require more then just a bit of education.  This book also is not for anyone seeking weight-loss through diet modification. Weil explains it certainly can be done, but he spends more time telling you what diets, such as Atkins, not to partake in. This fact is actually not a negative side to the book. However given the nations statistics on obesity I think this could have been a more helpful aspect of the book if he developed it.  I will end with this: This book could/would be an incredible useful tool if you were any or (ideally all) of the following:  1. You are wealthy. Try buying exclusively organic. It's outrageous. Most working families can not afford this lifestyle, contrary to the notion that prepared and processed foods are expensive. Prepared and process foods are cheap - that's why Americans consume them at such high rates. He suggest to organic co-op farms, but even as late as 2006 they can be scarce for most people in the suburbs, and when you do find them, they will only be cheaper then buying organic from natural food stores and chains, which isn't saying much. Don't be shocked when you find vine-ripened organic tomatoes at $5.99 a pound.  2. You do not work. Almost exclusively cooking from scratch, which is even acknowledged by Weil, will be the hardest transition for anyone who works full-time or has a family. This is probably the saddest aspect of this book. There certainly is nothing wrong with from cooking wholesome, healthy meals from scratch - but it isn't the norm for most people. If you buy the foods recommended, you'll be spending about 70% of your day in the kitchen if preparing 3 meals.   3. You already lead a healthful and active lifestyle. If this is you then you probably already knew much of Weil's intuitive advice and therefore will need only tweaking to adhere to the optimum plan.  My personal experience with this book is that you can back yourself into a corner with fear. If you work and have a family I suggest you skip this book. Working in your 5+ a day fruits and vegetables, organic or not, and leading an active lifestyle is a good place to start. The Eating For Optimum Health book creates a pretty black and white picture. And we all know life isn't black and white.

 Oh my gosh! I could not wait for this book to come out and when it did, I bought the hard cover - waste of money.  The other "evil" books were great, so why wasn't this one.  It was one of the worst books I have ever read, and am a reader addict.  I bought all the "evil", "shadows" and even some of her earlier works, but this, WOW, don't quite know how to describe how disappointing this book was.  Also it's a good thing I like Kay Hooper other works or I wouldn't buy another of her books 
 after few months it just stopped working.  also, it is not rechargable, and need to replace batery every 1-2 week 
 trully, i am from a very small town with minimal educational oppourtunities. I made my way into a very well respected graduate school without the help of a book like this.  It is understood that applying for school is stressful, but so is applying for a job or a passport. The title is very accurate.  If you took the time to study in highschool, took the time to research and think, you will do well on your exams as well as on your applications.  While a BA/BS from Harvard may look great on the wall when compared to a "public school" remember, while the BA/BS degree is important in the real world no one really cares where it came from.  I outrank a graduate from one of these ivy league schools and i graduated from a state school.  Work hard no matter where you go to your undergraduate, then apply to an ivy leagus school as a graduate student.  That is when the name matters.  Spending 45K a year on a BA/BS degree is foolish when you can spend 6K a year to go to any state school.  I have been there, i know. Freshman English lit at an ivy leagus school is the same english lit at state schools and community college.  So stop stressing, stop wasting money on books that can not get you into any school if you did not work hard in highschool, and start focusing on becomming educated.  That is the point of an education after all. This is supposed to be the best times of your life.  Dont have it ruined by being ripped off and stressed out all day long. P.S. if for some reason highschool did not agre with you start at a sommunity college.  Get real college experience and then go off to a 4 year school.  It is not and never will be hopeless if you trully want an education you can get one 
 Be aware that "journal" means lots of blank pages.  Not much of a bargain for all that space.  Could just as well have been a pamphlet 
 A sorry excuse for an album. This is not 'different' & wonderful; this is simply annoying noise. 
 There is some great advice for the novice agent in this book. But I think the author/agent speaks from two sides of her mouth.  She promotes good ethics and attention to detail in terms of contracts and client-care.  BUT, her own business is based on facilitating For Sale By Owners and an a la carte approach to representation.  Both of these approaches to Agency undercut our business and our income.  We spend a lot of money in this business, and are at great risk of frivilous lawsuits, burn out, and even our personal safety. Undercutting the traditional 6% (or even 5%) commission by offering limited services for a reduced rate undermines our whole industry.  Any author/agent who supports cut rate real estate services should be read with skepticism 
 Burchett is both a humorous and touching writer, but unfortunately, the point he is trying to make is obscured by his pervasive opinions. The author unfortunately assumes that you share his worldview, which many people may not.  Even if he is aware that the readers may not agree with him, he is convinced that they should, which undermine the argument he is trying to make. This book is supposedly targeting "everyone who has ever been hurt by a Christian-as well as...believers."  This absolutely was not the case.  This book is targeted to conservative Christian churchgoers.  He does not attempt to be open-minded, often times using examples to make his points that are contradictory to his reconciliation argument.  At some point in the book, he manages to express his opposition to homosexuality, abortion, drugs, alcohol, gossip, contemporary culture, divorce, pre-marital sex, swearing, petty arguments, road rage, and a whole lot more.  Although his opinion that all these things are sins may be valid, these views do not necessarily belong in a book that is meant to teach people how to reunite non-believers and recovering Christians with the church.  He also inserts politics into the book, with one particularly one-sided chapter with examples from the Bush/Gore election.  It might be just me, but I think it is possible to be a Christian and to have voted for Gore... This book is disappointing, because it seems that Burchett realizes there are problems with the church, and has some very good points, but they are hard to swallow when delivered with his personal opinions.  Although the idea behind this book is stellar, it does not deliver! 
 No, it's certainly not as good as the first one, but I did enjoy some of DEMONS 2. The beginning is cool enough, with the demon's resurrection and it's gaining access into Sally's apartment via the TV set. The tension and dread seem to build quite nicely. That is, right up to the scene where the kid-demon's chest pops open to reveal an idiotic, rubber demon puppet! Ugg! It reminded me of those stupid monsters in GHOULIES, HOBGOBLIN, or some other wretched '80s mess! The apartment building setting was interesting, but seemed to be mostly wasted on the few, precious bursts of action we actually get. I did like the weightlifter folks in the gym. They were hilarious and at least they put up a fight against the infernal invaders! The battle in the parking garage was ok too. Maybe I just expected D2 to be a bit more frightening and disturbing...           
 After a long wait for this book I was disappointed to find it not the authors normally great work.  The writing style was choppy and hard to follow.  The was plot weak and the content not very interesting 
 The problem with this book is that it doesn't adress important issues facing our legal system today. If for example Ford motor company manufactures a SUV with a faultly shock system that fails and causes the truck to roll over resulting in serious injury or death, clearly we have an open and shut case where Ford is completely liable and you can certainly bet that Ford is going to make sure that problem never happens again. But that's obvious. Anyone who knows little to nothing about the law understands full well that a company who is found to have a faulty product will increase their standards and work feverishly to fix the product in order to prevent future legal action. Carl T. Bogus has taken simple ideas like those and twisted them around to create a driving force for his political agenda, and baseless political agenda no less.   "And although the public was largely unaware of it, George W. Bush's 'tort reform'-which seeks to constrict the ability of individuals to sue corporations-was a major factor in his raising unprecedented sums for his presidential candidacy." The public? Carl you're a law professor at an over priced, second rate university in the middle of Rhode Island. How does that give you a divine right to claim that you know more than the average person about the Bush administration and allow you to make an accusation like that based on no fact at all? Where are the fact checkers at NYU press anyways?    To the contrary when George W. Bush is speaking in terms of tort reform he is referring to torts that actually need reform. Let's look at Johnny Edwards (former vice presidential running mate to John Kerry) who specializes in malpractice suits specifically involving children born with cerebral palsy. He claims that if doctors had immediately performed Caesarean sections then the babies would have been spared the affliction. The results of such lawsuits have yielded 4 times as many C-sections performed since 1970, yet the number of children born with cerebral palsy has remained constant. In fact cerebral palsy is linked to fetal brain injury long before labor begins. Edwards has avoided cases where the children died at birth because typically juries only award roughly $500,000 in those situations. In 1985 Edwards was on a case dealing with a girl named Jennifer Campbell, a 5 year old with cerebral palsy, which ended up being an award of 6.5 million dollars for the plaintiffs. This is what president Bush means by "tort reform". In simple terms someone who spills a cup of hot coffee on themselves while pulling away from a drive through window should NOT be awarded any type of damage. Cases like these undermine the goals of the framers of the Constitution of the United States of America and place individuals freedoms in jeopardy. We have seesaws vanishing from playgrounds, emergency-room staff blocked from attending to patients off hospital grounds even if they can see them bleeding to death just 30 feet away, "Caution HOT" warning labels on cups of coffee that a Chimpanzee could identify as "hot" without referring to a warning label, removing of harmless 10 Commandment Icons from parks and courthouses, and Godless Pledges of Allegiances. This is the America we live in. As a professor of Law Mr. Bogus should be required to teach the "LAW"; NOT the principles of the Democratic party. This book is the result of an egotistical, politically driven, liberal professor at a law school that offers a free bowl of soup with every degree. I wish I had more hands so I could give this book four thumbs down 
 I thought this book was going to be a wonderful improvement on an 800 year old ideal, modernizing it to fit a less hostile and disgusting world. I was wrong. If you're against republicans and war, this book will infuriate you like it has done to me. Don't pick it up if your morals are not Christian conservative, do yourself a favor and find another mentor. I'd recommend anything by Gandhi or the Dalai Lama.   I give this book two stars only because the author presents his viewpoint well enough to be useful to those that agree with him. The rest of us were at a loss picking up this book 
 I know there are many different Jewish beliefs and approaches. I am not Jewish. The author makes an honest & straitforward approach. A decent read 
 Great movie but CD not perfoming in the last few scenes.  It gets stuck or restarts itself.  Very frustrating and more frustrating to have to return new CD 
 I bought this CD because I've always seen it near the top of lists of the greatest Reggae albums.  I've given it many listens but I'm afraid I just don't get it.  Every song is basically 3 1/2 minutes long and all start to sound the same.  I didn't like this nearly as much as Marley, Tosh, Toots and the Maytalls, Jimmy Cliff, etc.  Even the dub versions disappointed me, being in the same lengths as the vocal versions.  I guess I like my dub a lot more stretched out and adventurous.  I thought this sounded dated, same-y and boring 
 Munch has long been one of my favorite painters, if not my favorite, since I was seventeen years old.  I love films (Angelopoulos, Tarkovsky, Fellini, Antonioni, Bergman, you name it.). Therefore, it was not a hard decision for me to forgo a particularly beautiful afternoon in the outdoors for being locked up for three hours in the AC atmosphere of a movie theater. What a mistake, and what a disappointment! Where was the editor (sorry, it was Watkins) for this film? I am amazed that director/editor Peter Watkins should so obviously confuse the television medium for cinema. The film is about one hour too long. It is repetitive, grossly uneven in its presentation of the painter's life (half-life, would be a more appropriate term). It seems that Watkins went on and on, repeating himself, and suddenly, looking at his watch, realized he had to rush through the remainder of Munch's life to finish the film.  He rushed and still did not make it past 1909.  Why ignore Munch, the man and his work, after 1909?  But I guess this is the director's prerogative, to show what he wants of Munch's life.  In general, the cinematography is good, with delicate colors.  The representation of the period was well researched and comes across as authentic.  The hand-held camera works well most of the time, with beautiful close-ups.  In some scenes, such as the socio-political discussions in the cafes, its unsteadiness underlines the chaos of the expounded philosophy.  There are even moments of greatness, such as when Munch is painting "Death in the Sickroom."  Unfortunately, more often than not, the camera is shaky for no apparent reason.  But there are far too many cuts, so many it makes one dizzy at times just watching, and they interfere with the narrative thread of the story.  Worse, the contrivance of the cuts is astonishingly predictable -- after a while, I knew that the instant any character's eyes looked directly into the camera, the scene was going to quickly cut to something else.  Geir Westby's performance, whose likeness to Munch is remarkable, is not convincing: one does not get any insight regarding Munch's internal demons, or any real sense of the artist's passion, jealousy, and repression.  The dreadful environment, familial, social and political, seems practically divorced from Munch's life, as the artist appears to stand apart from it all, an outside observer.  His very critical relationship with his father is hardly touched upon, except for a (too often) repeated short scene at the dining table, when Munch was still young.  Munch's complex and ambiguous feelings about women in general, which shaped so much of his work, are not even touched upon, except for his particular relationship with Mrs. Heiberg (Gro Fraas).  Waltkins' decision to present Munch's biography more like a docu-drama could have been rewarding, except for the fact that he was not able to integrate the historical document with the subject matter.  It all boils down to the editing, which is just AWFUL.  Believe me, I say this not because the film is three-hours long (Angelopoulos' and Tarkovsky's films do not exactly produce short subjects), but because when a director has nothing new to say, and keeps repeating himself, it quickly becomes tedious and boring.  Most likely, the original television production was shown in three one-hour installments.  Therefore, many of the numerous flashbacks were justified, not only to somehow refresh the memories of the viewers who might have seen one or two previous episodes in the preceding weeks, but also to "bring aboard" new viewers.  But in the continuum of the film, these same flashbacks become useless, even counter-productive, unnecessarily weighing down the viewer with back-story.  Please note that I did not follow many of my fellow spectators who left the theatre early.  I suffered through to the ending credits. 
 This novel tries to be funny, but the satire falls flat and the whole thing quickly becomes totally tedious. I bailed after 75 pages 
 Perhaps English majors will enjoy this book, but I didn't. The author constantly draws parallels between encryption and totally unrelated literature. Treating foreign languages or the Bible as a type of  cryptography is going too far. If you're a Poe fan, this book is for you,  but if you'd rather learn something about cryptography, find another book 
 I listened to this on CD in my car...driving around western Virginia.   -The author is not a very good reader...her rhythm/intonation is off...but I didn't mind the flubs at all. It's nice to have a reader that sounds like a real person. And by having her read it, the we avoid the distraction of having the technical terms being pronounced incorrectly. (Although I'm not used to hearing "hooves" rhyming with "moves".)  -It's a matter of taste, but talking animals (or babies, for that matter) have no appeal whatsoever for me. Ugh! And if they did talk, no horse that I've ever ridden would have said, "Are you all right?" when I fell off. I believe they'd say, "Aaaaaaaaah...at last. Hey, there's some grass!"  -Being a woman of a certain age, I liked the Sister character, (although I don't believe she still had her figure at 72). But the denouement---and Sister's actions in it---was utterly improbable and illogical. Gimme a break 
 What a load of garbage.  Equating a camera with a gun and the act of photography with a violent crime, is so ridiculous it does not even deserve to be discussed.  She has no idea waht she is talking about 
 My mom was a subscriber to Newsweek for years, and I'd flip through her copies.  Most of the material is friendly towards the powers that be (although, not friendly enough according to the review by the soldier who thinks the editors should be in jail.  So much for "protecting our freedoms").  Anyway, since Newsweek is beholden to Big Business advertisements, it won't do much to rock the boat that our corporate mafia owns. If people are interested in more honest, more critical views of the political and economic system that is causing so much devastation in the world (the neoliberalism of the US empire and other wealthy nations), then I'd recommend Z magazine.  I'll never forget finding my mom on the floor devouring it's articles on a range of issues the corporate media marginalize.  Z also publishes articles and interviews with the most-cited living author on the planet, Noam Chomsky (another figure I'm sure the US soldier thinks should be in jail.  Although, Chomsky recently spoke at West Point.  So, even the military is waking up to the hard truths he brings). 
 Leslie West continues to release gutsy albums. This is no exception. My only gripe, along with the recently released Johnny Winter CD, is why have fade-outs? There is plenty of room on a cd to have powerful endings 
 Its not light as advertised.  Its actually a very cumbersome broom.  I'd rather use a regular broom than this huge thing.  I would not recommend for every day use.  The bristles get bent due to the weight of it, and they don't sweep as well after a month or so 
 If there is a passage that defines this book, it's the one on page 74, where he uses his superior intellect and social conservatism to declare that "...[the human assembler of pre-manufactured parts] is not necessarily a bad man. It merely means that his education in his trade has been bad."   What an amazing nugget of wisdom from a man who browbeats the greater population for our consumption of mass-manufactured objects. No, David, assemblers who aren't emotionally or pridefully connected to the object are just deficient people, worthy of the utmost contempt. Start up a death camp if they bother that bad, Nazi bastard. Labor thanks you for your morsels of understanding and forgiveness.  Don't waste your money. Don't make ugly work 
 This is something that any first year business student could have written. It is a fast read but it provides no new insights 
 I liked this book very much when I started reading it.  The authors' characterizations of sailing were right on the money.  The characters and plot start out interesting but it seems the book was rushed to a sloppy and confusing ending that left me dissatisfied and wanting more.  I kept waiting for somthing to tie things together, but it never happened 
 Todos los tpicos tienen algo de verdad, y aqul que dice que Borges es un escritor pedante para pedantes no es en absoluto una excepcin. Sus historias, a pesar de estar cuajadas en ocasiones de ideas interesantes, se ven total y completamente empaadas por el afn didctico y pomposo del autor a la hora de inundar sus escritos con referencias tanto reales como imaginarias a todo tipo de obras, autores, sucesos, etc, etc. Sus cuentos suelen adoptar ms bien la forma de un ensayo o de una disertacin filosfica que la de un relato convencional. Esto bien podra parecer algo original y audaz a simple vista, pero su ya mencionado didactismo, su escaso ritmo y la casi nula caracterizacin de sus personajes, restan muchsima fuerza a unas historias que, entre tanto aderezo culto y metaliterario, pierden todo aliciente a los ojos de cualquiera que haya disfrutado de narradores ms hbiles y conocedores del medio en el que se mueven.   Todava estoy tratando de dilucidar por qu diablos cosas como "Ficciones" o "El Aleph" estn consideradas como obras maestras cuando su inters no me parece que vaya ms all de lo puramente anecdtico. A todas luces el de Borges es un caso claro de egocentrismo o de vastas influencias literarias mal asimiladas.  Los aduladores borgianos, esa grimosa secta compuesta (generalmente) de elitistas literarios, seguramente dira, leyendo crticas como la ma, que la razn por la que Borges me desagrada es "porque no lo entiendo". Nada de lo que preocuparse, pues es bien sabido que para ellos toda aquella crtica negativa a su escritor de cabecera viene dada desde la frustracin de quien no logra aprehender al "seor del bastn". No falla, probad a poner en duda la grandeza del argentino, y ya veris cmo en pocos instantes os llueve encima un torrente de dicterios por parte de sus incondicionales poniendo en duda toda vuestra cultura general. En fin, que visto lo visto habr que borrar la palabra "pedante" del diccionario, total, como no hay libros malos, sino slo libros que no se entienden por los que los critican...  Jams he llegado a observar mayor grado de sectarismo que el que rodea a este autor por parte de muchos de sus admiradores (ni siquiera por los fans ms agresivos de autores "frikis" como Tolkien o Lovecraft), y en parte es por eso tambin por lo que no me gusta. He llegado a conocer gente que modifica sus gustos y preferencias literarias como borreguines para que casen exactamente con los de Borges. Y es que es tal el grado de arrobamiento comnmente requerido para la "correcta" apreciacin de este escritor, que de verdad a m me enferma. Sin duda a Borges se le puede considerar, independientemente de sus mritos literarios, un autntico soberano de insufribles.  No niego que Borges era un buen lector, que su amor por la literatura se deja traslucir de sobra en sus escritos, y que como crtico era bastante avispado, pero desde luego, en el plano literario, era totalmente incapaz de algo tan sencillo como contar una puetera historia sin exhibir gratuita y sistemticamente su supuesto grado de erudicin. En mi opinin, un narrador nefasto que obliga al lector a "adaptarse" continuamente y sin remisin a sus referentes culturales (como si stos fueran imprescindibles o necesariamente fascinantes). Presuntuoso, superfluo y, sobre todo, frustrante, pues promete lo que ni sabe ni puede dar.  He optado por escribir este comentario en castellano, idioma en el que Borges redacto sus obras, pero para el que curiosamente nunca tuvo nada bueno que decir hasta que recibi el premio "Cervantes". En fin que -aparte de su incompetencia literaria- fascinante desvergenza la suya (iba a decir "chaqueterismo" pero se me olvidaba que Borges es uno de los pocos con patente de corso para drselas de listo inventando neologismos, as que mejor ser callar, que igual no estoy capacitado, vete t a saber...)     Un clsico sobrevalorado ms (y van...). Puestos a tener que elegir algo que lleve el nombre de Borges, creo que me quedo con la famosa marca espaola de frutos secos. Me resulta ms digerible 
 I was very disappointed in this book -- so much so that I returned it which is something I rarely do.  It just seemed superficial and glib to me and I was very surprised that it received such good reviews from professionals whose opinion I respect 
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 I would have been fascinated to read a comparison of how Protestants are treated in, say, Italy, Spain, Portugal or France.  What's that you say?  There Are no Protestants in those countries!?  They were tortured, murdered, driven out of their homelands or forced to convert to Catholicism many centuries ago!?  Wow.  I guess in comparison, American Catholics should consider themselves extremely lucky to be allowed to immigrate to a land founded by Protestants, to practice their faith, to get rich if they work hard, and to share every freedom that people of other denominations enjoy.  And, being so grateful for this freedom, I have no doubt that they all work hard to ensure that Protestants in Catholic countries have the same rights and privileges, right?  uh... Right 
 Artie may well be a baby gorilla, but the film sucks 
 This is a one-time watch. It is most definately a home movie with very unprofessional editing. I was hoping for at least one or two songs to have a professional mix. Never happened.. 
 Uses an absurd amount of ink. printed 3 sheets of 8X10 photos one CD and about 15-20 documents and ran out of ink not just one or two Cartridges but ALL six. customer service ay Epson is awful e-mail went unanswered so i called, tried to explain how much ink i was going thru and how the printer would clean the ink heads before every print job but was told that was normal. i don't know if the printer was defective or not, but i do know that epson customer support is. retuned and bought a cannon mp600 and i love it!!! 
    I guess with all the news recently that Universal wants to buy Dreamworks, their DVD marketing has started to go down the toilet, as two film packs like this one useually show little effort in both making a good DVD,adding any good bones features, and then just rushing it to stores.  The two movies on this gift set are rushed DVDs that were fast put together and were ment to rob you of your money.    Jurassic Park III; Perhaps the worst movie that Universal has done in ten years.  All special effects and no story.  Sam Neill deserves better films then this, and they still want to do a Jurassic Park IV......?!    Hulk;  Good Movie, bad DVD release and transfer.  Marvel did not like it either, nor Universal's less then promotion of the movie when it was about to be released to theaters.  There's talk of Marvel taking the Hulk Movie franchise to another movie company once the righst with Universal expire.  I say "Yes, Take it to a movie company that will do it right 
 Reading the first chapter was the only time I actually enjoyed this book. Everything went downhill afterwards, when I realized this was just a retelling of Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights. Wuthering Heights is a well-told classic, timeless, raw, and beautiful. Here On Earth, however, is just a poor rendition, very contrived, no spontaneity whatsoever.  The almost-complete cast of characters in Wuthering Heights is present in Here On Earth. I don't remember the names of the characters in Here On Earth but I remember their counterparts pretty well. There's your modern-day version of Catherine Earnshaw, there's the modern-day counterpart of her brother Hindley. Then there's the counterpart of Heathcliff! Surprise! Surprise! A foundling with a dark and ominous character! And then there are the neighbors: the counterpart of Edgar Linton (whom Catherine's counterpart marries), and the counterpart of Isabella Linton (whom the counterpart of Heathcliff marries). And then there's the counterpart of Catherine Jr (Catherine-counterpart and Edgar-counterpart's daughter), who falls in love with cousin counterpart of Hareton (son of Hindley's counterpart). There's also Nelly Dean's counterpart, and Linton Linton's counterpart, but that's all I'm going to say. Those of you who've read and loved Wuthering Heights, you know the rest.  It's a sad thing that this is the first Alice Hoffman novel I've read. I'm now inclined to ignore the rest of her novels. Maybe. Or I might be open to her other novels if I've finished reading all the other books I really wanted to read first 
 If you haven't read Ramachandran's "Phantoms in the Brain," go read that instead--it's amazing.  If you've already read "Phantoms," don't bother with this lightweight re-hashing.    Ramachandran seems to have chosen to follow in the footsteps of another great--Stephen Hawking--by writing one great book and following it up with an endless stream of successively shorter, "more accessible" versions of the same book.    The attempts to make more accessible that which was already readily accessible have put Ramachandran in danger of over-simplifying the material.    Warning: This allegedly 208-page book includes only 113 pages of "Phantom" rehash and then notes 
 I'm not sure why this magazine is so highly rated. Sure it's an O.K. magazine, if you like immersing yourself in hype, marketing-speak and incredibly superficial language. Admittedly the pictures are pretty and as an obsessed mountain biker i can say we like bike porn. I just cannot read any of the articles. Chock full of over-the-top adjectives and 'xtreme' language. I don't trust a magazine that calls every new incremental advancement in biking technology 'revolutionary' or 'amazing' or any number of disgustingly inappropriate modifiers. They ceaselessly use vapid 'technical' jargon made up to sound high-minded and high-tech, but is nothing more than marketing spew.  The tech advice column is full of suspicious letters that have the stench of stealth advertising. If there's one thing that's well thought-out about this magazine, it's how best to bombard the reader with sales pitches, half-truths and hype.  In short, this magazine is blatant industry propaganda. My first advice: don't buy it. If you do buy it (for the love of god) don't take anything between those covers seriously. 
 Ok, so I bought this DVD because one of my all time favorite actors is in it (I'm a huge Jimmy Stewart fan too!). While this movie was a good back drop for Cary Grant, the plot was a bit bland...spoiled rich man must make his own living for a year to win a bet. Some of the meetings with his "monied" crowd, while he's a working stiff, are entertaing, but not really memorable. Maybe I'm used to his later movies where he really shined, but this movie just didn't grab me. Or maybe it was the quality of the DVD. I might have gotten more out of it if I had turned the sound off, the sound track was that bad. There were a few skips and the usual "old film" wrinkles in the visual, but they wouldn't have been so hard to deal with if I didn't have to keep adjusting the sound....even then, some of the dialogue still sounded like gibberish. Could be that I've just got a really bad bootleg copy. I advise against purchasing the DVD whose cover case shows CG from the shoulders up in front of a car and stone house.   
 This book perpetuates the out-dated idea that Fibromyalgia is helped to worsen by your own mentality and emotions.  It's funny that Amazon.com paired it with "What your Doctor may not tell you about Fibromyalgia..." by Dr. St. Amand; seeing as how their contents completely contradict one another.  If you want "freedom from Fibromyalgia," do what I did: buy "What your Doctor may not tell you..." and get better with guaifenesin like myself and millions of others. Dr. St. Amand is a doctor who knows that having fibromyalgia is what brings on depression, emotional and cognitive problems... not vice versa. This book is a waste of time for someone who wants to get better a.s.a.p, and have it last forever, unless you've been diagnosed as a hypocondria 
 No, I don't own this cd.  I had the extreme misfortune of attending a party for airline employees (Daisy (my date at the time) coerced me) and you guessed it, they were playing this cd.  Unfortunately, they weren't serving drinks quickly enough and I got a good, sober listen to this one.  It's mawkish, boring, and dated.  Do yourself a favor, don't buy this cd and avoid parties where they play this kind of music 
 Walt Whitman's life's work is his "Leaves of Grass", enlarged over the years with additional poems.  Regarded as America's poet, Whitman wrote in the 1840s through the 1880s, encompassing both the "Manifest Destiny" ideology of the pre-war, through the Reconstruction period of US History.    The poems are diverse and upbeat.  The language, for the most part, is clear and easy.  Nevertheless, like most poetry today, the poems are so little different from prose, except in the presentation into lines.  Very few poetic devises are used.  One may correctly criticize my critique as one who does not appreciate contemporary poetry.  But, in comparison to rhyhming verse by Longfellow, Frost, Byron, Browning, or Shakespeare, current poetry appears meaningless.    Although a classic, "Leaves of Grass" offers only one or two poems that qualify for a standard anthology.  None of his poems are memorable.  Not a single line is considered worthy of citing anywhere in literature.  I give two stars to the work, simply because I must admit my own incompetence in modern poetry appreciation.  Whitman is considered important enough to be the major poet in the movie, "Dead Poet's Society"; so, the reputation of the work must be quite impressive, though it beats me how that is 
 I was disappointed in this volume. In the first episode, Tsume's recollection, it was practically the entire first episode replayed. I would have liked to see some more in-depth monologue (thoughts) around the emotional aspect of what the characters were going through as they recalled them. There was a little of this but it could have been much better thought out vol 4. I feel this was a missed opportunity for some indepth character development. The characters are so rich,it is a shame. The episode mantage (as i'll call these "recollections")I felt that was best put together was Hige's. I wish they had new schenes or angels that were part of the recalled events,new sequences at the very least. This would have served the same intention (to summarize the story thus far) but would have added a deeper dimension to the characters. Fortunatlly I rented this whole series before I decided to buy it.  I came across volume three first, thinking it was a stand alone movie. (I was in a hurry.)Oh course I was completely lost. Clearly this was the climax of the series. So I returned to begin from Volume one. When I got to this volume I was shocked. I spead through it, partly fast forwarding. Waiting for any thing new!  Nothing but a piece of dialouge or two! What a waste! And at $18.00-40.00 volume, don't bother!  I'll only buy this if I find it in the greatly reduced bin for $5.00 or less!  Thank you reviewers for your warnings!  Bandai,why did you cheat us like this?! 
 The arguments are simplistic, biased towards the Israelis (surprise, surprise!) ....same old diatribes about why israel should exist.. 
 After waiting for months, Amazon.com recently informed me that:  "We are sorry to report that we will not be able to obtain the following item from your order:      Mark McKown "Complete Body Development With Dumbbells"  Though we had expected to be able to send this item to you, we've since found that it is not available from any of our sources at this time.

 The history is very, very slow in developing and basically the whole book is noneventful. JB is sent to Bologna and the he came back. Period. Some people apparently wanted him dead! At least that's what Grisham tell us from the start, but then simply nothing happen.  But the most annoying thing - being myself italian - is to read so many mistakes in the parts of book written in Italian!! You fun readding this review? Notto really, I thinko but maybe picture the now you have how of italians parts off Brokker like sound 
 Before I started reading "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," the book had a lot going for it: stellar reviews on the cover, an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at Walden Books in Pocatello.  Unfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good.  I'm not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise. In "Zen" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s. But the story, I guess, is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology.  The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page  17:      "The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower."  That passage is good. The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of "quality."   I'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth. It's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better. The author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.   Whatever the book was supposed to be, it didn't impressed me.  
 I read this book because my mother and father, a career soldier, were married shortly before World War II, after knowing each other only 3 months. I hoped this book would offer me some interesting insights. But trust me, this book has no insights to offer. The vignettes are too short and most seem incomplete; further, they are repetitious and shallow, and the whole book is poorly written. Do not waste your time. Instead, spend it finding one of the really good books on WWII; there are plenty out there. Larry King must be spreading himself too thin these days 
 Readers interested in Benny Morris should read Israeli historian Yehoshua Porath's "War and Remembrance" in the summer 2002 issue of Azure. Porath adds to the Oct. 1995 and April 1990 discussions by Robert Satloff and Shabtai Teveth in Middle Eastern Studies and to Efraim Karsh's  excellent book, Fabricating Israeli History. Don't read this book without looking at these critiques.   Why? Morris et al tell readers they have written "new" history of Israel, considering the entire previous historical record as if it were solely propaganda for the Zionist cause. Here, Morris considers Jewish conduct in the 1947 and 1948, and why the Arabs fled.   Morris claims to be the first person to have looked at Israeli archives on the Dalet Plan, a plan to move populations in certain areas. Nevertheless, other scholars show that Morris and his peers in this book misrepresent themselves and the facts.   Firstly, Yigael Alon and Israel Galili, in The Book of the Palmah, gave Walid Khalidi material to argue in 1959 that the Dalet Plan was "the master plan of the Zionists" to expell Palestinians wholesale. Furthermore, the 1973 History of the Hagana (by Uri Millstein) included the entire Dalet Plan text. Official or not, these 1959 and 1973 Israeli Jewish histories, very shortly after the the 1948 war, did not hide what happened, as Morris claims here.  Morris also writes that Arab government archives were closed to his research and and to other historians writing on the Israeli-Arab conflict before him. He writes that he relied on Israeli and Western archives. But Porath, Karsh, Satloff and Teveth all show that this is not the case.   Furthermore, Morris did no research at the Hagannah archives or those of the IDF, a fact underlined by Efraim Karsh in 2002, and one which he admits in a more recent book (The War for Palestine). Morris now writes that in the mid 1980s both those archives were closed to all researchers after all. He writes, he was limited to few first-hand military materials, indicating that there is no "new" research here at all.   Morris' charge that Israel carried out a deliberate and systematic expulsion of the Palestinian Arabs isn't even remotely substantiated by extensive research done since the mid 1980s. On the contrary, Morris takes material very selectively, from Israeli archive fringes and makes what Porath terms "outrageoulsy false claims"-- that Israel's victory resulted from "an imperialist conspiracy or an overwhelming advantage in manpower and arms."   Indeed, Morris writes here that Arabs left Israel because of many factors, their departure was not the fault of the Jewish people alone. Then, he contradicts himself, giving those who hate Israel grounds to blame Israel for the exodus, without considering the other circumstances.   This book also details a so-called "massacre" in 1948 of Arabs at the village of Deir Yassin, but not enough to mention that the incident was actually a battle--in which most Arabs killed (like those in Jenin in March and April 2002) were armed.   Finally, Morris does not note (by comparison) other massacres in 1948--of Jews, by Arabs. On December 30, 1947, for example, Arabs murdered some 50 Jewish co-workers at the Haifa refinery. On April 13, 1948, they massacred over 80 Jewish doctors, nurses and Hebrew University workers on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem.   Additionally, nearly all of the 131 people who surrendered at the Etzion Bloc were also murdered by Palestinian Arabs. Only two survived.  These latter Arab massacres of Jews do not fit the blame that Morris seeks to lay at Jewish feet. Nor does the fact that Jews did not afterwards flee, as occurred on the Arab side following the battle at Deir Yassin. So Morris omits them.   I also find it disturbing that the book nowhere mentions the equal refugee claim of 1 million Jewish refugees from 22 Arab nations, who were expelled with nothing but the shirts on their backs, and rebuilt their lives in Israel, the U.S., and Europe.   The number of Jewish refugees was actually larger than that of Arab refugees (counting only those who fled, not their descendants). Honest history would have noted these parallels as well as the entire context of the war.   --Alyssa A. Lappe 
 If a story doesn't hook by the middle of Chapter 3, there are other books to open, books that kick in by PAGE 3, thank heaven. I bought TIME BOMB because the reviews on the jacket made it look fast and thrilling. I could not even finish chapter 3. I'd read something once by Jonathan Kellerman that made me remember him as a reliable author of great escapist fiction. I can't remember what it was.  *sigh* I don't see where these rave reviews are coming from. The book is so boring.  Also, the racist meanies I saw lurching up over the horizon, as well as being hackneyed and ho-hum, were unrealistic. Even the meanest harshest republican white adult male doesn't picket a school in a high income neighborhood shouting "wetback" and "greaser". Not even in wacky California, I shouldn't think. 
 Never could have guesse that this movie would be so bad. COuld not reach the end of it, a very rare occasion!! The dialogues are so ludicrous, characters and acting obnoxious, I can't, I repeat, I can't understand how Alyson Hannigan starred this piece of... Shame on me for being such a BUFFY fan and having the bad habit of renting / buying anything remotely related to the cast of BUFFY... 
 I bought an earlier edition of his books called "government giveaways" and learned the following the hard way.  Since he published new ones, I kept my mind open to what was new and I found out that I have this book in my local book store. I cracked it open and skimmed it.   Lesko makes it seem from the advertising that all of these grant and loan programs are for everyone-this isn't the case. When you eliminate 49 other states and every city other city that you don't live in in your state, the book becomes very, very short. There are federal programs that do apply, but there isn't a lot.  Go to your local book store to take a peek at it. You will learn that only a few things will likely apply to what you're interested in, and it isn't likely going to be worth the price of the book.  I would however recommend to Lesko that he gets team of researcher's and writers covering programs in MORE detail for each state. Having a more local edition of his books with all the existing state government and city govenment programs would be much more informative.  For example since I am interested in business financing, there is something called an SBA 7a loan. It would seem from the book that anyone can get it. But from the book you wouldn't know the following requirements: 1) You must be able to guarantee a portion of the loan yourself, with your real estate or other businesses. If you can't do this you don't qualify. 2) If you are an existing business, Your tax returns for the previous few years must have proof of cashflow. They won't guarantee a loan for business that doesn't show profit. SO DON't CHEAT ON YOUR TAXES! 3) Loan expenditures are only for tangible expenses, you can't pay rent, or people with the loan money. 4) If you are a new business, you must have Significant experience in the industry you plan on doing your business in.  Now why couldn't he just say that in his books!?!? It's because the book is written with a shotgun approach and isn't too detailed.  Good luck and happy free money hunting 
 Philip Kerr tries to write in seventeenth century formal English but it only makes him sound arrogant and it distracts the reader from the existing weak plot line.  Dark Matter was a terrible book.  The characters were underdeveloped, the plot line weak and unrealistic, and the writing obnoxious.  In Dark Matter Kerr's writing is extremely jumbled.  His style bothers and irritates the reader more than conveys any sort of message or story.  If you want to read a historical fiction, look for any other author.  Kerr uses vivid sex scenes gratuitously and pointlessly.  It is a completely inaccurate account of Newton's life other than the basic fact that he worked at the Tower of London.  (Historians agree that Newton was psychotic, which this book does not convey.)  Kerr should be forbidden from forever writing again 
 All i can say is that how can a christian woman have this as a title to a book 
 This book does cover alot of information not needed for CLEP, but it does give you a great guideline on who and what to study for clep and good examples on what questions will look like for the actual clep.   I wanted to ensure I was prepared for the clep, so I purchased this book and disregarded the other 2 comments.  Although, they were right about the obscurity, this book still taught me alot.   You don't necessarily need it, but if you want to be prepared, this book will not hurt your bank account that much. I also recommend The Complete Itiots Guide to American Literature (5 stars, check out the reviews), and the Internet.  That is all you need 
 This book began by raising some very interesting questions about "mother love" versus "father love", that is, about the need for a person to experience both unconditional love and earned love. I eagerly bought the book, logically believing these provocative questions would be answered at the end of the book, but IMHO Kushner wimps out. He writes that there really isn't any difference at all, despite the fact that he outlined significant differences earlier in the book.  I won't be buying Kushner's latest book, which was released earlier this month (although I'll probably read parts of it in a bookstore). I find myself growing a bit tired of his technique of profiling one Old Testament character per book. (He's profiled Job, the writer of Ecclesiastes/King Solomon, Jacob/Israel in this book, and Moses in his latest.) Kushner writes really well, and I'd like to see him break out of this mold and deliver some truly original ideas 
 I didn't get what I payed for! The screen said large print bible and I recived a bible with regular print!  It was for my moms birthday, it was a good thing she wasn't to dissapointed 
  Reading Dark Harbor is like watching a mediocre TV show that you can't be bothered to turn off. I listened to Dark Harbor as an audio book, so I don't feel too badly about wasting my time on it because I `read it' while I was doing other things that had to be done anyway, like driving.   If you are looking for something that feels fresh and new - Dark Harbor is not for you. This novel is about as innovative as an episode of Murder She Wrote. To illustrate: Stone Barrington and his cronies quickly deduce that an apparent suicide must have been a murder because the gun was found in the victim's wrong hand. (I think I actually saw that one on Murder She Wrote) Woods either can't be bothered to come up with a new idea or he simply doesn't care.   It is clear early on who is responsible for the murders in Dark Harbor. This isn't because the clues come together in any logical way, but rather because of the predictable nature of the novel. You can just tell. This doesn't mean that the solution makes sense. In fact, there are huge inconsistencies in the plot that make the ending feel forced.   It is as if Woods couldn't be bothered to think all of his plot lines through. Woods is compelled to include his regular characters in the novel even though they have little to do (except of course, to have sex with Stone). Holly barely says a word on her first trip to the island. On her second trip she has an obligatory romp with Stone and then gets kidnapped for the remainder of the novel.   Why was she kidnapped? I don't think anyone - including Woods - can answer that question in any plausible way. My theory is that Woods needed to work Holly into the plot and decided that putting her in peril would allow him to fill a few pages. It also allowed him to include Holly's dad (another regular character) in her search. Wood's motive seems obvious. The kidnapper's motive however isn't - her kidnapping makes no sense. But clearly this was something Woods didn't think was worth worrying about.   The best I can say about this novel is that it is a quick easy read (of course, in my case it was read to me). It may not be worth the time and trouble to actually read (and certainly not to buy) - but as an audio book from the library (with a limited selection of audio books to choose from) it helped me pass the time in traffic.   
 Macbeth V.v 25-30: "A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."   Stream-of-conscieness technique (no punctuation), southern accents (no spell check), mixed and matched timecrawls (flashbacks without warning), sequencing narrators (voice change with no scene break), first and third person viewpoints (confused yet?), and slapped-your-faceee! symbolism.  For literature, I choose Hemingway (who can be subtle or direct, but is always clear).  Good books should be enjoyable and understandable.  I understand the story Faulkner was trying to tell about a Jerry-Springeresque southern family, but I didn't like the novel.  If you want to enjoy dsyfunctional American families with blistering social commentary watch 'South Park'-- much funnier.  I'll let one of Faulkner's contemporaries speak:  "Poor Faulkner. Does he really think big emotions come from big words? He thinks I don't know the ten-dollar words. I know them all right. But there are older and simpler and better words, and those are the ones I use." --Ernest Hemingway  Unless you are forced into this book for a literature class, don't buy it and don't read it.  If you look hard enough, anything can become meaninful, even this tripe.  Victor Hugo, Shakespeare, and those ancient greeks are excellent in that their works have themes and meanings already.  You don't have to overanalyze and create meaning where none exists in order to enjoy those works.    Faulkner is babble and murky and opaque with circular symbolism fading into tempestous violence only an idiot pretending genius or an eleemosynary prententious genius enjoying idiocy might love and obtuse run-on sentences longer than this one are exactly what you'll find all over this classical work 
 This book reads as if it were written in one marathon sprint, the plot racing from one bloody event to the next, with barely a pause for character development or background detail.  What could have been an intriguing novel of mercenary killers and political upheaval is instead a throwaway pulp crime novel 
 The book is full of nonsense that should be simple common sense to anyone that has worked in the business world.  Mostly this book is a chance for the author to talk of his many "high level" meetings and for him to boast about all of the execs and sports figures that he knows.  This book is rather entertaining, but you will not gain much from it in the way of business or management knowledge 
 this not a terrible album, but it is not that good either, and this, when  coupled with the fact that there are many other bands doing very similar  things much better than knapsack, means that it probably isn't worth the  investment. i have never heard any of their other albums, but this one had  neither wonderful guitar work nor intriguing vocals, and the lyrics (which  have been called brilliant by one of the official reviewers) leave  something to be desired. the first time you hear this album, you will  probably like it, but after three or four more times all the way through, i  think you will probably be either skipping half the songs, taking the album  out after three songs, or running to your local used cd store to get some  of your poorly invested money back. it just doesn't have that lasting  quality that a great album has; this album does not leave you wanting more,  as a brilliant album would do. in short, not a terrible album but not worth  paying full price for, especially when there are so many bands out their  which are doing the whole emo-punk-pop thing much better 
 I don't know why this William Styron is trying to lie on my great great grandfather.  Needless to say I am a decendant of Nat Turner and it bothers me that this author is trying to lie to make this book more interesting.  I cannot say for certainty that my grandfather was not gay or that he didn't like white women and neither can this author but I can say that Nat Turner was married and had children and I am a decendant of that union!  As far as EVERYONE knows he was NOT gay and he certainly loved his African American Wife.  William Styron had no reason to portray him as such other than to make this book more appealing and that detracts from Nat Turner because it was a falsity.  Other than that idiotic portrayl the book was good 
 Why do we need another history book about ignorant cowards hiding behind bed sheets? Perhaps include details on the bed sheets thread count 
 There's no shame in not understanding the details of modern naval telecommunications, or the aerodynamics of flight, or how flight control systems work on aircraft, or the physics of modern weapons, or small-unit military tactics. They're all complex subjects. But why would you showcase those details when you hadn't done the research to write about them in an authentic way? Why would his editor not get someone to review these technical details? I had to drop this book about 75% of the way through it because I couldn't take the inaccuracies any longer. What a disappointment 
 This book is very difficult to read and poorly written. I was looking forward to reading this book because of the reputation of the authors. They have done a sloppy job with this book and I was extremely disappointed 
 I was actually glad to read all of the low reviews because I felt like a traitor when I didn't like this book.  I wanted to like it, I really did - but it was very dull.  I ended up skimming most of it because it didn't hold my interest at all.  The first chapter started out with a bang and I was totally hooked.  It didn't take long to lose me.  Boooooring.  I didn't like Sophie, I didn't like Royd (Royd - are you kidding?  Perhaps the author should invest in a baby name book - there are much better choices for names out there.).  I wasn't interested in the direction the book went.    I thought the action scenes were ridiculous compared to the every day scenes.  If Sophie could pull off the every day scenes like she did the action scenes we wouldn't have had such a boring book.  She was da bomb during breaking and entering and getting away but she was pathetic at any other time.  Royd was so very unlikeable I couldn't believe they ended up in bed together.  Ick.  Adding Jane into the book was very contrived.  Plain old artist Jane and her cop stepfather Joe saved the boy from a ruthless trained killer?  It seemed like a ploy to connect Eve Duncan with this book.  Not at all believable.  The one sentence that I found interesting was when Michael thought that Jane resembled or looked like someone familiar.  It seemed to be a lead in to the next book.  The first IJ book I ever read was Ugly Duckling.  Hopefully IJ re-reads that one before starting the next one.  Give us a strong heroine who overcomes her trauma and kicks [...].   
 If it's basically impossible for you to force the words "abortion is murder and murder is wrong" out of your pen you might be a liberal. Dr. Boyd, what a disappointment. You had me till then. Abortion is the ultimate violence.  
 The "original" versions are 4x3 letterboxed...  For anyone with an HDTV or widescreen regular TV, these DVDs are a major disappointment.  The original versions are matted from their original 2.35:1 aspect ration for 4x3 TVs, so they look like crud on an HDTV or other widescreen TV.  They appear to be made from the same transfers used for the laserdiscs.  The other versions, from 2004, appear to be identical to the DVDs previously released 
 There is NOTHING of science in this sliver of a book.  This book Summed up:  You must think Rich Use thought to bring form to the formless Thank god so it will occur. When it doesn't occur, you either weren't thankful enough to god or failed to think hard enough about being rich. PURE SCIENCE!    I could understand someone in 1910 being impressed by this work, along with maybe animal-magnetism or iridology, but only a half-wit would be compelled by any of this today 
 This is the perfect show for politically illiterate liberals who need a celebrity to reinforce their trendy, pre-packaged beliefs. Sure, this series bears some [contrived] humor; How convenient that renders it invunerable to criticism. Don't get me wrong, I'm not some regressive conservative who, with a red face, watched fahrenheit 9/11 and decided to slur Michael Moore because of his fabricated "misrepresentations and untruths." I guess I'm writing this because I had the misfortune of seeing "The Awful Truth," and I feel I need to get this off my chest or it will bore itself into my mind until I have an aneurysm. (If I had an aneurysm, I'd definitely make sure my dead body ends up up the Shamu tank at Sea World. At least I could warp some kids' minds in the process of dying.)  Every episode is literally like, "AWFUL FACT OF THE DAY: Some obscure, skewed study shows that Americans are dumb and like explosions and I'm Michael Moore an attention-starved clownboat!" Seriously, it's interesting Moore critiques "American Indulgence" when he thought having a television show for that kind of pseudo-racist content was alright. - Thus Says the Pellingto 
 This music does not include the lyrics from the animated movie. A disappointment. Whats the point of this album if you can't sing along to the tunes? 
 This book has some useful information on fasting and natural hygiene, but I found it extremely difficult to read through the book to get to it.  For those who are devout Christians, the book is probably wonderful.  For those  who are of other faiths, or who prefer books in which God is not referenced  in literally every sentence, this is not a great choice 
 Germaine Greer's idea of a good-looking young man is pretty unusual: almost all of the "beautiful boys" in this collection are passive, dewy-eyed pseudo-girls.  And I'm not just saying this: one of the full-page color photos is of a Thai "kathoey" (drag queen).  You will not find very many photos of active, exuberant, competitive, handsome boys.  In fact, the phrase "handsome boys" may sum up what this book is missing.  I need hardly mention that her "special idea" of all this artwork being created for "the female gaze" is absurd.  Most women care nothing for casual sex or pornography, and scribblers like Germaine Greer can scribble their hands off without changing a thing!  There is such a thing as human nature, after all.  If women really liked visual erotica, we would know it by now: there would be millionaires who made their fortunes by tapping this market.  Instead, we seem to see the same old same old: men buying visual erotica, and woman buying romance novels -- and there ARE millionaires who can attest to the vibrancy of these markets!  There are, of course, some testosterone-heavy ladies out there -- and Greer must be one of them -- who think that their ideas of the good life must become mandatory for all thinking women.  Why?!  What ever happened to freedom, and the right to choose one's own life?  Does Germaine Greer show any respect for these ideas?  Palpable, visible, nonsense, and complete arrogance: trademarks of Germaine Greer 
 Datlow & Windling's backpatting of personal acquaintances is the basis of their editorial choices, and adherence to political doctrine. Their "years best"  collection for 2000 includes Ursula Le Guin twice,  and this authors writing is little more then fanciful icing to make her  de-hydrated cause (feminism in this case) more palatable 
 I suppose the biggest problem with this book is that it is poor at explaining its underlying principles. Since those underlying principles are based on quantum information theory, among other things, it makes for difficult reading when the reader is not up to date with all that is current in the field. Much is implied or assumed. For me, this hurt the flow of the story.  The story is essentially a murder mystery. A human being is sent to investigate the death of a brilliant scientist on a planet where a scarce resource is found. Both the scientist and the investigator are a bit more than human. They are both the results of eugenic breeding programs and designer gene splicing. The death of the scientist is the ostensible reason for the investigation but the real reason is that everyone wants to get his hands on the data she was working on. It could conceivably turn all politics on its head. The tools at her disposal include her own ruthlessness, semi-official backing from the government and an artificial intelligence which can posses the bodies of those suitably wire for the process. In the end, her own fate as well as those of the government and other lifeforms depends upon what she finds and what she does with the knowledge she gains.  It could have been exciting but, for me, it was not. To be fair, I am not the greatest fan of mysteries to begin with and it may well appeal to others.  The author does provide a well thought out bibliography at the end which deals with matters on the quantum level. 
 I bought this to encourage more tummy time but my 4 month old doesn't care much for it. It doesn't stand up well and the handle to start the mouse moving is very hard to pull for a baby 
 Ingredients: High Fructose Corn Syrup and Hydrogenated Oil.  Do a search and see what you think. I won't touch this stuff. 
 Kaiser Chiefs are a load of wannabe rockers DO NOT BUY THIS buy Led Zeppelin or AC DC but please not this 
 I bought this book along with The Great Book of Optical Illusions by the same author.  The "Great Book" was suggested by Amazon as pair for "More," and indeed if you look on Amazon's page for "More Optical Illusions" you find that many people bought both books.  However, "More" is just the last half of the "Great Book" so if you buy the "Great Book" you don't get any more with "More." This is especially galling in view of the text by author Al Seckel, who writes in BOTH books: "Many books on optical illusions reprint the same examples over and over again, but this is not the case [in this book]."  Amazon's book pages and suggested pairings may be generated by a computer, but this is one case where Amazon should insert a human's touch to make sure its customers understand before purchasing "More" that it is simply a partial version of "Great. 
 Metallica were simply one of the worst most overrated and pathetic bands ever. Most of their trite albums deserve no stars. Their only good cds are either Master of Puppets, or Black Album. KILL EM ALL is such a bore!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! James Hetfield, the lead singer just screams and can't sing at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Why???? Why can't he sing more proper like Lou Greamm(Foreigner), & Mark Knopfler(Dire Straits)???????? Each and every song on this album is bad!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't listen to the people who rate Metallica's albums a five star. They are overrated....Green Day is better. Get Them, Dire Straits, and Foreigner insted.  Ps. This album is worth a minus trillion. 
 The author gets way of course on various subjects. The book, in my opinion, is a bore. I have read several publications on area 51 and this book was a real struggle. Very little substance and a lot of hype. I couldn't finish it. The silly cover should have tipped me off.. 
 Gardner's book is full of banal and often incorrect observations. It's hard to believe he has received over 20 honorary degrees from universities around the world if his ideas are this unoriginal. He chooses the staggeringly bad examples of Margaret Thatcher, George Bush and BP CEO John Browne as people who have successfully changed minds. He doesn't mention that Thatcher and Bush antagonized large sections of their countries' populations, completely failing to change their minds, in fact hardening their positions of opposition; in large part due to these leaders' own refusal to ever change their minds or consider alternative policies. Gardner lavishes praise on Bush for switching from isolationism to an interventionist foreign policy after 9/11, without any mention of the PNAC team that had already planned to invade Iraq even before 9/11.   As for John Browne, his claim to have repositioned BP as an environmentally and socially concerned company has been discredited in the past year with the explosion at a Texas refinery and the oil spill on the North Slope that led to the admission that BP hadn't done any of the anti-corrosion work it was supposed to do on its pipelines.   Another poor example is Lawrence Summers of Harvard. For some reason Gardner doesn't mention the biggest controversy Summers was involved with, when he said that women could never be as good at science as men. Gardner's use of case studies from academia is another bad choice because most readers won't have heard of these professors and won't care much about their internal disputes. It's a shame Gardner didn't tackle any real-life problems, such as how to change the minds of Creationists.   Gardner insists on using "she" and "her" instead of "he" and "his" as the neutral pronoun for political correctness, and another irritating habit he has is to invent jargon that will obviously never catch on, such as "wetware" and "dryware" for the internal workings of the brain and "GoodWork" for being ethical at work, yet another painfully banal concept.   In one section Gardner describes how a psychologist uses a patient's dream to understand how the patient sees himself (or should I say herself even if he was male?) in relation to others, which sounds to me like total cod psychology, but that's just my own reaction to dream interpretations.   Regarding computers, Gardner believes that people are starting to prefer interaction with computers over interaction with other people. This again is utterly mistaken and it's clear that Gardner has next to no experience with the internet. Thanks to the internet there has been an explosion in human interaction and far more people talk with other people than with computers. Gardner says people can get emotional solace from interaction with computers that are programmed to communicate and cites a book written in 1995, but gives no further justification of this claim.   Anyone writing about changing minds ought to have a full understanding of how people use the internet and communicate on all kinds of levels that weren't possible before this technology existed, for example role-playing or participating in a political discussion forum, as well as absorbing surreptitious marketing on the internet.   Gardner's specific advice on how to change minds consists of using a variety of words that all begin with "re" for convenience, eg resonance and resistance. I had hoped to learn how to communicate my ideas better from this book, but all I learnt was that it was a bad book. 
 I purchased this book hoping it would help me show a novice how to start modeling for games. While the author covers the overview and technical terms, the essential modeling instruction is severely lacking. The book talks about creating detail but fails to deliver quality examples.   I bought this title because I own a few of the author's other works including the 3ds max bible. This was a dissapointment because it fails to provide the information on technical skills while it raises false hopes of earning money from games, if folks use this resource. (Read back of book cover)  The up side to this book is in the overview. It does introduce the information and resources needed for the game industry, and it covers the basic concepts of animation and modeling, but does not mention many important pit falls common to many an aspiring beginner 
 I've sat in front of this book for a week, barely making a dent in it.  Flanner purports to tell the story of French culture, but succeeds only in revealing that she is a socialite concerned only with the deaths of famous authors. The book is organized into one-paragraph snippets summarizing the latest death, of Lindbergh or Monet, for instance.  However, instead of reflecting the culture of Paris in the era, Flanner simply summarizes the lives of her subjects.  Her description of Monet ends, as do many, with a count of how many people attended his funeral. Simply put, the book reads like the journal of a socialite who is out of touch with common culture.  It is not interesting neither literarily or historically 
 I read the reviews before buying this book and understood some of the objections others had.  Having DID, I bought this book with the soul purpose of finding out the process and struggles Oxnam went through in his healing.  I was extremely disappointed. His constant reference about how he spent two years in exhausting therapy sessions three times a week sent a resounding message about his financial status. Most people in therapy can hardly afford to go once a week.  His need to be special and exceptional was evident by his comment that "MPD" was "extremely rare".  This showed a lack of knowledge of Oxnam and his threapist.  The percent of children traumatized before the age of five is staggering.  Current understanding leads experts to believe that DID is more common than they used to think it was.  Oxnam's constant name dropping and many pages of his accomplishments through out the book was boring and served no purpose.  His insistance in calling the disorder MPD instead of DID was an indicator that he was operating from outdated resources and knowledge.  There is a reason the disorder was changed from MPD to DID and in 1990 when Oxnam was diagnosed, the disorder was called DID.  There is a difference in threaputic approaches between MPD and DID.  This insistance by Oxnam and his threapist put doubts on the validity of treatment.  Anyone who has studied DID and has gone through therapy for DID with an experienced therapist will detect that Oxnam's therapist was not experienced in treating DID.  I was left wondering why the therapist did and said what he did. Oxnam's extreme foul language in the book was not congruent with his constant mentioning of his superior intellect.  Upon finishing the book, I still remained uninformed about what Oxnam's real internal struggles were and extremely frustrated over Dr. Smith's methods. The many pages of Dr. Smith's explanation of DID at the end of the book is a futile attempt to convince the reader that he is an expert which he clearly was not at the time he worked with Oxnam for seven years.  In short, the book is about a very spoiled, weatlthy man's frustration over having DID and his insistance that he be pampered through the whole processes. I actually felt sorry for Oxnam that his therapist strung him along, but with Oxnam's constant references to his wealth, vast intellegence and status in life, I didn't feel too sorry. I will donate this book to the library book sale which will sell for 50 cents which is still over priced.   If you really want to read and understand DID, read Dissociative Identity Disorder Source Book.  It still remains the bible of DID for those who really truly suffer from its effects.   
 I found that tying in human traits to different styles of architecture was not interesting at all. There is no discussion of building techniques or the practical side of architecture.  This would be more for the artist that is trying to project different human feelings into the structure.  If you are looking for a techincal guide to architecture this is not it 
 Just finished reading the book, had never read Virginia Woolf before and had anticipated it eagerly, but was disappointed overall.  I think you have to have a poetic nature to appreciate it  and I've always had a hard time deciphering most poetry (sad to say).  Nothing really remains in my memory of the book except the suicide of Septimus.  I have read reviews that stretch back decades and understand that I am missing something monumental in writing, but for the life of me I was bored through most of it.  I have even bought a biography thru Amazon of her life to try and maybe appreciate the book and her writing more, but, in the words of another reviewer listed on amazon, she is just not my "cup of tea".  But, again, I recognize that she was a very innovative writer and will try another of her books, maybe I'll understand another better than this one. I'm not a pulp fiction/romance novel/trash reader at all, am very well read in fact, so I'm disappointed in myself for not getting what she was getting at.  Still, I encourage everyone to read the book, if for no other reason than to congragulate yourself on getting through it 
 If you are looking for a Catholic Bible, this is not the one for you.  This Bible does not include the Deuterocanonicals/Apocrypha 
 The daughter of a prominent Boston doctor is dead, apparently from a botched abortion (which was illegal in the late 60's).  Dr. John Berry's friend, Art Lee, is in jail for the crime, which he says he didn't commit.  So, Dr. Berry sets out to prove his friend's innocence, and runs into cover-ups and lots of secrets.  But there are many doubts, such as was the girl really pregnant, and did Dr. Lee actually perform the surgery, and why is Dr. Berry so interested in finding the culprit?  For Michael Crichton's first novel, it's not bad, but nowhere near as good as some later ones.  The plot is marginally interesting, but it was hard to keep characters straight and the dialog didn't sound very natural.  Dr. Berry (who just takes the whole work week off to investigate) talks more like a cheesy "private eye" than a doctor.  Also annoying was the use of footnotes and endnotes to explain various medical terms and concepts - nice to know but annoying to look up 
 Somehow, I thought I remembered most of the Dr. Seuss stories being interesting animations from the 1960s, when I was a child. However, I now realize that only a few proper animations were created (like The Grinch Who Stole Christmas). This DVD is an overpriced, underproduced waste of time. It is merely the illustrations from the books brought to life - poorly. The movements are jerky and silly, the voiceovers are embarassing, and it captures my 3 year old twins imagination about as much as a blank screen. They LOVE the equivalent books, and we read them constantly. They are NOT interested in these amateurish renderings (which at times look like cut and paste silliness like Terry Gilliam of Monty Python fame). If a three year old can tell the difference, then you will too. Even though the animation is limited, in the "Ken Burns" style or worse, the DVD compression is lousy with tons of visible artifacts all over the images. Do yourself and your kids a favor and buy the real books. Random House and Sony Wonder - whose logos introduce these productions - should be ashamed to market such inferior nonsense 
 I agree with Mr. Lentini. If you want to learn something about fuzzy logic - look for some other book. This is actually a booklet that only characterizes Fuzzy Logic in a very childish manner. The translator is an utter ignorant: Leibnitz is called "Ripunitz" and Aristole is "Alistoter" or something like that (probably following the Japanese transcription...). Even 1 cent is a waste for it 
 Michael Moriarity is my hero! He is just one of the coolest actors in my opinion. He has done such great B-movies as this, Q, and It's Alive 3: Island of the Alive. How awesome is he?? Anyways, I think that this movie was hilarious! I think a lot of people take this movie too seriously, thinking that it is going to be your typical movie. But you shouldn't because not only is this a B-movie, but IT IS supposed to be funny. My favorite part is when "the stuff" started bubbeling out of the ground and that old hick guy just starts eating it. Who would do that?? I just started laughing by butt off when that happened. So if you watch this movie, just sit back and enjoy it for what it's worth, don't be too critical on it. What I learned from The Stuff: Dairy products are evil! Especially if they come from with in the earth! If you like The Stuff, I recommend: Watching other B-movies, such as Island of the Alive 3, Zombi 3 and 4, etc 
 Compact design but cheap materials. A vital piece of plastic came off when I set it down on the bedstand. Another exhibit in the "you get what you pay for" sweepstakes. I threw it away 
 After reading so many positive reviews, I decided to try Skeleton Man as my first Hillerman novel.  Unfortunately, I'm about 100 pages into it and have decided to give up on it.    I read a lot of novels and have never really had a problem with this before, but I find Hillerman's writing style to be very choppy and awkward.  I find I have to re-read sentences to catch the meaning because it just doesn't flow smoothly.     Here's an example of one paragraph that I opened to randomly:  "Getting this ceremonial procession from Tuve's village on Second Mesa to the canyon rim and them to the riverbank involved describing several more stops for prayers and offerings, the placing of painted feathers in the proper places with the proper songs, and putting prayer sticks where the proper spirits traditionally visited.  By the time Tuve had brought them to the Hopi shrine at the tribe's cliff-bottom salt deposits, Joanna Craig had looked at her watch three times that Chee had noticed.  Navajo fashion, he hadn't glanced at his own.  Tuve would finish when he finished."  It's like he talks in short cuts that you're expected to follow. When I'm reading this book, my mind is wandering all over the place because the text doesn't draw me in.  I'm glad he has a lot of fans out there, but I'm not one of them 
 sublime is an all around good band with great soul and inspirations, but this album is more like a sign of what was to come for the boys. sadly, i think they would have been way too alternative mainstream if brad would have lived...alongside bands like red hot chili peppers and 311 for eternity...my advice is to stick with Iron Maiden. very random of a recommendation, but youll be surprsied how some bands just fall apart compared to others...but if you really want some reggae So-Cal punk, get 40 oz to freedom and Robbin the Hood 
 This is the work of an amateur.  Mr. Vachon is able to build a world, but as far as finding a story and weaving his way into and out of it?  Forget about it.  It's as if he had one idea (which is basically "hey, we're all in finance!  but we're all so debauched and weary yet excitedly aware of reality tv!  whee!") and then went from there without developing three-dimensional characters or plot or pretty much anything of substance.    
 Cute premise, but...this book just doesn't do it for me. I have been holding this book in my Amazon cart for a few weeks, waiting until I placed a large Christmas order. I'm glad I read short bits of this book in the bookstore before ordering it. The storyline is not entertaining in my opinion. Also, holidays such as Valentine's Day and Halloween are mentioned. My family and I do not celebrate Halloween, so this is another downfall of the book 
 Although Roizen and Oz have a great premise here for loosing weight what they have to present gets lost in the presentation.  The book is full of idiotic quips that are redundant, serve no purpose to the book, are a distraction to the overall message of the book and at times were rather degrading.  While the quips are at first funny, 30 pages into the book it gets to be rather tiredsome.  And the diagrams and cartoons in the book didn't add to it at all.  The diagrams belonged more in an elementary school science book than in a book whose target audience is suppose to be adults.  The cartoons, like the quips, just got tiresome.  I was inspired to go out and buy this book after seeing the YOU ON A DIET show on TV.  I honestly thought the docs had something useful here.  Unfortunately I was only able to make it half way through this book before having my "fill" of it.  As the diet was in the last part of the book I didn't quite make it that far and at this point I just don't have the stomach to open this book again.    As I mentioned before I do believe that Roizen and Oz have a good premise here however I just found this book to be too full of silly foolishness to be taken seriously as a diet book.  I am glad to see that it has worked for others, I just wish these two had presented their material better as I was totally ready to give their ideas a SERIOUS try - unfortunately I just don't think they were serious enough about their ideas for me to try them.  I don't recommend this book to any serious dieter.  If you want serious motivation, a common sense plan and someone who will talk to you like the adult you are then I suggest any of Bob Green's books - a very enjoyable read from which I gained enough motivation to lose 50 pounds!!  Having reached a plateau that I am having a difficult time breaking I thought something new and different might be worth a shot.  You On A Diet was definitely not new or different, it was boring and degrading 
 This book claims to want to show the 'nuance' of the sex trade, so therefore it must use complicated words such as 'debt bondage' to in fact describe what is an inhuman situation where people are threatened with death and beaten and raped in order to be forced to sell thier bodies to pay off a non-existent death.  Essay after essay encouraged prostitution as 'sex work' and claims that if only all prostitution were legal there would be no sex-slave trade in young girls and no forced prostitution.  This is strange becuase in the Netherlands, where prostitution is legal, it turns out there is just as much sex-slavery and beatings and rape.  This book also tries to claim all the talk against prostitution and the sex slave trade is 'racist'.  But how it is racist when Thai girls are sent to 'work' in Japan and Russian girls sent to Saudi Arabia and Columbian girls to Spain is not clear.  It is racist in the sense that rich Europeans, Arabs and Japanese are the buyers, but that is not what the authors wrote.  As typical of anything that is examined by academia this text has to dry all things down so nothing is ever what it seems.  A woman who is raped at the age of 11 by wealthy 'clients' and kept chained to a bed for five years until she gets AIDS, this is called 'western sensationalism' and in addition is described as 'sex work' and 'debt bondage'.   It is too bad that none of the authors of any of the essays experienced sex work first hand as one of trafficked people.  Seth J. Frantzman     
 I own and have read all of JA Jance's JP Beaumont and Joanna Brady mysteries and eagerly look forward to the next episodes in these character's lives.  I picked this book up, thinking it would be on par with all the JA Jance books I've read previously.  What a crashing disappointment.  I can't care about stereotypical characters in unbelievable situations - truth be told, I kept looking at the cover to see if I'd picked up a Harlequin by mistake.  I'll probably read more Ali Reynolds books if this is indeed a new series, but I'd much rather see what happens with JP and Joanna - incidentally, I didn't think much of either of them, either, when their paths crossed some books ago.  This one gets a big "Aw, c'mon, JA, you can do much better than this!" from me.  For those who haven't read previous books and happened to have the bad luck to pick this one up as your first JAJ, get the JP Beaumonts and start at the beginning.  They are worth the time and effort 
 I am extremely disapointed that the recipes in this book are not vegetarian.I recommend this book to no one.   Buy Mollie Katzen's excellent cookbooks The Moosewood Cookbook, Still Life With Menu, and Vegetable Heaven instead 
 An hour and a half of beautiful men prancing around wearing very little can never be less than watchable, but aside from the nudity and homoerotic horseplay, there isn't much else. Granted, there are a few nicely filmed poignant moments, but it's often dull 
 Tedeschi's voice has matured and become more expressive over the years, but she should either finally, belatedly, get some lead chops together or abandon her ego and hire on a player that matches the obviously prodigious abilities of the band backing her up. 
 Ok theres only like 4 good songs on this cd: Megalomanic, Pistola, Sick Sad Little World and Zee Deevel. The rest of the songs are slow and void of interest, theres nothing that really takes off. Its a slow and more mainstreamed approach to rock. I love the other two incubus cds i have: Make Yourself and Morning View but this one just doesnt sit right with me. If you like the other two cds you may not like this, You have been warned but if you like soft jazz rock which never really lifts off the ground and feel like sleeping bring your pillow and a cd player and this cd and drift off to sleep. BTW (The look on your face after reading this review was 'PRICELESS' 
 This book is a real disappointment.For one thing,though it contains a whole lot of information and many recipes the presentation is very poor ,cluttered and not easily palatable. Also as a christian,I am distessed by the fact that some recipes contain the use of blood as an ingredient in spite of God's clear command to man not to consume blood. The book is clearly not worth having in your food library 
 One of the blurbs I read on the book jacket compared this book to Into Thin Air and The Perfect Storm. No way!. Those two books were edge-of-your-seat reading experiences. This account of a kayaking expedition is just plain boring. The action doesn't start until about halfway or more into the book and even then, the cliched writing and deification of Balf's subjects make this book very hard to get through. Unless you are a serious kayaking fan, I would not recommend this book 
 I get the story line but 5 grown women need to suicide!?  The one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night.  Why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself!?!?  It is not matching the character 
 It just astonished me as how certain discursive formations can actually lead people to believe as the 'real' reality. It does not matter whether for an event to 'really happen' or not. What matters is that you hear it on a radio or read it on a newspaper or website or even talk about it at the water-cooler. Those who have had the chance to watch 'Wag the Dog' might get the idea of how such 'reality' is constructed.  On a more advanced level 'discursivity', a la Foucault, is a building block of a discourse in which certain linkages, here and their, add to what ordinary people believe on the street.  Now obviously Hitler was one of the worst things that happened during the 20th century. This is commonsense. But to add certain 'material' so as to advance another claim by building upon Hitler, is something that should be carefully approached, at least for people who at least visit and read stuff through Amazon. If a chain in a series of discursive formations can be shown to be weak or invalid than it would be proven that that chain of a discourse is on shaky grounds, and that most of what is known about it is likely to be false. Unfortunately we see certain 'material' is attached to certain claims so as to resemble the Holocaust. Let us revisit a single claim on part of those would like to exploit the events during the early 20th century. A reviewer, for instance, obviously bought one claim and thus knows it to be the 'truth'  Adolf Hitler: "Who, after all, speaks today of the annihilation of the Armenians?"  Now has anybody bothered to investigate it. No, of course. "It sounds like as if it is true, so why not believe it". Well fortunately there are still people who like investigating such stuff. Read for example : Heath W. Lowry Washington, D.C. Political Communication and Persuasion, Volume 3, Number 2 (1985) Abstract This article traces the history of a purported Adolf Hitler quote which cites the perecent of the world's lack of reaction to the fate of Armenians during the First World War as a justification for his planned extermination of European Jewry in the course of the Second World War. By a detailed examination of the genesis of this quotation the author demonstrates that there is no historical basis for attributing such a statement to Hitler... [...] If one is serious about really getting into history, rather than believing simply what is out their in the popular press, I would additionally suggest to take a tour of the documents of Ambassador Morgenthau. First let us not take any word for having a Godly truth 'Its ambassador so its gotta be true' mentality is ok if you're ok with it (respect of thought). But there are historical evidence that suggests that Morgenthau did not even know Ottoman scripture, and that this is proved throughout his letters when he attempts to translate 'words' and 'dates' of events. Do not hesitate to read... [...]   For those who have CAREFULLY read what I have written so far, notice I am not either on one side of the argument between Armenian historians or historians of the Ottoman empire, but that I have just thrown out some thought provoking information so that one will at least ask some questions before believing what they read. Doubtless there will be those occasional pointless replies to this review, but again all I am saying is, think before you react. Now one could argue that I am saying is a postmodernist crituque and historical relativism. That would be false. I believe in historical analysis, as a scientific enterprise (and only the scientific version of it). But then again let us not forget that some American historians who were studying the case at hand were bombed by Armenians. Now if history is written by historians and that some historians (i.e. UCLA professor Stanford Shaw)are bullied so as not to investigate certain historical matters than, at least if you have a capacity to think critically than be suspicious about it. [...] By the way absolutely nothing is mentioned about the equal ammount of civilian Turks that were slaugthered by Russian backed Armenian militia. Nor anything about the terrorism campaign of Armenians during the 1970's that left thousands of people dead and wounded. To say "denying genocide is a wrong thing" is one thing. But in doing so if one is denying the death of tens of thousands of innocent Turks, is called hypocrism and puts one in ethically shaky grounds.    The latest British governemeents acceptance that the "blue book", which Armenian claims are based upon, have been declared by the government itself to be a WW1 time propaganda material. Yes you heard it right!  Here's another eye opener: Often the claim is made there 1 million Armenians were murdered. What they do not say that the same material they indicate that a "genocide" happened says that  the ENTIRE Armenian population in the Ottoman Empire was 800 thousand (200 thousand difference!) MOREOVER Keep in mind that the Armenian diaspora, that builds its own desire to have a national identity, has a population of more than 9 million people across the world. HOW CAN this be??? Well thats how nationalism is formed: impossibile numbers, man on white horse, the evil "other" etc.... So this "genocide" attitude is more of identity building rather than real history.   Well I hope I contributed on an intellectual level and I hope 'thought thugs' would not misunderstand what I have suggested. 
 I have all the old LPs but had lost track of Pink Floyd since "The Wall". What a mistake to purchase this crap. The division bell is even worse. The singing is less than pleasant, forced and strained from a worn out rocker. The music is a jarbled New Age sounding studio mix of repetitive beats. Water's was correct when he said Pink Floyd was a spent creative force. If there is a message in the album or a theme its obscured by clouds of senseless notes and endless whaling guitar riffs. I think Gilmour wanted some retirement money and kicked out the last two PF albums to grow old on easy street. Or he followed the path of Sid Barret and slid off the deep end. 
 I am the assistant director of a preschool and the school purchased two of these tents for our Thanksgiving Center.  They have been awful from day one - They do not stay together - The material rips very easy.  BIG waste of our money.  We purchased them over the summer and just got them out of the box the 1st of November - cannot return them because of the 30 day refund policy!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! 
 I had always liked this movie.  Any time it was on, I would watch it because I enjoyed the music and because, despite the bad acting, it still had a really good story.  Until...  Until I turned back to traditional Judaism in my 30's.  This movie sends a CLEAR message to a Jew - "Lighten up and enjoy the secular world.  It ain't so bad."  I grew to hate the fact that Olivier's character (as Diamond's father) strove against Diamond's desires to forego his Jewish identity in search of a temporal pop dream.  And Diamond wins!    When a movie champions secular idealogies removing a Jew from his roots and assimilating him into secular society, it can't help but make a traditional Jew very very sad... 
 It is not often that I review a genuinely bad book, but this is one such rare occasion. It so happens that log analysis has been my primary area of focus for the last several years and thus I could not have missed a book titled "Security Log Management."   Yuck! The book starts from a hodge-podge of examples, which, if entertaining at times, doesn't lead to any meaningful lessons and thus doesn't deliver the value it could have produced. The same applies to material selection for the book, which, as a result, suffers from a compete lack of logical structure. Even the Ch 1 "Log Analysis: Overall Issues" barely touched on analyzing logs and clearly didn't cover any "overall issues."  Also, authors have undoubtedly trademarked the concept of a random irrelevant picture or graph...  In addition, the book reveals many areas where authors are deeply befuddled. ESM chapter (`Enterprise Security Management') is one such example, where such confusion reigns supreme.  They can talk about `ESM process' and claim that `ESM is not a tool' in one sentence and then describe `ESM tools' in the next one. On top of that, if you are looking for some arcane security humor, try understanding their ROI calculation in the chapter (`Cost of problem' + `Cost of solution' ...)  One would think that they can get something as (relatively) simple as firewall reporting right (chapter 3). One would think that - and one would be wrong...  The reader is still left with no answers to questions such as `what summaries, statistics and reports he/she should collect and how to do it'  As far as style is concerned, the book carries unfortunate signs of being written by a group of authors who didn't talk to each other much. Furthermore, what adds insult to injury is truly excessive amount of quoted source code, which plainly doesn't belong in the book, but on the website, CD, etc (were editors asleep at the wheel?)   To conclude, the book does have some relationship to patterns and chaos: the patterns in your brain will immediately turn into chaos after you are done reading it, provided you would even finish it.  My suggestion is to avoid this largely useless title and save the money for better books (such as Bejtlich's or countless others).   Dr Anton Chuvakin, GCIA, GCIH, GCFA (http://www.chuvakin.org)  is a recognized security expert and book author. A frequent conference speaker, he also represents the company at various security meetings and standard organizations. He is an author of a book "Security Warrior" and a contributor to "Know Your Enemy II", "Information Security Management Handbook" and the upcoming "Hacker's Challenge 3".  Anton also published numerous papers on a broad range of security subjects, such as incident response, intrusion detection, honeypots and log analysis. In his spare time he maintains his security portal http://www.info-secure.org  and two blogs. 
 do not buy this.  the steamer stops working in a month and it cannot be fixed.  cleaning doesn't help at all, even after carefully following the instructions.  very cheap, no good 
 I regret that I cannot recommend this book because it contains easily caught errors.    I suppose that misinformation in the text is not so important.  Still, on p. 21 the book claims that "Every bird has a scientific name consisting of two Greek or Latin words."  The author of this book, Prof. M. Udvardy, was a respected ornithologist who would never make such a mistake, so either it happened in the revision by J. Farrand or is due to an ignorant copy editor.  Much, much worse is the misidentification of photos, which of course is the heart of this field guide.  For example, photo #172 purports to be a Pacific Loon in winter plumage, but as any birder worth his/her salt can see, this is clearly a Common Loon.  Likewise, photo #175 is labeled Common Loon, and the bird shown is clearly not of this species.  A field guide should be 100% accurate in species identifications and also not promulgate misinformation about scientific nomenclature.  With many alternatives on the market, this is a book not to buy.  --Jack P. Hailman (Fellow, American Ornithologists' Union and President, Florida Ornithological Society) 
 It's World War I. There's death and dispair and darkness everywhere and yet amidst all the anguish, there comes the tale of two lovers and their sad struggle to live a complete life. It's the daring anti-war classic from the late great Ernest Hemmingway- A Farewell to Arms!  Sounds pretty promising, huh? Let's see how it REALLY is.  First things first, the Lovers- Fred Henry is an American in the Italian army. He begins the story feeling rather mildly about the war and life in general until he accidentally falls in love and things begin to change. He is a totally self-absorbed, unsympathetic dick. He narrates the story and yet somehow we get little insight into any of his deeper emotions or motives. I literally hated him by the end. Catherine Barkley is a beautiful English nurse who Henry falls for. She's still healing from her last lovers death when she meets him. At first she seems like she might turn out to be at least somewhat intresting, but the hope vanishes everytime she opens her mouth. She is  shallow, moronic, ridiculous, and one of the most unrealistic and dislikable females characters I've ever read. Henry, however, falls desperately in love with her and her thick head of blond hair.  Next we have the plot- As you know, it's WWI. Things aren't going so well. Henry mets Catherine. Henry gets injured and falls in love with Catherine. They spend almost all their time remarking how "sweet" and "fine" the other is and reassuring eachother they're really in love. Then they have some sex and Catherine gets pregnant. Henry cares somewhat. He's then forced to go back to war, however, but not before Catherine tells him she feels like a whore when he takes her to a hotel. This is the only intresting thing she ever says but she quickly retracts the statement as to not upset dear, darling Henry. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Henry deserts the army. This is one of the few exciting parts. Unfortunately, though, Henry soon goes back to Catherine. This is where is book takes a turn for the worst. The lovers breifly share happiness until Catherine has her baby, the baby dies and at last Catherine dies. Tragic.   My Opinion- The book is dull. When Catherine died I was just glad the book was over. The prose in this novel is some of the most boring and terse I've ever read. The dialouge is some of the most irriating. Between Henry's emotionless "Yes", "No"s, and "All right"s and Catherine's pointless, opinionless chatter, I'm not sure how anyone could be grabbed or moved in the slightest. Neither character had much going for them and I couldn't care less about their miserable fates. Hemmingway could have turned this into something so much better if only he gave his readers some likeable people who we could love and relate to. I don't know about the rest of you, but I thought his was the biggest waste of an idea ever. Cheers 
 I read the first few paragraphs, and quickly realized Mr. Baigent likes to makes outlandish claims.    Napoleon died in 1821.  60 to 100 years after that is 1921 not 2000.  But yet he makes the claim that we can compare the date of the writing of the scriptures to the date Napoleon lived and the present day.    This is patently absurd.  I decided to stop reading such a book.  If his first argument is so ridiculous, what should we expect from the rest of his book?    I returned this book of fabrications.  
 I bought I and II of this released Wolf's Rain because when I first read the reviews one of the reviewers claimed there was an alternate ending.  I am SOOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed because now that I have the second part there is no alternate ending and I now see that that review has been deleted. I think Amazon handled this whole thing very poorly.  We depend on what they provide to help us make our buying choices 
  I'm a betta hobbist and I know about all the misconceptions that betta can live in just about anything and it is bogus. This "aquarium" is way too small, betta require atleast one gallon of water and that needs to be cleaned 1-2x weekly atleast. This is probably 1/2 gallon or less meaning you either clean it every day, t hus stressing your betta out and killing it or let is die a slow death from ammonia burns and other ills. This also has no lighting leave betta looking dull and boring, no heating or ability to heat so your house must stay warm where your betta is and it just isn't good. You can also buy large Critter Carriers (2-3 gallons) for the same price or less, it wouldn't be great, but it'd be a heck of a lot better 
 You guessed it: It's the same leftist b.s. we were all taught in school. Please, I'm yawning already.. 
 Just took ours to Goodwill - kids played with it once or twice - not nearly as fun as advertised 
 Except for "Till You Love Me" (which even though is a good song is still overdone), the rest of this album is really, really bad.  The worst two songs on here are "I Wouldn't Wanna Be You" and "I Won't Stand In Line".  Her big hits "THe Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" (which is a pop song through and through and "And Still" an o.k. ballad but nothing to compare with "For My Broken Heart" or "You Really Better Love Me After This" (her crowning performance in my opinion from her Behind the Scene album on Mercury)are on here but they aren't worth the time.  If you like pop rhythms and sounds, this is the album for you!!  If you want straight ahead country you'd better look somewhere else.  
 This movie has absolutely the worst plot. The not so erotic sex scenes do not help out at all  either. Only once do you see the hairs on one of the girls bodies. This movie can definetly be passed and you wil not regret  watching it. Get Lolida 2000 instea 
 On the rear side of the box it clearly says that this DVD includes Spanish and French language in Mono format. It isn't true, doesn't have other language than "3" English tracks! The film is in B&W also. Don't tell me that there isn't technology to translate this in color and make it available in other languages! The film is good anyway 
 Usefull information is the only + point I can give you after studying this handbook as a course requirement. I do not know what the writer is thinking or who he thinks he is talking too. If you are lucky you can concentrate enough for one page at the time, shame there are as much as 600 pages... 
 This cartridge does NOT fit my HP 648c as advertised. The color cartridge that accompanied it did, however 
 There is no reason to wait any longer for a better transfer of this classic.  There was a Japanese laserdisc release fifteen years ago from a pristine film source; the intertitles were in Russian and Japanese (an interesting combination since the events of the film took place during the Russian-Japanese War of 1905).  The opening sequence of water rushing over a diversionary dam, and of the sailors on their cots, is simply astoundingly better than any transfer we have seen released in America on any format.  If the rumor is true of a 2004 digital remastering, we have waited three years too long for a quality DVD release.  A film this great needs to be seen in the best transfer for its reputation to be understood by all.  Eisenstein directed the details, and the better the transfer the more details will be seen.  None of current DVD transfers are at all acceptable 
 I do not solder so this book was not very helpful. If you can solder this book is excellent. I do wirework but with soldering required for most of the chains I have to return the book 
 My daughter loves the sticker maker but she used the cartridge in one day and still has plenty of stickers left to make and I can not find the refills anywhere.  They need to make the refills for these types of toys easier to get.  I am to hesitant to buy the bead maker now because of that and I know my daughter would like it but It's a waste if it's a one time use and upsets my daughter 
 Having lost faith and taken a skeptical approach to religion I was hopeful that this book would lead me into rethink.  No way! Tired and inaccurate, not a waste of time though as I found myself constanly jumping up with "That's not true." "What a jump!" and that's a downright fabrication! 
 While I liked parts of this book very much, it needed editing.  The sequence near the end in Venice was pure agony and I came ever so close to giving up.  However, having read so many pages it seemed a shame not to finish the book.  While the last few chapters helped to redeem the book, all in all the book disappointed, including the apparent tee off for a second volume.  Assuming there is a sequel, I'm not likely to purchase it 
 Not exactly the "vaults" blowing open, as stated in the promo.  These are mostly leftovers and one-offs from the late 1990s, when the group was on hiatus from serious recording.  That's why the set is overloaded with forgettable jingles from television shows, literary journals and graphic design firms.  Whats good is the material that was recorded for albums and subsequently rejected, such as "Reprehensible", "Rest Awhile" and "Certain People I Could Name".  But there are too few of these real songs, and they'd have fit a lot better on that long-awaited b-sides collection from their major label career 
 I found this book collecting dust on a bookshelf at a friend's house.  I asked my friend if she'd read it and she said, "Not yet, but it's a Patterson, so it must be good..."  Wrong-er words were never spoken.  This is the first Patterson novel I have read.  I am glad that I borrowed it from someone rather than bought it myself.  I suggest that if you insist on reading this, than you would be wise to do the same.  Let me just say that I don't enjoy giving bad reviews, but this is perhaps one of the most poorly written novels I have ever read.  I feel compelled to warn others so they can be spared the disappointment I experienced.  Maybe because it was "co-written" by this Gross person, but it just seems that this book was written too quickly, with the characters and the plot as a mere afterthought.    I kept reading, hoping that the story would get better, but it siimply did not.  When one of the characters was in mortal danger, I found myself thinking "who cares?"  This boring read has an utterly predicitable love-story woven throughout, and again, it seems pointless and cheesy.  One reviewer put it best by saying that this book is more like an outline of a story rather than a comprehensive novel.    The plot twists are predictable and uninteresting, and you sort of want to root for the bad guys because the main characters are soooo boring and flat.  The sentence structure is so elementary that I was surprised that this was written by an accomplished author and not a sixth grade English student.  I am by no means a "book snob" but I cannot believe that someone would review this book with a 4 or 5 star rating.  It is just beyond me.  If you are looking at the writing alone, it is terrible, not to mention the unbelievable events that take place.  Main character Boxer is always in the right place at the right time and everything comes together so neatly that you just cannot believe any of the events could possibly take place.  I know that a lot of die-hard Patterson fans will probably give me bad ratings just because I didn't like this book, but I am trying to be as honest as possible.    Maybe some of his earlier works are better?  Well, I guess they couldn't be a whole lot worse in any case 
 A sequel? There really is a Satan.   Meyer has proven to be one of the most annoying and somnambulistic of writers. I had to laugh when I saw her brilliant new plot outline involves the ever nilhistic and dull Bella making time with wherewolves for another eternity of pages. I suppose in book three Bella will finally give up the big prize and "go all the way" with a zombie, which is pretty much all that will be left of Meyer's fan base.   Honestly the woman's purile writing induces narcolepsy! What really concerns me is the apparent inability of reader's to recognize the difference between a good book and a real stinker.  Meyer is still a big P.U. in literature 
 This book makes saltwater aquariums seem easier than they actually are. For one, I don't even think the book mentions the use of reverse osmosis or deionized water, which is strongly recommended by all marine aquarists. The author also doesn't mention the importance of live rock. In fact, he goes as far to advise against using live rock for fish-only tanks! Sure, you might be able to get away with not using live rock, but it won't be worth it in the long run. Also, I don't agree with the list of recommended filter combinations. One more thing, the book lists an air stone as essential equipment, but the only thing an air stone will do is aid evaporation and cause salt creep! If you have enough movement of water at the surface, you should get sufficient gas exchange. There is, however, one thing the book does get right: its strong recommendation of using a protein skimmer.  This book is easy to understand, but you won't be getting the best information 
 Turn of the century continues to serve a most useful purpose, months after I gave up on it. I have a door that rattles if it's not wedged open and T-o-C is just big enough and heavy enough to do the job on its own. I struggled, oh how I struggled to try and even begin to understand some of the characters. I stirred the pages wildly while I waited for the plot to thicken. I fought against closing eyelids while the book became heavier and heavier. I searched my abridged guide to good grammar to see if I had missed a couple of chapters explaining that sentences after all don't need a subject, a verb and an object - or even a permutation of two out of three. I left it on the front doorstep hoping somebody would steal it. I offered it to my  neighbor so he could jack up his car. I considered lighting the fire with it. I wondered whether, if I took just a few pages a day, I could eat it and get rid of the evidence. I offered it to my mother-in-law for Christmas. I took it scuba diving with me instead of a weight belt. And then, eventually, voila! The rattling door! What a fine tome T-o-C is. Another few hundred pages [...] and I could have used it as a sea anchor for the Titanic 
 Too bad I bought this book before discovering the author works for the Washington Post. She can't say three sentences in the book without bashing the President.  I doubt the First Lady had anything to do with this lousy piece of trash.  I wish I could get my money back 
 This a good subject and I have much respect for the men who served in the Merchant Marine.  But this is a badly written book. I'm sorry to have to say it, but it's true 
  Junger revises his story in the final chapter inducing the reader to believe Smith is innocent and DeSalvo, although there is not one shred of evidence against him, is the probable culprit. After writing earlier that the Goldberg family lived over a mile away from the Jungers, we are told that Bessie Goldberg was the lady who lived down the street.  When the crime is first described Junger tells us that Roy Smith lied to the authorities concerning the time he left the Goldberg home.  In the last chapter Junger tells us that Roy Smith never lied to the police. Junger describes Smith as a career criminal who spent many years in prison including one 6 year term in Sing after his conviction for attempting to shoot a woman in the head at point blank range. In the final chapter Smith is canonized as a saint who according to Smith's nephew (who has never met Smith) would never kill a white woman.   Where are the interviews with the prosecutors and the defense attorney who have spoken on television about this book?  It would have been interesting to hear the from a surviving jury member. Alan Dershowitz said when interviewed on NBC Nightly News regarding this book, "Journalism essentially lets the facts speak for themselves.  This case has a thumb or maybe another finger or two on the scale of how it presents the facts."  
 As most other reviews stated, this book is easy to read, and it provides a detailed description of the events throughout the Croatian and Bosnian War (1990-1995) This book is supplemented by the highly popular BBC series - "Death of Yugoslavia," which is perhaps the most-known documentary on the war. The documentary follows the book quiet closely, with an inherent strength of BBC reports having interviews to most of the major players - Milosevic, Tudjman, Stambolic, Izanbegovic, and others (most of which are in jail or dead now anyways).  Nonetheless, this book has a strong anti-Serb thesis, which, I suppose, it needs in order to be conclusive. In other words, if there are no good guys and bad guys, the Laura Silber would create an incomplete work. But for someone who wants to get a good insight of the war in Balkans, it cannot be looked through the lenses of "black and white," as this book tries to convey.  It is important for readers to know that the accounts of the war are carefully selected and edited in the anti-Serb fashion. For example, the ethnic cleansing atrocities, when described in detail, are almost always pertaining to the Serbs. But when it comes to the Croats and the Muslims, the book overlooks their actions during the war. In addition, the book provides little evidence of the involvement of the bigger powers - EU and USA.  For example, early chapters go into great depth talking about the pointless shelling of Dubrovnik, talking about Montenegrins peasants getting their "revenge" to fulfill their jealousies against the prominent Croatian population of Ragusa. But when it talks about Operation Storm - the single biggest even of ethnic cleansing during the entire war, undertaken by Croatian Forces will full military, logistical, and financial support from the US, it does not go into any depth at all. It is dismissed as "Krajina Serbs" got what they deserved. The Krajina Serbs did not "occupy" that part of Croatia - they lived there for hundreds of years.   When dealing with international involvement, it goes to great length to disapprove Srebrenica, while Operation Storm is supported by the West. Perhaps US and EU had other motivations in this conflict? What about the arming of Croats and Bosnia throughout before the war in the old SFRJ (which was then illegal)  In addition to a one-sided view, it fails to address other major issues, such as economic disparities. Invoking economics, it justifies Croatia's and Slovenia's promising economic position before the disintegration, nevertheless, it mentions to compare facts. Slovenia and Croatia assumed a high level of industry due to the fact they had cheap natural resources that mostly came from Serbia and Kosovo. In addition, the economic status of Serbia is taken under consideration with Kosovo - even though Kosovo, not Serbia, is the most impoverished region in former Yugoslavia. The fact that Kosovo Albanian's have been boycotting the federal institutions since early 1980s - not paying taxes, utilities, and other duties since the death of Tito had something to do with this idea.  While I do not discourage people from reading this book, I only state that Laura Silber (et al) provides a narrow-minded, opinionated, and sensationally journalistic view of the breakup of former Yugoslavia.   If anyone is interested in truly learning about this conflict, more resources are necessary. 
 I can't imagine why anyone would want a book filled with gruesome images- what purpose does it serve? I thought the film was very poor overall, totally missing the point, (assuming you believe that Christ was who he said he was, (that should be IS) and actually lived and died on a cross) I didn't think it was antisemetic per sec. Almost certainly it's not historically accurate but like some other reviewer has commented, a horror story, in Gibson's inimitable style. I can't imagine that Jesus was flogged to such a degree- he was nothing special to the Romans, just another regular execution. I thought the whole point of the story is the ending, which was glossed over very quickly- maybe not spectacular and violent enough for Mr Gibson.It was well filmed in a dark atmospheric way, but I didn't see the point of it being in Arabic. The film didn't move me atall. It should have done 
 Just finished this book what a dissappointment. Dialog, Dialog, Dialog...no action no plot no idea what this strange little rant of a book is about. Thank goodness there is no test 
 Though I don't agree with some other reviewers who believe that narrators or main characters need to have redeeming qualities to be interesting or engaging (read the short story "Rock Springs" by Richard Ford), I found Chippering to be just plain annoying. His voice was too silly to keep reading for 384 pages. Maybe it's funny the first time he tells us something that obviously isn't true, but after 300 references to how attractive he is to women when the women he's with clearly despise him, the story gets to be a bit trite. Had this book been a little shorter, maybe it wouldn't have been so bad. I don't know, though, because I never got to the end - and I'm usually the kind that can't leave a book unfinished.  The most interesting part of the story is one which is left almost completely untouched. I kept wanting to read more about Chippering's betrayal of his Green Beret buddies and what they were going to do to him, but after 280 pages of the same nonsense with Lorna Sue and Mrs. Robert Kooshof, I gave up. Okay, maybe Tim O'Brien has been type-cast as a Vietnam writer - but really his best work revolves around the war. Hopefully (ha ha) he can break out of this label, but if he keeps writing GOOD fiction about the war instead of this garbage, I'll be happy 
 My 2 year old already has the items on the puzzle pieces memorized after seeing them only 3 times.  Our version did not include the "5 ways to play" as stated on the box.  (I've requested a copy from Briarpatch.)  My 4 year old - who received the gift - lost interest after the first time he played.  Both of my boys LOVE the "I Spy" and "Can You See What I See" books.  This game just wasn't challenging enough for them 
 This book is terrible.  It misses steps, and makes you do stuff that you would never do in the real world, and the stuff you do in the real word it leaves out. For people who know how to use AutoCad it is more confessusing.  Recommendation Do not buy, there are better books out there 
 there is a handful of writers in the genre of fantasy who actually know what they are doing; creating their own history rather than dabbling in things that can only be described as monstruous fanfiction. sara douglass, however, is neither a good fantasy writer or a dabbler in fanfiction - she's a typist. there is no other excuse for the existence of this series; someome must have seen her at a computer and assumed that she was an author and accidentally given her a book contract - for this is literature at its absolute lowest.  1. random capitalization of names and places and races does not make a book stronger - in fact, it makes it look like it's been written by a mad monkey.  2. the popularization of a traditional hero/anti-hero has been done to exhaustion. the hero/anti-hero in this case is so boring and full of himself that one wishes he'll just jump off a cliff and die already.  3. problematizing a trivial love story into oblivion is NOT a good idea; half of the time the reader will have absolutely no idea of what the author is getting at, and the rest of the time will be spent in annoyance at the trivialities.  this is not literature; it's TYPING, and it is not even good typing. a bland, uninteresting character will not catch my attention by a double-capitalization (StarMan? StarDrifter? TypingAuthorWomanWithComputer?) that most of the time looks like the typist's hands were sliding all over the keyboard. this story is bland, unoriginal, boring and sometimes infuriatingly presumptuous. no reader likes to be treated as a child, yet it is exactly with such an attitude that the author takes on her quite ridiculously thin story.   stay away - or better yet, go read george r r martin. this is not worth your time 
 It's not a bad book but nothing really stands out about it either. It has a lot of information on J.K with quotes, background, and a bit of a biography. I did learn some new information about her but most of it is already known; single mother, thought of Harry Potter on a train, wrote in a caf.   Books 1-5 and the first three movies are covered with reviews and general information. A detailed cast and credits are listed for the movies. This book has a lot of reviews and quotes from editors and publishers, it gets overwhelming at times.  The book also contains 70 or so black and white drawings from artist Tim Kirk. I didn't care much for them but they added to the book with the theme of wizards, creatures, and magic.  They adorn each new section not unlike the Potter books illustration at a new chapter.  One useful thing is the "concordance" (list) of people places and things in the Potter universe. It's about 80 pages long and was what I bought the book for initially. Although the info is good, there is information available on the web for free and is much more detailed and easy to navigate. The sites (The Leaky Cauldron, Mugglenet, and the Harry Potter Lexicon) are even mentioned in the web sites section of the book.  There are also some omissions and errors. When he first starts to go over the books all the the entries have an "about the book" section except for Prisoner of Azkaban. Some of the entries for this section are a page or more long, it seems odd to leave this one out.  Other errors have to do with names like the Dursley's in Egypt when it should be Weasley's, Uncle Dudley, things of that nature. Not terrible errors but still annoying.  There are 27 color glossy pictures in the middle of the book. Most are of filming locations, a couple of the books, some of JK, one of Dan Radcliffe, and the rest are of owls. It was nice but I would of liked to see more.    Overall this book was ok. I learned some new things but most of it was basic stuff and a lot of quotes and reviews. Its a bit long at close to 400 pages so children may tire of it quite quickly. I would not recommend this book. Vast amounts of information are available online and the amount quotes and reviews make this a tough read 
 This is perhaps the worst book I have ever read. It was the most useless, horrible story ever. It highlights the worst in teenagers, makes the main character nothing but a one dimensional stereotype, and makes all the other characters one dimensional sterotypes. There is no depth to anything, there is no resolution, there is no attachment to any characters. I did not emphatize with the main character, I wanted to smack her! Don't waste your time!!!! 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 Rabbit Proof Fence was a slow going book; you had to really have the will to continue reading. The first 50 pages consisted of Doris Pilkington describing the history of Western Australia in the late 1800's/early 1900's. It was slightly confusing since she skipped between different tribes and places, all of which are in a completely different language- sometimes full sentences would be in an aboriginal dialect. She then followed a couple of young girls. It finally started to get interesting and worthwhile. But then, instead of the book reaching the climax and enthralling you, it loses it. I got completely bored for the last 75 pages; it seemed as though it was the same thing happening over and over. The ending also seemed quite rushed, as though she had to fit it in a certain number of pages. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you are obsessed with Australian history or know how to read many confusing aboriginal languages. 
 I got this lens in a kit with a Nikon D80 camera.  This lens failed to deliver the goods 99% of the time.  Why buy an expensive camera and then use a cheap lens like this?  Its silly to spend big money on the camera and have only blurry pictures to show from it.  It was only tolerable in very bright situations and using less than 100mm focal length.  A cloudly day or all of the 200 mm zoom would result in a picture that had significant distortion noticeable even on little 4x6 prints.  Very few pictures came out when it was used in the fullest zoom (200mm).  I disliked this lens enough to return the entire camera kit and purchase a different camera (D200) that came with the highly ranked 18-200 VR lens from Nikon.    If your interested in nice sharp pics, then pass on this lens.  If you want to save a few bucks and like blurry photos, this lens is for you.. 
 [the two stars here are for the audiobook only. I give the book six stars.  I loved the book. Best book I've read in years. Couldn't put it down.  But the audiobook is dismal. The voice artists are amateurish, their speech clumsy and unnatural. It's as though they're reading from a script that they haven't rehearsed and they don't know how to get "in character". The attempts at foreign accents are overdone and painful to listen to.  (I love listening to audiobooks and radioplays. I listen to many hours of BBC World Service every day. I know what foreign accents sound like. Not like these).  I strongly recommend that you find a preview of this audiobook before buying it, to see if you'll dislike it as much as I do. Or buy the book instead. Heck, buy five copies of the book like I did and give them to your friends. Awesome book 
 Terrible writting,This was the first time i bought a book written by mr Cahill.I recommend renting his book if you want to sample his writting but he is very hard to follow with stories that never seem to go anywhere.The book is compose of many short stories and I would have to say that less then 40% of the stories are worth reading 
 Purchased three of these drives for a special project where we had to have three copies of large amount of data. Cleanly unmounting the drive in Windows would render the data unreadable next time the disk was mounted on ALL THREE DRIVES and on any Mac, Windows or Linux PC. chkdsk repaired one disk once. Thereafter, the only way to get at this data was using OnTrack software to recover it to a different drive. We bought three LaCie 1 TB "Big Disk" triple interface drives and returned the WDs. The LaCie's work flawlessly. AVOID these WD drives at all costs - at least until they figure out whatever is wrong with their chipset firmware 
 This book falls into the classification of most French Revolution books that I have read. It loses focus in the complexity of the revolution and gets bogged down in way to much detail. Even if you know a lot about the revolution the analysis is too much and distracts from whatever his overall point is which was lost by about page 20.  I had a hard time getting through it and if I had not needed to read it for class I would have stopped after the first 50 pages. Try the French Revolution and the Ancien Regime by Collins for a much better look at the French Revolution.  
 I read up to chapter twenty (about 300 pages) and stopped reading the book, realizing I had more important things to read.  My major complaints are (1) that there is too much discussion of the Mozart family finances, which I'm sure would be fascinating to economists and accountants, however tedious to someone concerned about music; and (2) too much retroactive Freudian analysis of the subject, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  Think about this:  Solomon uses an obsolete, and now debunked, system of psychoanalysis to describe a subject that cannot be interviewed.  The best discussion of music is concerning the Salzburg serenade style in chapter eight.  Other than that brief section (pp. 125-133), I was not impressed.  Short of reading Mozart's letters and making your own analysis, I recommend Stanley Sadie's "Mozart: The Early Years, 1756-1781" for starters.    
 I am embarassed to admit that I saw this video several years ago; I give it 2 stars.  I suppose the film quality is excellent, but in my opinion, a waste of film to make this.  The plot is forgettable, and, at the risk of offending those who like it, "I spent two hours out of my life watching this, and can't get them back again for something constructive. 
 The writing is good from a technical standpoint (I don't have to jump literary hurdles to get through a paragraph because the words flow very well).  The idea is a good one too.  What I can't get past is the character Robert Langdon.  Langdon is supposed to be a sharp academic but he seems to lack foresight in his cogitations and things always dawn on him at the last second.  Another thing I have trouble with is Dan Brown's knack for slowing the pace of the story.  Things will be running strong for a moment and then the author tries just a little too much to build suspense.  The problem is the reader already knows where the particular scene is headed and this attempt to build up for a critical moment leaves me wanting to skip ahead to the payoff.  Like playing fetch with a dog, you can only tease him for so long before he loses interest, especially when the dog has a pretty good idea where the ball will land after it's finally tossed.    This book is an easy read but I think it is a bit over-rated.  
 This book advertises that it contains information about embedded Visual Basic.  Like, only 1% of the book is about eVB.  All the examples and code is for embedded C++, which is fine if that's what you are looking for.  The author even acknowledges in the text of the book that discussion about eVB will not be covered, so why does the book say that it talks about eVB?  I bought this book and wasted my money.  Buyer Beware 
 Sorry, I just cannot believe that the "humorous" and "honest" approaches recommended in this book will work. It all seems very idealistic, flaky and undignified. I value honesty (and humor too!) but there is also something to be said for modesty and decorum. I would find someone using these strategies very off-putting -- the words "sense of entitlement" come to mind. And I am not conservative. So what would a conservative employer think 
 I have bought two dust busters in three years.  They do work great for small things like lint and hair, etc.  However at some point within a year maybe a year and a half with little usage (a couple of times a week for a couple of minutes at the most) it will not charge anymore.  You do get what you pay for and I will be buying from another manufacturer 
 Ok I have to tell you, about a year ago I was looking forward to playing a show with this supposedly garage rock group from Denmark, who had been hyped continually.  The album may be good, don't know as I haven't heard it, but they put on one of the most boring live shows I've ever seen, the only standout being a cover song.   Big let down and basically a hipster joke, best part was watching four guys in beatle boots trying to carry a 3oo pound hammond down a set of stairs into the room where the club held their shows.  Honestly I wasn't impressed at all....  
 It's a shame, I wonder sometimes how some no talented singers like Rickie Lee Jones managed to even sing somewhere and have a record company sign them. She's awful, no voice at all. I rated 1 star only because 0 star is not available on the scale.    
 I found this book to be offensively un-American.  The characters accuse our country and our government of all sorts of nefarious acts.  The best spy thriller fiction is based on fictional characters and actions in a world not totally removed from reality not an agenda of false premises.  I think the author is the real conspiracy theorist not the characters. 
 While the 18 recipes in this cookbook (yes, you read correctly, 18) do represent traditional Greek cooking well, most of the recipes would be difficult for a young cook to make without adult supervision and assistance.  Traditional favorites such as baklava, spanikopita and stuffed grape leaves are included among the recipes.  The beginning of the book has cultural information about Greece and safe cooking tips.  This book would be helpful for a school project about Greece, but it is disappointingly short 
 If it were possible to give this book a lower rating I would have.  To start, the title is misleading.  A more appropriate name would have been "Paul The Hedonist Hermit" since there were so many scenes of Paul fornicating and going off on his own for years at a time.  Or another good title would have been "Insight On How Misguided Christians Can Be On How Authority To Preach The Gospel of Jesus Christ Is Attained".    I was amazed at how unenlighted and uninspired this author was about the doctrines of priesthood order and the authority to administer gospel ordinances.  In addition he doesn't even attempt to footnote which characters are really from the New Testament, nor does he attempt to help the reader understand which details of his story are facts drawn from the New Testament and which are his own artistic creations.  The only good things I got out of reading this book were a better understanding of why certain varieties of Christians think their ministers have the authority to be ministers, and an assurance from the Holy Spirit that this author's Paul is a very warped version of the real apostle Paul from the New Testament.    
 Saw this on the box last night. I sat through the whole thing just to see if it would improve - it didn't. I kept wondering whether this was a radio play that someone had decided to film. The dialogue is wooden, the plot is pathetic, the whole set-up is unconvincing. It looks like something the actors did in a couple of days due to contractual obligations of some sort or maybe to cash in on the whole "Vegas" craze - which ranges from CSI to "The Cooler". (Incidentally, "The Cooler" is another one to avoid.)  I would give this zero stars if I could 
 400 plus pages of droning detail and a limp ending.  Remove the excess and make it a short story and you've really got something here.  By the time I reached the end of the book, the only character I cared about was the dog 
 The description gives the impression that the material is made of hard rubber and that it can protect you ipod in "rugged" conditions. In reality it is made from very thin flimsy rubber. I suppose will protect you nano from scratches and other cosmetic damage, but it will not porvide any protection from drops or other rough handling 
 Zackheim's style is certainly readable, but her conclusions leave something to be desired.  She provides the reader with too much irrelevant or misleading detail and too many of her own strong opinions.  I also found  her explanation of Lieserl's ultimate fate to be unconvincing.  To her  credit, she has told a story that should be known, and provided a number of  wonderful photos. In my opinion, two of the photos depict an extremely  plausible candidate for an adult Lieserl 
 This would be a nice printer.  If only I could get it to print!  Not to mention when I turn it on it makes a god awful sound like some thing is jammed.  I've tried over and over to try to print something.  I've checked my options, turned it on and off and still it sits there not printing.  If your looking for a portible printer you have other options and I suggest using them 
 If you rather bypass lackluster comedies along the line of Adam Sandler's "Water Boy" and Chris Farley's "Almost Heroes," then do not waste your time watching "Rocketman."   "Rocketman" has comedian Harland Williams as Fred Randall who can land a NASA team on planet Mars. Randall does not appear as your typical rocket scientist. His personality resembles Dennis the Menace, always poking his nose in places he does not belong. We are expected to laugh at this misbehavior, but the tasteless humor is nothing we haven't seen before and the outcome of every incident is easily predictable. Except for one scene when clumsy Randall loses the American flag down in a canyon. He then pulls out his USA boxer shorts to mark the territory that carryover live on national television.   The site of Mars looks adequate to its dull counterpart. Only sand occupies the orange planet. In contrast, it'd have been interesting had Mars inhabit alien life form shown in "Ghosts of Mars" or "Total Recall."    William Sadler as commander Overbeck is more like Randall's baby sitter. Every stupid question Randall has to say gets turned down. It's not funny when a grown man imitates a child by saying, "Are we there yet?" They never get along with each other-Overbeck takes NASA seriously whereas Randall is a complete nutcase.   Jessica Lundy as Julie Ford is surely adorn by male hormones. Her wholehearted blue eyes and fireball red hair unquestionably makes her the real star in this comedy, although the chimpanzee came close at second.   Not a memorable comedy for adults to watch. Children should enjoy the outdated comedy because to them its humor will be fresh.                
 'Gin' Sanders gives some good advice in this book but there is also alot of fluff and just plain nonsense about why one should eat healthy. For instance she continually writes about how certain foods and ways of eating are 'tacky'. While that may be true, real data on the health benefits of the French diet is probably more helpful than being judgemental. I would recommend Clower's The Fat Fallacy over this. 
 I bought this pan and to my suprise I had to assemble the handles on the skillet and the lid.  The handles on the skillet were not bad at all but the lid....   Anyway, after I got it assembled, wash, and dried per the instruction manual I plugged it in a began cooking.  It was amazing-my chicken came out beautiful!  Two days later I was cooking and the thing went out on me!  It became cool to the touch. I left it alone for a while thinking maybe I did something wrong-but I was already cooking at a low temperature.  It did not come back on when I replugged it in.  Hence I had to give it back.  I was so disappointed.  I am just glad it did not happen while cooking the feast I had planned for the following week.  Save your mone 
 Bought this at Target, returned it the next day.  Not even close to the quality of B&D T-R-O's from even a few years ago.  Summed up in one word, 'cheesy' is the appropriate descriptor 
 this is entertainment? Wow, exactly how much of your brain has been damaged by fat 
 Long ago, a friend who raved about "The Invisibles" loaned me this first book. I don't have very clear memories of it, but I remembered it as being very hard to read, and I remember not getting very far in it before I lost interest.  Recently, due specifically to the influence of Warren Ellis's awesome series "Planetary", I've gotten interested in comics again, and decided to give "The Invisibles" a second try. I got a little further this time, but still didn't even make it past the first volume.  The story seems promising; "Big Brother is Watching, So Make Yourself Invisible". The eponymous team are a gang of reality-bending Crowley-style sorcerors, fighting the mundane system of everyday life, and the sinister otherworldly monsters who control the mundane system of everyday life. The execution, however, is less than ideal. MOST of the pages are very jarringly non-sequential; on one page, the characters will be in a park, listening in on a conversation, and then on the next page, where you expect to find a continuation of the conversation they were listening to, they'll suddenly be walking along a riverbank, in the middle of their own completely different and unrelated conversation. On almost every single page I had to turn back, and check the page numbering to make sure I hadn't accidentally skipped something or pages hadn't fallen out of the book; if it weren't for the sequential page numbering, I would have assumed I was reading a bad printing. This could be a clever technique if used sparingly; in a comic book about "hacking reality", throwing in a sudden and unexpected "jump cut" between two pages can contribute greatly to the reader's immersion in the "reality hacking", but when it's done on every other page it loses that hook and just feels sloppy, like the author and artist didn't know how to structure a comic.  One of the "page cuts" jumps from the beginnings of a fairly realistic fight scene to a super-bright, psychedelic scene in which a character is tripping out and talking to the ghost of John Lennon, which looks like a completely different comic, has completely different pacing and artwork, and is FILLED with meaningless text, which brings us to my next problem with "The Invisibles": there's WAY too much meaningless text. If you want to present a radical, reality-altering concept in your comic, that's great; try to do it with action as much as possible and with as few words as possible -- this is a visual medium, after all. If you need to throw in a few wordy bits, that's OK too ("Planetary", again, does a perfect job of this). If, however, you are filling ENTIRE PAGES with text so small that you have to go below standard comic font size and it becomes illegible, then you might want to re-think your medium and perhaps just write a book, or a really wordy animation, instead. It was after the third ENTIRE page of nothing but hard-to-read, handwritten, meaningless text that I gave up on "The Invisibles". And by "meaningless" I don't mean "fluff dialogue that pertains to the action" or "cryptic dialogue that might make sense later", I mean actually meaningless, gigantic word-bubbles of insane characters singing entire songs and babbling incoherently about things that have nothing to do with the plot, or meaningless stream of consciousness droning from characters who are tripping. All of this text feels like nothing but filler, and coupled with the jarring transitions between pages it makes "The Invisibles" look like VERY amateur work.  One last niggling detail is that I couldn't really identify with any of the characters. The main character, a teenage boy named "Dane", is basically a carbon-copy of Alex from "A Clockwork Orange", but without the interest in Beethoven. He wanders around London with his monosyllable-named "droogs", indiscriminately stealing cars, smashing windows, beating people up, and blowing up buildings. It's suggested that he's very smart, but this doesn't make him any more likeable. The "hook" is that he "sees dead people", which might've been clever when this series was first printed, but after "The 6th Sense", "Bleach", and a dozen other stories with "I see dead people" protagonists, it just seems clich√Ø¬ø¬Ωd.  I really wanted to get the same sort of "reality warping" experience out of "The Invisibles" that some of my friends have, but I've seen it done better a dozen times before, and the whole execution just seems amateur. When I stopped reading it, I was hungry for some REAL reality warping, so I sat down and read some stories out of the collected fictions of Jorge Luis Borges and felt MUCH better. I suggest you skip "The Invisibles" and do the same.  Addendum: The friend who last loaned it to me told me that the first two story arcs were, indeed, horrible, but that it got significantly better after them. I tried reading it again, skipping over those first two story arcs and starting from the third, and it was indeed a much better read, and nothing was lost in having not read that first part. So, I'm upgrading my review to "a fun read overall, but not something I'd be interested in owning" 
 Profiles In Courage  By: John F. Kennedy  Intorduced by: Caroline Kennedy   Forworded by: Robert F. Kennedy  	Profiles in Courage I think is about courage in battle along with politics, and J.F.K. helps  us realize that. Profiles in courage is an autobiography written by J.F.K. he talks about some of   his what I thought were inspirations. They were senators in which J.F.K. told their stories. I   wanted to read this memoir because it seemed like an interesting political book. The important   events I thought were when J.F.K. talked about the senators who made a difference and who  didn't take no for an answer.  	I think these events were important to the author because the senators he talks about   seemed a lot like J.F.K. When the author talks about the senators he talks about quotes, policies,   and things that happened while they were in office. At the beginning of every chapter there's a   quote from the senator he'll be talking about. There's one part where J.F.K. talks about the   meaning of courage and talks about courage in battle and courage in the assembly.  	The author also talks about the bad parts of courage, for example when he's talking about   WWII he brings up the fact we lost more than 300,000 troops and 300,000,000,000 in expenses.  I think the title profiles in courage means, that when you look at courage you see all these   different profiles of people who exhibited great courage like Audie Murphy or Rosa Parks.  	    	I think J.F.K. had a lot of courage because of his brother talks about J.F.K.'s days on a   PT Boat during WWII when it's attacked by the Japanese J.F.K. goes in the line of fire to save a   severely burned comrad. J.F.K. showed courage in politics and war. When J.F.K. pretty much   stopped WWIII from happening with Russia or when he saved his boat crew member. J.F.K. had   a very good political set up. When he refused to give the order for air support in the Bay Of Pigs   operation a lot of people might have died in the army but it prevented a nuclear war.  	I don't think J.F.K. could've learned anything about himself, but that's just what I think.   He might have been inspired by some of the political actions his "idols" did. I didn't really like   this book becuase i didn't get some of the politics. I wouldn't reccomend this book to people   who don't like politics or don't like books that aren't actiony. I didnt't like this book one bit   even though it's about one of my favorite political heroes.  
 I love Linda Howard, but I didn't even finish reading this book because it was so boring and annoying!  The heroine was a whiny martyr--she drove me crazy!  And where was the suspense?  I truly can't believe that people liked this book!  If you want to read a good Linda Howard book, read "Mr. Perfect" or "Dying to Please" 
 Fortunately, it has been a long time since I read anything this sappy, sophomoric and/or senseless.  Frankly, I'm amazed this series was published.  Adriana Trigiani is a harlequin romance writer at best (i.e. fabio visits the farm), and it's unlikely she'll ever produce literature of quality.  I left this book in a Portland coffee shop (on purpose), and it was still there when I returned two weeks later!  Go figure, eh? 
 This book went right off tangent, after the brilliant writing that started the series.  The side-story is pretty bland, doesn't provide insight so much as it rewrites the backstory, and the overall plot isn't expanded, it sounds like he mostly ran out of ideas and started to drag his other books into the story. 
 I bought the same wok from bed bath and beyond. After only 1-2 times, the non-sticky coat started peeling and eventually came off completely. Unless you plan to do very simple stir-flying, I won't recommend this wok 
 Mr. Winn can bash Islam all he wants. The truth of the matter is if someone is really seeking god and truly wants to work ship him alone, he will not see a better way then Islam. Islam was sent for not just those Arabs, Islam is sent for all of mankind. Its funny how Winn talks about Islam wants money, sex, and power. In reality, Prophet Muhammad (May peace be upon him) use to tell the people, live this life as you were a traveler. He (S.A.W) used to convey the people to travel light so that it will be easier for you on the day of Judgment. He (S.A.W) didn't know how to read or write, so the Quran has to come from Jibreel to Muhammad (S.A.W). The prayer was one of the things God actually told Muhammad directly face to face.

 This book is very hard to read. It is also inaccurate and hard to follow. I want to get a refund on this book 
 I think Cheryl Jarvis needs to get a grip on reality! What kind of wife wants to take a 3 month sabbatical from her husband and family to find herself? People like her need to wake up and remember the commitment she made to her husband and children! Life can be hard sometimes, and can take us all on a ride we don't like or in the wrong direction. Women like these need to realize that they have made other commitments now and have to stick with them! Her children come to her and ask her not to leave...... doesn't that right there give her the clue that maybe her dreams and goals have changed and being a wife/ mother is what she is now! This is why you see divorces at like 60% now because no one wants work at a marriage anymore, when it gets too hard they just pick up and leave! I don't like the message this book is giving and don't recommend it to anyone! You have problems with your life, talk it out with your husband. Don't read a book from a person who doesn't know the first thing about marriage! What ever happen to talking things out 
 I cannot review an item I did not receive,I ordered the cd at a certain price and was later refunded my money as IMPORTCD said they had stated the wrong price for this cd was this a mistake or what? 
 This film has been re-released as "Meltdown."  There are a few reasons for watching this movie: 1) Jet Li.  2) Chingmy Yau (the reporter).  3) Wu Ma (Frankie's dad)  4) a decent fight scene at the end.  Jacky Cheung is also not as aggravating as usual.   That's it.  Jet Li has appeared in three or four films directed by Wong Jing, and, just as Chow Yun Fat does in God of Gamblers and Jackie Chan does in City Hunter, he does what he can.  The direction of the film, however (as well as GOG and CH), stinks.  The plot copies Die Hard and Speed, with some broad satire aimed at Jackie Chan, but that is not the problem.  Put simply, Jackie Chan knows how to direct a film.  Wong Jing does not.  If you want to see Jet Li, go see Fist of Legend, Once Upon A Time in China, or just about anything else he has done.  If you want to see a good Hong Kong action movie, watch films directed by John Woo, Ringo Lam, Tsui Hark, Jackie Chan, and Sammo Hung.  Jet Li is fun to watch, but go watch everything else he has done before you get to this 
 The manufacturer could have easily glued the seams outside the envelope but the way they designed these Burlington envelopes scratches the cds as you slide them in and out. A poorly conceived product 
 There certainly are many ways in which maternity care in the USA could be improved.  But this author's recommendations are not among them.  Even an open-minded person is put off by a great deal of plain old misinformation in this book.  For example, an epidural does not (as claimed in the book) involve sticking a needle in the spinal cord - YOUCH!  Nor do women who have epidurals have more back pain afterwards than women who do not have epidurals.  Because it's the pregnancy stupid!  The book winds up being a colossal straw man.  Maybe someone else will write a truthful book incorporating factual information, rational analyses and sensible suggestions for improvement 
 I just saw this toy in Parents Magazine Sunday night and was so excited to see it on sale at Target this week. I ran to get it since my [...] son is too short to use his hand-me-down red tricycle. It looked like lots of fun in the picture, however, my son is too big for it! I don't know why it states that it is suitable for up to 3 years old- no way! If it were adjustable, I'm sure he would have loved it, but just like another reviewer stated- it's just like the other ride-on toys we already own. Currently, the Scuttle Bug is in the trunk ready to be returned to the store. How disappointing 
 I expected this book to be about PARENTING an only child per its title and was disappointed. Susan Newman did touch on some important issues such as teaching sharing and respectfulness and avoiding loneliness, although there wasn't a lot of meat to the chapters on these subjects. She also discussed being careful not to have excessive expectations of an only child, which I found interesting. However, a great deal of this book was devoted to justifying the decision to have an only child. If you're struggling with your family planning choices and would like someone to tell you repeatedly you're doing the right thing, you may enjoy this book. At this point, I don't need justification, I need information on addressing relevant issues so that I can be the best possible parent to my child. I also do not need reasons why my decision to have an only child is "superior" to the paths other families choose and was a little disturbed by the author's tone. Bottom line: this book effectively identifies some concerns of parents of only children, but I will be looking elsewhere for more substantial parenting support 
 When it comes to cheap productions, this awful little mess should rank near the top of the (garbage) heap.  Script, acting, and production values are nil, and it appears that the whole thing was shot with a home video camera; however, it is far less entertaining than the average home video.  It is an utterly pointless waste of time and money, and should be marketed only as a cure for insomnia.  When compared with the bozos who made this film, Ed Wood looks like Cecil B. DeMille, and that is a notable accomplishment indeed.  The size of the budget does not determine the quality of the film; however, when coupled with a dull and pointless script, sleepwalking actors, and the incredible ineptitude of the writer/director, the low budget doesn't exactly recommend it.  Admirers of this film are certainly welcome to it; those of us who are evidently not as intellectually gifted can live without it.  The debate over this film is rather like the story, "The Emperor's New Clothes", in that those who look hard enough for something will generally see it, whether it exists or not.  This sorry mess isn't worth the pomposity and arrogance with which some persons choose to approach it.  Personally, I find this film to be an abject waste, so number me among the numbskulls.      
 well, i asked my vietnamese friends their opinions...they said the language was not accurate.  but the choice of terms was humerous 
 I purchased this AGP to run 3d software occasionally and not really for games. I updated the BIOS, DirectX, and video drivers before installing the card and loading it's support software. The manual was a general manual that wasn't specific to my card. It recommend exiting hardware wizard and running the ATI install. The amount of software that was installed was overwhelming and unnecessary. All you need is Catalyist and the drivers. Not file player, ALL-IN-ONE-WONDER, REMOTE-WONDER, Multimedia Library, unless you plan to watch TV on the PC. (I don't). The card has no fan but a large heat sink. I have a Sempron 3100+ with 1 GB ram, additional cooling fans and 300 Watts. With all that the system was shutting down from overheating. I lessen the resolution and refresh rate to no avail. The card showed rich cooler and the built in 3d configuration, pc check and screen savers worked with no problem. But just doing web surfing, playing quicktime, running 3D screensaver causes overheating. No games. The video payback was choppy. My onboard video that came with the motherboard outperformed the card but can't run 3D. As a test, the card couldn't run even the most basic 3D game demo even in it's lowest detail settings. I returned the card after that. The overheating and shutdowns went away. It maybe a great card for larger systems but for budget system it's a performance killer. It has overheating issues. The support software did little to prevent system crashes. 
 Tried very hard to get through this book, but in the end gave up.  Don't need a paragraph to describe a blade of grass.  Put me to sleep 
 This is one book that I would not recommend to anyone.  The author had so many character and so much detail that I could not even get past page 55.  All the characters in the book seem to have nothing to do with each other  and it got to the point that I did not even want to try to read the book  anymore 
 This tie winder is not only twice the size I was expecting, but it doesn't work.  After one attempted use, the lid no longer stays on.  I would have returned it if the return shipping didn't cost more than the item 
 At a lecture at West Point United States Military Academy April 6, 2006, Naom Chomsky argued, "Just war theory" literature "deserves special attention but is ultimately not very instructive about just war".  "Just war theory" is "declarations of personal preference", which "never tells you anything. It doesn't tell you when it is proper to intervene, what it tells you is 'I think it is proper to intervene'...there is a big gap between assertion and argument, between surmise and evidence."  "We learn very little about just war from 'Just war theory'" what we do learn is "mostly about the prevailing moral and intellectual climate in which we live." Walzer's book relies crucially on such premises as "Seems to me entirely justified, or I believe, or no doubt." Chomsky then discusses scientific studies on human behavior which is noticeably absent from Walzer's book.    Walzer uses the term "I think" at least 52 times in the book. "I don't think" 7 times. "I believe" twice, "no doubt" at least 41 times, and "seems to me" 12 times (I write "at least" because the same phrase twice on one page would be counted once.)   Walzer's hypocricy  In a book which suffers from terribly bad organization, on page 62 Walzer finally systematically lays out his arguments, stating that "Once the agressor state has been militarily repulsed, it can also be punished."  On December 29, 2005, in an interview on NPR Morning Edition ('Just and Unjust Wars' Author Critical on Iraq.) Walzer stated that the Iraq war was not a just war:  "If you are going to use military force in someone else's county...There has to be a cause of some urgency, a massacre in progress.  A massacre in memory is not a just cause."    Therefore, if you follow Walzer's assertions to its obvious conclusion, the Iraq war was not a just war and therefore "the agressor state", the US, should "be punished."  But Walzer signed and endorsed The Euston Manifesto, which states in part:  "We are also united in the view that, since the day on which this occurred, the proper concern of genuine liberals and members of the Left should have been the battle to put in place in Iraq a democratic political order and to rebuild the country's infrastructure...rather than picking through the rubble of the arguments over intervention."  Therefore in Just and unjust wars, Walzer argues that "agressor states" should be "punished" but yet Walzer signs a document which criticize those who "pick through the rubble of the arguments over intervention."  Although the Iraq War is not covered in this book, Walzer's inconsistent views on the Iraq war should give serious students of International affairs pause before subscribing to his arguments. It is one mans opinion, full of statments such as "Seems to me entirely justified" "I believe" or "no doubt."   Walzer's arguments are unscientific rablings of one intellectual which are "ultimately not very instructive about just war".      
 The graphics, illustrations and figures add no value to the book. They confuse the reader and distract their attention away from the authors points. I would not recommend reading this book unless the graphics were  removed 
 Dear Nerd,  How's your imaginary world doing? Any good blood-letting or disembowelments lately? Not too many, I hope. You'll run out of imaginary friends/enemies pretty soon if you don't ration yourself! I'd hate to see that happen.  But seriously though, how's losers anonymous going? Just because you were picked on in high school doesn't mean that you have to resort to spelling magic m-a-g-i-c-k, or just making up words to be clever. Especially since it isn't really clever at all.   What's that, you say? Witchcraft is real? Instead of writing that here, you should try saying it out loud. Go ahead. There you go, good girl. Sounds pretty stupid doesn't it? I mean, come on now, even the atheists have a better grasp on reality than you do. They at least use a cowardly sort of logic for their basis of self worship, but you've got, what, your lonely imagination and fairy tales?  Oh wow, get a load of the book description! "Approach with caution, you may open the gates of hell within!" Shouldn't that read, "Approach with caution, this book will prevent you from ever getting laid"? Swamp thing from last night's naked tree dance DOES NOT count.  The Bottom Line: If you're weak minded enough to actually buy into this childishness, then please, Harry Potter, go right ahead buy a copy. Otherwise, try finding a more constructive way resurrecting your self esteem. If you don't respect yourself, no one else will either.   Sincerely,     - Someone who prays you will not try to reproduce. 
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 I returned the book.  As I have a toaster over/rotisserie the book was not what I needed 
 Once you get this remote working -- which I found challenging, and I work with computers all day long -- you'll definitely like how it works and it's better than programming in codes. The biggest problem is the charging dock doesn't make a connection to the remote so you have to wiggle the remote or put a book on top of it to make sure it touches down on the charging contacts, which means it's usually dead when I go to pick it up. I've been on hold for over an hour to try to get them to help me with this issue once again which BOTH of my 880s have, and they're not even answering. Last time I called, they said many people were having the same problem and all I had to do was squeeze a rolled-up piece of paper behind the battery to force that connection. That solution hasn't worked. They're on to something, but I'd wait for a version where they've addresed this issue 
 This book was not actually written by "Larry the Cable Guy," but a gentleman named Dan Whitney.  Whitney is the human being who plays the character "Larry the Cable Guy" in concerts, movies, TV shows, CDs, and now this book.  What Dan Whitney really thinks about anything is up for conjecture, but he certainly knows what he wants people to think his character "Larry the Cable Guy" thinks.  In that way, this book succeeds marvelously, it makes fun of all the things Whitney has observed as making LTCG fans mad, and like president they all voted for, he tells them what something is and whether it is good, bad, or funny (i.e., jesus = good, fart = funny, being retarded = funny, not supporting the Bush administration = bad) and requires only confirmation by repetition of the catch phrase title of the book, and purchase of sundry items bearing the same inscription.  It is brilliantly targeted and presented for maximum cash-in value, with very little discussion and no thought involved at all.  It is the easiest thing in the world to be a  Larry fan because you don't even have to know what is funny, good, or bad, just wait for Larry to sum it up in the simplest little joke imaginable.   That is because he has calculated that if he talks in a thick southern accent (the origin of which is never revealed because it is an amalgam) people will think "wow, he really must be a down to earth fellow to unabashadly parade his hick background instead of trying to "unhickify" himself to reach a wider audience.  The unhickified Dan Whitney was boring and not funny, so he devised the Larry character to play on people who thought a brash, "honest" guy from the south was more funny.  It's a beautiful formula, and Larry is a gazillionaire as a result.    He may have paid  a few visits to a Waffle House to take notes, but you can be assured that establishment does not cater the spread on Dan Whitney's Gulfstream V.  So if you're wondering whether Larry sounds like he's from east Texas, western Louisiana, central Alabama, northeast Arkansas, Northen Florida, southern South Carolina, or smack dab in the middle of Georgia, don't labor too hard, he comes from Nebraska and the accent is fake.  Just like all the heartfelt nonsense in this book he is simply describing what he thinks the big fans of LTCG want to hear.  So if you want to be told what you want to hear by what is basically a cartoon character, instead of engaging in thought about a real human being, then welcome to the world of Larry The Cable Guy.  Just like Santa Claus, The Easter Bunny, and Jesus, he's not real.  Is that un-PC enough for you, Dan 
 THE GIRL IN THE CAFE starts out with promise, the promise being to be a sweet May-December love story. Bill Nighy is Lawrence, an aging bachelor working for the government as a financial expert who meets a lovely young girl (Kelly Macdonald) in a cafe during coffee break. Mr. Nighy does a nice acting turn as the twitchy, shy older man and Ms. MacDonald as does a fine job as the adorable if undistinguished girl in the cafe. It's an unlikely but possible match that progresses when Lawrence asks Gina to go to a high-level international conference with him in Iceland. It is at that point that THE GIRL IN THE CAFE stops being a romance and starts becomming a political movie. Gina suddenly loses her sweetness and becomes rude, pushing her leftist political agenda, which, by the way, hardly anyone in the movie disagrees with. They are just not going far enough for the politically correct Gina. Gina's political outbursts are an amazing show of disrespect for Lawrence, who invited her on the Iceland junket in the first place, as it puts him at odds with his boss, the target of Gina's political salvos. It was at this point, having been disappointed in not getting a sweet, May-December romance and instead a vehicle for leftist political views, I decided it wasn't worth it and turned the DVD off, the victim of a bait and switch. If you are a lefty, the girl in the cafe's rants will be music to your ears. If so, hang in there; the second half of the movie may be worth it to you. 
 Narcissistic hypocrytical douche bag. Comments on Bill Clinton's sexual escapades, but settles a sexual harassment suit out of court for 2 million dollars. Douche Bag 
 Once again, Sandra Lee is out to poison America with her high-sodium, preservative-laden recipes.  This book is a joke.  Under no circumstances should anyone who prefers not to die before the age of 45 should buy this.  Heart attack city!  Oh, and crappy food.  Did I mention how bad her recipes are?  Terrible.  The scourge must be stopped!  Whoot 
 		This is a book by a chronic kicker, someone who frequently cites Emile Zola but who has all the relevance of "a young contrarian" wallowing in what is otherwise known as the terrible twos.  	Don't get me wrong:  Hitchens is very self-important, his targets range from President Clinton to Mother Teresa, which earned him an interview with Vatican authorities in a "closed room, a Bible, a tape-recorder, a Monsignor, a Deacon and a Father."  He spent years attacking Clinton, and was finally thrilled when someone noted his piffle.  But, this molehill of courage doesn't write a word in this book about President Geoge Bush.  	He says it's courageous and vital to dissent.  Nice.  Welcome to an idea that has been celebrated since John Milton and the First Amendmant to the US Constitution.  To guard his own brilliance, he doesn't cite a single example of the how, when, where, why and what of anyone he's criticized.  His book is supposed to be "the art of mentoring," but he limits it to praise of his own courage, insight, wit and relevance.  	Granted, Hitchens is a rare talent;  his unique ability is being outrageous without being effective.  He doesn't cite a single example of his dissonance doing diddly squat.  He offers feel-good whines, moans and complaints, but nothing constructive.  It's why late-night TV talk show monologues are the epitome of today's political commentary, humour, satire and relevance.  	He consistently attacks political compromise, praising "fanatics and absolutists like John Brown, who regarded compromise as a disgrace."  So  --  was Abraham Lincoln a second-rate president compared to a John Brown?  This reflects the great weakness of this book:  Hitchens doesn't understand the difference between dissent and dissonance.  	There's a good reason why Hitchens is inconsequential compared to dissent such as Zola, Vaclav Havel and even Tom Lehrer  --  this rant is always safe, tame and respectable.  It's a perfect Hallowe'en gift, a fierce rubbery face meant to produce a shriek, a laugh and a comment, "Oh, how clever!"  It's great sport for the two-year-old mentality.  	"Most people, most of the time, prefer to seek approval or security," Hitchens writes.  This is his meagre attempt at respectability;  he does so by citing great dissenters and basking in their reflected courage, glory and relevance.  He falls far short of being a court jester, lacking the wit, wisdom, wiles and wariness to be relevant.  Sadly, but not unexpectedly, he misses the mark 
 This book, I attempted to approach with feelings of wanting answers and wanting to feel safe and secure in our often harsh, demanding, and very male world.  Unfortunately, I was unable to achieve those feelings of inner peace and turmoil dominated.  I was hoping for an Oprah meets Holly Near meets Dame Edma book that was refreshing, and would allow me to blossom inside.  Many of the passages make some sense, but the boardroom chapter may alienate some sisters due to the fact that most of us are struggling at jobs which are mundane and tedious.  It is so easy for men though, all they have to do is look around and they get what they want.  I am still looking for love and am tired of nights in the bubble bath, reading silly romance stories which reflect our harsh patriarchial society.  I am searching for a book with the answers the way some people claim to search for soulmates.  I am tired of the tv shows with loving couples and my cat which I am alergic to that scares all the men I know away.  I want a book that I can relate to...one that works on my own terms...one that speaks to me and the women like me.  Tell me if you find i 
 What a disappointment!  I ordered PASSIONATE HEARTS as a gift for  newlyweds and must return it to AMAZON because it is so weak.  A very few  good poems surrounded by many unimaginative, cliche-ridden, excusses for  poetry.  This book needed CPR from a editor who hears the vigorous  heartbeat and ecstacy of fine literature instead of the fragmentary  palpitations of 2nd-rate amateurs 
 Tiresome, repetitive sexual descriptions, no character development, unexplained events, no plot, very little humor.  Ten years ago, Hamilton was doing interesting work, exploring some moral issues, having some character development, and humor.  Now both the Blake and Gentry series are predicable and sex obsessed 
 Although the information in the book is detailed, more pictures are needed to give some idea how these trees and shrubs might actually enhance a garden. The photos contained in the book are sparse and are entirely in  black and white. Pictures in books? Generally not needed, but in a  gardening book, good graphics are essential 
 I was more upset with this book than anyother. I've loved every book in the series , but this one was more dissapointing.  I pictured EVERYTHING the sasme as in the movie though... thatrs just telling you how welll it's written and described. But, it was more about the Triwizard tournament the whole entire time. Still, i am addicted to the series . Either way you should read the story just to understand whats going on. I just wish it would have been more exciting and less predictable 
 The concert footage is great but the editing is terrible.   About half way through the show the sound goes waaaaay out of sync.  It is almost like they took decent quality bootleg footage with multiple cameras, and tried to sync the sound from the CD.  Its cool for the die hard Iced Earth fan to have the concert footage, but be aware that the production is not very good.  Most people should buy the CD instead 
 Many of my issues with this book were covered in another review. Most of the "plans" are really just a couple tracks. The diagrams aren't clear enough for a book on track planning (for a magazine writeup, maybe, for a book of plans for practical use, no). The plans are repetitive and derivative of each other. And, as previously noted, there is very little breadth of offering - over and over you see the same format of layout: for instance if you have any significant-size space but don't want a multi-deck layout, you're out of luck.  It's not 101 layouts, it's 101 variations on 2-4 basic ideas.. 
 I first became a fan of the Gorillaz with their excellent 2nd CD, Demon Days. The interesting thing about this band is that their music is so strange and so "out there" that when you first hear one of their CD's...it sounds like complete garbage. But once you listen again and again, you start to like it more and more. Eventually you end up really liking the CD.   That was the case with Demon Days. After enjoying that CD fully, I thought I should check out the first Gorillaz CD, and  I didn't like it all that much.   There just seems to be very little actual songs on the CD. Way too much of it sounds like complete filler. There were a couple throwaway songs on Demon Days, but most of the stuff on that CD was great. Here, we've got songs that are just...boring. Nothing happens. I was waiting for the melody or a cool tune to occur in some of these songs, but it never happens. You just listen to 2-D whining into the microphone with dull beats in the background. (Such as on songs like New Genious, Man Research, and Starshine.) Some songs are nothing but beats with no lyrics at all, sometimes sounding just like static noise. Songs like this, such as Double Bass, are cool for a minute or two, but the song drags on for practically 5 minutes. It gets boring. Other songs, like 5/4, M1 A1, and Rock the House are catchy at first, but just don't have staying power. They get old. 5/4 got annoying quickly, M1 A1 and Punk lost their appeal quickly, and Rock the House is another song that would have been better if they cut about 2 minutes out of it. And songs like Latin Simone are just annoying.   The remixes of 19-2000 and Clint Eastwood that end the CD are also fairly forgettable, although 19-2000's kind of catchy on the first couple listens.   There are some good songs here, though. Tomorrow Comes Today, Clint Eastwood, Gravity, 19-2000, and Left Hand Suzuki Method are cool songs. Slow Country's kind of cool, too. And Dracula's got an awesome, almost haunting sound to it, and it's really absorbing. Although it too, unfortuantely, loses its tune and turns to repetitive and aimless techno noise about half way through it. This small collection of good songs, though, is surrounded by a huge collection of filler tracks. Much of this CD just isn't really that good.  I don't know...this CD just seemed empty. Very few meaningful tracks, lots of filler, and some really annoying and repetitive songs. Some good songs were stretched to almost 5-minutes long, mostly given filler techno beats that ruin the songs. Clocking in at 72 minutes, (which makes it 22 minutes(!)longer than Demon Days) this CD was loaded with filler and just not enough good stuff. People interested in The Gorillaz should pick up their superior follow-up, Demon Days, instead of this one. If I listened to this debut CD first, I probably wouldn't have ended up liking this band very much. The good news about this is that the Gorillaz have not hit a sophmore slump; their CDs are getting better, not worse. That is a great sign for the future of this awesome band. 
 While it's clear Ms. Bender can write and write cleverly, it wasn't enough to hold my attention in this quirky collection.  I found myself waiting for the next oddity rather than the next revelation.  And, sadly, towards the end, I was just waiting for it to all be over.  I found this especially true in her novel, which was just a very very very long quirky short story.  I'm a little tired of quirky and clever, so forgive me if this review is too strident.  If quirky and clever is your thing, then by all means.   
 I was expecting a humorous juicy story about the goings-on of a Manhattan call girl but that's not what this book is about. Instead I got a tale of an engaged prostitute, Nancy, who isn't sure if she wants to get married and let go of her call girl life style.  Her future sister-in-law constantly pesters her about her wedding plans and she never says or does anything about it. She's also a district attorney who might be after Nancy. We never really know. Her future brother-in-law may or may not be having an affair with one of her escort friends. We never really know what happens with that relationship either. And the climax of the story happens when there are only five pages left in the book and as a result the plot resolution is really lame. Also this novel is supposed to read like a diary, but who puts detailed dialogue in their journal entries? 
 Stale, painfully obvious information from the so-called internet gurus. Full of "what-to-do" instead of the more useful "how-to-do" information. If you really must get this type of info, go to the authors' websites. It's just get rich on the internet by telling others how to get rich on the internet. For beginners in ecommerce, there's very little in the way of detailed step-by-step instructions. For people with more experience, there's nothing new here, just a compilation of articles with the author's website address at the end of each one where you can actually buy the information they're telling you about 
 This has to be one of the stupidest books I've ever read.  When I first picked it up, I thought it was a cat/humor type book.  Wrong.  These people actually dance with cats.  Talk about nutcases.  The pictures of the cats were cute but the people dancing about in weird costumes was a bit out there.  I adore cats just as much as the next cat lover but this book is a bit too much.  Now, if I could get my cat to dance.. 
 When I heard "Heaven" I rushed to purchase this CD. Take "Heaven" as a prelude to what this CD is-a bad (mostly) cover tunes album. "California Dreamin" is soo bad I could not get throught half of it. And the origional stuff is predictable, and boring. Besides, who needs the "Bonus" slow version or "Heaven" anyway. Save your money. Download "Heaven" for a mere 99 cents 
 This book should be entitled "The Obsessive-compulsive's Guide to Keeping House".  The lists of tasks to do daily, weekly and monthly were more than a little overwhelming. If you did all the things this book says you need to do to keep a clean, orderly home then you will have little time for anything else.  There are some good ideas in here, but they are overshadowed by the to-do checklists.  Also the pictures in this book are of rooms with a very sterile, minimalist look to them.  Boring.  The rooms are indeed clutter free and spotlessly clean, but lack character and warmth.  A little like living in a hospital. I was very disappointed with this book 
 Ugh....I never write Amazon reviews, but this book truly deserves a bad one.  I can't believe other ppl gave it such great reviews.  The characters are shallow and moronic to say the very least, Lizzy being one of the worst characters in the piece, and unfortunately the protagonist.  And I totally agree the use of "vereee" constantly got on my nerves, and so did all the brit slang used by these "Americans" (???).  I did not like one character in this book!  What a disappointment...I was looking fwd to a nice fun read. 
 There are some very thorough and well know WW II historians who use all the documents and interviews they can get their hands on, such as John Tolland.  It is laughable that this work of anti-American fiction created by the careful trimming of contradictory evidence should occupy the same section as works by Tolland and others.  The key to unravelling the problems with the thesis:  who did Japan send to look at the results of Hiroshima?  Dr. Nishina.  And who was Dr. Nishina?  Head of the Japanese atomic weapons project.  Were we the only ones in this race?  Certainly not.  Both Germany and Japan were hot on our heels and the Soviets not much further back than that.  The only reason we dropped it first was because we won the race, in the short term.  So there is no moral low ground for using the weapon.    This book also ignores Okinawa, the battle right next to the home islands only two months prior where the US endured horrendous losses.  It was on the basis of that battle that the figure of 1 million casualties was projected.  The basis of actual combat experience with the same kind of troops and local support we could only expect to get stiffer once the homeland was attacked on the ground.  This book does not examine the military situation involved at all while criticiizing what was essentially a military decision.  Do yourself a favor and read a real history book by a real historian, not a left wing diatribe by an anti-American trying to blame us for all the world's woes 
 Buss must love to hear himself talk.  This is overstating the obvious to the n'th degree.  How many ways can you say that murder is related to human evolution and animalistic instincts?     There, actually, I just re-wrote the whole book in one sentence.  Don't bother...there's a reason there are so many of these for sale used, and very cheap 
 I read the book when it was first published and then a friend had a son diagnosed with leukemia and went through the same thing as the Mom in the book. Fortunately he had a lot of advocates that pushed him to ignore the insurance company and his son finally found a donor match but it was too late. So I feared that this movie would not be up to the book. My fears were unfounded, the casting was brilliant and I loved this movie, even though it is tough to watch, I still catch it in reruns on the satellite occasionally and "must watch". That is how good it is 
 I just watched the recent Frontline about Tank Man, the man who bravely defied the line of tanks in Beijing, and went to Amazon to find books about the subject. Up came this book, among others, and I remember almost throwing it across the room over ten years ago when I read it. You have a guy who escaped, knew a few people involved, and whose only personal involvement is from the outside. He had no balls, and never dared risk himself. Sure, he knows the figureheads, the history, and can write about what happened as if was there. But he was hiding in his room, making himself out to be a hero. If you want to read a book with the only suspense being whether to finish it or not, then this is the one 
 After reading The Kite Runner, a story about friendship, loyalty during the adverse times in Afghanistan during the Taliban, I was looking for another read centered on these harsh times in Afghanistan.  The Swallows of Kabul was endorsed as book for those that enjoyed The Kite Runner however, disappointly, other than being set in Afghanistan the books similarities end there.    I appreciated the descriptions about life during the Taliban rule.  The author painted a vivid image on what it would have been like to walk down the street during these times.  You felt sympathic towards the two couples, eventually their lives intertwined but not how you would have expected them.  I was disappointed in the outcome of the story and was left with a feeling that the book was incomplete. 
 This book is really not useful.  The idea of "thinking" your way to happiness is interesting and imbues a connotation of a potentially introspective read.  Unfortunately, this book belies its title and focuses on not thinking.  Instead, it explains anything that makes you unhappy should be ignored and things that make you happy are OK.  Materialism is bad, but if shopping for expensive shoes is what makes you happy, go for it!  The author describes how you shouldn't be unhappy if you don't have everything you want, while in the same book detailing his extensive materialistic compilations of houses, etc.  This book is shallow and basically tells you everything is all right, just keep telling yourself everything is all right, everything is all right.  It is a superficial way to seduce happiness for a minute in your life.  The question of happiness is one that has confounded philosophers and thinkers - all humans - for centuries and to think a quickly read, 240 page book could allow you eternal happiness by "thinking" - as the author explains thinking - is preposterous. 
 I was offered this as an add-on to my order ... so I didn't see a picture of the cover ... this is VERY elaborate - not one or two sheet oragami (guess I thought all Oragami was 3D :)  50 plus pages of small papers to make these - then spray paint or seal them- they look like something out of the 50's, but not something you'd want to remember!!  I had intended this for my nephew but didn't have enough information to realize what it was all about.  May I just wasn't familiar with the whole 3D Oragami angle of things 
 This book isn't worthless, but it's not very good either.  Cabot encourages women to be positive, specific and proactive in their approach to men, which I appreciate.  She devotes a good portion of the book to the "love languages"--auditory, visual, and feeling.  This information, so long as it's not pushed to the extreme or used by a manipulator, is interesting and could help people in any sort of relationship.  However, ultimately, this is still a "man-hunting" book, with all that that phrase implies.  I think that Cabot's approach requires a bit of tunnel vision, a bit of obsession about men, and a lot of manipulation.  Take what you can from it, but I think that Sherry Argov's Why Men Love [...]is a better investment 
 I found the book heavy-going. Points are hammered home and I could not help wishing the book were much shorter. I do not think I as a reader would have lost much if there had been less detail. 
 When I first bought this book, I was very hopeful. The book seemed to cover a lot of relevant material, in a concise fashion. When I tried to read it however, I found it a little bit too much on the concise side. I have read very complicated books with a lot of math before, and I could follow them easier than this "easy" writing style. Almost every subject is covered in other books in more detail and better. Sometimes it's nice to have a simpler book which is an introduction, and that is what I was hoping for, but this just didn't do it for me.I donated the book to the library,as I felt I would never really get too much out of it. This didn't stop me from buying Mr. Razavi's "Design of Analog CMOS ICs " and I liked his tutorial in the IEEE Phase Lock Loop book he edited.I know he can do a better job 
 I bought this Barbie after seeing two pictures of angel Barbies on the website and reading the Manufacturer's Description. One picture seems to have been deleted now. The Manufacturer's description is of an angel with a dark blue dress and a long gold sash. I trusted that the Manufacturer's description, which matched one of the pictures, was the correct angel. The doll with the light blue dress is not impressive at all. It is very simple with vinyl wings. Be aware of which you are purchasing, the description is deceptive and incorrect 
 Not even getting out of the second chapter I've run across more than a dozen typos and other errors.  If I had known there were so many I would have marked them all and sent them to the publisher.  Some topics are not even covered.  I have thrown this book away and bought the Sybex 70-290 study guide instead...Sybex Study Guides are the best I've found.  If you want to learn this information correctly, do NOT use this book.  Their technical editor should be fired 
 Maybe it was me, but I kept wanting this book to work and it just never grabbed me and I had to put it down.  It was almost aggravating 
 It had a couple laughs, but it got very old after the first 30 minutes, and then it started falling into the very dumb category. Like "naked gun" kind of dumb, maybe even worse than tha 
       Mirowski's(M)book correctly points out that Samuelson's attempt to model economics "as if" it was the physics of Boltzmann and Gibbs fails to incorporate the  20th century physics of Einstein(the special theory of relativity(1904) and the general theory of relativity(1915)).However,if Samuelson had discovered the special nature of neoclassical economics,then he,and not John Maynard Keynes,would have been the greatest economist of the 20th century.Mirowski generally is correct that the economics profession has been too engrossed in the advanced Newtonian physics of the 1870-1900 time period.Of course,it is this type of physics that Samuelson was taught in his engineering physics courses when he was a student in the early 1930's(the same conclusion holds for this reviewer in the early 1970's).Unfortunately,Mirowski,instead of correctly pointing out that,despite Samuelson's great technical skills and ingenuity,such an approach could only yield special conclusions(Samuelson did point out that neoclassical theory is strictly limited to an analysis of points lying on the boundary of the static and dynamic production possibilities curves in his principles textbook),appears to come very close to claiming that Samuelson is a scientific fraud .Mirowski's claims are simply false. The second major problem with this book is in its assessment of Keynes's General Theory(GT;1936).Every statement about Keynes and the General Theory in this book is either an error of omission or an error of commission.Mirowski's knowledge of Keynes's mathematical modeling approach in chapters 20 and 21 of the GT is nonexistent.Mirowski's reliance on the error filled commentaries of the mathematically  and economically illiterate,inept,and innumerant accountant,Hugh Townshend,whom Mirowski describes as"...a spectacularly perceptive critic..."(Mirowski,p.411)means that he has absolutely no idea of what Keynes is doing.On pp.261-262 of the GT,Keynes gives,not once but twice,the sufficient macroscopic optimality condition required for there to be no involuntary unemployment.It is that the marginal propensity to spend must equal 1.Unless this condition is met,no amount of wage and price flexibility ,even if instantaneous and simultaneous in all markets,will have any effect.Formally ,the mpc must equal 1.If the capital stock is not at an optimal level,then the mpc+mpi=1=mpc+mps condition is required,where mpc is the marginal propensity to spend on consumption goods,mpi is the marginal propensity to spend on investment goods,and mps is the marginal propensity to save.In chapters 20 and 21,Keynes derives this condition from the ground up,using a microfoundations of firms/industries operating under conditions of pure competition.This condition,which any competent mathematician can derive,is that w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where mpl is the aggregated marginal product of labor.If mpc+mpi<1,involuntary unemployment will automatically exist.Keynes demonstrated that the capitalist system is ,in fact, a system of multiple,stable equilibria.Due to the ignorance of Mirowski, concerning Keynes's Einsteinian revolution in economics,his explicit unsupported attack on P. Samuelson,and his implicit attack ,again unsupported,on John Maynard Keynes,I can't recommend the purchase of this book unless it undergoes a complete revision,concentrating on the deficiencies of modeling economics on late 19th century Newtonian physics only.Mirowski could have written a 5-star book.Instead,he mixs his correct assessment of the misguided attempts of the economics profession to model economics as if it were physics with a series of unsupported attacks on Samuelson and Keynes 
 Compared to his other superb books, this is one is tedious and boring.  The overall thesis is a stretch - trying to find equivalences between pre-industrial (and pre-printing press) 13th century price paterns and those of the industrialized and post-industrial 20th century requires ignoring far to many factors.  At a minimum comparing a world in which 90% of the population are attached to agricultural production and illiterate to world where almost precicly the reverse holds is just too big a leap to swallow.  Sadly, one suspects more than a little political axe-grinding is involved.   Enjoy Fischer's other books where he excells, but you won't miss much if you neglect to read The Great Wave.  Besides, the subject has been better treated elsewhere by authors not so obviously out of their depth 
 My family enjoyed the Pirates movies so much that we couldnt wait to get this game.  Once we started playing it we were very disappointed.  It has no excitement in it.  We thought it would have clips of the movies but but it doesnt.  It is just moving ships around a map and collecting cards as your treasure.  It takes a long time to do each turn since you have to put in your coordinates that your ship is on to see if you found any treasure.  We played it for 2 hours and still were no where near ending the game.  Be prepared for a long game if you buy this product 
 This movie was as one of the most disappointing in its genre, far less interesting than Pulp Fiction and even below the level of Reservoir Dogs. It is said that in the violent late Middle Ages street shows were  often staged in European cities where fake blood flowed like water, heads fell off and stomachs erupted sausages to simulate intestines  during an evisceration delighting  the crowd. It seems that in the violent final decade of the twentieth century we had come  full circle from Barbara Tuchman's gripping account of the  awful fourteenth century.  Despite the abundant gore if the film had been  better handled it could have been quite good. There are  glimpses of its failed potential at different  points. For instance the scene  towards the end where the prison governor's head is impaled on a broomstick and carried around by the revolting inmates seems to be a direct  copy of an actual event at the  Bastille during the days of the early French revolution. In sum, as a special kind of disgusting  art form it is interesting, as entertainment though Natural Born Killers sucks. I admit some  people will like it , no doubt the same crowd who would attend  public executions if they were available for viewing 
 I guess I was expecting a Japanese, day before Pearl Harbor, Gorky Park. It wasn't. The problem with this book is that it did not hold my attention. I went back and reread more pages than in any book other than Michael Crichton's. In fact when I finished it I really could not tell you what it was about beyond ... the day before Pearl Harbor.  Buy it if you have insomnia 
 It's really a fundamental book of communication especially on writing, even for a reader, English is not the native language. I can't see special focus on business.   
 When I was a boy I rented out this version of Peter Pan from the library and hated it. It was boring and stupid. DON'T EVER SEE THIS VERSION-IT STINKS!  PS. Why make a women play Peter Pan NO AFENCE KATHY RIGB 
 Did not care for this book. It was a struggle to get to the last 100 pages which read somewhat more interesting but was not worth it. Don't waste your time, you never care for the characters, nor did I want to get to know them.  
 Most books that set out to explain why organisms behave as they do describe observations of behaviour on almost every page. The books of Richard Dawkins, whom Rose selects as his special target, illustrate this well: readers can reject all of his interpretations while remaining fascinated by the purely factual information that they contain. How one can hope to convince anyone of the truth of a theory without supporting it with abundant facts? Yet hard biological information is extremely sparse in Rose's book. There is a great deal about what he thinks of other biologists' opinions, but almost no observations from behavioural biology. Nonetheless, in his preface he aligns himself with the practising biologists "who spend a significant part of every working day thinking about and designing experiments", dismissing Dawkins and Daniel Dennett as "people who either no longer do science or never did it." What a pity, therefore, that he chose to include so little of the experimental basis of his ideas in his book. There are a few vague remarks about how chicks behave, and that's about it.  
 Charlie Sheen,who is now on CBS' hit comedy "Two and a Half Men",once played the reborn alien form of Sherilynn Fenn's boyfriend in this '80s cheese-fest.Unlike his character on the sitcom,he can incinerate bad guys with his eyes--and wear a really bizarre leather outfit.I found the reborn boyfriend/alien wraith concept confusing,maybe it wasn't supposed to make sense in the first place.  Randy Quaid,before playing the rancher in "Brokeback Mountain",plays a cop who wonders what's going on.Who expects local cops to understand the supernatural?  There are wonderfully strange '80s hairdos,'80s music--it's a cheesy sci fi/teen angst space epic.How many of those exist?It's "The Breakfast Club" meets "Alien." Be prepared to be amused 
 This was probably an ok book in 1996, but I really feel that it has lost relevance, many more couples these days are choosing not to have children, and I think the issues are different.  I would like to see an updated book that talked about what the choice is like now.  Some of the issues are still the same ... who do you leave your stuff to when you die, but that was not an issue I thought was well covered in the first place.  The women Jeanne Safer seemed to interview for this book were also heavily weighted towards the arts/entertainment industry.  There were a lot of comments like "I couldn't have children because it would have drained my creativity."  There were few/no comments by average 9-5ers like me. 
 Check it, So I got my new headphones I had been waiting 2 weeks (free shipping deal) for and when I opened the box, I was like, sweet, these look pretty tight.  Then I went to put them on, ya know, test them out, and the darned things would't fit over my big dome. I went to adjust them and i was like, they can't be adjusted! I went to lift them up and Oh snap... them things snapped!! I got mad and threw them against the wall, packaged them up, and sent them back. I still havent received my refund.. 
 Building Big reminds me of a book I owned as a boy called "How do they build it?" Slick pictures of giraffes and elephants building dams and skyscrapers. This book isn't much different. Skinny on the details, full of colorful pictures you might get from Maurice Sendak with a lobotomy. In other words, I'm dissapointed that a subject of such scope has been slighted here 
 Never received the book. No emails and notice, no nothing! Very Disappointed 
   I really thought this book had promise.  I liked the character of Edward in Hamilton's previous books, but "Obsidian Butterfly" made him look like a wimp! Giving the guy a "family" and a "personal life" after having him spend years as a cold and calculating hitman was so not the right thing to do.  Why didn't Hamilton have Anita fall in love with him, too?  After all, she's got lovers from a variety of different species! I couldn't even finish this book; it was so disappointing.    Another serious problem I have with the Anita Blake series is the lack of vampire hunting, as listed on the front of each novel: An Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter Novel.  It's quite the misnomer these days.  I wish Hamilton had stuck with Jean Claude (my favorite character) and created more scenarios around him and other vampires.  I probably will not by any more of her books unless they feature Jean Claude and/or actual vampire hunting 
 This is one of the worst books I've EVER read.  Or almost read.  I've only gotten through 50 pages so far, but there's NO WAY I will be able to read ANY MORE.  Chuck Klosterman can't write about anything but himself, and let me tell ya...he's not interesting AT ALL.  AND some of his information regarding historical events in rock history have already been misinformed in the first 50 pages...so don't dare read this book with ANY intention on learning ANYTHING about rock music history.  I HATE THIS BOOK.  I CAN'T BELIEVE I EVER BOUGHT IT.  WHAT A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY. AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 I bought my Canon A95 in November 2004.  A little after 1 year just after the manufacturer's warranty expired, the infamous E18 error struck.  I called the factory repair center to get a repair estimate, and they quoted $89 plus $8 shipping & handling.  I bought the camera for $300 online, now it's going to cost me roughly 1/3 of its purchase cost to repair it.  For all I know, it might break down again after the repair! The repair comes with 90-Day warranty period, but it COULD break again after 90 days.    And then...  There is an upgrade option.  Canon offers a program where you can upgrade A95 for A610 for $125 plus $10 shipping and handling.  This comes with only 6-month warranty.  Again, it COULD be flawed with the same e18 error that could struck after warranty expires.    I would really do extensive research before buying another CANON. 
 When you call your book true stories, especially in this year of heightened awareness about what is truth and what is fiction, you should expect a higher level of scrutiny from your readers.  As such, I have to admit that I'm highly dubious as to the legitimacy and honesty of some of these stories.  I'm sure that they are all based on some grain of truth, but the specter of exaggeration lurks in the background of many of the stories.  Am I to really believe that people were punching him in the kidneys because he was walking around Seattle in a dog suit?  The height to which the story goes on-and-on seems like a rant.  Other stories also come across as rants.  The writing workshop story comes across as being written by someone with a big chip on their shoulder, a frustrated writer, and comes across and quite demeaning actually.    Many of the stories are down right obnoxious and boring.  Some are interesting as a brief diversion perhaps before bedtime.  Bottom line, I'm not sure if it was the attack on Seattle, or the underlying obnoxiousness and seeming exaggeration, but I found myself hating this book and hating its author 
 I was so, so looking forward to reading "Little Women" to my daughter, so she could be caught up in it as I was at an early age.  I particularly chose the "Whole Story" edition because of its broad margins, easy-to-scan pages, and charming illustrations and margin notes that add historical texture to the story.  Imagine my shock to discover that at the end of THIS edition, Jo has not written a book, Amy has not gone off to Europe, Professor Baer has not made an appearance of any kind and....you'll never believe this....Beth is still carrying on a conversation (I'm trying not to spoil the plot of the real thing here).  That's because, apparently, "Little Women" was initially published in two parts ("Little Women" and "Good Wives"), which are generally published as the same book.  Whole Story has chosen to stop at the half-way point, so much of the story you remember, loved, cried, and laughed over is just not here.    Imagine getting only the first half of Tom Sawyer...leave him stranded on the island forever!  I feel completely conned.  It's a five-star story - make that maybe even a seven-star story - but it's a one-star edition.  
 If there is ever a place where the political correctness does not belong, it's mystery. Ruth Rendell has sold out to the PC crowd - the book is bland and preachy. I think the damage is irreversible, at least for me. Mystery will never be the same 
 This book didn't teach me how to draw cars!What it did show me was art work from talented car artists.Showing me artwork will not teach me how to draw a car 
   Hiaasen is a funny writer but he has created quite a bitter little world here, with a cast of characters that ranges from obnoxious to flat-out-evil.  He also has a weakness for repeating himself, especially the many scenes where clueless bad guys try to kill our "hero" in his kooky, off-the-grid hideaway.   The central theme seems to be the scourge of bad cosmetic surgeons, who apparently feel emboldened because Hiaasen's South Florida is such a completely corrupt place.  The story still might have worked if it were 100 pages shorter and he hadn't placed the equivalent of a puppy murder at its center, but it wears out its welcome long before it finally ends.   You can do better 
 There were aspects of the book that I enjoyed- the writer has a great knowledge of the food and restaurant industry. Some of his tales were interesting-  The reading was really bogged down for me by the writer's almost "groupie" sense of being impressed that he can hang with great chefs. It seemed almost jouvenile to me-  He definitely takes the side of the industry and looks at customers with a good amount of disdain. To me it was hard to get through the book because the guy kept referring to his own relationships with people in the industry-  Also, he thinks that critics should not be anonymous- that to me is ridiculous in its own- how can you write an honest review of a establishment, if you were out eating salami sandwiches with the chef earlier that afternoon-  In my opinion the writer really gets off on rubbing elbows with restaurant elite-  Because he kept getting bogged down with being impressedm with himself, getting reservations at tough restaurants, etc., a lot of the material was hard to get through.  He also seems jealous of real writers and has to take a lot of shots at them-  Next time I see his name on a book cover- I'll skip it 
 Not a very good tool unless you have other supporting data to aid with this book.  Nothing new.  Not worth it 
 The book, Hidden in Plain View, is based on the oral testimony of an elderly lady, shared with one of the co-authors shortly before she died. This book was immediately seized upon by the popular press and apparently, embraced by many people as the "Gospel Truth".  Page 33 of the book shares the author's own statement that the book is conjecture. No collaborative evidence was provided nor sought by the books' authors, and since neither of them are quilt historians, they surely did not realize the inanity of what is proposed. In my opinion, this book is a major insult to intelligent people everywhere yet it has been picked up to be shared as "fact" in Social Studies classes across America, instead of the "fiction" that it is. The book does not jibe with what we know about the Underground Railroad and African American history. Most certainly, the depiction of quilt blocks is not in tandem with known quilt and/or quilt block history.  Members of the American Quilt Study Group, a group that is comprised of University professors, professional writers/book authors, appraisers, publishers, and many others associated with the quilt world, have privately and publicly condemned this book. For interesting reading, you may like to read the introductory remarks that Marsha MacDowell shared in the year 2000. Marsha is a researcher and faculty member of Michigan State University, and  her thoughts are available to read in Vol. 21 of the Research Papers of the American Quilt Study Group "Uncoverings", 2000. From a quiltmaker's point of view and also that of a quilt historian, several of my articles about Hidden in Plain View have been published by major magazines. This book, HIdden in Plain View, is scholarship at its worst 
 I've had two of these stop working when used with olive oil, sadly, though the canola oil one is still going strong 
 I read three versions of the Arthurian legends recently, and this one was the weakest.  The language is somewhere between Malory's archaic form and modern prose, but does not succeed well at being either.  The tales were also, in my opinion, less well told than in the others.  For your consideration, I read La Morte D'Arthur in an abridged version and Roger Lancelyn Green's "King Arthur and His Knights of the Round Table" from the Puffin Classics series.  I enjoyed Green's telling the best, as it was credibly compiled from a number of works (including Malory) and had some excellent atmospheric illustrations.  Though it is a Puffin Classics edition, I did not find the usual condescension or "dumbing down" that often occurs in youth literature.    Get Green's version.  It was just as cheap right here on Amazon, and well worth every penny 
 I had to read this book for an anthropology class taught by an intelligent but uberfeminist professor.  There's an important point in this book that sheds light on its angle: when a Muslim woman wearing a hijab and full coverings was asked how she can walk around in the heat dressed in such a manner she responds something to the effect of "it's not as hot as the fires of hell."  Mernissi is not about to challenge behaviors that are dictated by Islamic scriptures.  Her argument is that the veil and woman's place in the Muslim society are a result of misinterpretation of the scriptures and the hadith.  This is sort of akin to Christians trying to reinterpret creation as an instructive myth after Darwin shattered the fundamentalist vision of creation.  I think Mernissi's approach is generally doomed because, if tradition has failed to maintain the original spirit of a religion, a new analysis almost 1500 years after the fact is almost certainly doomed.  There are too many epistemological problems with diving the original intentions behind a text that is so old.  Mernissi may convince some readers that her radically new interpretation is correct but only at the cost of introducing uncertainty and mistrust in the traditions themselves. Fatally wounding relgious traditions is nearly a fatal wound to the religion itself, and will only cause apathy or fundamentalist overreaction to a challenge of the status quo 
 Now that Professor Chasteen's personal friends, ex-students, and professional connections have had their say, perhaps a dash of insight would be relevant. This is a lousy book, in part because the premise is ludicrous. There cannot be a concise history of Latin America for the same reason that there cannot be a concise rendering of Newton's Principia. Thus, what professor Chasteen has provided is a concise overview of his personal prejudices, the vast majority of which he directs against (and here's a surprise) the United States and Europe. That these prejudices are personal is evident from the dedication (in which he states that his Latin American children are improving the US simply by their presence) until the meandering, pointless fizzling out of his discussion 250 pages later. The history is mediocre, at best, and some of Chasteen's opinions are so ridiculous (anyone historian who singles out the Carter administration's foreign policies for admiration has been hitting the bong a little too hard) that you have to wonder why he continues to live in a country he so plainly abhors.  The writing is so saturated with neoliberal condescension that professor Chasteen's acknowledgement to the over 100 students who read the manuscript seems a wholly fitting exercise, given that they may well have written the dreadful thing 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 The 2nd edition of this book is terrible. Look it up and see what other people have said about it. Be sure you can flip through this edition before buying it. Also, look at the author's website and prepare for the shock of your life (he writes a book about a subject he knows next to nothing about) 
 money ways and actions learned while growing up may indeed be a cause of the way you manage your finances now; this book is a very poor tool in getting those practices turned around.  i find this reading to be very boring and repetitive, and no help to myself to better my financial situation at this time.  i hope the workshops are much better done than this book is written 
 My own fault for not reading the ingredients - but the marketing info on this product is extremely misleading.  Basically, it's a $10 bag of blueberry candy. High Fructose Corn Syrup is the second ingredient - oil and flavoring also added. I don't have anything against candy but this stuff left my teeth tingling for hours after I ate it - I actually had to brush my teeth twice. This product should not be in the natural and organic category - don't waste your money 
 While comprehensive in its coverage of investment banking activities, this book provides very little detail, less analysis and no insight.  The actual relevant information this book provides would be summed up an introductory  chapter of a better book.  An example of a better book would be  "Global Banking" by Ingo Walter and Roy Smith 
 First, this looks to be an excellent book -- if -- you eat eggs and dairy.  If you follow a plant based diet, this is not the book for you.  There are handful - count maybe 5 - recipes that don't have eggs and dairy.  It is possible to substitute Earth Balance for butter and tinker with egg replacers for the eggs, if you want to bother.  For some reason I thought that because it has Buddhist roots it would lean more heavily on plant-based baking.  
 Do not misunderstand me: this book is fun. Problem is, it is only fun while it could have been really good and I hate to see good ideas wasted.  The writing itself is no more than straightforward: there are several clumsy turns of phrase, many repetitions, some shabbyness here and there.  The main problem is the plot we have no real mistery or thriller or whatever, just an excuse of a plot to introduce the main character, Ms Anita Blake, 24 y.o. -is she not just a little too young?- necromancer and ***-kicker. She is thrown with us into a bulging heap of violence and/or bodice ripping situations, facing countless (and I mean COUNTLESS) characters, none of which satisfyingly rounded: Anita spends all of her time ***-kicking, deciding how to dress to hide her guns or whether she is ready to die horribly. I am not saying she is not a nice character because she is, she even has a depth -but once again, can someone so young have such clear sighted symptathetic cynism?- though she tends to repeat the same puns too often.  A pity, there are some breathtaking paragraphs, others are excellent, the author seems to be able to move her pawns when she wants to: Phillip, for example, one of Anita's companions in her adventure is outright lovely and could have been perfect with just a little more concentration.  Let us see whether this first volume is just a warm up for better things to come 
 This is one of those rare books which are so thin, you can learn as much from their table of contents as from their actual contents.  There are a number of things I didn't like about this book and its packaging, but I will only list two for brevities sake.  First, there are not "20 Successful Uncorrelated Strategies".  "Technique 19" is simply a list of what the author believes doesn't work.  "Technique 20" is a reading list of books the author likes; there are probably hundreds of Wall Street listmanias listing the same books.  The other 18 present absolutely nothing new or interesting, most of them are simply "buy the dip" strategies.  Second, this book should rather be called "Trade Like James Altucher", unless you believe there are no longer any hedge funds that have discretionary traders or are willing to use options and go short.  There is almost nothing in this book with regards to real money or risk management either.  I suppose no one would have bought with that title though.  This is the only good sentence in the entire book: "Table 3.1 shows some recent large bankruptcies that were liquid enough to trade after filing Technique [sic] 11" (p. 49).  But what disappoints me most about this book is not that it is content free, but that it wastes the time and money of those who really are interested in learning.  This book, I speculate, was meant to exploit the members of TheStreet.com and its children.  Like another reviewer said, my copy is available for burning.  I recommend Perry Kaufman's book instead, it may be twice the pirce, but has a thousand times the content 
 Mona Charen cites nearly every example of demagoguery committed by social liberals from 1960 to 1996.  She didn't miss one.  She bashes liberal views of the Great Society of LBJ, the anti-war protests of the 60's, the welfare state, Clarence Thomas' and Robert Bork's nominations, and the crime wave that quieted in the 90's.  Unfortunately, Charen forgets the similar pandering and hypocrisy that has occurred by social conservatives during that same period, an omission that greatly detracts from her thesis.  Another failing is that she attaches exclusive causeology  of NYC's decrease in crime in the 1990's to Guiliani's get-tough policies, and conveniently forgets the complexities of improved economics, changing demographics and the "abortion factor" (as expounded by Leavitt in Freakonomics) as potential contributors.    She glibly assigns culpability to liberals for any number of social ills including unwed mothers, homelessness, violent crime, racial tension and conceiveably ring-around-the-collar.  Her references are numerous, but her arguments are not careful enough for a scholarly work, so the book serves only as red meat for the angry masses screaming about the same old problems of government waste associated with liberal government bureaucracy.  Charen conveniently avoids the huge government waste associated with the current so-called "conservative" government of GWB and the Republican House and Republican Senate.  Charen forgets to cite the Medicare Part D program as the largest social spending  program (inflation adjusted) in history.  She forgets to mention that GWB signed into law a bill written by fellow "conservative" Republicans that represented the largest farm subsidies (inflation adjusted) in history.  Charen neglects to mention that the current "conservative" government has rushed us into a war that will cost half a trillion dollars and has already lasted longer than WWI, WWII and the US Civil War; and Bush did this despite protests by previous Republican cabinet advisors and diplomats.     At the end of the day, this conservative prefers a government that wastes billions of my tax money on unnecessary and counter-productive social programs over one that spends trillions on unnecessary war and mayhem 
 I've read a lot of the books in the series, and Hillerman is one of my favorite mystery writers, but I have to say this one fell way short of his other mysteries.  My main complaint is the presence of several plot gaps and inconsistencies not characteristic of the author--his well-crafted mysteries almost always hold water, but not this one.  I whole-heartedly recommend most of Hillerman's other Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novels, but if you want a good entrance into his captivating style and skill, this is not the book to pick up.  
 The best way to begin is to show you where I stand. I think "Zombie Island" and "The Witch's Ghost" were excellent. I didn't much care for "Alien Invasion" or "Cyber Chase." I thought "The Legend of the Vampire" was a surprisingly good return to form. Onto chapter six. I can't really say this is one of Scooby's better movies. It kind of lacks the punch and surprises of "Zombie Island" and "The Witch's Ghost." Instead of the scarey surprises seen in the first two movies, this 6th chapter seems to rely more on silly chases. (But if you like the original episodes, you probably won't mind that so much.) Also, in my opinion, the script is weaker which means the movie seems very long and drawn out. ("Zombie Island" and "Witch's Ghost" don't seem to have many dull moments at all.) And, I won't say too much here, but when the mystery is uncovered and you really didn't get to know the culprit in the first place, a certain edge is missing. (In "Zombie Island" and "Witch's Ghost," we got to know the culprits very well in the 1st half of the movie, and therefore, there was  a scarey sense of recognition when the plots were uncovered. The main reason I can give to watch this movie is that it was at least nice to the original line up from the early cartoons (Casey Kasem-Shaggy, Frank Welker-Fred, Heather North-Daphne, and Nicole Jaffee-Velmah) together again. The movie is worth some interest, but it's more of a long episode. If you like Scooby, this movie is watchable. But, don't expect the terror, intensity, and suspense of "Zombie Island," "The Witch's Ghost," or even "Legend of the Vampire."           
 The railings on the Schwinn 820p did not line up with the screw holes on the frame by several inches!  It was impossible to assemble.  With any quality control at all, these measurements are checked on every item that leaves the factory.  Human error is then not a factor.  This is a defect that should never happen. Schwinn/Nautilus has zero quality control.  That is simply a fact of the most basic quality control standards.    You are therefore definitely taking your chances with this or any other Schwinn or Nautilus product.  With zero quality control, no telling what else can prove to be wrong.  And though the warranty says "1 year on parts", the warranty then goes on to say that there will be a charge for the installation of any defective or replaced parts.  So what is the 1 year warranty on labor?  Nothing, obviously.  I wish I never had purchased this product, myself 
 This is pathetic.  Vile language, inept writing, and silly casting.  Worst: This film just isn't funny.  It's a waste of Gene Wilder and Harrison Ford 
 Set in modern times, Mona Simpson's fictional book Anywhere But Here takes us through a mother-daughter relationship full of disagreements and misunderstandings.  Adele, Anne's mother, pressures Anne to look beautiful and thin so that she can become a notorious movie star in Hollywood.  Even though Adele has high aspirations for Anne, she can't quite seem to live teh life that she has in mind.  She is consistently trying to find "the perfect father" for Anne but comes up short after many different dates.  Adele finally decides to take Anne to California and eagerly searches for movie shoots and jobs for her daughter.  This whole ordeal of becoming famous is seen throughout the book but in the end Anne is just a normal child and her mother is left wondering why her idea of Anne becoming famous never was fulfilled.                                                           Even though the plot is intriquing, it is quite drawn out.  The sentences flow well with one another and are quite poetic and  colloquial.  But the prolonged story makes the whole readability  of the story difficult.  While reading through the book, we as readers are left wondering why some scenes are even inserted.  Many of the scenes are distracting as well as unnecessary.             Mona Simpson's writing style also affects the overall readability of Anywhere But Here.  Her chapters jump from character to character, letting us see the different views of each of the characters on specific events.  However, most of the chapters are seen through Anne's unemotional viewpoint.  Carol, Adele's sister, also plays part in a few of the chapters, describing Adele's past life and attempting to demonstrate to us as readers why Adele acts in the manner in which she does.  Adele has one chapter in the end which is, unlike Anne's, full of emotion.  As readers we are left confused as to why Simpson doesn't add as much emotion into Anne's character.  As Simpson jumps from character to character, she also skips from year to year ignoring chronological order.  This makes for a hard-to-understand organization of stories.  One minute we think that Anne is an eighteen-year-old woman and the next we find out that she is only a twelve-year-old child.  Not only that, sometimes Simpson doesn't even mention the age and we are left trying to decipher Anne's age by Simpson's inferring style.           Overall, the book depicted a real-life situation that most everyone can relate to but the storyline was really difficult to follow.  I would suggest watching the movie before the story because you may begin the book but find out that you are unable to finish it due to the difficult storyline 
 After reading this book I can only say that the author is selling something unreal , the figues he uses in the book are totally unrealistic . talking about 10 and 12 to 15 percent returns on investment , like they are the readers just for the taking .his advice reminds me of the old Steve Martin shtick on how to become a millionaire , Steve says " O.k. first you get a million dollars then..."  This is basically what the author is saying, This book has no real pracital advice , It is just another author getting rich telling everyone else how to.Very disappointing , I would not waste my money if i were you .  
 I was so looking forward to this book, after I read James and George's book, but what a major let down this book was. First of all they kept expressing in the book the age difference between Amy and Warren which I was trying to over look but couldn't. Secondly Amy was pretty much what we would called in todays society a stalker. Third the hero and his attitude was over the top. The only saving grace for this book was the appearance of the other Malorys James, George and Tony. 
 While some would call Orange and Acme "studio" albums, suggesting that they lack originality, but they have rythm. I would call myself a big JSBX fan, I play Orange and Acme constantly, however I feel that this album is a little too much free form, and free noise for the everyday listener. I would recommend that anyone interested in JSBX start with Acme and then move on to Orange to develop an appreciation for JSBX, because it is a rather acquired taste 
 The title of the book certainly was a great inducement to buy the book.  Thinking that it would be an informed commentary on key elements of Bush's character, I purchased this book and eagerly awaited its arrival.    Starting off well, the author lays out what he purports to be the architecture of a meaningful and detailed analysis.  Then, sadly it degenerates into a self serving diatribe filled with epithets and derogatory terms.    Whether or not you support the President, any credible review of his actions from a psychiatry perspective should at least appear unbiased.  Not the case here.  Mr. Frank quickly descends into child like name calling and remarks that should never come from a professional.  He cites theories from others that indicate it is impossible to accurately apply a diagnosis without lengthy study, then in the next few paragraphs violates that premise by applying the very diagnosis he earlier claimed was impossible.  Finally, (and I have learned my lesson here) the final words of the book are a call for Bush's impeachment.  What that has to do with an unbiased psychological analysis I have no idea.  I now will read the final paragraph from any book Mr. Frank writes to understand his motivation before sharng my hard earned money with him.  Unless you are a closed minded rabid Bush hater, this book will not appeal to you.  If you are of such ilk, just rewards are yours for the reading 
 I paid for it and got an e-mail link but have yet to receive the written conformation. Called the 1800#. It's been a month. If it's this hard to get the plan I wonder how it will be if I need to replace my product 
 There are SOOOO many GREAT books about wicca out there I certainly wouldn't waste my money again on this book, and I suggest others don't either. It is a lot of pop propaganda made to make wicca and witchcraft look like something out of the movies. It is full of false information made just to look cute so it will sell, sell, sell. This book is not for anyone who is seriously interested in learning Wicca or witchcraft in general.  This supposedly "advanced" book doesnt go into details on how to make your spells better, how to connect with nature, how to beome stornger. It doesnt encourage deep thinking and lots of factual information. It DOES however make the reader feel like they can just read a spell out loud from the book and it will all work in a puff of blue smoke. This book is not about a different of opinions or different practices, it is about portraying a real, serious, religion as a fun and games, do whatever you want choice as she mixes in things in tradtional witchcraft that has been shown to have the oppsite and/or nagative effects, as well as doing spells which do not follow the Wiccan rede.  Even though I am not in a coven I understand wicca is a religious choice and like any religion there are beliefs and redes which are followed. It is not 'do whatever you want to do and call yourself wiccan'. Yes some things in religion are personal choices but the building blocks of the religion are totally lost on her. Freedom of choice in religion is wonderful and its everyones right but if your choice is to make up your own religion you should not go around saying your wiccan when you do not follow the wiccan ways, Unfortunatly that is EXACTLY what ravenwolf does. She doesn't differentiate between the Wiccan and Paganism, in fact she barely cover the topics at all giving vague rehashed information from her other books. This book seems a nice commercial, cutesy items to make everything pretty and oh so shiny. This book is teaching hype not truths.   This book is demeaning and disrespectful to anyone into witchcraft and wicca alike. There are many good books which put things in simple, pleasant terms without all the false, goofy information spread thoughout this book.  Go pick up another book on whatever your interst (wicca, witchcraft, or paganism) and you will undoubtably end up more informed, this book will just leave you feeling broke. 
 This book was something that I read in one day, just to pass the time.  I really didn't care about the characters, and Lara seemed just too unreal to be true.  She was too much of Scarlet O'Hara in her dealings with a real estate world dominated by men.  I only finished it to find out what crisis happened that gave her an empty birthday party, but when I finally came to the end, it wasn't too satisfying 
 Pro: pretty comprehensive Con: This book is obviously  written for the people without much idea about programming. It tries to explain many basic things in an extremely layman's term, which may make a real programmer feel odd. I do think some serious programmers or people well trained in computer need to learn javascript too - in that case, this is not the right book to read 
 This table is very lightweight and easy to use, but not very sturdy. It would probably last longer for someone using it only a few times a year - but for weekly use, it only lasted me a few months before one of the hinges came apart. I don't think I would buy it again for frequent use. 
 I wanted to convert an HP LaserJet 4 Plus to a networked printer. Even though instructions from the manual was followed, the printer did not work. The customer support is claimed to be 24/7, but no one has closed my help desk ticket yet. This product cost more than a linksys router. So customers can naturally expect better customer service and better response time 
 It all depends on who you are if you will like this book.  Republicans will like it but Democrats or people with brains won't. 
 My husband and I just finished watching this and to say we were disappointed would be an understatement.  We were under the impression that we would be watching Richard Pryor doing his amazing standup and what we got were small clips of him interspersed with comedians putting their two bits in, copying  him, and all this other garbage.  I don't even understand how this was supposed to be entertaining in any way - it was quite simply totally annoying and pointless.  We fast forwarded through most of it that didn't involve Richard.  Don't buy this 
 mine broke in 11 months.  it switches off by itself before the water gets boiled 
 I was very disappointed in this book .I thought it was a biography of the man but instead it was a synopsis of business management only.   Who cares about the daily life of the corporate CEO?  I wanted to know the man.  What were his parents like, what kind of a childhood did he have?  How about some pictures of Jack the kid? Who was his wife of twenty eight years, what are her opinions of Jack, as a man and a father?  How about his children, do they have insights into their fathers feelings?   What experiences in his life molded him into what he became?  These and many other questions were not answered.   How can anyone write a biography with no personal facts or anecdotes?    Try it again Janet, the third time never fails 
 If you know this music well, either from recordings or, better yet, playing it, the strengths and failures of Lang's performances are obvious.  He possesses a wonderful digital dexterity; he can play complicated, dense scores with real technical mastery.  And in Liszt, for example, this works reasonably well.  Yet, in contrast to Liszt, as Arthur Schnabel remarked, in Viennese classical music -- say Schubert and Haydn -- playing the notes in time is only ten percent of what's required to realize the music's potential.  The pianist needs to sing his way into the heart of the score.  Lang's failure, at this early stage in his career, is a failure to grasp the inner voices of pieces like Scubert's Wanderer Fantasy, performing a showy razzle dazzle instead of the profound song Schubert wrote. He has the raw talent to do this.  Does he have the heart and imagination?  Time will tell 
 Claiming to be a book which bridges the divide between the worlds of academia and populism, Japan Pop! gets off to a poor start with an absurdly high cover price likely to put it out of reach of the casual J-Pop Culture fan. The price might have been justified had this been a glossy, photo-packed book, but seems ludicrous given that it is merely a collection of 17 essays. The essays dwell on four major areas of contemporary J-Pop Culture: music, manga and animation, TV & film and the popularity of J-Pop Culture outside of the country. It comes as little surprise that Mark Schilling's contribution, about the Tora-san character in the Otoko wa Tsurai yo (It's Tough Being a Man) film series, is the most interesting - not necessarily because of the topic, but because Schilling is the only contributor who is a writer of any repute. The majority of these essays are written by academics and it shows: footnotes abound, the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers get analysed to the nth degree and claims are made that "Sailor Moon's rearrangement of the traditional superhero myth bears hints of not only a new social order, but also the kind of moral struggles, alliances, and identities that may create and accompany it." The book also contains a number of confidence-sapping factual errors (example: Osaka band Shonen Knife "started playing in the mid-1980s" which is not true, they started playing in December 1981). Schilling's Encyclopedia of Japanese Pop Culture (Weatherhill) remains the definitive starting point for those seeking a good, accessible introduction to the subject; Japan Pop! is only for the otaku completist, and a wealthy one at that 
 Don't be fooled by thew presence of Star Wars characters in the draws, or the name of Star Wars, this isn't "really" Star Wars music. Jow McNeely just took parts of the music composed by John Williams, and introduced his own music for the book. It hasn't got the intensity of the Star Wars music, sometimes music goes up and down and it's annoying, you better buy the Star Wars trilogy music instead of this 
 technically useful, but written in an irritative prolo-supposed-funny language, and culminates with offensive comments about "European trash" climbing sites.  Must be good to promote the patriotism of the USA climbers 
 Although the authors are clearly very well versed in forensic anthropology, I was disappointed in the way they presented their material. The chapters weren't difficult to follow, but they read like memoirs of the authors' cases and I got the sense the authors were more interested in showing off than sharing knowledge with nonscientists. That  made it tricky to isolate details, and frankly I've learned more from general crime scene books that devoted just one chapter to forensic anthropology. Bottom line: If you're looking for a solid reference book that you can turn to again and again, you'll probably find satisfaction only in the glossary at the end 
 I looked at the title and thought - Yes this looks great.  Then I read the first sentence and came across "blood splatter".  Not the correct terminology and an immediate let down.  The correct "technical" term is "blood spatter".    This may seem a small matter to some, but it immediately made me dubious to the authenticity of the rest of the material, and whether more of the content portrayed incorrect technical information.  This book maybe a good read, but is not for someone who is looking for CORRECT procedure or technical insight 
  Jim Ross, A Statistical Approach to Betting the Horse Races, Second Edition (self-published?, 2004)  Ross releases the second edition of A Statistical Approach to Betting the Horse Races, rearranging the data and adding just under four thousand races over twenty-three tracks. While I realize that getting a large enough data sample to come up with a truly comprehensive version of this book would be a Herculean task-- it would certainly require a decent-sized full-time staff-- some of the tracks represented here are a bit confusing given some of those left out; Evangeline Downs, Penn National, Ruidoso Downs, and Beulah Park are all included, while Belmont Park is nowhere to be found. This, I would imagine, leads to a large number of confused Belmont players.  The book runs just over one hundred seventy-five pages, which is reasonable for a racing book of this price, but over half the book is nothing but charts and graphics. While there are some interesting ideas that warrant further study to be found within these pages, the fact of the matter is that the real meat to be found here could have filled a much smaller book-- or, perhaps, a sixteen-page pamphlet.  If you're a collector of horse racing books, you might want to add this one to your collection; otherwise, you can safely avoid it. * 
 I found this book to be offensively un-American.  The characters accuse our country and our government of all sorts of nefarious acts.  The best spy thriller fiction is based on fictional characters and actions in a world not totally removed from reality not an agenda of false premises.  I think the author is the real conspiracy theorist not the characters. 
 These slipcovers are tooooo expensive to fall apart after one washing!  I bought two of these;  one ripped and the other is coming apart from the inside.  I constantly have to cut the strings:-(  
 Once again, Konstantinos has created a book on Goth culture that has little, if anything, to do with traditional occult themes. Readers expecting to find detailed, practical rituals will be sorely disappointed: instead of providing such information, Konstantinos fills this book with musings drawn from his obsessive interest in the Necronomicon and his reprobate New York City lifestyle. Furthermore, I doubt that many readers will have the time or resources available to attempt many of these stunts: rituals frequently call for the use of alcohol, drugs, Gothic sex partners, long, dark hallways, deserted beaches, basements to simulate a descent into Hades, etc. How Konstantinos' target audience of teenage/adolescent Goths are supposed to obtain such things is beyond me.  It is standard fare for a book on the occult to begin with circle casting techniques and basic methods of raising energy. Oddly, Konstantinos has discarded the techniques outlined in his previous books and devised weird new rituals to replace them. These involve lying down in the black of night, imagining a swirling mist of specters surrounding you, whispering at you, inhaling the vapors of said "whisperers," and trying to self-induce terror at the thought of suffocating on this mist. The circle casting that follows is then composed of little more than "pushing out" against the "whisperers" in the shadows. Interestingly, at each of the respective quarters Konstantinos has his readers alternately breathe against the outer edge of the circle, warm their hands and press, lick their fingertips and press, and fall upon their knees, but nowhere in the text does he explain the obvious elemental association of these acts as invoking (or attempting to invoke) air, fire, water and earth. The lack of such basic explanation puzzles me: Konstantinos surely must realize that his failure to explain the symbolism of the ritual to his readers will make the motions ineffective.  Now to the heart of the material: The first chapter of this book contains standard-issue, largely plagiarized material from Austin Osman Spare on sigil magick (to his credit Konstantinos makes a rare acknowledgement of the derivative nature of this section). Nothing new here, and this section seems strangely out of place for the rest of the book. Readers will be thankful, however, for its inclusion, because it is one of the few rituals that most anyone can perform successfully. The next chapter describes a standard-issue method of sex magick (repeating a commanding phrase to oneself at the height of orgasm). Nothing particularly new here, except that Konstantinos insists (contrary to his earlier Gothic Grimoire work) that one should perform this sort of work with a partner (which seems like a strange thing to concentrate on in the midst of shared passion, but therein lies the mind of Konstantinos).  Then the book goes straight downhill: Konstantinos advocates the use of alcohol, absinthe (illegal in the U.S.), and psychodelic drugs (illegal in the U.S. and most everywhere else) to aid in the performance of rituals. He follows this up with "Hadetic" magick, which is a fancy name for Greek psychodrama about a vision quest to Hades that seems lifted from Bulfinch's Mythology. Divination material is copied from his other texts (themselves copied from Cunningham's materials) on different forms of scrying, except Konstantinos also recommends use of blood in the scrying dish. Yuck. Then the most disturbing part of the book: a dance with a Gothic partner who pretends to be a corpse (which Konstantinos calls his "Dance of the Dead"). I kid you not! He even strongly suggests that sex should follow the Dance... very disturbing. Then he discusses random conversations he had with Lucifer while he was suffering from a BRAIN INJURY (I highly suspect that explains a lot of this book). Oh yeah, Lucifer is a great and brilliant guy, by the way, although the author will not share with the poor reader, Lucifer's brilliance (apparently the wisdom is just too personal, and potentially marketable for another title).  To wrap it all up, Konstantinos spends fully the last half of the book pontificating on the glories of the Necronomicon, and how it's been so wildly successful (the version he referenced was published in the 1970s) that it's created the very entities that Lovecraft invented out of his sick imagination seventy years ago. Oh, and this includes a Call to Cthulu ritual, the alien god creature bent on destroying the earth. Anyhow, I suppose this section is harmless enough, since everyone knows Lovecraft spun these monsters out of whole cloth. It's mainly filler material, and mainly demonstrates how nostalgic for his 1970s sci-fi youth Konstantinos was feeling when he wrote this part. All in all, I think this book is mostly devoid of new thoughts about the occult, generally reflects a disturbed worldview and mindset, and becomes vividly uninteresting in the last half. But on the bright side, it is an interesting psychological portrait of Konstantinos. Not worth the price of admission, but since it's the only thing to admire about the book, puts it slightly above the one star minimum 
 This was not good news to me and does not represent who I am as a PCA Presbyterian woman, happily married and the mother of two sons. I resent how the author demeans women in her writing as if they are less intellegent than she is for choosing to submit to their husbands and staying home with their kids. There can only be one leader of a corporation, and one leader of a home; in a dance, one leads and one follows--two cannot lead in a dance, or there is no dance. The author has never studied Greek or Hebrew as far as the credentials state, and she is in no place to profess to be qualified in the exegesis of Scripture to prove her feminist agenda. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It is a waste of time 
 Should you be afraid of your microwave oven? This book discusses that non-issue for several paragraphs, before concluding that no, you probably shouldn't be afraid of your microwave. That embodies what's wrong with this book. It pretends to be reassuring while actually planting a bunch of paranoid ideas. It also assumes that you, the reader, are the mother-to-be, while having very little to say to your partner, in a way that I find subtly sexist. Overall, it has plenty to make you extra-worried. For instance, it advises posting pictures of healthy babies all around your house (on the door, in the kitchen, on the bathroom mirror, really, all around your house), in order to continually remind yourself to eat a very rigid diet -- as if the bump in your belly wasn't already making you worry quite enough. If you think that it would be helpful to post a nagging sign on your front-door to ask you daily, "Have you fed your baby breakfast today?" then you may like this book.   Personally, I found that _What to Expext_ left me alarmed about microwaves & air pollution & ambient noise & even exercise in ways that were not helpful. For a book so full of information, it also, curiously, failed to address any of my specific questions. How soon should I begin taking folic acid or other prenatal vitamins: as soon as I start trying to get pregnant, or only after the pregnancy-test comes back positive? Is there anything I can do to increase my odds of getting pregnant? What are those odds, anyway, for a woman my age? These seemed like reasonable questions to me, but to find answers, I had to look in the far-more-helpful book by Ann Douglas, _The Mother of All Pregnancy Books_ -- which also features a nifty week-by-week what's-happening-inside-your-body chart that I love. The other book I highly recommend is Armin Brott's _The Expectant Father_, which has terrific & reasonable advice you won't find elsewhere. By those two, not this one. 
 I do get annoyed when a book's title does not reflect what the book is about. The writer did not use his mathematics in any way so I find it misleading to say, a mathematician plays the stock market.   In this case this book is actually two separate books twisted into one.   The first book is of a guy moaning about his loss on the stock market and how unfair and dishonest the market can be. Annoyingly the figure that he lost is not specified, but I suspects its not that much!  It is quite clear that the writer did not  1) Ask any reputable person who had any experience in the share market  for advise 2) He did not read any book on the stock market to help him make his selection 3) He did no research on the company   The other book is a discussion of varies models of the stock market, some of which are mathematical in part. These models are reasonably well explained in a very simple way but if they don't fit into the writers preconceived ideal they are quickly eliminated. For example part of William Buffet success, the book claims is because people follow his lead.  Something that is quite difficult to do, as what Buffet's buys is not released. He has a special deal with the US goverment that allows him not to release the information. Peter Lynch's success is noted but no explanation is given, its just brushed aside.  Now let us say he had listened to some of these theories he so arrogantly rejected. Some that spring to mind are   1)The fundamental theories would have told him that WorldCOM was overpriced 2)The technical analysis theories would have told him that its going down. 3) Almost all books would have told him to diverse his stock and not stick to one share. I am sure there are more.  I have been involved in the stock market for many years and it is a subject that I know something about. In my experience stock market is risky. For every winner there is at least one loser. For every big winner generally there are a few losers.  The successful ones do study the stock market in detail and they depend upon substantial understanding of the share market system but knowledge is not enough, you need something else as well. If it was simply knowledge and easy, then arrogant inexperienced fools like this writer who are obviously extremely intelligent would have made money instead of losing it 
 I feel I was misled when I purchased this book (or maybe I was half asleep and didn't read the book description carefully enough). "Microsoft Office 2003 Step by Step" is a tutorial. It covers all the Office programs, but it does so with the idea that you can learn the programs best by getting hands-on instructions for using them. You won't find much commentary, much advice, or many tips or tricks. You will find a CD with raw data and a number of step-by-step lessons to help you gain experience with the Office programs.  If you have time to load the sample data from the companion CD and, when you need to know how to complete a task, pick your way through a step-by-step lesson, this book is for you. But if you're in a hurry and you just want to get the information quicky, try a reference book instead.  This book is not for people who, say, are at work and have to get the thing done before five o'clock. It's aimed at readers who want to learn Office programs from the ground up and have the time to do that 
 I've read dozens of end times novels and to me this one seems juvenile and very predictable.  It portrays the Israeli Defense Force as villans and idiots.  Try James Beauseigneur or Grant Jeffrey for thier excellent  prophetic novels 
 I have been a fan of Bruce Springsteen long before he became a household name throughout the U.S.A.  I primarily like his earlier works, but have listened to a lot of what he has done over the years.  Missing from this Greatest Hits collection is Tunnel Of Love and One Step Up.  I am sure that their are others but, those two stand out.  This may appeal to someone who is just trying to add some of his music to their collection.  Perhaps, someone who isn't that familiar with him may enjoy this, but this one disappointed me 
 The writing is uninspired.  The organization is poor.  Evidence is largely anecdotal.  After reading the review in Scientific American, perhaps I was expecting too much, but this book was not at all what I had hoped for 
 Like said in an earlier review, after a couple weeks the mirror quits working and fogs up so bad you can't see a thing in it in the shower.  I run hot water on it and it still fogs up after a couple minutes, then you can't clear it with any method.  Total waste, not worth a dollar.  
 This book was required reading for a class on children's literature.  So, naturally, I was expecting the very best samplings of what was out there.  The beginning was quite exceptional.  I even invited my husband to read it with me since we share good finds to read together in the evening.  We were about 75% of the way through before its magic halted and it turned to various detailed descriptions of the main character's female body parts.  Due to this we feel it falls short as an example of wholesome children's literature.  We set the book down and did not finish it.  If you are looking for good children's literature that COMPLETELY steers clear of naked images instead of turning to them to keep the pace of the book going, then this book will be a let down.  Sad, because up until that point, the writing was quite good.  
 After seeing the travesty that was episode one in the theatre I decided to give this one a try, assuming that it couldn't possibly get any worse. Was I right? Oh man, I was worse than right. I was wrong. The weak character development that took place with Anakin Skywalker in no way led me to believe that this person could eventually become Darth Vader. The character Anakin is such an undisciplined whiney little brat that it becomes utterly unbelievable that this kid could become a dreaded supervillian. On top of that, the chemistry between him and Padame was very weak. The supposed romance between them was devastated by mediocre acting and no real interesting dialogue.  So once again the special effects department has broken their backs carrying this movie. Without a strong plotline or interesting characters, this movie becomes not a story, but just an impressive light show. It seems as if George Lucas figured that if the technology that he has now is light years ahead of what he had twenty five years ago, then the audience won't need anything else. The special effects in the three 'prequel' movies was so inconsistent with the older films that they should have been released as a completely different story alltogether.  And finally we get to Yoda. A puppet that can bounce around and defy gravity with a lightsaber, but still needs a cane to walk. In the older films, Empire Strikes Back for example, Yoda was balancing on Luke's feet during his handstand. When Luke lost his balance and fell over, wouldn't Yoda be able to just use the force and gently float to the ground instead of tumbling to the ground out of control with him? Is that because of lack of special effects technology back then, or just Yoda was getting too old to use the force anymore? Just a little food for thought. I'll let you decide.  So once again the only plus in this film is the impressive visual effects. If your expecting more however then George Lucas will once again let you down 
 This just in:  William S. Burroughs was the only beat writer with any talent at all and, ironically, if you were to ask your average college type for the names of beat writers Burroughs wouldn't even come to their pot-headed mind.  Allan Disgustingberg, alias Allan No-talent, was a very successful literary fraud.  He was even able to blindside Burroughs, who was a literary genius, into thinking he was a real hairway to steven, er, stairway to heaven.  And this is most astonishing since, if you've ever seen a picture of Allan Disgustingberg, you know that he was about as sexy as my uncle Abe.  
 Seems like they sold too many of the first volume, and have produced a second just to try to rake in a little more. Hardly any of the tracks on this album are funk, and as for Queen being the opener... it speaks for itself. To me, funk is typified by an active bass line, compelling beat and sharp guitar or brass; any or all of these are lacking on most of the tracks here. What you get instead is a collection of slothful, disparate songs, hardly conducive to dancing. Save your money 
 If you call it a "novel," they can't sue you. Mantle's family must be mortified. This book is just slightly better than trash. There are actually a few baseball references but it is mostly mindless perversion masquerading as entertainment. 13 year-old boys might "get" something out of it. For the more "mature" reader, don't waste your time.  In regard to the reviewer who claims he knew Mickey Mantle and how Mickey was generous with "George's" money. Well, I'm sure Steinbrenner gave Mantle some money but it was long after Mantle retired and the memory of that reviewer appears to be as muddled as this "novel."  Are you a 13 year-old boy? Buy it. Hide it under the mattress. Don't let your mother find it. It's a travesty. It's utter filth. It dishonors his memory. A blatant money grab. That's all. 
 Like so many of you, I love Stephen King. I really do. He has given us so much that he is certainly forgiven for writing a stinker. But hey, we already had to read Gerald's Game! At least Gerald's story wasn't very long. However, Wolves of the Calla feels extraordinarily long because it is so damned boring. Also like so many of you, I do in fact plan to read all of King's books despite being let down by a few bad lemons. But, knowing this, knowing that so many readers will read on no matter what the hell King puts on the menu--shouldn't he take it upon himself to aim for a little less indulgence? If you cut all of the fat from Wolves you'd be left with one tasty little steak, perhaps a great short story that never got its chance to shine. Instead we have a book that simply doesn't do anything. You know from the get-go what's going to happen in the end and in King's own words (out of Roland's mouth)--that's only worth 5 minutes of actual fun and those five minutes--after a several hour investment--simply do not pay off. I was bored out of my f---ing mind listening to this overblown and obvious tale and I didn't even have Frank Muller as the reader to help me get through the journey. On that note, I truly hope Mr. Muller is on the mend. King ... well ... he's written his tale to its conclusion and so be it. But if Cell, a very mediocre book, is the indication of where King's going--is the best of him behind us now 
 This book is about a writer who splits up with his long-term boyfriend, becomes depressed, and then becomes friends with a young boy (I think 10? 12? I don't remember) over the phone who was abused and used in a kiddy porn ring by his parents before escaping only to learn he had AIDs and writing a book on it. Except as the book goes on, it becomes questionable whether the kid actually exists.  All well and good, but what really makes the book stand out isn't the storyline. Noooo. It's the slashy overtones where there REALLY REALLY SQUICKILY SHOULDN'T BE ANY! I should NOT get the idea that this abused kid is this middle-aged author's fantasy. No, no, NO.  I felt dirty after reading this. I felt even more dirty after finding out via wikipedia that the author based it on a real life experience of it.  This is a scary scary man, and makes me want a long long bath. 
 ...Or the other reviews.  Those reviews probably came from someone in their camp.  When I first saw these two, I said "no they did not!"  If you go to a music  store it n the rap section and look through it, you will find knock-offs of known and real rappers.  These guys have their names for the simple reason of trying to confuse a would be buyer of Mobb Deep.  These two clowns are nothing more than sucker MC's trying to get a dollar off of someone else's hard earned names.  If you are new to hip-hop or just young, there IS a reason rappers used to talk about something called a sucker MC(a fake rapper, someone without skills, someone you hear and you know they should not be rapping) and these clowns are it 
 I have two issues with this book: First, the information is far too basic to be of use to anyone with even minimal restaurant and/or marketing experience. For instance, the authors use highlight boxes to define ultra-basic terms like "discount pricing" (even the definitions are obvious: "pricing ... to generate more customer traffic.") The second problem I have is that the authors and publisher misrepresent what this book is about. If you look at the chapter titles, this book is nothing more than a simplistic how-to-open-a-restaurant book - yet they are selling it as a marketing guide for owners and managers.  Here's some examples of chapter titles - Does this sound like an oversimplified start-up guide?  Chapter 1: What am I getting in to? Chapter 2: Location: Where am I going to put his place? Chapter 4: Who are my customers? Chapter 5: Menu Development Chapter 6: How much do I charge for this stuff? Unless you have zero business know-how and absolutely no restaurant experience this is DEFINITELY a book not to waste your money on. 
 There are better live performances of Meters and related material out there. This concert seems thin in its sound texture, not very powerful, and generally and uninspired. In contrast, george Porter Jr and the Runnin' Pardners'CD, Things aint what they used to be, is much tighter and energized, and the real horns are great. So get that one if you can find i 
 This book was so different from the usual NR story.  The burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic.  If you want romance, skip this.  It also seemed to take forever to get the book set up 
 I was disappointed with this book because I expected more substance on how to cure cat behavioral problems.  Most of what was presented in the book was common sense.  The book also doesn't offer any in-depth case histories and therapy plans for cats with particular problems.  I feel this book would be useful for someone who knows little about cats.  However, if you are familar with cats and their basic needs, this book doesn't offer much more insight than most people would know.  I expected more from a well-known behaviorist.  If you are really looking for an in-depth book on pet behavior that is more useful, read Pam Johnson-Bennett's "Psycho Kitty" book.  I found it to be absolutely excellent. 
 I bought this drive primarily to keep on my keychain and because the cap wrapped around the body and I would not have to worry abut loosing caps.  This worked well for about 2 months when, after the normal wear and tear of taking my keys out of my pocket, the cap popped at the point that conects to the key ring. I say popped not broke because the cap is made out of rubber-like material that I now realise is a glorified rubber band. Sport indeed.   I had to resort to keeping the drive loose in my pockets, have long since lost the fragile thing, and am now wishing I had the frustration of loosing caps for a drive that is sucurely attached to my key ring 
 This is a nice DVD, if you don't mind that 27.9 percent of the original theatrical image has been removed for the DVD exhibition, so that the DVD image fills your entire 4:3 television screen (theatrical aspect ratio - 1.85:1; DVD aspect ratio - 4:3).  If you're okay with that, enjoy! 
 Quite possibly the most overpriced crappy wine glasses anyone could find.  They're exactly like the wine glasses you'd find at a hotel bar -- short, with a rolled lip, and designed to be washed in a dishwasher over and over.  Heavy and indestructible.  Not what I think of when I think of crystal 
 I am a huge fan of Kathy Reichs' novels and of the TV Series, Bones. However, this book was quite a disappointment to me. I did not care for the way the author wrote dialogue -- Brennan's dialog is not that simplimatic on the TV program, and she certainly would never say, "Where at!?" The author way overused the joke where Brennan did not "know what that means."  All I could think of was how much better this novel would have been if written by Reichs herself.  I started to jot down the holes in the story but quit after a while 
 "The Other Boleyn Girl" and "The Queen's Fool" are two of the best books I've ever read--and I've read a LOT of books, especially about this period, which especially fascinates me. They were gripping to the end, and my involvement with the characters was complete--true masterpieces. So whenever a new book by Philippa Gregory comes out, I buy it, hoping to have the same experience, and lately have been sorely disappointed. "The Virgin's Lover" fell flat, and now I am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged, must give it up. One reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly--that is always an easy guess, however it depends on the writer. Anthony Trollope, for instance, was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed. That may or may not be the case with Gregory. I know, as a writer myself, that there are times when the work flows out, feeling almost as if it's channeled from another source, and times when it's harder, more mechanical. The more challenging situations are those when I'm not entirely convinced or in love with my subject. So to me, neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse. They feel forced, constructed. I'm going back to Trollope 
 This component was returned because it was not compatible with my Dell all-in-one printer. I was not alerted to this possibility by any information from the manufacturer, from the supplier, or in print on the package. I should have been 
 I don't know what to say about this book. It is the single worst book I have ever read in my young life.  I feel like I've witnessed a horrible tragedy and am at a loss for words to describe it.  I would say at some point in the book, maybe about halfway, every line of dialogue, every characterization, every plot point, is absolutely terrible.  This book is truly an offense to literacy, and I cannot understand how a publisher of any merit or author could publish and print this trash.  I can only imagine that Robin Cook either allowed a child to write this book,or was chronically drunk while writing it. Either that or he has lost his faculties altogether. I have read children's essays that have been better written. While it would take a novel to explain all the problems with this book, the highlights are: -knowing the mystery 50 pages into the book and being forced to painfully watch the dumb characters discover the mystery -cliche mania with lines like, "I going to get to the bottom of this mystery" and when the character's discover something, giving each other high-fives. -racist remarks about blacks living in harlem about how they like to steal televisions, own guns, and play basketball. -stereotype characters such as mafioso that like to eat spaghetti and named dominick and vinny. -incredible suspension of disbelief when the heros, nyc coroners, fly off to africa on a moments notice because they want to finish their case of a dead body. (also paying for their friends to come too) -wandering around the main installation easily where the evildoers are working, and asking questions, and getting answers to them real easy. -incredible annoying characters that make inappropriate jokes. (i.e. making sarcastic remarks to a guy holding a gun on them) -the book spirals into total madness in the last 50 pages to a beyond implausible ending. I got a sense whoever wrote the end of book was on sleeping pills when he wrote it. If anyone thinks this book is better than two stars, they need their head examined. 
 I was really looking forward to listening to this CD because it brings so many great memories to me.  But after i spent a long time prying it open, I was shocked and very disappointed to see that there wasn't even a CD in the box!!!  How does this happen?  I ordered it new.  I am being credited and I will receive a new one next week.  I hope the same thing doesn't happen 
 I bought this book with a lot of hope and enthusiasm but unfortunately found that the recommended exercises were not right for me. In fact they hurt and made my back worse. I did find a therapist who gave me massages and exercises which worked and I'm now without any pain 
 While I myself had not actually read the book, the problems I see with this work is tautologically apparent.  PIAS works on an objective, logical truth that far exceeds mankinds framed reference of what can be epistemically available.  Recent works have started to combine the gap between current science, and the emerging postmodernist methodologies to create a holistically balanced approach (I refer the reader to  Sokal 1996).  Our job as subjective viewers is to wait in the sidelines until the field codifies itself, but until then, reserve judgement.  
 I knew before I started reading Candice Bushnell's Sex and the City it was not the HBO series, so that wasn't a surprise. What was a surprise is that this so-called "author" is about as literary as a discarded apple core. There's nothing smart nor funny in this book. Bushnell's writing is flat, lifeless, and dull. This book does nothing but cast a spotlight on the empty, materialistic, shallow, insecure lives of New York's wealthy and "beautiful people." She never casts an opinion about these pathetic souls, so you're constantly asking the question, why should I care about any of these characters. Not one character has a redeeming quality, and poor Carrie is portrayed as a self-involved, border-line alcoholic--no wonder no one wants her. Not one character in Sex and the City is interesting, witty, or even identifiable with anyone who doesn't share the same shallow emptiness. The only thing the book imparts is a grateful feeling that you are not one of these pathetic losers. I'm grateful that Darren Star and Michael Patrick King were able to transform this piece of garbage into a witty, vibrant, sexy television series that will be remembered far longer than this wretched piece of effluvium 
 Ulrich leads up to believe that the likes named here are the holy grail of best practice. The list of names reads like the book of deadbeats and the academically challenged, Agilent thrashed its self to a fraction of its former glory by the people he named and we are supposed to kneel in worship. Its leaders were clueless buffoons.  The other three reviewers must be Ulrichs relatives, or on the payroll. If you take on board this rubbish, do your current employer a favour and find work in another field of endeavour. 
 First off, the graphic novel is and will be better than a movie, novelization, play, interpretative dance, or whatever other form you want to put it in. Why? Because graphic novels/comics are a medium which cannot duplicated. As a reader you are much more actively involved in the story than passively watching a movie. With the page in your hand you may stare at it as long as you like, flip it upside down, flip back to a page previous, or any other number of things us crazy folks do who read these wonderful masterpieces of our time.   To correct the person who, incorrectly, pointed to the artist of this work (Mr. David Lloyd) as disapproving of the film, it was not the artist who protested it's creation, it was the author, Mr. Alan Moore. Just as he has with the other hideously molested adaptations of his work (From Hell, Leauge of Extraordinary Gentleman) he did not want to have anything to with this million dollar money trap. He has several reasons which you may find out by simply searching for any number of interviews with him, but basically he does not approve of this and all other big budget, no substance movies that are produced solely for the purpose of extorting money from   parents through their children, while offering no real meaning or substance other than an orgy of explosions and bastardizations of once meaningful tales. He gives his portion of the proceeds to the artists involved.  Also in the correction department, this series began in 1982 and was published until 1985 in the UK's Warrior magazine, alongside other great works such as Marvelman (originally being in black and white). Upon the success of Moore in the mid to late eighties, with such work as Watchmen and his revitalization of the Swamp Thing series, DC decided to 'resurrect' V and thus Moore and Lloyd continued the series to its conclusion.   If you want to experience V for Vendetta the way it was meant to be, go to your local comic shop and pick up a copy of the trade, you won't be disappointed (unless you're a mindless idiot who eats up whatever bs movie comes down the pike for whatever mindless reason, in that case there's no hope anyway, how'd you even get to this webpage??).    "Hello the Voice of Fate and V for Vendetta. 
 I usually enjoy Ms. Maron's Deborah Knott books very much. The characters are well drawn and give deep insight into Southern life. This one, however, is very flat and the characters are poorly drawn and one dimensional. The first murder doesn't seem to contribut anything to the storyline and is just "there". The second one involving Dwight's son (who is a very poorly developed child character) and his ex wife is not very interesting.   I devoutly hope this was the nadir of the series and it will improve after this. Probably not, though-I foresee several storylines involving husband/stepmother/stepchild conflicts. Glad I checked it out from the library and didn't purchase it outright..do the same and don't waste your money 
 Mr. Haqqani's views about his mother country are very dubious. The only question I have for the author as he served in some very corrupt governments as their partner...What has he done for his home land? Nothing!!! This book in waste of time. 
 Just when you thought they were through making those stupid, boring, pointless COTC movies, they throw this one at you! The script is stupid and a waste of time. It really does not follow the whole COTC point. In part one, when they reached a certain age, they were supposed to die. And now, however many years later, Isaac returns, as an adult, and they think nothing of it... All I can say that is good about this movie, is Isaac's voice is not nearly as annoying as it was in the first one..That would be the only good point to it. Bottom line: Stay away from this whole series. It's not worth it 
 Two months after ordering the magazine I have yet to receive a single issue 
 I am disappointed and I haven't even read it yet.  If anything Steve has written and quoted out of the book is correct then it is just another case of the blind leading the blind.  Please read his review and decide for yourself.  I still plan to buy the book but as with everything else I will take it with a huge chunk of salt.  Sounds to me like the so called "Conservatives" have just put out another book to "unbiasedly" support their positions and make it easier to swallow by the masses.  There is no such thing as a conservative any more.  If you want to get back to constitutional government, go check out the Libertarian party and view their positions.  They come the closest to truly supporting a government of the people, by the people and for the people.  The rest of them are still just self serving and don't want to let go of their power and your money.  Dan  
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 Alright, first of all, I have read dozens of books on nutrition and weight, etc., many of which were inspiring and very helpful. I highly doubt that many women in 2006 lack general nutrition knowledge, but if they do, it can be found easily online or in the library. Dr. Northrup's advice was ludicrous. 30 grams of carbs per day? I was encouraged when she began by citing Geneen Roth, but things deteriorated from there until I wanted to throw the book out the window. If anyone is looking for a mind-body approach to food, please, PLEASE do not read Dr. Northrup's chapter on "nutrition." Instead, I would recommend Fed Up by Dr. Wendy Oliver-Pyatt, Eating Mindfully by Dr. Susan Albers, any book by Geneen Roth, or even How Much Does Your Soul weigh, by Dr. Dorie McCubbrey. These books adress eating mindfully, allowing yourself to enjoy the foods you love while paying attention to your body's responses. Dr. Northrup's "nutrition" chapter is just another externally driven, trendy, but ultimately ineffective attempt to control weight and promote health (She calls herself a "sugar addict" and if you want information about that, read something like sugar busters (until you figure out that ALL diets will never work long-term). Anyway, I think she's a nut, and I wish that consumers were more perceptive and less desperate and likely to grasp at straws like Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom. 
 I bought Sarah Canary when it was first published years ago.  I started reading it then and stopped early on.  Recently I tried to read it again.  I went further but once again lost interest, this time half way though the book.  I won't try again, I'm afraid, since I'm getting too old to give books more than two fair attempts.  I agree with the other reviewers, however, that this book may appeal to someone with a different, quirkier, and more complex sense of humour.    
 I purchased this item for my son's birthday.  Not well built as it needed lots of tape to keep it together and readjustments after each attempt to fly it.  Also appears to need the wind just right and thrown a certain way in order for it to fly.  After a couple of  days we were able to accomplish only one 2 min. successful flight.    On the second day, after 15 mins of recharging the battery, the battery case and wires melted.  Have contacted company for a refund.  
 This was the most boring, unimaginal work I have ever read. It was totally sensless 
 Therese, Lux, Mary, Bonnie and Cecilia make up the five Lisbon girls, ages 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. Cecilia, the youngest, lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors. As a cry for help, she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub, she survived the incident. After a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon that it would be benificial for Cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age, Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only Lisbon party. Some of the neighborhood's boys are invited over and while the party is in session, Cecilia is pretty inanimate, sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt, talk and laugh. Midway through the party, Cecilia asks to be excused and Mrs. Lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it. Cecilia goes up to her room (on the second floor of a two-story house) and jumps out the window, landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the Lisbon house. In this way, Cecilia Lisbon commited suicide. Only four girls remain.  The act which Cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed. The father saw her immediately, the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum. Four of the Lisbon's neighbors, four young boys, suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the Lisbon girls, who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world. They got hold of Cecilia's diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide. The eldest decided Cecilia was a dreamer, and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window, she thought she would fly.  With their youngest sister gone, the remaining Lisbon girls grow closer to each other, stranding themselves further from the outside world. When school starts again, they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened, not ever mentioning their youngest sister. The run-of-the-mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however. The usual profuse apology to the mention of the word "death" and the like.  Trip Fontaine is the most popular guy in school, the object of desire to all of the girls at school... Except for the Lisbon girls, which is of no importance to Trip until he sets eyes on Lux. Trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty. In the beginning, he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she's not interested. But after his consistent courtship, Lux falls for his charming ways. Trip then attempts to convince Mr. Lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the Lisbon daughters to Homecoming. After Mr. Lisbon talks to his wife, he agrees to Trip's request, knowing nothing but Trip's sincerity and claimed honorable intentions, on the understanding that Trip have all of the Lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew.  After Trip explains the situation to his football peers, he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely. Meanwhile, the Lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the Homecoming Dance. Though one pattern is used for all four dresses, each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail. Once they pick up the girls, they stop midway to the Homecoming in order to smoke, Lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke. They then drive to the dance. Trip and Lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol. Another one of the Lisbon sisters and her date follow, but leave soon afterwards, not being as wild nor daring as Trip and Lux. At the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew, they are all there... Except for Trip and Lux, who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field. Deciding they must make their own curfews, Therese, Bonnie, Mary and their dates leave without them. After fooling around, the intoxicated Trip and Lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium. Trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves Lux there alone. When Lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why Trip is not there. She takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick (of course). But they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the Lisbon residence.  The girls, in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world, begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives. One of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls. Soon following, the boys begin talking to the Lisbon girls via phone. One day, the girls invite the boys to come over once Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon are asleep. The plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere, the boys hastily agree. They sneak over and Lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and Lux goes to wait in the car. The boys wander down to the basement while waiting for Therese, Bonnie and Mary, verbally expressing their hopes for the night. But then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters. She had hung herself. The boys, scared to death, run all the way home. Time passed, things changed, girls came and went... But no matter what, those four boys NEVER forgot the Lisbon suicides.  Ultimately, the movie was nothing short of queer. When trying to sum up the story in a few lines (such as "Follow the lives of the Lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors. A story full of obsession, gossip, lust, love, desire and isolation.") the story sounds quite unique and intriguing, but the story fell short of that for me personally. Partly because the Lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation. The movie, in places, is also extremely flawed. I do not believe Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon could've removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services. In many parts of the movie, they should've used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences. The whole movie was filmed in a style that I can truthfully say makes me rather bored. I would only suggest this film to, perhaps, people who like movies such as "Elizabethtown" which Kirsten Dunst is also in. But I personally disliked this movie which was not very tasteful and will not be watching it again in the future 
 First off the company I work for ordered three of these.  One out of the three did not work.  There is no sound comming from the right side and it isn't the speaker as we have tried different speakers.  Amazon will not take it back and will not exchange it for another one.  This is just the start.  The two that do work work very poorly.  The connecotor for the iPod is very flimsey and feels like it will break off.  They give you inserts to use depending on what model iPod you have.  These inserts prevent the iPod from sliding all the way down so when you use them the iPod will not work.  Also, the CD player has a lid that opens with a motor.  Yes, a motor.  So, if you push it down when it is open it will close but this throws off the gears as it is very sensitive and now the damn things don't close all the way.  You need to use the open/close button to prevent this but natural reaction is to push the lid down when it is open.  All of the buttons are very clumbsy and confusing.  The sound is not that great at all!  There are a TON of wires with this thing.  Power, speaker, antenna and iPod firewire type connector all run between the speakers, subwoofer and main unit. This is not a good product and has been a nightmare for my department. 
 I was excited when I saw the price because I'd been looking for a cheap cordless that had an answering machine. I love the answering machine and the features that come with it. My problem is with the headset; it is very hard to hear the person on the other end. I have to have the volume all the way up, but then I have to talk softly because I'll hear myself YELLING and can BARELY hear the person on the other end. I have to be in a quiet room with no kids, TV or dogs to hear and use this phone, and most of the time, that just isn't possible. 
 This film is laughably bad. The entire plot is completely unrealistic and it is difficult to have any sympathy for the cruel murderer who is central to the plot, who is not only a murderer but also totally retarded, missing numerous opportunities to escape and make life easier for himself and the saps who for some random reason have taken it upon themselves to look after him. This film is an absolute waste of time, but feel free to watch it if you feel like wasting 107 minutes of your life 
 To anyone who has endured corporate life at a sub-executive level, the title of this book will be seen as a dead giveaway to the underlying motives of its authors and those to whom they pander.  The book's message? When one is too greedy a bastard to pay employees a fair wage, simply devise schemes that make them temporarily forget that they are being exploited.  Such short-term distractions allow the "chosen ones" to continue creaming off profits for themselves.  It doesn't take much time to figure out that there is a chasm between executive rewards (e.g., multi-million dollar payouts, regardless of performance) and the scattered bones thrown to an organization's "little people".  [... 
 I've ordered the collection with one thought in mind: ohh boy! a good irish collection.  i was astonished to hear SYNTHESIZED(!) music instead of the real instruments - no violins here, no bagpipes, no flutes!  only synthesized music! this collection had much potential but it was killed!  not to mention the annoying rain sounds. ok - their nice for starts but they dont stop all thru the album and sometimes the music gets engulfed in them totaly.  BAD 
 Before I started reading "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," the book had a lot going for it: stellar reviews on the cover, an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at Walden Books in Pocatello.  Unfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good.  I'm not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise. In "Zen" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s. But the story, I guess, is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology.  The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page  17:      "The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower."  That passage is good. The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of "quality."   I'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth. It's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better. The author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.   Whatever the book was supposed to be, it didn't impressed me.  
 i hated this book with a paaion. i had to read it in english class last year ansd it was the worst book i have every read in my entire life. dont read it!! 
 Nothing against Ian Fleming. Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't get into this book. The Bond movies are more exciting than the books 
 Alright, this is the last time I buy one of LKH books new, even from Amazon, from now on, used only, I'd rather spend the money buying the latest Kim Harrison hardcover. I know LKH doesn't care anymore, she's just collecting a paycheck, I encourage all others like me who are waiting for her books to get better to just buy them either in paperback or used maybe then she and her publisher will get the hint.  Her books should be moved to the erotica category and not be put in with the regular books.  
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 I must disagree with the people who have given this book five stars. Like many of them, I believe Ben Hogan was - and is - the greatest technician the game has ever seen. This book is, however, a disappointment.   The book can be broadly divided into two sections. The first is an account of John Schlee's Maximum Golf school. It covers Tom Bertrand's work with Schlee,  Schlee's relationship with Hogan, and his use of Hogan's techniques in his teaching. The second section is a breakdown of Hogan's swing fundamentals, including points that he hit upon AFTER publishing his 'Five Lessons' book.  The first section of this book provided an opportunity for an in-depth look at John Schlee and Hogan. It can hardly be coincidence that Hogan, a very singular character, chose Schlee - an equally singular character - as one of the few to whom he confided the secrets of his life's work. A thorough examination of these two men, their characters, and the parallels between them, would have been fascinating. It may also have shed some light on the nature of the relationship between golf and character. (I can't think of another sport with such potential appeal to character traits like obsession, perfectionism, even masochism.) While this is, at the end of the day, an instruction book, I would have loved to have seen the authors try to shed some light on Hogan & Schlee's characters through their golf - their approach to the game, their methods, techniques, goals and systems. It would have greatly enriched the book. It could have even added some depth of understanding of the techniques themselves. Perhaps most importantly, such an attempt may have given dignity to, and acknowledged the memory of, John Schlee. He deserved a better hand than Life dealt him in his last years. This book does not do him justice.  The instructional section of the book is at best, adequate. Much is made by the authors of their "tracking Hogan's secret" chronologically - which is nothing more or less than a quick run through Hogan's writing and interviews as to what he revealed and when. This section is not illuminating for anyone with even a passing knowledge of Hogan. Lastly, the detail of the swing moves and fundamentals themselves are set out briefly, with photos as visual aids. While adequate, they lack the flavour, clarity and depth that Hogan, Herbert Warren Wind and (illustrator) Anthony Ravelli employed with such skill and care in Hogan's 'Five Lessons.'  In short, this book strikes me as a magazine article that has been padded out with the intention of cashing in on Hogan's mystique and the obsessive need that golfers have to tinker with their swings. It serves as a pedestrian, adequate piece of instruction, but it's a missed opportunity. It is poorly written and it lacks ambition. It could have, and should have, been so very much more 
 The Movie was bad and unreal and so was the soundtrack, spend your money elsewher 
 My first Nora Roberts' book....with only be persistent did I complete the book....found it to be very slow paced with an unrealistic storyline...shallow characterizatio 
 Slim Jims may taste ok but that's because they are so greasy. That's what helps the flavor. I can't figure out why anyone would like these as I can't seem to chew them to a point where I feel comfortable to swallow. It's like eating a really really tough piece of gristle meat.  The amount of fat, cholesterol etc is also higher than beef jerky. I'd rather eat beef jerky than this stuff. At least I can chew the beef jerky 
 Eric redding and his wife d'eva..Authored a book of anna nicole back in 1996. Basically the first edition of this book. Must admit a great read the first time, especially the first half...till they started that cut and paste job. You would think with all the negtive reviews on that...they would have changed that up a bit.  But nope they didnt. This book was an obvious attempt in a way to cash in on anna nicole death. And people who act like there so above her no less. Which is funny.  The book does not reveal any new information that it was promised. It has been in the making for aleast 6 years. As far as 2001 I recall Eric saying in an interview that they were doing another book on anna nicole, that would reveal never before seen pictures, even more interviews and more secrets from Anna's lesbain past. This book did none of that at all. What is even worse is the pictures are in black and white.  I suggest if you have the first copy, don't even bothere with the second one, it gives you nothing new at all. If you know nothing of anna nicole go to a libary and read the first half, after that, it's nothing you can't find out in any tabliod in america. My goodness couldnt they have done something better then this ?  Claiming to once be "friends" with her, yeah for what a year ? I mean seeing as anna nicole is there only way of making a living you would think they would have followed her better.  This book mentions nothing at all of anna nicole's career in the late 90's or anything of her life at all. It skips all over her singing career, her time in europe, when she first lost the weight, her fall out with playboy, her lovers, and her time is Miss republic of courver gold.  It goes from 1995 to 2006, like that. Like it was nothing at all. I mean really they could have done much better.  This book was a huge dissapointment.  Oh and There attitude towards anna that stuck up attitude d'vea has, something in the book about the only nice words for anna was "golddiger" Gee if your so digusted with her, why write a book about her ? 
 As someone trying to read Neruda for the second time, I was surprised that I could recognize that the translation was poor.  I had only read five of his other poems, and somehow after reading three poems from this volume I knew something was amiss.  The translations were more confusing than the Spanish, and my spanish is poor.  In many instances the translator chose words that were unnecessarily complex to convey something that could be expressed more simply and clearly in English and still remain true to the author's original words.  The only reason I logged onto Amazon.com was to see if the reviews also cited poor translation as a problem with the volume, so I would know I was not just a poor reader 
 I didn't realize how out of date this book was, or I would not have bought it.  The book makes 80s-era references when it comes to diet, nutrition, and other books about fitness.  He suggests that you'd better plan to spend a whole $45 dollars on a good pair of running shoes!  The author is readable, and his personal experiences are somewhat interesting.  But although he is an M.D., there seems to be no scientific basis for his recommendations - it is all based on his personal experience 
  I was disappointed by this book. It does not help me to understand the 'truth' about global warming. Patrick Michael's subjective ranting throughout the book can be labelled 'humour', and 'readability', but I have to say that, for me, the rhetorical devices just put me off. It's just sensationalising the subject.  I can understand that he may feel he has a point here, and he may have one, I don't know (still), but, as a scientist, I find it impossible to take what he says seriously when it is just littered with remarks that would be better placed in a tabloid newspaper.  He makes some good points about the links between science, media and funding - how organisations will link issues to the cute and furry animals and so on in order to get more support. But these have been made many years ago, and aren't news to me as a social scientist. Ditto for the difficulties for attributing causality (p.128).  What I find, as with Lomborg's book, is that these authors are so busy building a rebuttal to an argument that they themselves produce 'evidence' that is just as biased, if not more so, the other way, and this reduces their credibility to anyone who is not already convinced that they are right. Relying on the rhetoric of powerful soundbites to get those who agree with him is not going to convince those of us who are really trying to learn here.   
 The art of writing and negotiation has come a long way since the ole Herb wrote this book. His stories present him as an argumentative, cheap, old-fashioned man with a distant relationship with his wife.  His first kibble of advice is to annoy a salesperson at a one-price store (read as "department store") until they eventually agree to knock a few bucks off the price. I guess this supposed millionaires time is not that expensive 
 I've read a lot of Stephen King's work, and loved most of it, but 'Firestarter' was a big letdown!  It's not quite in the 'abomination' category of 'From a Buick 8', but at least King could blame that one on his car accident. This one is probably only about as good as 'The Tommyknockers.' The premise is great, but once it gets away from 'Andy and Charlie on the run', and becomes 'The Life Story of Tom Rainbird', it goes downhill very quickly! Not to knock King too much, but as this books goes along, it seems obvious that SK was losing interest, either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason, and wanted to 'explore' the supporting characters more; or simply because this book came out fairly early in King's career, when he was known to partake of certain 'substances' which he later swore off! Worth reading only if you really want to read every SK novel. Otherwise, just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one(with the exception of the two mentioned above) surpasses 'Firestarter' 
 This movie is an utter crap fest! I remember watching this film as a kid. Back then it was a scarry experience, watching it now is just plain mind numbing. This movie is beyond bad, and while some campy films can be quite entertaining, this is definitelly not one of those movies. Horrible acting, laughable demon makeups, zero excitement for horror fans. Don't waste your money on this crap, rent it before you consider buying it. 
 This pillow was too soft!  It needs to be firm enough to keep your knees apart which is the whole purpose in using a leg pillow in the first place.  This pillow was so soft that my knees ended up mashing it within minutes and therefore my knees were touching and the pillow was useless.  I don't recommend this for anyone who needs a pillow for knee support for proper spine alignment and back health. 
 This is one of my all-time favorite movies, but I was very disappointed with the DVD version.  In the middle of the movie, you will have to get up, go to your DVD player, and flip the DVD over to the second side to see the rest of the movie.  I don't know what bozo came up with that idea, but it defeats the purpose of relaxing and enjoying a good movie.  Who wants to get up and flip the DVD over in the middle of the suspense?  This format takes stupidity to the next level.  I would highly recommend the VHS since I have it and it's wonderful.  I would NOT recommend the DVD until they do a better version.  The packaging is in paper and not durable at all, another truly bad idea.  DVD's should be in plastic cases, not paper 
 this was certainly not one of Cornwell's best works.  IT was almost like a couple of possible novels rolled into one.  It read like a draft for a novel rather tahn a complete novel 
 It was difficult to get into reading this book, since I had just finished reading "Single: The Art of Being Satisfied, Fulfilled, and Independent" by Judy Ford (which I highly recommend over this book).  In my opinion, "Living Alone and Loving It" reads more like the author's autobiography of singleness than it does as a guide to actually "loving it".  It's not as matter-of-fact and loveable as "Single" was.  Barbara Feldon tends to get over-wordy where it isn't necessary, as if she was trying to write the great American novel when she wrote this.  It is nice to read her book and know that you're not alone in your singleness, but this book was almost down-right boring.  
 The cover of this DVD states that the available sound tracks are DOlby Digital 5.1 English and Japanese, and English and Japanese Stereo.  Alas the sound is only in DTS for Japanese.  I do not have DTS, so trying to listen to it produces a loud pop, then no sound whatsoever.  Very disappointing, to say the least.  NOw I'm forced to watch with English, which I NEVER do with non-English material.  Boo, hiss 
 Unlike Donaldson's first "Chronicles" trilogy (arguably one of the finest epic fantasys ever written), this pretentious attempt at hard-boiled detective fiction is inauthentic, tiresome, and a complete waste of the reader's time.  I got my copy for free, and I still feel cheated!  If you want to read something worthwhile in this genre, check out something by Raymond Chandler, Andrew Vachss, or David Cray -- even the worst mass-market fluff by that hack Robert Parker is far better than this travesty!  Have you no shame, Mister Donaldson 
 I'm sorry no as a matter of fact I am not sorry this doll looks like she can be in three six mafia video dancing in the background. Who told Mattel that this was a good idea? Is this Mattel's vein attempt to give the dolls an "urban" feel if Mattel feels this is appropriate to teach young girls to dress like ho's and teach them that their body is all that they have to offer then Mattel has some messed up views of the world. Honestly people this doll is not innocent looking it looks like it could be on that HBO documentary about hookers. What happened to the times when a kid could be a kid and play with a normal looking doll.  
 I was disappointed that the "Open Your Eyes (Baloobalot Hot House Piano Dub)" by Rhythm Scholar was not on this CD.  It's really the only Donovan worth listening to.  Skip this and get something by Ochwat & Sam or Spanky My Monkey instead 
 Personally, I'm not so sure whether Searle really gets it. In my opinion he really downplays power relations and differences that are a major part of social reality. This book is best juxtaposed with a book that does address conflict and interrelations between indviduals, i.e. Pierre Bourdieu's work 
 This book deserves a point for an original idea, but that was the only thing it had going for it. The author might have been trying to make some sort of point by skipping from one scene to the next with no warning, but all it came off was a confusing plot that made little or no sense. Don't waste your money or time on this one 
 Somehow this author managed to make an interesting topic into and unreadable uninteresting book. It read like a 328 page book report 
 I unfortunately wasn't able to use this book as much as possible because it was the wrong edition.  The material inside the book was okay, but some chapters ended abruptly and left you wondering if you missed information 
 Bad Movie, Bad action and you don't get to see almoust anything....   tho words : money waiste 
 Very beginner. Slow as can be. If you are just starting Yoga let this be your instructional DVD.  NOT FOR THE EXPERIENCED. 
 I turn to these reviews to help me decide on a purchase.  Unfortunately, in this case, the reviews are almost worthless because they are obvious plugs by the publisher, author or their friends.  There are even two identical reviews back to back.  This system needs some screening to make reviews of these types of products relevant and not self-serving hype 
 I was dismayed to find that this audio book is simply a laundry listing (in an "advice o'the day" format) of tidbits of wisdom. The wisdom offered is good, mind you, but if you are looking for something to stimulate and entertain you (eg on a long car ride) you will likely be disappointed. I can only listen to about 4 or 5 tidbits before I lose interest 
 So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my opinion 
 So ... I now learn that the infertility problems I had for many years, which I always thought were due to polycystic ovaries and failure to ovulate were ACTUALLY due to the fact that I hate my husband, didn't want to have children with him or was simply ambivilent about motherhood. And my rather lengthy (but normal) labor was also due soley to my ambivilence about motherhood. And, presumably, any peronality quirks my daughter might have are due to some oddity about my labor and her birth, as Dr. Northrup's daughter's problems are mostly attributable to a 'too fast' second stage because she had pitocin.   There is some good stuff here, and it's certainly good for a woman to educate herself about her body, so she can avoid AVOIDABLE problems and understand what is normal, and find medical caregivers that fit her needs ... but so much of the book is based on the idea that almost anything that goes wrong is due to 'wrong thinking' (and conversely, if you just think (and behave ... mostly through an all natural,  mostly vegetarian, dairy-free, caffeine-free, alcohol-free, and sugarfree diet) properly, nothing will ever go wrong.  
 This book isn't on my favorites list. To me, the plot was confusing and took to many twists. And at some points the word choice was unskillful and didn't have a fluency it needed. It might just be because this book is truely for younger readers then I am, I'm an odd rater, or this book isn't the best in the world. I really just didn't get hooked at all. I'm not really requesting it for tweens or over. Or for anyone honestly. I request 'The last dog on earth' much more then this book. I liked that one MUCH better 
 I think that this is a great idea and a very cute plush, but I immediately encountered some problems with the toy that I think are worth mentioning.  First, the battery box is very poorly designed.  Once you have opened the velcro cavity in the dog's tummy, it's nearly impossible to keep it closed again.  The dog's hairs get caught in the velcro and the battery box is too big so the cavity keeps busting open.  Now, if I handle the toy, the box keeps falling out!   My second comment is that the sound effects are pretty bad.  The sounds quality is poor and it doesn't always sound like a dog 
 I cannot believe people actually worship a cold blooded serial killer just like Stalin. He is not a hero or revolutionary icon, he is a murderer and it was about time that someone had caught this dimwit and executed him.   He was also responsible for the torture of prisoners and anyone who had opposing views on the man was executed.     
 There are a ton of errors in this book (including listing Roland Hanna playing piano of Charles Mingus's Mingus ah Um, when it was actually Horace Parlan). Plus ALLMUSIC.COM will list a cd at 3 stars, and this book will list it at 5, and vice versa. The reviews are supposed to be in chronological order, but are frequently out of order. But THE MOST ANNOYING, is the enormous amount of 2 or 3 star reviews that end with, "essential music", "great music", "must have". Then the next review will be 5 stars and end with "not all that essential" or a causual "worth a listen". Buy music, not thi 
 This documentary is poorly produced, has terrible sound quality and stereotypical "life affirming" stories.  There was nothing in here to support Wal-Mart, their business practices or their philosophy 
 The only pointer I got from this book was that posture and breathing are very important in correcting back and neck problems.  These facts reinforced facts already known.  Better exercises can be found elsewhere 
 This rating dont even deserve 1 star this book sucks!!!!!!!!! Do not waste your money on this crap 
 First, I will confess that this is the first time I have bought one of Dozois "best of" books new rather than used.  I have never considered his collections worth paying full price, but amongst the dross I have always found two or three real gems that was I glad to discover.  I have come to conclude these gems must have been included by complete accident.  When I saw "Best of the Best", I assumed that he had decided to put out a book spanning several years, using gems only, skipping the filler.  Well, I was wrong, and feel cheated out of the price of this book!  I slogged through page after page of stories ranging from mediocre to poor, with nary a gem in sight.  I understand that Dozios did not actually write these stories, and therefore did not create the turgid prose, sloppy plotting, hackneyed and pedestrian themes, and uninteresting characters that fill these stories.  He is, however, responsible for choosing them and holding them up to the public as the "best" examples of a genre that has so much more to offer than a reader unfamiliar with science fiction might conclude it does based upon this book 
 If you're thinking of reading this book, let me save you some time--don't.  I like a good literary read as much as the next guy (really), and make it a point to read all the Pulitzer winners, but this book, in perfectly plain English, sucked.  There is no plot, no beginning, middle or end, and is so tedious and boring that I actually started reading it from the back forward.  It didn't help, but it didn't make a wit of difference either.  Do your self a favor and skip it 
 To rate this item is a waste of time.  I read it.  It obviously came from a person who has no leadership qualities.  Leaders all believe different things.  I am, in fact, fiscally conservative and a staunch defender of freedom, civil liberities, and the USA.  So, when Fidel came to my doorstep as a topic, I knew he was dog.   But wait....then I read history - Fidel's, his dad's, Che's, Kennnedy's, Jesus's, etc.  What marks a leader?  The label good or bad changes from decade to decade with each new generation digging into history differently.  Again, what marks a a true leader?  My conclusion was that a true leader defends his (or her) beliefs period.  History will bring to light different opinions based thereon forever.  Villians will become heroes and heroes will become villians.  But those men (and women) who are willing to stand alone against great odds and then inspire others to do likewise are true leaders.  Fidel is one, no one can deny that;  the question is could you stand alone on such a tough landscape as he did against such a powerful and physically close enemy as the US was to him?   Most likely, no.  His tactics, called communist, socialist, or whatever, were simply that....tactics.  He did not care what he had to do to preserve his country's independence from the USA.  From a conservative such as myself, Fidel is the strongest leader we have seen this century and definitely in contention with FDR, Hitler, and Stalin in pure strength.  If the USA were in someone else's shadow, I would hope that a leader would staunchly defend her so.  I can entirely put myself in his shoes.  Can you?    Good and bad are definitions left to God not us 
 I got this book based on the overall good rating it got and the fact that I like romantic supsense type of books. This one, however, didn't make the mark. The romance portion was barely there and seemed far-fetched. And I wasn't the least bit afraid while reading this book. No good suspense factor for me. I also found that I could put this book down for long periods of time and not be compelled to pick it up again. All in all, I found it to be a waste of my time...I don't think I would try to read another book by this author again 
 I recently read "I", "K", and "L" in succession.  Compared to "Innocent" and "Killer", I found Lawless to be slow paced (even though this edition finds Kinsey spontaneously traveling across the country) and the plot twists less surprising.  With others I've read in the series, I am usually hooked relatively early in the story line.  I was 1/3 of the way through this iteration before becoming mildly interested in the outcome.  Even the subplots were not overly attention grabbing (Kinsey has little contact with immediate family, ergo she substitutes others in her life--Henry, Rosie, Pitt family, the criminal elements in this book--as her family...).  I also found it hard to believe that some of the characters that appear in "L" could be so dim-witted on one page, and great possessors of vast knowledge with incredible powers of deduction on the next.  Anyway, there are others in this series I would recommend more highly ("M" being one of them) 
 If you're a fan of Wagner's Ring Cycle of operas, you'll be disappointed by this (which Prof. Hatto freely admits in the introduction.)  The real Nibelungenlied, for the most part, lacks the "balls" of Wagner.  However, the amazingly bloody fight scene at the end is memorable and masterfully composed. Hatto's prose translation is readable but sort of flat.  It has a fairy-tale lilt to it at times, which more often than not comes across sounding juvenile. The story consists of two distinct sections with decidedly different flavors, indicating that the poet composed it out of two pre-existing stories that didn't exactly fit together.  The first part deals with the wooing of Brunhilde and the death of Sigfried.  A wealth of detail from other versions of this story is unfortunately left out, and Sigfried's earlier career is completely skipped over.  We're simply told in a few lines that he slew a dragon and conquered the Nibelungs, gaining posession of their vast treasure along with a magic cloak and impenetrable skin.  Brunhilde is consumed with jealousy when Sigfried marries Kriemhild, but because of the poet's ham-fisted tampering with his sources, the "real" reason of her jealousy has to be substituted with something lame and irrational. The second half of the Nibelungenlied tells of Kriemheld's grisly revenge for the murder of Sigfried.  This part is well written, but oddly the characters metamorphose so that the villain of the first half (Sigfried's muderer) is the hero in the second half (a stalwart victim of a woman's treachery.) The story is bogged down throughout with chivalric courtly nonsense, undoubtedly thrown in for the gratification of the poet's royal patron.  After reading some Icelandic sagas, the characters' behaviour in the Nibelungenlied seems painfully artificial. I'm also puzzled as to why this work bears the title "Nibelungenlied" since it really isn't about the Nibelungs at all.  It doesn't tell the story of Sigfried's conquest of Nibelungland and the winning of the legendary treasure.  The Nibelungs show up briefly in the story as an army which Sigfried has at his disposal, and nothing more.  In the second half, the Burgundians are inexplicably referred to as "Nibelungs" but this just doesn't make sense after referring in the first half to the Nibelungs as a seperate people in a seperate land (a seemingly otherworldly land.  There's a dim sense that the Nibelungs might be "fairy folk," perhaps like the Tuatha De Danann in Celtic myth.)  The title is a cheat, and I think it's misleading.  But it is the traditional title of this epic. The afterword provides in-depth critical analysis and profuse apologies for the epic's many flaws.  Reading this helps greatly towards better understanding of the poem, and also puts you on the track of parallel sources of the Nibelung legend, some of which Prof. Hatto briefly summarizes.  I need to find the Norse "Thidrekssaga" which fills in many exciting details of Sigfried's early career and the truth about his relationship with Brunhilde. I've also heard that the Volsung Saga is a much better telling of the story.  Though I haven't yet read it, based on what I know of sagas I'm willing to bet it will be a much more satisfying experience. All in all, I can't recommend the Nibelungenlied to anyone unless they have a real serious thirst for Medeival literature 
 How did this guy ever get a recording contract? Not only is his singing style shmaltzy, but his voice is grating, whiney, and nasally. Besides being a self-admitted atheist and homosexual, he is a terrible singer. Very handsome, though. He looks like a cross between a giant mosquito and a Kangaroo who got into somebody's eye shadow and makeup kits. What an overrated wierdo. This guy had to have friends inside the industry. Manilow singing Tony Bennett or Bobby Darin is akin to Cedric the Entertainer playing Cary Grant or Clark Gable. In drag, no less 
 Do yourselves a favour kids, save your money don't go to the show,i mean don't buy this soundtrack. Here are some tips about it. It runs for a mere 29 minutes. That's awfully short. There are 8 songs and 8 portions of dialogue. most of these portions of dialogue last a few seconds, radio announcements of songs. The best portion is the harvey keitel bit, 'if the manager thinks he's Charles Bronson, cut off one of his fingers'. The songs now. Little green is a decent enough song, cocunut is a good song. i gotcha is okay. Stuck in the middle with you is a good song but has been ruined for me because it has been played to death on tv and radio. The other 4 songs are a joke. so basically it's a total waste of money. The pulp fiction soundtrack is a lot better than this one. Stop 
 As careful as I have been the pans are already warping and the finish on one is ruined.  The pots are no longer round so the lids do not fit properly - I cannot even use them to make rice as too much steam is released through the gap between the pot and the lid.  I have followed the instructions faithfully but have yet been able to keep the pans from sticking.  Frankly, they are not much better than the regular teflon after the coating has started coming off.  The information posted said they were ok for ceramic stoves but I cannot help but wonder if this is the problem as other people seem to think the pans are great.  I do like being able to use metal utensils with them but that's about the only good thing I can say 
 Sorry, but unless you are really into esoteric numerology you are going to be disappointed.  I am honestly sorry I bought this; it is not at all my kind of book, but then, sometimes one DOES judge a book by its cover.  If you really want to buy this book, or even if you think you may as well, buy it from me cheap; I'm going right now to sell this through Amazon in an effort to recuperate a few dollars of what I spent 
 I saw the movie and thought the book must be even better...nope. It was like listening to a thirteen year old girl whine. It made me uncomfortable reading it she was trying so hard to be a good writer that I felt embarrassed for her. I stopped reading after chapter 1 and sold it to a book store for a dollar 
 Whew!  After reading other reviewer's remarks, I'm glad to see I was not the only one who thought this movie was crap.  The cinematography is great, and the look (art direction) is authentic.  I too had trouble following the double-storyline.  Just when I started to get interested in the modern-day story, the action cut back to the past.  I don't know if it was poor choices during the editing processes or what.  I have seen many other movies that use flashback and dual-timeline stories.  None of those were this boring.  By the time you get to discover the real truth behind the century-old murders, you really don't care anymore.  And I don't see how the climactic storm at sea resolves the modern-day storyline.  In terms of casting, I have to agree with the other reviewers: why cast two British actress as the modern-day leads.  To me, the character of Jean should've been played with either an American actress (or at least a British or Australian actress with an American accent)instead of Catherine McCormick.  I also couldn't begin to identify with the character.  She seems so obsessed over this murder but completely inarticulate when discussing it (unless that's the point).  Sean Penn sits around and broods as her husband, a has-been poet.  Josh Lucas and Elizabeth Hurley (as Sean Penn's brother and the brother's girlfriend) really don't have much to do except add some eye candy (Josh for the ladies, and Elizabeth for the guys, and believe me, I kept wanting to see more of her in the bathing suit -- with and without the top).  Some say Josh Lucas's acting is a bit wooden and stiff in this role; I say he has nothing to work with: the character is just there to steer the boat and give Hurley backrubs.  He has no real personality quirks and Lucas works best when he plays someone who's a bit flawed (he is a rare case of a character actor who has leading-man good looks but bland roles don't suit him).  Sean Penn, on the other hand, looks like he's sleepwalking through half the movie.  His alcoholic poet seems more like he's stoned on Prozac; there's no passion, even when he quotes Dylan Thomas.  I think this was a miscasting; he's not sympathetic either.  (SPOILER ALERT: His character's fate during the storm is almost deserved; one cannot feel sympathy for him.)    The story set in the last century is much more interesting but because of the cut-up flashbacks, one doesn't hold interest.  Sarah Polley is a good actress, but her moping around -- "Oh, I'm stuck in a loveless marriage, and I really want to sleep with my brother again," attitude gets old.  Yes, dear viewers, I gave away another spoiler: incest. The other actors that play in the murder mystery story (aside from Polley and the great Ciaran Hinds as the wrongly accused murderer) are all Scandinavian and I've never heard of any of them before.  They do a good job with the material they're given, but it's hard to connect with them as well.   Perhaps this is one of those movies that you grow to like after repeated viewings.  Once was enough for me.  Perhaps you also need to read the original Anita Shreve novel before you watch it.  If so, I understand the movie is quite the literal adaptation.  This may be its biggest flaw: novels can be cinematic in their themes, imagery and their dialogue; they become water-logged when one tries to adapt the same style in telling two contrasting stories.  It also helps that when reading a novel with two story lines, it's much easier to go back and re-read parts of it, when the action gets confusing.   
 I read this book a few years ago, along with another one by the same author, Care of The Soul.  I found his books informative, though difficult to read because of the writing style.  Since, I have read many other books that address the same issues in a much "simpler form."  I noticed that the price for used books is very low, this should tell you most of what you need to know 
 The story falls apart. Early on, too many unusual circumstances signal where the bad guys are. Too long, too many coincidences. Maybe next time 
 The disc never played.  I was sent a replacement and that didn't play either 
 The Unbearable Lightness of Being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason: the point of Kundera's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style.  For instances, his endless digressions about history, politics, and philosophy.  For the movie, we are left with nothing but plot and character.  OK, what is one to do?  That in itself wouldn't be so bad if I didn't watch the film with the constant thought: I could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie.  This is a SLOW film.  It takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it.  I can't recommend the film 
 Specifically, you'd have thought that Russell and Corrine Calloway would've learned from what happened to them in the aftermath of the Stock Market Crash of 1987 (chronicled in "Brightness Falls").  Nah...they're still the shallow, selfish, self-absorbed people they were 14 years before.  The trouble is, you can't really tell whether McInerney thinks that's a good thing or a bad thing. 
 This book is not serious scholarship, it is merely an op-ed piece. The author, Michael Parenti does not provide any footnotes to back up his claims; strange coming from a scholar from Yale. No matter how much is said that conforms to my beliefs about politics it simply cannot be relied on as there is almost no evidence within.  
 Really not worth the effort to find it, even if George MacDonald Fraser was involved with the screenplay. The producers chose the "least best" of the Flashman novels to adapt, they cast the wrong actor to play the role, and they reduced the whole story to a bawdy, not-very-funny, slapstick comedy. Don't bother searching for it. True Flashman fans will be disappointed 
 I read this book and was very disappointed in that it did not cover ONLY the movie version of the Phantom.  I was not interested in anything about the stage version that was in the book.  Considering the price the book should have been larger.  I also thought there should be more pictures of the Phantom who is the true star of the film 
 It is unfortunate this book didn't come out better. Some glaring problems with it include: - has no concept of energy physics to begin with - does not understand "hydrogen economy" (hydrogen's an expensive storage, not a source of energy) - downplays geological data of oil discovery (or doesn't understand it), although Hubbert is covered briefly - believes or disseminates half-baked unproven ideas from the research sector: scientifically not valid energy sources are brought forward as alternative fuels - does not deal with the net energy concept (EROEI) or even refer to it  With these fundamental oversights it's really difficult to recommend the book.  It's not completely without merit as it does tell some of the basics right, but mostly it's pathologically impartial journalistic fluff, without looking at the hard facts as a good researcher should.   It's too much about how we are miraculously going to replace oil, gas and coal with tar sands, nuclear power, hydrogen and live happily ever after.  To those readers who want to believe this, this might be a good book. People looking for valid and scientifically solid reasoning on the subject will be sorely disappointed.  I'd recommend books by Deffeyes, Simmons, Heinberg, Campbell and many others before this (all on peak oil) 
 The Winner and Absolute  truth made me continue reading Baldacci books.His last few books Christmas Train and Split Second were awful.Now Baldacci takes his left leaning anti american feelings and tries to shove it down our throats.That was the last money I ever spend on a Baldacci book,I even threw out his good books. Shut up Baldacci and write fiction books. Your ideas do not get through in this non fiction world 
 If you want just one CD that gives you an overview of Joan Baez's career and contains her greatest hits, well...you won't find one.  Her career has been too long and varied for that.  She was at Woodstock and at Live Aid.  She covered traditional English, Spanish and French folk songs, protest and mainstream pop.  She currently has 46 albums to her credit, including 15 compilation albums.  Newcomers to her music will assume that an album entitled Greatest Hits, which is her current best seller, is the best place to start.  Unfortunately, it's the worst.  The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down was one of her finest songs; I remember the excitement her version generated in the 70s.  This album has a live performance which is a pale imitation of the studio version.  Her voice is tired and slightly off-key, the backing is scrappy, the acoustics are poor and the tempo is a little too fast.  A mess.  She does a Dylan impersonation on one verse of his A Simple Twist of Fate.  This might have been amusing at the time, and may still be to those in the know, but to newcomers it will be irritating and confusing.  A mistake.  One of her signature tunes is Amazing Grace, which she has performed better than anyone.  At the 1985 Live Aid concert, she made the terrible mistake of saying the words before each verse, to encourage audience participation.  Mercifully, the DVD of the concert cuts this short.  So why, in the name of all that's musical, does this album include a 1976 performance of her doing the same thing?  An embarrassment.  All the tracks were recorded in the 70s (1972 - 1976), by no means her 'Greatest' era, nor her most representative.  Simply, they are her years with A&M Records.  They had the nerve to cobble these tracks together and call it a 'Greatest Hits'.  A smart marketing move but a shameful musical one.  To add a positive note, the final track, Less Than the Song, is very fine.  I guess you can't keep a good singer down.  Joan's is the finest female voice of the 60s folk revival and protest movement -- pure and melodious and true.  As a child of the 60s, the album of hers that I remember best and which now seems most representative is her eponymous 'Joan Baez'.  If you are new to her music, start either with that album or with The First 10 Years.  Both are great.   
 This book, above all others, reveals the breakdown of classical (libertarian) liberalism into the statist liberalism of today.  Although the first part of the work, being a refutation of Edmund Burke's silly  nonsense, is stellar, and is well worth reading.  Regardless, the second  part, the chapter on "Ways and Means" in particular, is composed  of the most despicable, anti-liberty doctrines that one can find.  What  Paine basically proposed was a late 18th century form of the welfare state,  replete with progressive taxation, subsidies for child birth, and other  fine statist amenities.  Thus, as all of these things are, in his words, to  be claimed as rights, the title of this book comes to mean nothing  whatsoever.  It is indeed sad that Thomas Paine has gained such an enduring  legacy as a friend to liberty.  In truth, he is actually one of its worst  enemies, as he combines a just zeal for resistance to oppression,  revolution, and reason, he sabotages his entire political philosophy

 I'm not sure what the young lady is trying to accomplish here...potentially compelling folk-blues material collapses under the weight of annoying , exaggerated Appalachian vocal affectations ("Give me that ol'-fashion mor-phyne...it's good enough for mae"). Guess I should have taken heed from her similarly afflicted turns on the Be Good Tanyas' Blue Horse ("Riiine and snow..."). As a counterpoint I contrast her with Gillian Welch, who manages to stay on the good side of the line separating authenticity from irony. It's a shame, thinking about what might have been if she would drop the pretensions and just...sing 
 He crossed the border from pompous reggae-influenced pop/punk with the Police [a great thing] to pompous ersatz pap-meister solo [a very bad thing], menacing us for nearly 2 decades with quasi-rock/jazz that lite-radio dreams are made of. Don't mistake this for art - take it for what it is - a monopoly on a radio format w/a larger than cult following. More tuneless, wan and monotonous than usual...perfect fodder for the VH1 votary. My grade: C 
 I read this book in 2002 way before the Iraq invasion seemed probable.  After reading it (and believing that I was reading thorough reporting) I supported going after the WMD in Iraq.  However, now that we've seen how Judy can manipulate facts and her proven track record with no WMD found in Iraq I strongly suggest you read this book with a skepticism to truthfulness.  Some of the non-Iraq WMD reporting was very interesting and I learned a bit from that, but how do I separate fact from fiction?  As a result of being 100% wrong in her reporting and Judy's recent comments, "the analysts, the experts and the journalists who covered them -- we were all wrong," which is not true (read John MacArthur, Ian Williams and Joby Warrick), I think this book loses its credibility.  You may want to read it just to attempt to discern fact v. fiction 
 The author should have made it clearer that this was a work of fiction 
 The animation ... Excellent.  The characters ... Excellent.  The premise ... Excellent.  Laugh lines ... plenty of them and well executed.  This is a movie you will say was worth spending your money on.  THE PROBLEM IS ... as adults you will understand the movie is about putting the past to rest so you are free to enjoy your now and your future.  For kids, they don't see a lesson in putting your past to rest, they see - If you don't like something - put IT to rest ... as is R.I.P. - DEAD!  After the crotchety old man (doesn't every haunted house need one to heighten the tension) identifies the haunting is related to someone he knows ... there is far too personal a vendetta to finish them off (again).  Also shame on the producers of this movie... a KIDS movie ... there is far too much irresponsible adult behaviour (babysitter getting it on with boyfriend, boyfriend getting drunk and threatening the kids, etc) -- it is just not necessary to tell this story.   I wouldn't let any relative of mine, under 14, see this otherwise excellent flick 
 I am truly sorry to those who purchased the DVD. I read ALL the reviews and some critical scenes seems to be left out. I would have been totally pissed because I know this movie like that back of my hand. Obviously for those who never saw the movie/VHS, they got to enjoy the movie as is, but for those who had the opportunity to see this GREAT movie uncut, I feel the anger and frustration via your words.  I will not get this DVD, because I believe you all when you say they screwed up this DVD.  Maybe we should tell Oprah about this? Flood her with emails about how they chopped up HER film. With Oprah...you never know 
 Bits of Beatles,Zappa, Queen, (Herman's Hermits ?), may be laudable  in intent but reveals the crucial difference between an original musical mind and a talented imitator. Elfman's themes are good but his songs have some of the same faults as your normal Musical pieces, they have fairly banal, repetitive lyrics and are cut and paste music. Has the creepy competence of a Dave Grusin album. If you like that you'll be OK here 
 THIS WAS THE WORST DK BOOK I EVER READ THE ONLY GOOD PART WAS IGNEOUS ROCKS.I LIKE THE OTHER DK BOOKS BETTER THAN THIS ONE  [... 
 I received this as a gift from my wish list.  The oven does not get hot enough to brown food, same for the broiler.  I'm sorry I own it, it takes up way too much room on my counter.  
 Not sure what movie everyone else is talking about, but I fell victim to the hype as well. But PAN'S LABYRINTH is far from a masterpiece. If you want to see brutal violence - some of it directed against children - along with some horrific gore (including a Rambo-esque scene where one of the major characters sews up his slashed cheek with a needle and thread) then this is the movie for you. Forget what other people have written about adult fairy tales and whatnot; this is not an entertaining nor enjoyable fable. Nor film, for that matter. Subtract the special effects and there's not really much of a movie 
 If you're considering buying the D200, this book provides a decent overview, but it is not an acceptable field guide, nor is it an acceptable replacement for the actual manual 
 This is a bubble gum type of book that does not teach anything about making money on the markets. It is a platform to sell Investor Business Daily services. If you want to learn trading look for articles written by Toby Crabel or Arthur Merrill, even Linda Raschke. They are full time professional money managers that happend to write few articles... some of them you can probably find on Ebay for cheaper... 
 I really liked Dick's "Do Androids Dream" and was excited to read another of his books.  What a disappointment!  The characters in "The Divine Invasion" seem to exist only for symbolic reasons.  Dick needs a protagonist to convey his religious theory but he doesn't create anyone believable.  The main character, Herb Asher, is obsessed with a sappy singer named Linda Fox or "The Fox" (how eighties is that?) but we don't find out what he likes so much about her.  His wife, a virgin who carries Yaweh (God) as a human child, comes across as unlikeable and morbid.  As a musician, I feel that Dick's portrayal of the music industry and the sound system that Asher sells to The Fox is absurd.  For such a visionary as Dick it seems pretty silly to write about music tapes in a future of space colonization... I mean did he think we'd be recording to tape forever??  Also there are a couple of chapters in which Dick writes about powerful religious leaders who seem to be forgotten by the end of the book.  I will say that I think PKD's religious ideas are interesting.  I like his portrayal of God and the Torah as being parts of the same whole.  It's also interesting that he explains that the angry god of the Jewish Bible is only one facet of God's personality.  This is something that bothers me about the bible and I'm glad to see Dick addressing it.  Aside from these things, I wouldn't recommend "The Divine Invasion" 
 First of all, the track listing is wrong from what appears on the Amazon site as of 6-14-2006. It's not even close.  Second, there are no demos on this. Am I missing something?? I preordered this to get the demos and all we have are live recordings. The sound on this is awful, very similar to the Stooges live recordings. If your familar with those, you know what I mean. I would have given it one star, but it is still a interesting listen, as I love The New York Dolls. I'm shocked they would release this the way it sounds. It appears to be a attempt to make money without putting a dime in cleaning up the sound on this. The Vancouver show is the only decent recording on this release 
 I know that I will outrage alot of people with this review but here goes... This is one of only 2 books that I have ever read that I truly REGRET devoting the time to , but once I start a book I always finish.I don't know what else to say except that it was painful for me to finish this.  I just don't get it.  The main character was quite annoying to me and the story was SO SLOW and predictable I really just wanted it to end. I would not recommend this book for fun and if it is required reading for you I am sorry.   
 Hey quick note. In Sam's review he speaks of Bill being from Eastern KY. Not to throw my 2 cents in, but Rosine is in Western KY .Not a biggie, just want the fact straight :-). Thanks, Slippery jaw from K 
 I was impressed by the volume of data supporting the overall conclusion and was pleased that the authors chose data that was adjusted for other factors (age, etc) but I agreed with a previous reviewer that they failed to show cause and effect.  Many of the downsides of not being married (domestic violence, eg) may result in not being married instead of vice versa.  This is especially true in reference to the section on how there is a full out war against marriage - yes, there is a lot of bad press on marriage but that's because there are a lot of bad marriages (and if you think divorce is bad for the children, try having one of the parents - or both - hating their home life).  The authors show that their are several inherent values to marriage (eg, finance is easier with 2 people supporting one household)-and you want us to believe that people stay out or get of marriages because they others talking about how bad marriages are?  In the end, people are going to make decision based on personal experience if available and I know very few people who haven't experienced marriage, either their own or their parents.  Something's going wrong within the matrimonial institution that the authors completely ignore.  What is it?  I don't know and the book fails to give me insight.  Given that omission the authors' final conclusion - encourage marriage by giving financial breaks to married couples and marginalizing single people - will not solve the problem. If singles have trouble financially, shouldn't they be the ones getting tax breaks? If some singles are less likely to have affordable health insurance shouldn't we address the health industry? What about those singles who want to be married but haven't met the proper person - how is this going to help them? Bottom line is the authors' suggestions won't necessarily increase the proportion of happily married people but will make single people's lives more difficult.    
 This book doesn't address the condition of man and mans condition as its been forever, as in thousands of years.    and to single out Christianity as war mongers is tarded, the whole world is and has been into wars.    Name ONE century in history, yes all of history, where there has been no wars? ( hint, its zero )   oh yea yea i know the debate, we are getting smarter as people and will stop wars as soon as we get more educated.     below is from another reviewer in here.  To Christian readers I would recommend considering Hillman's view that Christianity has been martial from the start as a challenge to examine the relationship between the Christian emphasis on love and innocence and its long institutional history of intolerance and brutality. Is warfare endemic to Christianity? Are Christians who reject warfare exceptions to an almost universal aggressiveness? Must Christianity be a religion of missionaries who think they know better than the peoples they seek to convert? These are some of the questions raised by Hillman's study.  without even talking to any of you peeps in here that give this book 4-5 stars, I am willing to bet that you also are ok with abortion for any reason the women wants.   Seems to always go hand in hand, hate war, abortions are ok.    Guess what, abortion kills more than all the wars combined.  At least 1.5 million in USA alone.    yea yea I know, overpopulation ( Got War? ) unwanted kids ( 7 year waiting list for adoption ) on and on it goes.   Organized religion is at the head of many of mans problems, if not the most of them.   This includes all religions.   However, the Christ of the bible has nothing to do with organized religion, so hence, you see why we just continue to have problem after problem.   I was raised catholic, bailed to Christianity, went over to right wing Christianity, and bailed out of all named denominations, now it's just flat Christian.  The problem is, not many others are doing this, and wont as I see the world anytime in the near future, so hence, all our problems in the world are going to continue.   Simple as that.    people are confusing getting rid of all religions ( john Lennon Imagine, etc etc ) With the real Christ.   Jesus hated religion, yet his people still want to be a part of it, as they think it keeps them all in line.     I know so many people that were raised in a Christian home, Mormon home, JW home, a Catholic home, and as soon as they became adults, they bailed on all of it.   going over to anything that sans organized religion and is "Just God".       
 This second book in the series is such a repeat of the first one I thought I may have mixed things up. I hadn't and except for a few changes I really felt it was a reread. Still sweet, but lets have some interaction with previous characters or something to mix things up a little 
 There are much better books on management out there than this collection of unorganized work.  Don't read this book if you're looking for new insight on management techniques.  If you're already a seasoned manager, you'll find more value in your real work environment.  This was a text for one of my MBA courses, and the rest of my MBA team (which consists of seasoned management professionals) has the same sentiments.  Spend your time elsewhere. 
 For good or bad there are certain things one comes to expect when watching animes especially after watching them for many years. Surely the avid anime enthusiast would like to see more and more serious anime films, but at the same time they'd like an anime feel to their films... what's most important though is whether or not the film is intriguing, creative, and powerful. This film fails short of all of those things and instead pretends to be something it isn't.  This didn't have an anime feel... which wasn't really a problem for me - I've seen a number of anime movies which were serious, but this movie was - in my opinion - about as horrible as they come.   Trying to show itself off as a feel good anime film about Christmas (how many damn Christmas-happy movies do we have out there?), this anime follows the same premise as thousands of films before it and fails in the face of them. "A Christmas Story" and all of those films far surpass both the quality and thematic/story-delivery found within Tokyo Godfathers.   Are we supposed to like it because these themes are found within a Japanese animation? I doubt anyone could really say that the visuals were great (they were not, but that's beside the point since visuals aren't all that matters), I doubt anyone can even say this film was really all that original (the only thing semi-original about it is the cast of "odd fellow" characters like the street bum with the heart of gold who wants nothing more than to have a child of her own... except she is a transvestite, really a man).   I feel really bad about posting this review considering so many people enjoyed it, but I can only guess that they haven't watched very many Christmas movies in the past or that they have little to no capacity for judging films accurately.  The director however is one of my favorite - I deeply enjoyed Perfect Blue and Millennium Actress is perhaps my favorite anime movie ever made - after watching this movie though I'm kind of disappointed that fans of decided to "cling" onto this movie and call it a classic when in reality it mimics half a dozen non-animated titles and brings nothing new or intriguing to the table.   Furuya was successful in taking a bland film, creating such a big hype over it by attaching his renowned name to it and putting a child in it and some heart breaking tales already told time and again. The audience bought it up... too bad. You don't need to feel ashamed to say it really isn't as special as it tries to present itself as.   Oh well, perhaps you really need to be a hardcore sentimentalist to like this film. Here is the film's ultra-negative review by an informed reviewer... I sincerely hope people take my words into consideration not merely rate this as "unhelpful" because they disagree with it (then again, that's the style on Amazon these days isn't it?) 
 I'm amazed that this book is for MBA level students!  I am currently an undergraduate student and have the opportunity to use this textbook for a finance class and find this book very vague on termology and not very helpful when it comes to difficult concepts.  Anyone with basic knowledge of business can understand the book so that's why it amazes me that this book is used for MBA's 
 Lol, Elizabeth Clare Prophet, the cult leader, a huxter, nothing close to a scholar, is teaching us about Christianity now lol? Lame 
 These were horrible.  I thought I'd try raw foods and I amde a big mistake 
 I had to read this book for a political theory class in college.  After talking with several other members I was happy to find out that I do not have the reading skills of a third grader...Benhabib goes out of her way to use vocabulary words that most educated people are not familiar with.  The book is also not organized well.  In order to really understand this book you will have to read it while taking notes.  Points that could be grouped together for arguments are scattered throughout entire chapters and even the whole book.  Benhabib may have used her vocabulary and lack of organization as tools to hide that the points she makes are not very well argued.  Throughout much of the book Benhabib is trying to shoot down the theories of John Rawls and other theorists to support her views on migratory rights.  To be honest, I disagree with her views and admit that I might have found her organization and vocabulary more tolerable if I agreed with her.  Still, I do not have a problem with her making these claims if she did so logically.  Much of her work is based on telling the reader why other people are wrong and she will use theories she supposedly already disproved in one arguement to justify her later arguments for disagreeing with other theories.    In short, I do not think anyone would want to read this book for pleasure, or intellectual curiosity.  If you have to read The Rights of Others for a class, I extend my condolences.

    If you're considering buying this book, I want to look down at the bottom of this page and note the number of customer reviews.  Everything, I'm going to say has already probably been said by them, but I will continue on out of ego.  What drove so many people to their keyboards? Simply, rage.  I know that's the case with me anyways, dear readers.  I wasted an entire summer on these books hoping desperately that their former glory would somehow blaze back into life.  Sadly, I was mistaken.  Reading these novels now is just like drinking microwaved coffee.     I'm sure Jordan has never read Hemingway.  The former may look like the latter, but old rough and tough Ernest wouldn't waste time describing dresses when, I don't know, he could be instilling artistic value into the prose.  What about Jordans characterizations, though, you ask?  (You're probably not asking that,but just go along with it.)  Well, and this may be shocking, Jordan's world happens to be filled by personality dopplegangers.  It's as if every woman's genetic code was locked into the same sequence for all eternity.  Oh, sure they may look different (it's mostly because of the dresses, I think), but they all possess the exact same persona that is, basically, Jordan's botched attempt at a strong woman.  I cannot take another exclamation of "Men!"  I guess that's some sort of mantra that let's you know they're REAL strong women.  It must be far more effective than actually instilling them with depth of character and the ability to triumph in adverse circumstances.  Then there are his male characters, who are either jerks or, in Perrin's case, lesser jerks who you hate anyways.    But, the most greivous sin Jordan committs here is the utter stagnation of the plot.  Nothing happens.  Most of its an intricate dance of braid pulling and smoothing of skirts.  Rand is barely in it.  Which, doesn't really matter, it's not as if he's been doing anything great for the past couple books.  Tuon is terribly uninteresting, because, well, I've seen her many times before.  She's just part of Jordan's mad scheme to make sure every character's paired up and in everlasting love.  Which brings me to a point.  Why must Rand have three girlfriends?  If that is not the most teenage boy-oriented plot device ever employed.  And guess what, ones blonde, ones a rehead, and the other's a brunette.  Just thinking about it makes me want to cast down modern literature.                      Run from this novel 
 Once upon a time I thought Jeff Sachs was both a genius and a tower of integrity....then I read this tragic work.  This book is the result of what happens when a brilliant mind goes "Hollywood". As a Financial Economist who actually lives in Africa...it is obvious to me that Jeff is selectively clueless about how things really work here. Then again...I think Jeff knows exactly what the people he works for at the UN want to hear. 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 This book is a collection of 670 illustrations. No text is included with the illustrations, but  could be a good resource for someone interested in seeing the various types of design used in what was mainly cast iron.  The  books groups the ironwork into handrails, window balconies, railings.  banisters, drapery screens and door panels etc. For someone looking for a  copyright free set of graphics this would be a good choice. For those  interested in finding out how this ironwork was made and by who it would be  a bad choice. These is no explanation of who, when or how in this book -  just a collection of detailed illustrations 
 All of the people that gave this game a review of more than two stars are bs-ing you.  Those people are probably hardcore ff7 fans - that game was barely mediocre at best.  Other ff7 releases = advent children, cell phone game, and movie/tv show thing.  All three things, resectively, sucked.  Now comes, "Dierge of Cerberus"  whoop did eeee doo!!  The only reason why I rented it was because the title says, "final fantasy" in it.  The only redeeming quality of this game is the cutscenes - other than that, boring.  If you can get more than 20 minutes through the game, then by all means, it's the game for you 
 As one of the Co-Founders and former Director of Guatemalan Operations for PlanetOutreach, I discovered this book was published after leaving PlanetOutreach in 2002. The author was misinformed about how our internet cafe / telecenter was actually launched and who was involved in making it happen. In fact, the author made it seem that PlanetOutreach was a project of eBay and it certainly was not, although we did receive a grant from their foundation to make it happen. Persons mentioned as being a significant part of this project came down to San Pedro to visit only; from a few days (Meg W.and Henry G.- to take a tour of the village and project) to three weeks (Griffin - who helped with painting bookshelves only). Naturally, I was stunned to see credit given to people when they played a very small role (if any!) versus the four us who founded it (Karina, Ron, Debbie and me). Naturally, I was disappointed to see how the author chose to innacurately profile this innovative enterprise.  Two of the first employees I hired and trained, Mary and Otto,  continue to stay in touch with me through email. In fact, Otto, the first employee of PlanetOutreach, and Cata, his wife, gave birth to their first daughter in 2005 and named her after me; I saw her in Sept 2005 and she's beautiful! 
 The book is about court poetry, court architecture, court philosophy, and how well courtiers felt cultivating their court culture. It is definitly NOT about the entire culture of al-Andalus. It is not about those who worked and suffered to pay the courtier lifestyle, the dependend farmers, the craftsmen, the merchants, etc. Their music, dance, food, workman skills, etc. is completly neglected. It is no wonder that Ms. Menocal wonders why the court culture was destroyed. Maybe a lot of people were not willing to pay for it any more. Worse, it is not about the international musicians and dancers, the gitanos who breathed life into Spanish culture. The book is written by a bourgois raised and educated in safe homes and university bubbles but definitly not by someone who ever took part in creating culture 
 The opening of 'The Laughing Jesus' is brilliant. Freke and Gandy manage to make a compelling case for an examination of the historical basis for a literal interpretation of scripture. They highlight recent events of 9/11 but also talk about the crusades and the role literal interpretation of religion has played throughout the ages. After this, however, things go pear shaped.  The authors declare boldly that what is needed in this current age and what they are going to do about the current crisis in the world:  "Our response is to mount a full-scale assault on the pernicious idea that God writes books."  And so the task begins. This is the 3rd Freke and Gandy book i am reading and its clear that they know what their 'trump card' is; it's their attack on the historical existence of Jesus. This is where they have been most successful and this is material highlighted by numerous other scholars. Thus we get chapter that examines this, regurgitating the material of 'The Jesus Mysteries', entitled 'The Most Famous Man Who Never Lived'. This is their forte and they deliver their arguments in much the same style as in their previous books.  Either side of this chapter, however, are two chapters that sadly do not live up to the same standards as the other. I am aware that they are mounting their 'full scale assault' but this should not mean that their style of writing should suddenly become tabloid in nature. The quality drops dramatically. Provocative, and at times filthy language is used to insight reactions from those reading the text. The arguments given are very flimsy and easily countered in nearly all cases. Following this full on assault of Judaism and Islam we then enter in to the section of the book detailing Gnostism as they way forward.  Sadly Freke and Gandy have just over simplified things and selectively quoted just a bit too often for their thesis to hold any water at all. Only someone with a very poor understanding of the history of Judiasm, Christianity and Islam will be able to read the material and not question most statements.  They have just tried to do much. For instance in the space of just 5 pages they try to demonstrate that Abraham, Moses, Joshua, David, and Solomon never existed. These figures stretch over a period of 1000 years, yet in 5 pages Freke and Gandy aim to show they never existed, and nor did any of the things they were supposed to have done. This section is woeful.  Their attack on Islam in Chapter 5 is equally over ambitious and naive. Here they concede Muhammad existed, and even admit that he brought positive rules and laws, for example stating:  "Women were amongst Muhammad's closest followers, they took part in public life, and even fought alongside men in battle. Muhammad forbade the killing of girl children, or regretting that they were not boys, and gave women legal rights of divorce and inheritance centuries before the West."  Unfortunately after acknowledging this they state that all this was due to Muhammad being influence by Gnostics.   "Muhammad originally followed the Gnostics' egalitarian example in his treatment of women".  Thus, according to them, any positive elements found in any religion are only there due to the fact that the really true parts are Gnosticism. This is the claim of Freke and Gandy. They are not subtle about this either stating in the opening of the book:  "Religion isn't all bad. It has answered the profound human yearning to understand the mysteries of life and death. It has inspired people of all cultrures and temples, transcendental music and songs. It has the power because at its heart is Gnostic spirituality"  I was very disappointed by the book in general. Having enjoyed their other books, this was a huge disappointment and perhaps showed me that these authors are not as knowledgeable as I may have thought from their other writings.  In conclusion I would say this book is actually quite dangerous. Its inflammatory, factually inaccurate in many places, heavily polemic towards a Gnostic view of the world and often crude and vulgar.  For anyone wanting a detailed, balanced and yet deeply comprehensive analysis of fundamentalism and trends in Judaism, Christianity and Islam I would recommend 'The Battle for God' by Karen Armstrong 
 I could barely get through the...um...er...reimagination...of the childern's classic - while the set design and special FX are state of the art, as usual for a Tim Burton film, the actual movie is hard to watch. Why? Depp's "performance" is chock full of ticks and mannerisms, off-putting, flat, self-absorbed, and finally, one-note. Rather than the quirky fun of the original 1972 Gene Wilder version, Burton's film is more horror than fantasy, often casually cruel and sadistic to the point of being far from family fare.  While deliberate on Burton's part, that doesn't make the final product any more watchable. It's one grim, dismal, downward spiral slog. Not much holidday fun, huh? As with most of Burton's other big, expensive failures, he knows how to CREATE a convincing world, but has no clue how to POPULATE it with characters and situations we identify with and/or could care less about.  The final result is a film that's like a fragile, hermetically sealed curio on the shelf - nice to look at from afar, but hard to get attached to, much less involved with. What a waste of millions of studio $$$ 
 Chirpy ideas, bad writing.  I feel sorry for the poor saps who get stuck being slaves under this motivational trash.  In your job, to "make their day" is best made by giving them a paycheck, or better yet a raise.  That's why people work.  You have to "be there" otherwise you get fired.  As for "play"?  Heh.  Who feels like "playing" when they feel like they're going to puke when they are force-fed this garbage at the office?  Choose your attitude...yeah.  Most people who work go because they have to.  Their boss chooses their attitude.  "Smile no matter how you feel or your butt hits the sidewalk."  Fish are among the dumbest creatures alive today...near the very bottom of the evolutionary scale and have nothing for brains...hmm...I guess a fish wrote this book 
 This movie has NO plot! Yes, the characters say things and do things and things happene but that's not a plot! This movie wanders on aimlessly. What is it trying to say? What is the point? Brian J White is a good actor. I loved him in The Shield, but in this movie he OVER ACTS! It's like he has no talent at all. The white women in the film are stereotypes, especially the blonde. They played the same 2 or 3 pieces of music several times throughout the film whether they fit or not. One seemed to be played in every other scene. Whomever wrote this needs to try again! Or NOT 
 I believe this is the second worst book I've ever read, although having not bothered to finish it, it had potential to rank higher on the list.  The concept, the characters, the plot and the writing were so far fetched that it was too difficult to suspend my disbelief long enough tolerate reading it.  I never give up on books; I read them to the end, no matter how much I dislike them.  Leaving a book unread haunts me; throwing out a book is a Cardinal Sin in my mind.  I made an exception in this case and tossed it in my garbage can and felt no guilt.   The writing is poor; there is no eloquence, no wit, no attempt at a remotely believable plot.  The humor is not humorous; it's an attempt at slapstick comedy that falls short of its goal.  It is too obvious, too tiresome, and often just plain bizarre.  The book was recommended by a close friend who enjoys award-winning books; I assumed she'd be on target with this one.  She obviously likes Hiaason's books and find them funny and involving, but simply put,they're not my taste or to my liking.  Find something else to do with your time, something more satisfying and  mentally stimulating than reading this book.  I've never dared to try another of his books since being so annoyed by Lucky You, so I cannot speak for them.  This one might have been an anomaly in his body of work, although I honestly don't know.  But I feel like I wasted my time with this, and to be honest, if I were given a choice between reading this book and snorting dirt, I'd choose the latter.   
 This was my first read in the series and I was very disappointed.  It was terrible.  Not at all what I expected.  Slow, slow, painfully slow and dull.  I can't believe this is a series.  Does anyone really talk like Hannah and her transparent characters?  Way too predictable, silly clues and bland dialogue.  The best part of the book was the ending 
  did not like this movie,except for the acting which was it's only redeeming quality. this movie jumps all over the place and after a while i just gave up trying to follow it,although i did watch it to the end,hoping it would end up making sense.boy was i wrong.was never so happy to see end credits roll. i do not recommend this movie unless you are one of those people who can keep track of ten things at once.if you are,you'll love it.otherwise don't waste your time 
 The author is obviously as out of her element as Inspector Monk, and clearly has little knowledge of the ships, seafaring, nautical quarantine requirements, etc. of the 1860's.  Her characters are hardly believable:  Sutton, the rat exterminator and Dr. Crow are perhaps the worst examples, but not the only ones.  Would a proper young lady be picked up in a cab without a chaperon to go to a function?  Very disappointing 
 I didn't know there was a "Parental Advisory" on this cartridge until it arrived. Clearly not suitable for children. Also, I didn't know any of the songs on the cartridge. It would be helpful if there was a way to see the songs included before purchasing 
 I'm not a hard core Dean Koontz fan but I have read a few of his novels and enjoyed most of them (at least enough to pick up another from time to time)   Until now.   I've always found Koontz to be heavy handed as an author and 'The Taking' is about as subtle as a hand grenade. We get it - people are selfish and have lost sight of what is important in life. They should pay more attention to their children and love their dogs.   The preachy tone to the novel reaches a crescendo with a corny 'Noah's Arc' ending. This the worst novel I've read in a long time - and may be the last Dean Koontz novel I'll ever read. 
 I don't understand why people spend money on this charger, when you can pay half as much for the same thing. I bought an iPod charger for my 5G iPod video from Sonnet Technologies and I am very satisfied. It is small and the connectors retract for easy carrying around.  Search Amazon for "Sonnet USB Wall Charger for Ipod with USB-to-Dock Cable" at about HALF the price. It comes in black or white to go with the color of your iPo 
 It read like all the other Wiccan books popping up everywhere. Same old stuff. Save your money 
 I rarely write reviews but I decided to write this since I had this urge to let everyone know that this product is just plain bad.  The review by "Reviewer: RC Lansing Mich" has listed all of my frustrations and I will not go over them again.  But the rating of 4 stars that he has given does not agree with what you will read in his review.    The summary of this product is that it is "highly unusable".  You will be tired of using this on your first trip that you will not feel like every using it again.  Yes, you can "manage" you way with this product.  However it is not worth your time and money.  And last point that struck a nerve with me about the ols maps database ... the company came out with a plan where customers can send them updated maps, based on locations they have travelled, not covered by the original map database ... come on! 
 The year was 1990, the sound was "new jack swing"...R&B laced with hip-hop..the group was Bell, Biv, Devoe..3 former members (Ronnie Bivins, Ricky Bell, Mike Devoe) split off from New Edition, the hugely successful R&B "boy band" of the 80s. The band racked up a quick 6 Top 100 Billboard hits and then disappeared from the charts.  HIGHLIGHTS: The title track is far and away the best song here and the only hit that still sounds pretty fresh. The group moves from strength to strength with sharp hip-hop beats, occasional harmony, and a really funky break (after "Blow!"). Outside of that, the album track "Ain't Nuttin' Changed" is a nice slice of old school hip-hop with a Sly and the Family Stone sample to boot.   LOWS: "Do Me!" was a big hit back when, but the junior high locker room ideas about sex are pretty boring to me in my 30s (it's no "Let's Get it On"). "Word to the Mutha" and "I Do Need You" don't really go anywhere musically.  BOTTOM LINE: This band was definitely a singles act, you don't really need the album unless you're a diehard fan who wants the extended remix of the title track and album track "Ain't Nuttin' Changed" which is also pretty tough. Outside of that, all the hits can be found on the "20th Century Masters:Millennium Edition" (ASIN B000066F0S) or if you really only want "Poison","B.B.D.", and "Do Me!" you might go for New Edition's "All the Number Ones" (ASIN B00004T0EB) which gives you those 3 tracks plus several big 80s hits from their old band 
 I'm a fan of Janet Evanovich and her Stephanie Plum series, I think it's laugh out loud funny.  I didn't care for this story at all, it seemed sloppily constructed and I agree with other reviewers, lacked a story line or believable characters.  I left off a few chapters into it, there was no point in finishing.  
       Pure junk.  I've tried this several times.  It doesn't repair  scratches but covers the lens with a sheet of clear gunk.  The first trick is to spread the material evenly and smoothly over the surface.  And the second trick is to try to get your money back. The method of spreading it evenly is not well worked out by the product makers.   
 I have the first book this author wrote, and was extremely disappointed to find out that at least half the blocks in her new book are repeated from her first book. I feel that the title is misleading. Several of the authors of multiple volumes on the same subject are in my library. Examples would be Bethany Reynolds, Marsha McCloskey, Sharyn Craig, and Carol Doak. In each and every case, the blocks or techniques do not repeat the items that appeared in their earlier books. Therefore, it's logical to expect that a book entitled "More Biblical Blocks" would have  additional blocks to the ones you already have.   Have you ever bought a CD of an artist you liked to find out that half or more of the songs were repeats from one you already owned? Well, this is the equivalent. Since the book isn't cheap, it's doubly disappointing.  Whereas I do agree that the directions are guite good, they are no better than those contained in many other books on the market by other authors, so there is nothing remarkable in that arena. If you have this author's "Biblical Blocks" book, I'd recommend skipping this one. If you're considering buying one of her books, buy only this one and skip the first, so it can have value to some. I, however, feel ripped off 
 It will be easier for a camel to walk through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to get into heaven. Well Patty Boy I hope you have been training one hell of a camel because otherwise you are going to be mighty hot for an eternity. This man is a intolerant bigot. 
 I was reluctant to pick up this book because of it's title, but I decided to read it because I had it in my collection. I was somewhat entertained, and finished the book very quickly due to the short length. It is a tragedy in which almost all are killed in the end. I did not care much for the plot, which involves an incestuous relationship between brother and sister. After reading part of the book, it was rather easy to predict the ending. It is not a tremendously detailed and emotional story. I'm not sure if this is a title that would often come up in conversations between friends or colleagues, but avid readers might want to pick up the title to have read it 
 I was attracted to this book because I was turning 50 and finding it unexpectedly disturbing.  The book was interesting enough but not very useful.  I didn't really find out anything I didn't already know - other than there were a lot more women out there who were going through, or had been through, a similar re-evaluation. So while it was vaguely comforting, it wasn't at all inspiring or particuarly helpful.  I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone who hasn't had a traditional married-with-kids-plus-career lifestyle 
 I have read 3 other Sue Margolis boks and enjoied them all. This book was really really BAD 
 I thought reading this book was a waste of time. It largely preoccupied with its overdone sex-and-gender research and sometimes becomes downright obscure eg. when the writer of the first chapter was just interested in the way certain "scripts" he believes to exist can be or not be found in the dating stories of some boys he interviewed. What's sad about this chapter is that he ignores the obvious dilemmas some of them were in. One told him that he wanted to try out anal intercourse in a public restroom in order to "find his identity" or something. The author does not comment on this glaring misconception of what sexual orientation is and is not about (eg your personal identity) and how anal intercourse or other sex techniques might be wrongly linked with same-sex attraction or a contrived "gay identity". Anyone interested in this particular problem should read the papers and essays of Chuck Tarver and Billy Weintraub (both are available on-line)!  In another chapter its writer concludes that some gay men actually think they basically don't differ from straight men just because of their difference in sexual orientation. Now that's something that should be emphasised, but the whole collection of essays seems to be rather about how gay men are somehow special or different while straight men are all the good old emotionless blokes.  Another funny thing was when in a chapter its writer complained that there are some gay men who object to a link of feminism and the gay rights movement or try to prove they are not chauvinistic when she thinks they obviously are. I thought that made the whole intentions of her article clear.  The only good chapter was the last one: its author researched drag queens and concludes that the gay men who do that kind of cross-dressing don't do it to actually become a woman, but just as straight men might try to make fun of certain feminine role-models. That was an interesting read.  Still, the only book I can wholeheartedly recommend on this subject is Bawer's A Place at the Table 
 This is my first review for Amazon.  I write this so that some reader can avoid the pain I suffered.  The book was the worst mystery I have ever read.  Wild plot twists have been mentioned by others, nonsensical plot twists are a better description. I found none of the book to be believable and must admit the the only reason I finished to the book was to see if the final half was worse than the first half.  This book was factually wrong in so many ways. Here are a few; 1) The prices listed were off. 2)College professors held office hours late on Friday afternoons. 3) Someone was paid with $1000 dollar bills.    I will give away one plot twist.  Someone has been stealing rare books for months.  Someone is given a contract to kill a girl two weeks before the first attempt is made to kill the girl who happens to be reading the rare book.  The brillant detectives assume the book thefts are to a smart way to cover up the murder.  I would have found the book less offensive if the plot twist was that young aliens were playing with their parents' time machine and that the aliens had given the murder contract in order to prevent their parents' from discovering the youthful indecretion 
 I was very disappointed with this book. The author continually tells the reader to be kind and gentle with children, and then recommends "alternatives to spanking" that are simply other types of punishments: time out, removal of privileges, and the like. She simply doesn't get it that children are human beings who behave as well as they are treated, and who will behave well when treated with love and respect. Would the author respond well if her partner tried to control her in these ways? There are many better choices - see the book titles listed at The Natural Child Project  and La Leche League websites 
 Great idea for a story - but just an "ok" book that could have been so much better 
 I do not consider myself a conspiracy theorist, just a fact based reality observer.  I would like to ask the author a question though.  For all the conspiracy theorists out there, i'm sure at least SOME of them link Dick Cheney to a group trying to take over the world or whatever.  Tell me this, what are the odds of him being involved with a company that has intentionally fixed (or willed, I think YOU might say) the energy prices in California sky high to make a huge profit and cause widespread recession and economic problems in parts of the state of California, thus causing all sorts of problems for the Governor of California at the time, Gray Davis (whom I despise) which led to a Republican Governor (also implicated in conspiracy theories as he had earlier shown political ambitions in a film made called Demolition Man)...and on and on and on.  I guess you'd call it a conspiracy of coincidence, but not I.  BTW, what is one of the number one crimes committed in the world today?  Do you know?  Conspiracy to committ.  I don't think things are quite as "cut and dry" as you seem to imply in your book sir 
 I bought this video at a discount book store and was excited to see a new Method DVD. I like variety and consider myself an advanced exerciser.   I did it once, didn't sweat and was BORED!  It has been gathering dust ever since.  
 Well, I guess it's been a while since I've been a college student. I'm a crusty old amateur radio hobbyist now. I guess all college texts have ridiculous prices. This book used to be the best reference I've ever seen on basic electronics for non-EE's, and even for non-engineers. It's not much of a cookbook - instead, it will make you sit down and work through the fundamentals of the circuits you're designing or adapting. The second ed. is getting long in the tooth, and since the book is used as a college text, it's preposterously overpriced. The one terrible thing about the book is that there are no answers to the (otherwise excellent) exercises, and you have to pay out again to get answers to the questions you're not sure about. It will be interesting to see what the 3rd ed. looks like. Maybe I'll start a web site and publish the answers online 
 C. S. Lewis exposed the circular reasoning in Hume in the book "Miracles."  David Hume was not a skeptic.  He was a freemason and therefore a gnostic.  He was only skeptical of nongnostic positions, such as Christianity.  He was an apologist for gnosticism.  He had blind faith allegiance to the masonic lodge and its creed.  His argument against miracles is his chief argument against Christianity, and it suffers from circular reasoning.  Circular reasoning you exclaim?  Yes.  Hume argued that miracles violate uniform experience.  However, if uniform experience is against mircales, then they cannot happen.  Uniform experience is his presupposition.  But, uniform experience is defined to exclude miracles.  If they didn't happen, well, they didn't happen.  This begs the question.  I have a better argument than Lewis's.  I would simply point out that pure logic cannot dispense with the empirical question of whether miracles happen.  Afterall, mathematics is made up of tautologies.  As such, mathematics or logic or any formal reasoning cannot have physical meaning.  Pure logic, as Hume employs, cannot tell us anything about the world.  Therein lies the sophistry.  It boils down to the distinction between analytic statements and synthetic statements.  Whether or not miracles happen depends not on logic, but on the existence of God who intervenes in human affairs.  As the former atheist Antony Flew said, it is impossible to argue against the existence of God in light of the evidence of intelligent design of the universe.  If anyone went to the moon and found a house there that supplied oxygen, food and other human necessities, they wouldn't hesitate to posit a creator of that house.  So why would anyone question the existence of God in light of this wonderful planet that supports our lives?  What is remarkable about him is how irrational he is.  He possesses a flair for writing and shows great promise in reasoning.  Yet, he sacrifices good reasoning for pushing his gnostic agenda.  It's like a person who graduates from medical school who decides to murder patients, or a graduate from law school who chooses to rob banks.  He tries to use reasoning to support irrational thought.  Hume was a strange man.  The engine is running, but there's no one behind the wheel.  
 I think this book had a boring ending it ended as if it was a movie that was going to have a sequel to it. There was no point to the ending of the book. The only thing I liked about the book was that it showed that no matter what race anyone was they should get along. All in All this book did not interest me 
 I bought this video as something to throw in with my regular routine so I wouldn't get stuck in a plateau from not enough variation.  Unfortunately, the routines were confusing and difficult to follow.  It also consisted of a lot of standing in one place and shimmying your body as opposed to really getting a workout by moving.  I was very disappointed, especially after reading all the other great reviews.  10 minutes into the workout I turned it off because my heart rate wasn't what I wanted for a cardio workout.  I would not suggest this as a good workout even for a beginner 
 This book is a sensationalized report of the Iran-contra affairs.  Its author seeks to shock the reader of the government's misconduct.  There is very little historical, methodical, or academic virtue to this book.  It's for sheer shock and awe, which can easily be taken from serious book like Theodor Draper's A Very Thin Line 
 I read Bill Bryson's "A Walk in the Woods" and laughed hysterically at many parts of the book, and through the rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated (for the "educated" aspect, Bill interlaces the book with fascinating factual tangents).  I started into "In a Sunburned Country" with similar expectations, and especially since I have always longed and planned to visit Australia.  To state that I was disappointed is a severe understatement.  After reading this book I now have little to no desire to visit the "land down under;" my only hope is that I will completely forget what I read in Bryson's book so that I may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting Australia.  (Senility be merciful and consume me hastily!)  My best estimate is that Bryson was commissioned to write a ~350 page book about Australia.  During and / or after his trip, his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own.  I have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as I did with this one.  Bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a "story" relayed second-hand from one of the Australians he "met."  Such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books.  The only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents.  These, at least, provided for some interesting reading.  After comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of Bryson's books ("I'm A Stranger Here Myself") after she read "A Walk in the Woods," it would appear that "In a Sunburned Country" is not the only snore-fest that Bryson has churned out.  Perhaps he isn't a "one hit wonder," but I for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out.  So, if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that Bryson provided in "A Walk in the Woods," look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed.  
 After reading A Brief History of Time I decided that I wanted to learn more about Stephen Hawkings himself and how he became who he is today. I picked up this book written by Kitty Ferguson, which is claimed to be a biography and started reading it. After about twenty pages she was done talking about his life and started talking about his theories. This was disappointing to me because I thought the book was a biography.   As I continued reading I became somewhat confused while she told about Hawkings discoveries. The explanations were little or none in trying to get the reader to understand the ideas. It did not help that there were very few small illustrations that were in the book to go along with her explanations. If there were highly detailed color illustrations such as those in A Brief History In Time, it might have been much easier to understand.  I did enjoy the beginning of the book where Kitty goes into detail about the beginning of Hawkings life but I feel like it was just an overview of how he became who he is today. I would not recommend this book, instead I would recommend A Brief History In Time because it is much easier to understand because it has great illustrations and is not so mathematical 
 The remake took out the best elements of the original while keeping its initial problems, some of them being the sudden mutual understanding that a fog is responsible for the deaths as well as the "mishap" that the fog F/X's in the remake look just as campy as the original ones.   The acting is absolutely dreadful. I had hopes for Selma Blair - but nevermind. Carpenter's version gave us at least some rock solid minutes by Hal Hoolbrock, Janet Leigh and John Houseman. Even Tom Atkins beats the hell out of the pretty boy poorly taking over his role. The camera work is reminiscent of productions suited for television yet not fit for the silver screen. The editing is way too quick - something I blame many current filmmmakers for who paste the story together so quickly that the viewer doesn't even have time to let the action on screen sink in.  The soundtrack: generic bass sounds, crescendo-ing horns...the usual. Carpenter's fistful of repetitive piano notes had at the time more impact. This remake (just like the majority of other remakes) was designed to suck ten bucks out of the pockets of horror film fans who should know better by now. Did I mention that this film is family friendly? 'Nough said 
 The monster was pretty fake. The jokes were corny. The special effects...were there any? The underwater shots were grainy. At times, it was over-acted. This movie was so-so. It won't scare you. The Alien series or The Cave are much better. This movie may have been okay in its day, but times have changed...and movie making have improved a lot...a whole lot. Skip this flick 
 I regret to inform that Anne Rice has been reduced from an open minded author with original ideas, to a narrow minded christian.  This book will be interesting for: * those who have never read or heard about the time period Jesus grew up * christians and other book-religious people  Otherwise, nothing really interesting happens in this book. At least for people who have been exposed to more than a bible.  I'm sorry to lose such a great author to the, in my opinion, real dark side. I give it 2 stars for the research work, 0 for the story.  Sorry, Anne Rice. I will still read your old book 
 Unfortunately, just like most books of its kind (histories of specific firms written with full cooperation from the firm involved), "The Perfect Store" is way too obsequious to eBay's official "party line", and doesn't engage in real, hard-hitting, investigative journalism.  Moreover, the book is severely out of date -- it tells you nothing about the last several years of eBay, and in a sector that changes as fast as internet commerce, this is a serious problem.  The book is well-written and competently organized, but that doesn't make up for the substantial problems with the quality and timeliness of its conents 
 This was my first Deaver book...and my last.  The suspense factor was "ok", but the sections on scuba were ridiculous.  A diver (with only 25 logged Caribbean clear-water dives) goes into a new NY/NJ wreck, alone (no dive buddy), on a single tank.  And the Coast Guard approves this dive...laughable.  Then once in the wreck, the diver goes down a dumbwaiter passageway measuring 2' by 2', without taking off any gear!!!    You might ask why I point this out...The above was 2 chapters, not just some passing reference, a very material piece of the story.  If this one section [which I know something about] is that outlandish, what does that say for the other sections that I'm not as informed about.  Complete Science Fiction!!!  You are better off reading tea leaves than this book. 
 I bought this book sight unseen, and ended up very disappointed. The fact I actually agree with Galbraith only makes this more maddening.  Most of the points he makes challenge conventional wisdom, but are not particularly original in themselves, and his pompous yet abstruse writing style makes reading a painful slog. I have never seen such abuse of the passive tense and periphrases, Strunk and White must be spinning wildly in their graves.  This is a very slender volume, essentially the content of an op-ed column padded to fit an essay. The price the publisher is asking for this slim folio (it hardly qualifies as a book) is perhaps the real fraud here 
 I like this amp but it causes my TV (Sharp Aquos 42" LCD) to lose synch whenever the video has a sudden white flashes (NFL sports transitions, War of the Worlds death-beam blasts, Drawn Together transitions, explosions, stuff like that).  The synch loss takes about 5 or so seconds for my particular TV to recover from, which is pretty annoying.  When I had the problem I searched the web and found that numerous others had similar problems with this and other Onkyo receiver models, but Onkyo doesn't seem to acknowledge the issue.  It's a good receiver, but if you buy it save the packing for a few weeks just in case it causes problems for your TV as well.  Given that these problems seem to have been around for a good year or more and Onkyo isn't fixing them, I can only give this 2 stars 
 Reminiscent of essays written by bored school children, The Planets by Sobel is lacking in enthusiasm and excitement for its subject matter. The boring regurgitation of fact bogs down what might otherwise be an novel approach to astronomy integrating myth and science.  I highly recommend this book to those who have trouble sleeping at night, otherwise find an author who brings the wonders of the planets to life 
 This book covers very little of the subject for which it is titled. If one were looking for a pure molecular biology textbook with some developmental correlations, then this is the text for you. It covers none of classical embryology and development. It is geared more towards laboratory technical work than to understanding fundamental principles. I had to give it only one star because of the misleading title. In reading this book, you will not learn the steps and stages of embryology and development. This text expects you to already know them like the back of your hand. You will not learn any developmental anatomy. You will learn a lot of seemingly arbitrary chemical signaling. Also, this text contains no glossary. I don't know what the author was thinking with that 
 Pass on the hype.....this book is a soft general overview. However it lacks on technical details. It focuses mainly in two areas, 883 coversion and history. Again the 883 conversion IS NOT TECHNICALLY DEEP and I would even venture to say lacking. I was disapointed in this book. Not recommended 
 As someone who saw the Grassroots live in 65 I was hoping this would be a good CD to add to my collection.  I am very disappointed.  I finally dug out my Cassette copy of Golden Grass, bought the conversion software, and now has a wonderful CD of the real Grassroots.  What a difference!  Save your money, don't buy this cover-band garbage.  Long Live PF Sloan and Steve Barri 
 The number of absurd coincidences, cliffhangers, and deus ex machinas required to sustain the plot of this boy scout daydream would challenge anyone's ability to suspend disbelief.  I would rate it as slightly less credible than the Wizard of Oz.  This silliness spoiled it for me, though I might have loved it if I had run across it at the age of 12.  This book does not give any kind of reliable view of World War I.  It is a fairytale.  Also despite what other reviewers have said, I found the South African apartheid-style racism pervasive and offensive.  This kind of thought was no more acceptable in 1916 than it is today, as Gandhi made so eloquently clear at the time 
 I picked this book up with very high expectations. I ordered the Harcover edition of this book because I thought for sure it was going to be a prized gem in my library. WRONG!!! This has to be the most BORING book I've read in my entire life and I am not one to criticize, but it was just poorly written. She said the same things over and over again such as "You know children don't take after strangers", which was cute at first but quickly turned into a nuisance.I was so bored I almost put this book on the shelf without finishing it and I always finish books. I finished the book to see if it was going to get any better. WRONG AGAIN! If I had known it was this bad I would have saved my money and used it towards something better. If you just have to read it, please borrow it from someone or check it out from the libary! 
 Catholics thinking about purchasing this book should know that it is written and published by representatives of the break-away organization the "Society of St. Piux X," that the book bears neither an Imprimatur nor Nihil Obstat from Catholic bishops, and that its contents and commentaries are not necessarily conforming to Catholic doctrine 
 How anyone could rate this movie 4-5 stars is beyond belief. This was such a contrived movie that had a simple plot that went nowhere. As I watched this movie I could not figure out if it was meant to be a comedy or a drama. It was never very funny and both lead actors, playing one white and one adopted black brother, had scenes in the movie that were terrible. Romany Malco has a scene where he is running around in his underwear for no apparent reason accept to show off his body. He jumps out of bed when his cell phone rings, runs down the stairs and then outside and back in just to gather everyone in the house and scold them, in his drawers? He is talentless and idiotic as a "brother" in France that no one can relate to. Paul Rudd is likable but his shining scene is when he comes back to the chateau drunk and "grossly" tells off everyone - people he has known for less than a week! The servants are the best actors in the movie and play their parts well...but can't make up for the dismal rest. Ludicrous - a bad movie that probably could have been funny if they had went for laughs instead of drama. This is another example of a rental that you think is going to be good but then disappoints 
 I bought this, I'm SO SO Sorry. It looks nice, but so hard to use that we ended using the old remotes. You just can't handle it like an elongated one hand remote. The touch screen is nice, but useless as you can't handle it without looking at it, and doing both controlling and pointing and looking at devices is next to impossible.  Do not buy this model. Try the 890 (which I bought, but was dumb enough to return for the 1000) 
 A terrific idea: Show the current time AND the alarm times all at once. Very intuitive, very helpful. Unfortunately, the backlit LCD display just doesn't make the grade. The numbers do not stand out against the bright background enough to be easily readable. The manufacturer's photo makes the numbers look sharp and clear, but the customer image from wickedpete is much more realistic. The numbers just wash out.  It's interesting that the customer image shows the orange and green backlights reversed from the manufacturer's image and from the unit I got. I think that would be a slight improvement, because on the one I got, the orange (backlighting the alarm times) is about twice as bright as the green (backlighting the current time), and it just looks weird.  Also, FM radio reception is quite poor. The line cord is supposed to serve as the antenna, but that just doesn't work well no matter how I orient the cord. I can't tune in a strong station just 10 miles away. So back it goes 
 If you thought the Windows 2000 install and performance were bad wait until you try it under XP!   I should have spent the extra dollars and gotten a decent card.   :( 
 I found this book to repetitive.  It just keeps going on and on, on how bad Web feels about the death of his 7 team mates.  Also, it has harsh racist descriptions on some characters that don't really add to the story at all.  It just adds to the stereotype of how life is in Annacostia, Washington DC.  One such description is that of the black grandmother of the missing kid.  She is described as a big black woman about the sides of a small car with big breast and lives in a house full of rat excrements. I don't recommend this book at all, but if you are a narrow minded white male, who thinks that he is at the top of the hill looking down on the rest, this book is for you 
 It is authors and books like these that continue to show that there is no evolution in the novels put out but white wolf...they only want action, no character development or originality, is really very sad. You want a good fanatsy book...read someone like Sharon Shinn, Glen Cook or Mercedes Lackey and steer clear of  poorly written amateur books such as this one 
 First of all, let me qualify this review by stating up front that I have been a DM fan since its inception and think that the band has single-handedly influenced a whole generation of musicians. That being said, I think this album is a symptom of a much larger problem with the band: a real lack of vision and originality.  On the good side, many DM diehard fans will like the majority of the tracks because it reverts to familiar fodder - dark lyrics with machine-driven rhythms. On the bad side, it's all too familiar stuff with  beats that could have been lifted from earlier efforts. The only real difference is that the tracks on "Angel" sound like they've been fed through a fuzz-box.   The first time I listened to this disc, I thought I had blown-out the speakers because the drum tracks clipped and everything else sounded distorted and fuzzy. I soon realized this was intentional, but had to ask myself, why? "Exciter" was experimental, but a truly drained effort. This album sounds like a pale imitation of Bjork. They even copied the toy piano and music box stuff like on Bjork's "Vespertine" album. The difference between Bjork and DM is that Bjork knows how to use weird sounds to enhance a lyric and create a musical mood. This album just sounds like conventional mid 80's DM music that was fed through badly recorded effects.  I really could feel the creative slide with this band when "Ultra" was released, but this record confirms what I have sensed for some time. The band has really struggled to achieve artistic relevency since the departure of Alan Wilder. Martin Gore is a musical genius, but he has limitations when carrying 90% of the musical vision and writing. I really think Gore needs an intellectual foil to conterpoint and challenge his ideas. Unfortunately, this album sounds more like a Gore solo effort than a true DM product and as a result, the music has greatly suffered. Gone are the famously catchy hooks and relevant, edgy lyrics. Here comes the gloomy ballads with headcase-jilted-lover lyrics (yawn). A new member or creative colaborator in the band would inject some fresh ideas into their music or I fear this may be their last record.  Word of advise: although this album does show some promise at times, your best friend here is iTunes. Download "Precious" and preview the rest of the record before making any additional choices. You may find it very hard to find another tune worthy of keeping on your iPod 
 John Steinbeck is one of my favorite authors. I love Of Mice And Men, East of Eden, and The Grapes Of Wrath. But this 4-part story of a a boy and a horse (which isn't even about the horse that much) is pointless drivel. I'll admit, I liked the first part of it, which is great and good enough to warrant two stars. The rest of it feels disjointed. I couldn't wait to get done with it.  It isn't a terrible book, but it isn't good at all. It's below average, and below average is not what I expect from the writer of Of Mice And Men 
 Luckily, I didn't pay a penny for the motorized SkipDr. as it was given to us as a "prize." I have the original (manual) SkipDr. which worked every time, and I always end up using it instead. It has more than paid for itself in repaired CD's--$20 for an entire kit at a wholesale club that came with spare sanding discs and the whole shebang.  The motorized version didn't come with any deep scratch sanding pads, which I need about 25% of the time for a badly scratched disc. Most of the time the automatic sensor fails to detect that a disc is even in the machine, and won't start turning, so I have to squeeze it together to make it work 
 Finally viewed this one after everyone hyped it.  It was an okay movie, nothing exciting and certainly not worth the cult status it supposedly has.  If you've seen one pool movie, you've seen this one.  Mars Callahan should either get acting lessons or quit altogether because his character and the way he portrayed him was the most unbelieveable thing in this film.  "The Shooting Gallery" was a better film in all areas compared to this one in my opinion.  Of course there is always the "Color of Money" and the unbeatable "The Hustler" 
 I hardly know how to describe this book.  When I read it two years ago, my hatred for Pamela (the character) was something of an amusing obsession.  Although Richardson had meant to portray a model of feminine virtue, Pamela is vain, conniving, self-righteous, wordy, and obnoxiously weak.  I cannot think of a more annoying character in literature...Uriah Heep, Lydia Bennett, Newland Archer...all are more tolerable than Pamela.  I find myself rooting for Pamela's ruin. To top everything off, Pamela's great reward for maintaining her virtue is a marriage to the man who had so many times tried to rape her.  As a husband, Mr. B. is temperamental and demanding.  And this is virtue rewarded?  Even by 18th century standards the idea was thought absurd by many, such as Henry Fielding who wrote parodies, Shamela and Joseph Andrews. Yet despite all this, the book is at times entertaining (if for all the wrong reasons) and pleasantly sentimental.  I admit, I hate it and love it.  I searched and searched to find Pamela part II (yes, Richardson actually did write a sequel).  So far it promises to be just as frustrating as part I!    
 The science is: brains are like neural nets; a hidden layer with feedback gives nets the ability to detect temporal patterns; information/logic in a net is distributed.  That's it, plus some rambling about Husserl that seems largely irrelevant (if you're curious it's summarised pretty well by the review above (by the "top 100 reviewer" who apparently never gives below 4 stars...))  So if you're at all interested in consciousness, you probably know the science.  If you don't, then I assume you've read a bit more than the typical science nerd and expect a basic level of narrative competence - you're going to be disappointed.  The fiction part is embarassingly bad.  The plotting is appalling; the characterisation cartoon-like.  Some reviewers are saying this would be good for an introductory course.  It would have to be very introductory.  (I see that this book is currently being offered with Papadimitriou's "Turing".  That's not a great book, either, but it's stunningly good compared to this - it has warmth, wit and depth.  The closest this book gets is a painful irony; the cover suggest that someone, somewhere, was hoping for a noir ambience, but the only darkness comes from a power cut).  I feel bad writing a negative review, because I guess this was a work of love.  I can understand the desire to popularise ideas that you find interesting.  But please, if you're going to take my money, give me something at least half-way decent.  If I were the author I'd be pretty mad with the editors at MIT for letting me publish something this bad.  And finally, I note that one star is the lowest rating possible, which is rather sneaky of Amazon (doesn't their use of the arithmetic mean imply a zero-based scale?).  [Later - for a stunning treatment of similar material see Power's Galatea 2.2 
 Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked 
 There are already quite a few negative reviews on this router but just in case you are still considering buying it, here's one more.  This router simply doesn't work.  I'm on a second one after returning the first completely inoperable one.  This second one is just as frustrating and is a waste of space.  I am constantly resetting it in hopes of it magically working.  Sometimes it works for 15 seconds (long enough to load one page) and when I try to go to the next page, it is already dead again.  Arrgh.  If I had to choose between the old days with dial up on AOL vs. using this router and completely unreliable access, I'd go for AOL (with all of its re-dials and disconnects).  Please avoid this product.  Finally, even if the price were reduced by 75%, it still would not be a good buy 
 These recipes are boring hardly professional. The author had a cooking school in her home...c'mon??? That is exactly what the recipes look like.  There are no secrets in cooking, just good techniques and procedures. There are too many organizations out there like the International Association of Cooking Professionals that give awards to their members for marketing purposes...friends supporting friends.  Terrible book...and that is no secret 
 I didn't finish this book, I threw it away after I found too many factual errors.  It may be an interesting book but don't trust it 
 It's all well and good for people to be researching this subject.  As an 'abductee' (that word just doesn't do it justice), my first thought when I heard Mack had finished his book was "It's about damn time a major  figure got into the field".  But then I got really ticked-off when I  heard about his past life regression and other new-age consciousness  theories.  I read the book and was appalled that someone of his collegiate  stature would be lured-in by this contactee bull dung.  Sure enough, months  go by and his contactees start admitting they made the stuff up.  OF COURSE  THEY DID!  Anyone who thinks the...'things' act with ethical benevolence is  either lying or delusional.  The truth is bitter and unpleasant.  Want to  know what kind of crud goes on?  Read David Jacobs' "Secret  Life".  I'll personally vouch for it 
 I have recently read 5 books about the Trappists/Cistercians and this is the worst book of them all.  I have spent 10 days on retreats at a Trappist abbey and more to come, and I DO NOT recommend this book for several  reasons.  First, the author has approached his subject as a journalist and  has a negative tone.  Secondly, he has included too much autobiographical  information about his own life and spiritual struggles.  Thirdly, he has a  rather arrogant attitude about his desire to invade the privacy of some of  the monks who choose not to be interviewed by him.  Lastly, his tone is  that of one being perched "on-high" and gazing down upon the lives of the  Trappist monks.  For a much better introduction to Trappist/Cistercian  monasticism: The Silent Life, By Thomas Merton; The Cistercian Way, By  Andre Louf; Trappist: Living in the Land of Desire, By Michael Downey; and  The Orchards of Perseverance, By David Perata.  I believe that these other  titles are much more accurate in portraying the spirituality and practice  of Trappist monks 
 This review may sound pretentious and ignorant, but in truth I'm a big fan of British history, so bear with me!    Even as a film itself, it's surreal, and I don't like the acting.  But as with any historical film that includes the British, they're made out to be the absolute bad guys!  Sure we were forging an empire within France (i.e. The Hundred Years War), but rapists and murdering pillagers!?  Never!  Historically accurate, full of British sentiment, and down-right weird.  Avoid this film today, folks! 
 This book and the great mass of the photos relate not to the garage, ie, a covered space where cars are stored or where a hobbyist workshop is located, but converted space or living space above a garage.  If you're interested in creative garage layout, workshop arrangement, automobile-related storage, etc., this is not the book.  If your desire is to turn a hardworking garage into a granny flat, this is for you 
 Well, if anything this was a decently written story, with good dialect and character detail. However, this story felt like it was going around in circles without any indication of ever ending. Grafton seems to have an idea of where she wants to go with this story but never really gets there.    The story starts off with PI Kinsey Milhone in her office at night when she hears a knock on her door. She opens it to find Janice Kepler, mother of Lorna Kepler standing before her with the tale of her daughter's mysterious death. Not only this, but she also explains to Kinsey about how no one ever solved the murder because Lorna's body was left to decompose for ten months in her isolated cabin house. They talk for a while about the strange circumstances surrounding her daughter's death until Janice tells Kinsey about a pornographic video that was sent to her house after Lorna's death. This tape leads Kinsey on a wild goose chase of suspects in the red light district and gets her nowhere when it comes to turning over the real murderer.   	Millhone dives even further and searches through the world of Lorna's day job where she uncovers a mysterious lead about an expensive, elaborate project which is angering several people a considerable amount. Kinsey also checks up on Lorna's family members, and with the exception of Janice, all seem to have a motive to murder her Lorna.  	 Not being a fan of these types of novels, I decided to at least give it a chance but this story got me nowhere. By the middle of the novel I wanted to give up and skip to the end of the story, but when I got to the end I had to go back to the middle to figure out how everything ended. I stopped caring about the whole murder after so much more emphasis was placed on so much side stories and it seemed like Grafton did too. The ending left me with a strange feeling and I didn't know if the book had actually ended. All in all, it was just not the right kind of book for me but if you're a murder mystery fan, try any other of Grafton's alphabet themed novels besides this one 
 Due to the fact that you can't give 0 stars, I had to choose a 1, otherwise it would have been a big fat 0!!! We bought this mattress when I was pregnant, thinking that all crib mattresses were the same and we were totally wrong. A couple months ago my son poked a couple holes in the vinyl when he should have been napping, mind you he had nothing to use other than his fingers, no toys, nothing sharp, etc. Well last night he wakes up crying in the middle of the night, and my husband and I go in to see what is the matter, and find that the vinyl had split completely from side to side and the springs were sticking out. My poor little one had the springs poking at him. After further examination, we found that under the vinyl is a thin and I stress the word thin, layer of foam, then CARDBOARD piece and then the coils. What a joke!  Carboard!!!! Needless to say I went out today and bought him a much better, better constructed Simmons mattress. I should note my son is only 17 mths old, and the first five months of his life he never even slept on that mattress, so bascially he had only used it for 12 mths. Don't waste your money ....you'll only have to buy another one down the road. Take your money and buy a much better well known mattress for your baby!!! Afterall they deserve just as good a nights sleep as we do!!!   From a mom who learned the hard way! 
 In the ad, this cable charger claims to sync and charge but will not hotsync to my Treo. It will charge but I already have a home and a car charger so it serves me no purpose. Falsely calims to sync 
 I like the way this book teaches the bridge pattern. I liked the first edition as a stop-gap. I had anticipated that the second edition would beef the book up in several areas - it didn't. My main problem with this book is that it doesn't stand the test of time. I do not find myself coming back to it 
 "The Heart is a Lonely Hunter" is simply a compilation of character sketches loosely strung together.  If you are a student of literary characterization and the methods authors use to bring a character to life, you might enjoy this book. The charcters are indeed animated.  However, if you are searching for a book that combines vivid characters with any sort of plot, this book is not for you.  By the time I was half-way through the book I was seriously wondering when a coherant plot would develop.  One never materialized.  This book does not adhere to the standard beginning-middle-end, protagonist-antagonist-plot-resolution formula by which most novels abide.   As I was reading this book as a book club assignment, I trudged through to its completion.  Now all I wish is that I could recapture the hours of life wasted on its pages.  
 starts off with an interesting premise about media influence and politcal power but turns into bush bashing anti-corperate rant.the problem with the media is bias, the problem with this film is the same bias 
 My overall recommendation is to read Bryson's brilliantly funny recent works, then go back to less recent works, then stop before you get to this one.  As other discerning reviewers have noted (especially Amer-Aussie, whose spot-on review you really must mark as 'helpful'), Bryson looks for the worst in America and, surprise, he finds it.  Sure, there's much that's funny here, but the humor gets swallowed up by the mean.  Let me add one more observation, which amazingly seems to have eluded all:  one of Bryson's worst habits--even worse than his penchant for telling you where he is politically (he hates Republicans)--is his smug disdain for and ridicule of religion, particularly Christianity.  Happily, Bryson's later books show a maturity absent in this one 
 I was left with a sense of annoyance after reading this book. Maybe it was because i started it believing it was a memoir. When i then read the contrived jacket, i learned it was a work of fiction: "Dark, humorous, and exquisitely haunting, his final book of fiction...". In the book, the writer reveals that his birthday was January 30, his daughter married without his approval, he hated traveling, etc. I had never before heard about Richard Brautigan, so i did a bit of research. What a surprise to find out that he was born on January 30, his daughter married without his approval, he hated to travel, and so on. So this work of "fiction" turned to be pretty autobiographical after all.   The style of the book is certainly different to anything i have ever read before. The narrative is almost what you would hear in a conversation. There are many artificial segments interspersed here and there. For example, "Maybe i'll describe what I have been doing since I interrupted or was interrupted writing this book nine days ago..." He goes on to describe a dream, and then all of a sudden 14 days have passed and he says the book is "mischevious and grows more and more to follow the way life works out". How helpless.   Another aspect of the writing that i did not like at all is the self-indulgence that permeates it. "I got a glass of wine as I said I would - interruption for a Montana nature break. I just felt something dimly crawling on my arm". And he goes for an entire page talking about a spider. The last page, where he thanks the company that made the notebook, is another example.   So sorry about Brautigan. The expression "pobre hombre" comes to mind when i think of him. What a painful existence he must have lived. But, no matter how fanciful or different your writing style is, that doesn't make it art. Others have explored the subject of death in a far more compelling, delicate, articulate manner. Brautigan's vision was ultimately selfish, the way he was with his daughter, his relationships, his friends. And it shows.  
 I'm rather upset with the technical quality of this DVD.  Grindhouse rereleased this disc exactly as it was in 2000, without so much as a 16x9 animorphic upgrade.  This is certainly not worth the $20+ dollar price tag Amazon.com has right now 
 Dont pay attention to any of these 4 & 5 star reviews. This album is a complete waste of time & space in anyones music library 
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 This is a copy of the review on Amazon.com for Van Zant's Get Right With The Man which is another Sony corrupted title.  "This CD secretly installs DRM (digital rights management) software on your PC without your permission. Not only does it do this, but the software then hides itself by installing as a "root kit."  As per WikiPedia,  -- Root kit From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. A root kit is a set of tools used by an intruder after cracking a computer system. These tools can help the attacker maintain his or her access to the system and use it for malicious purposes. Root kits are known to exist for a variety of operating systems such as Linux, Solaris and versions of Microsoft Windows.  A rootkit typically hides logins, processes, files, and logs and may include software to intercept data from terminals, network connections, and the keyboard. In many sources, rootkits are counted as trojan horses. --  In this instance, Sony installs DRM software to copy protect their CD, and prevent it from being copied to various devices, all the while not telling you, the user, or letting you uninstall it because it hides itself from the user and Windows.

 ZERO stars. If you live in Europe, forget about it. This thing only works on PC's with an all American time & date system. Unless you want to americanize your computer, it's not usable. Americans could also have some complaints, for instance that the "book" (real paper) that's included is unreadable because it's glued to the carton - and all the selected articles are unreadable anyway because it's only one page, continued on a following page which is NOT included in the book. Furthermore you have to insert DVD's all the time: you can't copy them to your hard drive, no no, INSERT DVD, that's the way. It's EIGHT dvd's: whenever you click an article, you have to insert this or that dvd... This thing has an impractible, arrogant, snobbish and non-cosmopolite air about it - and reading a few articles, one thinks: what's the fuss about anyway? Famous names, sometimes, but not the best those famous names ever wrote, and the rest of the articles (99%) is trash. Chic, expensive but empty magazine fodder, nothing else. Best thing is the old ads, but they tire very quick. Back issues of Vogue and Cosmo would be much more entertaining. This is the first time I will return an item to Amazon 
 I had for some time been interested in reading the story of the Confederate ship the Shenandoah. I about 3 recent books and finally decided upon this one but would recommend that if you are interested, you try a different one. While obviously well researched, it was not an enjoyable read. I never felt very engaged in the story and certainly never felt that I had any insight into the persons or what drove them. I never even felt that I got much of a feel for sea life. Generally, although I now know the story, I do not feel I understand the story anymore then I did before reading this book 
 The publishers made a typo error in this book's title - they added an "f".  Instead of "Another Life", it should more appropriately be titled "Another Lie."  Although it is a  well-written and fairly entertaining memoir, it is the Napoleonic ambitions  of its author that make it a very dubious and unreliable addition to any  non-fiction library.  Due to Michael Korda's supremely fragile ego, always  in danger of having to be placed in intensive care, everything in this book  must be viewed very skeptically.  Korda not only takes credit for himself  but distorts and erroneously states facts so that he can be the hero and  the mastermind.  After reading a few chapters, I became suspicious of  Korda's "memory" when he always appeared as the brilliant,  all-knowing catalyst of every event he was participating in.  When I came  to his chapter on his relationship with Graham Greene, I had the sense he  was exaggerating his teenage friendship with the famous author - logic just  wasn't on Korda's telling of the tale, especially since none of the  principals are alive to offer a differing view, as is true for most of  Korda's stories.  But, as for facts, I decided to do some research and  check what Korda was relating about his publshing career.  Alas, he has  created more fiction than fact in relating these tales.  I could write half  a book on his lies and misrepresentations, but I merely use one case in  point.  His experience with the bestselling novelist Susan Howatch.  On  pages 309 and 3l0 Korda presents Howatch as "some unknown woman in New  Jersey sitting at her kitchen table and holding her baby as she wrote"  the book which HE discovered and became the best seller  "Penmarric".  This was l970 and Korda paints the scene as if he  is plucking an unknown first author and using HIS great judgment to  determine that she, indeed, has written a great book.  ACTUALLY, Susan  Howatch had begun writing novels in l965 and was a successful and respected  author of three novels published by Stein & Day by the time Korda  caught up with her. It's rather clumsy and absurd to present her as his  discovery, BUT Korda goes on to state that he perceptively noticed the  subtle parallel between "Penmarric"'s plot and the lives of Henry  II and Eleanor of Aquitaine.  He relates how Howatch reluctantly confessed  to having borrowed the historical plot and was nervous that someone else  might also notice.  Korda, fully confident of his own superior brillance,  assured her that no one would, and he states that they went ahead and  published the book and not one reviewer commented on the Henry and Eleanor  similarities.  HOW CURIOUS.  Especially since Howatch's book states in  passages at the beginning of every chapter the Henry and Eleanor story and  how it applies to the following chapter.  She plainly wrote the parallel  right there in the book and used it for the structure of her novel.  And  every book review commented on this fact, especially the New York Times,  who thought it added greatly to the book's success.  What is Korda talking  about!  I'm afraid every chapter is filled with such self-serving lies and  erroneous facts that only serve to elevate poor little Michael Korda's  sense of self-importance.  The real crime here is how Korda gets away with  these very easily checkable lies and how his legendary Editor, Robert  Loomis of Random House, can allow this obvious distortion of truth to get  publish.  It's just not sloppy and careless editing, for which the aging  Loomis is becoming famous, it is the deliberate distortion of their own  industry and a real lowering of standards. This collaboration of Korda and  Loomis and its careless and fictionalized view of the New York book world  is far more eloquent than anything Mr. Korda has to say in his book. Yes,  book publishing really has gone downhill, and Korda and Loomis have taken  it another giant leap 
 I don't listen to this kind of music as I really hate the whole radio/alternatine scene.  I worked in a music store when this album was released and must have heard it 5 or 6 times a day as we had to play new releases in the store.  Although there is no talent in this band vocal or instrument wise, the music made me reminisce about high school days.  Anyway, this was a flavor of the day type band who has been forgotten about by now.  It was obviously a group created by music execs to have some radio play, milk every dime that it was worth and then thrown out like old chewing tobacco.  It's such a shame how music is being ruined like this. 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 Finestein's translations are so awful, it is no wonder that few English speakers want to know who Tsvetaeva is. She loses the rhythm, rhyme, literary devices, and everything for which Tsvetaeva's poetry is so loved. The duality of meanings and word play is also completely lost.  Try Angela Livingstone's translations - they are excellent 
 I was really looking forward to using this product given how pleased I have been with the iSkin covers for both of my iPods.  The iSkin cover for the MacBook Pro does not fit well over the keyboard and as another reviewer mentioned it makes the keys hard to read.  I plan on returning this keyboard protector 
 I am returning it.  The bluetooth signal keeps fading in and out every 45 seconds or so.  When it worked, it was great, but not a single song went by without the dead air problem for 3-4 seconds then it would reconnect and start playing again.  I contacted Logitech customer support and they sent me an email 3 days later with suggetions about a completely different product.  Then I called long distance to them and stayed on hold for 14 minutes only to be told that it sounded like it was defective and I should return it.  Not very satisfying customer service experience; I had high hopes for this product; I may order another one later and see if my luck is any better then.  
 Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him 
 Are we really to believe that the music of this man does not speak for  itself? Was it really his "political connections" and "who  he knew" that led to his success in 19th century Vienna? Are there  really other Beethovens running around out there who just haven't gotten a  break. A nice parlor exercise perhaps, but really.....how about a serious  listen to what he actually wrote down! What I am suggesting is a serious  listen. Why, for example, does his work seem to have a much higher density  of sheer thought (form if you like) than that of any other composer? Why  are his thematic constructs so intellectually exhilarating as well as  emotionally moving? Why does he exemplify the most startling development of  style of almost anyone you can think of in the arts? What is it about his  almost extra-material universal appeal? Listen to the music. Maybe the  answers are found there 
 This book mentions God, Jesus, Christ, or quotes Scripture multiple times in each chapter.  I freely acknowledge that some people might find this helpful, but I did not. Written for depressed Holy Rollers.  Skip it if you don't fit that description 
 Is this a book written for women by a woman? Or is it part of some patriarchial conspiracy to freak out ambitious and intelligent women enough to turn themselves into baby manufacturing facilities once again AND be at the mercy of a husband? Before this book makes you baby-hugry ... here are some statistics from the 2002 Fortune's Most Powerful  Women in Business Summit:  Of the total 187 attendees 71% are mothers 31 is the average age of first-time motherhood 2.2. is the average number of children born to working women  Other findings include that some attendees were made partners in a firm around the time of their first child. So ... before you go on a quest to marry and have children, ponder if you are acting out of love or fear instead? 
 He is too lifted... like a god... who says it's all true what he has done, ok ok... he must have done a lot... but i guess he wasn't the only one around there... he even got beaten too.. is that written in there...  Always mushashi this and that... i don't mean disrespect here...   But write me another book please about other samurais that time... without upholding the facemask of the japanese !!!  Like, what do we know about jinsuke shigenobu... minamoto no yoshimitsu... and lots and lots of others...  you won't fool me by telling he did it al by himself.. 
 I have not had a good pillow in a long time.  I wouldn't pay upwards of fifty dollars for a pillow.  But I gave in after reading the reviews and got this one.  It's way overpriced in my opinion but they are onto a very good idea.  First, I have had it for a couple of weeks and it's pretty flat now.  The coils are only in the very center of the pillow, and at times you do notice them there, but not in a bad way, just noticable.  The problem is the fluff they add to the pillow must be the cheapest possible nothing.  I imagine I will have a really strange looking square blob surrounded by a moat of flat fabric pretty soon.  At first, it was really comfy. I think that if they either put high quality fluff around it, or better yet put coils through the entire thing, with higher ones in the center, this would be outstanding, beyond all other pillows!  But as it is, it's not worth the price yet.  If you have tons of money to burn, go ahead and try it.  I wouldn't recommend anyone get two to sleep on at once, they would be awkward and they would be falling off the sides of eachother.  You could use a regular pillow below this one, but then you are back into the same pillow finding - switching game we all want to avoid.  I would have given three stars if it were a lot cheaper, but after going flat after only a few weeks, and the price, I had to give it two 
 i don't recommend this product. it gets locked up easily and it's hard for a 4 year old to figure out how to get it unjammed. my son got so annoyed with it he doesn't even attempt to play with it anymore 
 This book has some nice color photographs, and is another way to get the Starbucks name out into the public.  It really is nothing about Starbucks or Passion, has a few recipies 
 We bought this when our baby was born (6 months ago, only used it a few times until recently). He loves it now to get him to sleep. The problem lies in that at 4 am, my husband and I awake to hear the mobile playing...scares us to death since no one else should be around to start it. We go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals....the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off, causing the mobile to fall on the baby. (He thought it was the funniest thing in the world, he was okay, thank God.) But the little plastic hook piece was in his hand. If you have a 6-month old child you know that they eat everything they can find. I thank God that he didnt put that in his mouth. It is a great soother for the baby, but be sure there are no defects every day!   Like I said before, other than this, it has been great.  
 If you liked Whyte's previous sophomoric efforts, you'll love this.  In addition to being the same dumb, hackneyed story lines and stock characters we are used to from the previous books, this one has the additional feeling of being pure filler:  in no real way does the story get advanced.  Arthur begins as a baby, and ends as a small boy.  There are adventures, but nothing important happens.  As usual, in Whyte's books, the bad guys are left alive so they can sneak up and do new evil, and as usual the bad guys are pure plot devices and in no way characters.  With all the (totally ahistorical) democratic rhetoric, Merlin's brother shows up out of nowhere and they immediately hand him half the power in Camelot.  Anyone who would read this, I guess, has already read the previous lame offerings in this series and doesn't object to laughably boring plots which rely heavily on coincidence, caricatures who never grow or change, and historical detail that sounds like it comes from a museum brochure rather than any real scholarship.  So go for it.  But please, if you want something exciting that will also make you think, look at the really good Arthurian efforts out there--Gillian Brandshaw, A.A. Attanasio, or Barbara Taylor Bradford to name just a very few.. 
 I've dared to challenge my cinema-going art student friends and uni-mates, amid heated discussions about David Lynch, Akira Kurosawa and such, by confessing that I really didn't like Magnolia at all.  I feel that PT Anderson does indeed create well-rounded characters, compelling dialogue and stuff like that.  The actors cast in his movies always deliver brilliant performances - but in the end, I really felt Magnolia fell short of something more substantial.  It dragged on way too long, the extensive scenes never really seemed to go anywhere and I felt that some serious revisions and editing would have been most beneficial.  There were twists and diversions that didn't really add anything and overall I felt like it was a waste of time which is a shame because some of the scenes featured some great and inspiring acting but maybe they were misplaced.  It didn't really have the sort of message that I couldn't have gotten from a song or another movie in less time and all the symbollic, arty stuff came across as pretentious film-student stuff.  I think PT Anderson is highly overrated as a director and his films are way too self-indulgent.  I don't think he's very good at telling a story without going overboard and sending the viewer astray.  With the exception of the performances by Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise, I thought this film was terrible 
 From what I noticed, this book comes with few examples, which I need to learn well. However, I learned the same topics originally with Calculus by James Stewart (fifth edition), which comes with very clear explanations, diagrams, and examples. Then the practice problems start off easy and then gradually increase in difficulty. Instead of Kaplan's Advanced Calculus, the James Stewart book is highly resourceful and I would recommend it to any student in calculus, because it can work for practically anyone. 
 George Barna is not fuzzy about what he defines and promotes in the book 'Revolution'. But, after reading it, the question still stands -- Is this a biblically sound direction that believers should embrace? Although the author promotes some essentials, it is still describing a redefined Christianity.   You don't find 'statistical examples' in the book about the many Christian believers who were asked to leave their Church if they didn't adhere to the seeker-sensitive programs and changes, or how many born-again committed Christians were ostracized for verbalizing biblical and theological concerns with the model of church they were emulating, due to the popularity of the purpose-driven books and church-growth programs. These changes that were coming into churches, have continued to mutate into what is being called the Emergent church movement. At the end of Barna's book, the author lists 'Recommended resources for Revolutionaries', and the list reveals -- Emergent Church leaders and Authors - McLaren & Sweet, and website favorable to the Emergent movement.   The purpose-driven movement and now the Emerging movement have brought BIG changes into the majority of America's Churches that not every Christian agrees with. Trying to discuss these concerns with a Pastor brought serious consequences that for some Christians marked them as 'Trouble-makers', and some were labeled as disrupting the unity of the body and were forced to leave. So to group all these Committed Christians into a 'Revolution' with the same motives isn't realistic or entirely factual. A Careful theological approach is needed in reading this book; it is too easy to get swept-up in the hype and emotional appeal of the message in the book, without carefully examining it to Scripture. stay alert.     
 This product will not fix your disc, I tried to fix a damaged CD and it only made the problem worse.  I ended up throwing away the CD and the SkipDoctor.  This is a poorly designed and manufactured product that does not work, I wish someone would have told me this before I spent money on it 
 The portrayal of the Bobo in this book, and, more importantly, the fascination and inner glee with which many will gobble up this portrayal, seem light-hearted and fun, but herein lies the reason that Dubya managed to win over the hearts and minds of good, average, working-class people everywhere. Shockingly similar to Brooks' depictions is the conversatives' and right-wing fundamentalists' portrayal of liberals and Democrats: as effete, latte-loving milquetoasts, who know little to nothing about the travails and tribulations of hard-working, ordinary folk. The resulting "cultural wars," based on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and separation of church and state, served as the perfect mask to the dark agenda that Bush and the right-wingers have planned: privatization of social security, revamping of the tax and bankruptcy codes to benefit large corporations and the ultra-wealthy, the destruction of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and the list goes on and on.  Although I will admit to having enjoyed many of the anectodes in this book, it must be pointed out that they appeal only on the basest, most superficial level, and for this I am ashamed. Diverted by all the gadgets, toys, and conveniences of modern-day living, and the incessant feed of so-called ideas from a putatively liberal media, the Bobos and the primates who poke fun at them remain blissfully oblivious to the utter economic and environmental disaster that we're headed toward.  Instead of spending your money on this book, I recommend that you sit down, find some well-written blogs, and read some (free!) critical commentary on politics and the state of our country, and then try to formulate your own ideas about our society today; in other words, THINK for yourself 
 Maybe this DVD would be good if you know & like the group, "Collective Soul" before you watched it. I didn't, & I found the lead singer to be an annoyingly privileged navel-gazer, so much so, I wanted to tell him to shut up & go back to the USA already. I bought the DVD because I thought I'd get to see some great shots of Morocco on film but, no-ooo, all I saw was that guy crooning away in some pretty ill-chosen spaces. Take this DVD off my hands, please!!!  
 I ordered this book because I play a rogue and was hoping to get access to new feats, enhance my skills, maybe get a new prestige class worth aiming for with my rogue. The Complete Adventurer really whet my appetite for a rogue-based "complete" book, since it provides so much of value for new feats, weapons, and prestige classes. Unfortunately, the Complete Scoundrel is nowhere near as useful as any other "Complete" book.  Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of new material. The catch is that all of it requires that you design your campaign with that new material. And THAT means that any existing game can not simply plug these new prestige classes, skills, or feats in. There are some new spells that can be used, and there are some new ways of hiding blades and some new alchemy items that might be easily used, but about 95% of this book ends up being useless in an existing game. If you want to DM and have a fairly wild world, this is a good book for you and your players. If you are a player, talk to your DM first before buying this book. If you don't, the Complete Scoundrel might be collecting dust on your bookshelf just like my copy does 
 I should start by saying I am a big Clive Cussler fan and have read all his books.  The only ones I have not enjoyed are the two Oregon Files ones.  There are so many characters I could not remember who was who without having to keep looking at the cast list at the front.  I reached the point of not caring anyway and just kept reading to get to the end.  The whole thing reads like a Mission Impossible TV episode but nowhere near as good or exciting.  The scenes in the UK were very sloppy; there are no such things as pound notes and the beefeaters actually guard the Tower of London not Buckingham Palace.  I can only hope that it is Craig Dirgo that is the problem and that when the next Oregon Files book comes out written by Jack DuBrul (who I am a great fan of in his own right) that things will improve 
 the person who sold this to me lied and therefore I am very unhappy with the item in question 
 Very overpriced for a movie that is available by anchorbay.................also isn't ilegal to sell cancelled dvd's i'm sure the studio will be upset........Hello Amazon......... 
 The book is OK, but nothing like its counterpart She comes first. That one is a much better book with lot's of techniques, this book is very philosophical about the whole relationship issue and connection between two people. Not very excited about it and certainly did not learn any new techniques 
 i was so disappointed in this book, it made me angry. It was the first time I ever wanted to rush out and buy a book and pay full price upon hearing reviews. People were gushing over this thing. While Messoud is a beautiful writer, I beg to differ. This was stinky chic-lit. I was insulted by the stereotypical characters and didn't really see any "twist" to them at all. I thought the use of the events of Sept 11 to be really blah. The characters don't seem to grow. they all just seem like whiny, pathetic, bougie snobs. I really expected more. Don't bother buying this book. Just drive by my house and pick it up out of the trash. 
 The Bourne Identity by this author was great but this is a contrived, monumental bore.  Intricate plotting is only worth following if the themes and characters are worthy of attention.  This book is some kind of desperately single-minded, looney-left hate fest.  OK, you can say Hoover was a monster, and say it again 10 times, maybe even 50 or 60 times, but that does not a book make.  The world presented here is sick, but the sickness is the author's monomania 
 This CD is so boring. Sarah McLachlan has written / performed songs before that have set people alight with her passion, her intensity, her hurt, etc... these are very TIRED renditions of all-too-familiar Christmas songs. Sure, I can stomach a Kenny Rogers Christmas, for some reason it just seems to make sense. But Sarah McLachlan putting out a Christmas album seems to be nothing more than a combination of not having new material of her own and needing some more bucks. Excuse my frankness, but this album is very disappointing 
 Car!  For Arnie that is.  Arnie is a gawky, awkward teenage male with few friends and few skills.  But he does come across a car named Christine, which he proceeds to fix up and clean.  This car in turn comes to own him as it itself is somehow inhabited by an evil demon that allows the car to come to life at will, and cause accidents, run over others, and even asphyxiate one unsuspecting intruder with exhaust gas in its cabin.  Together, Arnie and Christine form a bond based on loyalty and violence.  The car makes him cool and he uses it to get even with his enemies and those that would hurt his car; the car in turn protects him.  Over the course of the book, Arnie turns from an innocent and weak teenager to a violent-prone and temperamental adult.  But all good relationships come to an end; and the book ends with Christine being crushed into a cube at a garbage dump.    This book is one of the shorter books of Stephen King.  Written in the early 1980s, it is readable by high school kids, and is easy to get through in one day.  There is minimal gore, some violence, and enough drama to keep one interested.  All in all, nothing fancy and nothing extraordinary from the king of horror 
 If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck, walks like a duck, it's probably a duck.  If a quick leafing through Careers For Your Characters tells you it is primarily yet another formula book, bingo. 
 This film is a classic with a believable storyline.  If you like fast paced WWII movies..get this one 
 Sure, the author's  premature death was not related to 'normal aging', but what are we trying to do here?...I thought that the system was supposed to free us from whatever  maladies might come our way. By the time we're dividing up the 'normal'  and the 'unusual' , we really haven't increased our chances all that much, have we? Are we to define any death under 100 as 'not normal aging', if we're on the program?  The fact is that this is a program that begins to interest people in late-middle-age, which has two sides to its misleading nature:1/The rat experiment begins at birth. Middle age humans have aleady created quite history for themselves, which can't be accounted for in any scientific way. In such cases,  the results must be assumed to be lessened to a negligable amount, even among believers. 2/ A healthy 50 year old has a good chance of making it past 90 anyway. Are the restrictors promising so much more?....As far as the rats themselves are concerned; caged rats are compulsive eaters, so comparing,(as 'normal'), to restricted rats is not valid. All we really have for the experiment is ourselves. We are the rats. Are you ready to be little hungry for the rest of your life, look like heck, and be weak as lamb, (check the followers out, this is no exageration), when it's just an experiment 
 Despite the alluring subtitle boasting coverage from Hitler to Al-Qaeda, the bulk of the book (likely from the first edition - delineation of new material is not clear) is dedicated to cold war spying issues and the Soviet Union.  Many of the stories covered of that time are done so in great detail, sometimes overly monotonous.  As the book moves on, I was hoping to learn more about American intelligence efforts in other theaters, but the material is limited.  Hitler, South American and the Middle East pre-9/11 are all given little attention and scant new information is available, even for a moderate follower of the subject.  Further, as the coverage shifts more to the modern day and the post-9/11 world, the book takes on a sanctimonious tone on what, based on earlier writings on the subject, would still be considered limited information from the intelligence world.  Material that likely makes up the revised edition appears sounds more of Monday morning quarterbacking thrown together quickly to take advantage of the current public interest.  
 Given that this is the man who claimed to have predicted the fall of the Soviet Union years before it occurred, I had high hopes for this book. Unfortunately after having read this dirge, I'm suspicious that Todd would be incapable of predicting what day tomorrow is.   The book starts with a self promoting preface, wherein Todd tries to play up some vague Pro American sympathies he professes to have, which given the later content is somewhat reminiscent of Robert Mugabe's early eulogising of white farmers in Zimbabwe.  Todd's book has two main premises, one, that the US is a spent power, using it's military to intimidate other nations into providing it the capital and goods that it needs to continue it's parasitic existence. The other that Europe (A united superpower version of the EU, which doesn't actually exist), Russia and Japan should realise they are the masters of the earth, not the US. (He seems to periodically forget China exists).   To support this disturbed worldview, he proceeds to give bizarre, specious arguments using faulty logic. (The US is equally to blame for the Russian situation in Chechnya was one eyebrow raising example - although in this case, it was probably driven by his desire to portray Russia as a positive force compared to the wicked US).  His main arguments are basically vague attempts at portraying a world he would like to see (Europe, specifically France, as a global colossus, bolstered by the Economic and military might of Russia and Japan). He brushes over such things as the demographic meltdown of Germany, presenting it as a positive force since it means that Germany will eventually shrink to about the same size population as France, at which point the Franco - German axis will be a partnership of equals!   The peculiar self-deluding bigotry that permeates the French so called elite. is present in spades in this book, and unfortunately just comes across , as a wish list from a man who  hasn't realised that his countries imperial days ended in 1945.   A huge disappointment, I had hoped for an insightful analysis of the real problems that afflict the US, not a bigoted attack shrouded in pseudo intellect and drowned in meaningless statistics.    
 I have not read this edition of Dr. Kent's book, but as a former student of Dr. Kent's, I was forced to buy his text when I took his comparative anatomy course.  At the time, I found it a difficult read of marginal  usefulness.  When he left Louisiana State, a different, far better text was  introduced.  If this is merely an update of that volume, I echo others who  recommend other sources 
 Oh my goodness me where do I start? This book is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The writing level is comperable to that of a 7th grader. The story is very poorly told as well. The writer tries to make herself sound talented by using similies and metaphors at the most awful points in the story. The story could've been interesting if I was written nicely, and was more in depth of events. This book gets too much publicity than it's worth, and this is probobly only because of the subject matter. The book starts off with Lalu, poor Chinese immigrant who was sold multiple times in China, and was starving. Once she came to America she was fed plenty of food, but unfortunetly, she was a sex slave for an evil Chinese Saloon owner. This is where the story gets uninteresting and stupid. She's then sold off the Charlie, a good friend of the man who brought her to the town she resides in. Then it just tells us what happens to her life after all of this. Maybe I didn't like this book because of the subject (Immigrant books never really were my favorite), but the poor writing style sealed the deal for me. Your money is better spent on something else 
 This imported 'sword' is actually a long dagger, about the size of a WWII-era bayonet.  In the scabbard it is all of 15 inches.  The construction, fitment of parts, finish, and overall quality is poor.  Definitely a mass-produced, low quality item.  The blade is plain stainless steel and would not hold an edge.  It would properly be labeled a "Masonic-ish" sword as the symbolism on the handle, guard, and scabbard do not strictly conform to those of any branch of Masonry.  There are prominent red crosses and a few Knights Templar-ish symbols but no one that knows anything about Masonry would mistake this for a genunine implement.  The blade is sharply pointed so this is NOT something children should play with!  It looks okay hanging on the wall (in the scabbard) but that is about all it is good for.  The price is not a bargain, it is about right for a Chinese-made import of this size and quality.  As long as you don't expect more that what I have described, you might like this item 
 Anyone who believes that this book is an authentic portrayal of boxing has never stepped into a ring and has no sense of history or perspective. Mailer hero-worshipped Ali, and could never write anything objective about him. Mailer knew nothing about boxing, other than the sensation of hitting a woman in one of his drunken binges. Mailer went to Africa, and could not write the truth about Zaire or its bloodthirsty dictator. He either did not know or could not write that the stadium in which the fight was held, for example, was a killing field for criminals who were rounded up before the fight to make sure the event went smoothly for the press and the tourists 
 This book is pretty much standard for undergrad analytical chemistry but it is not a great text.  It provides a very basic introduction to analytical methods in a poorly organised fashion.  The information is presented in such a way that it calls for you to memorize rather than understand.  The mathematics presented confuse the reader more than they help.  I recommend you buy this used.  If you plan on pursuing analytical chemistry, this book will quickly be shoved aside to make way for much better books, each specific to a particular instrumental method 
 The Bloomsbury edition illustrated by Ralph Steadman is ABRIDGED. Do not purchase unless you are buying it for the drawings 
 I used this book during my first year of law school and found it utterly useless.  Aside from the terrible editing, the material is not all that well organized and the book is full of little "mini-cases" which present you with random little holdings of tort law.  Furthermore, I found the analysis on some of the more important cases to be deficient.  
 This book is just a clever rehash of his other books but just repackaged under "POWER AGING". Some of his books contain the title Gary Null Phd. and other books just say Gary Null- so this time it is "Phd"- the book jackets NEVER say from what University. Many of the supplements pluged in Null's book are sold by his company Gary Null Associates so it is hard not to look at this book as just another product placement. The idea that hundreds of  millions of people of diverse cultures should eat a specific way is ludicrous. Gary Null writes his book as if he has all the information, but scientists still do not have much of the answers regarding aging, yet Gary gives the impression he knows everything there need to know about health and mega- antioxidants may become pro-oxidants in the body. He sounds like the Jim Jones of health gurus. Gary Null knows that his diet is nearly impossible to follow for the normal average person working 8 to 6 pm 5 or 6 days a week and he creates products that fill the need. Instead of eating all those lbs. of organic vegetables and fruit each day just take his expensive concentrates and supplements and watch Gary Inc. get richer. CASE IN POINT: FOR OVER 30 YEARS GARY CLAIMED THAT CHOCOLATE WAS TOXIC AND AS BAD AS CONSUMING MEAT OR COFFEE-NOW HE SELLS A 'NUTRITIOUS" GARY NULL CHOCOLATE BAR!   
 This book is problematic on all levels.  The first of which is the cover....look how eratic the image(s) are on the cover.  Observe how the books titles, and authors name actually start on the back cover and work their way around the spine and to the front.  This is exceptionally bad design.  Today, I returned my copy of the book.  Also note that the author fails to detail which (if any) companies he has worked for....saying only that he has "worked in the America's"....what the hell does that mean?  If you buy this book wou will be returning it sooner or  later!  Youv'e been warned 
 before i began writing this review, i surfed the internet looking for reviews from other readers.  90% of the reviews i read began or ended similarly: i am a ____teen year old girl.  having only gotten through 150 pages of this book before calling it quits, i wasn't surprised to learn that so many young women gravitated towards this book. after all, the novel's protagonist is just such a teenage girl.  however, this fact is more than a little bit troubling because astrid is not someone you'd want your daughter/sister/niece/cousin/etc to identify with. it's also troubling because when so many people, both younger and older, hail 'white oleander' as some sort of literary masterpiece, even going so far as to compare it to nabakov's 'lolita.' this is a horrifying book, not necessarily for the story's content (which is equally horrifying), but for it's plot, execution, characterization, and particularly its ham-fisted writing.  to be sure, this is a book written for the oprah generation and reflects the 'oprah-fication' of literature. the novel's problems are so many, that i simply won't have time to address them all.  however, i will address some of them:   1) astrid.  the novel's protagonist, a fourteen year old girl, is a thoroughly contradictory character.  some people have written that astrid is not your 'average' teenage girl and that she is 'gifted.'  if she were such a girl, i would expect much more of her.  that's the least of the problems, however.  i'm not a psychologist nor have i ever been shot, but i suspect any fourteen year old girl who's mother was sent to prison for murder, offered herself sexually to a man three times her age, is shot by her first foster mother, performs oral sex on a boy in exchange for 1/2 bag of marijuana would be severly emotionally disturbed and troubled.  astrid, however, seems to care less that she herself was nearly murdered, instead she focuses on and longs her sexual encounters with ray. remember, this is a fourteen year old girl.  any credibility astrid has a narrator is blown early on because no one who's gone through her experiences would be in as good as shape as she is. it also discredits her as a character, and with a discredited character, the novel doesn't stand a chance. think about a fourteen year old girl you know. now imagine her beaten, shot, mother in prison for murder, sexually loose (some may argue ray took advantage of her, but remember, astrid was the one who approached ray and when he said no, astrid was the one who dropped her clothes), and yearning for a lover three times her age. it simply wouldn't happen.    2) unfortunately, the plot fitch drops astrid is pretty much by the numbers.  i have trouble with any novel where the plot is advanced by a series of tragedies or dire circumstances.  more often than not, it's a gimmick (or crutch) inexperienced writers rely on when realistic ideas for authentic plots run thin ('the kite runner' suffered similar fate).  read joan didion or toni morrison (or steinbeck) and how see how they use tragedy--it's real, honest, and most importanly believable.  most of the 'white oleander's' is simply too unrealistic.  3)  the prose is borderline comical.  i was awe-struck to read how many people have praised fitch's prose.  fitch's use of similie is so overdone and forced that it slows the narrative down to a cumbersome pace.  similes should be used judiciously and flow naturally. fitch, on the other hand, find it's necessary to inject as many as four or five similies in just about every paragraph, and most of them just ring false and forced.  the 'white' metaphor is also an unfortunate victim.  count the number of times fitch uses 'white' to describe astrid, ingrid, clothes, food, dishes, the sky, etc, etc, etc.  she beats the 'white' metaphor into holy submission and never really allows the reader to discover for him or herself underlying metaphors.  the majority of the book is over-described, and so many of the descriptions are flowery and self-indulgent, as if fitch is trying to prove to her readers that she's a capable and talented writer.  the sex scenes, in particular, are dreadful.  i don't want to read how a fourteen year old remembers every graphic detail of performing oral sex on a middle-aged man.  it's too much. way too much.  a 14 year old girl who's performed oral sex on a man is not going to long for it again. i can tell you that.  furthermore: at one point astrid sees a shiny convertible, compares it to a man,  and imagines herself climaxing while laying on its hood; during her encounter with ray, she describes the act as riding a horse through the surf.  and those are just the sex scenes.  also, fitch refers to one man's hair as 'balding.'  hair, of course, can't bald.  scalps can bald.  hair cannot bald.  these comparisons seem better fit for 3.99 romance novels at the supermarket checkout.  fitch also seems intent on stringing together a bunch of pretty words in hopes of making pretty sentences.  unfortunately, this does not work.  pretty words don't necessarily make pretty sentences the same way pretty notes don't necessarily make pretty songs.  fitch's prose works much the same way thomas kincaide's 'art' works -- it's looks pretty, but there's really no substance to it.  it's also much like 'legends of the fall' -- sure it looks great, but all you get when you strip the prettiness away, you end up with little more than a soap opera.  she would do well to focus more on advancing plot than affecting a poetic or lyrical voice.  4) the characters and uniformly cliched and poorly drawn.  astrid's mother is the self-absorbed, feminist poet.  her first foster mother is a bible-thumping floozy; her stepmother's boyfriend is the object of astrid's desires, even though he's more then three times her age; the second stepmother is demanding and her husband is quiet and reserved; and of course we have the 'hooker with a heart of gold' who takes astrid under her wing.   in fact, the professional prostitute is the only emotionally stable and 'nice' character in the entire 150 pages that i read.   what's fitch trying to say?  maybe something, maybe nothing.  but fitch's character's seem born straight out of some pseudo-intellectual writer's workshop.  any editor worth his or her salt should've have caught and corrected these flaws.  the fact that the editor(s) didn't, while i'd like to think it was out of sheer laziness, is  proof that american literature as a whole is in serious decline and that unrealistic plots and characters = big dollars.  and as i mentioned earlier, the fact that so many people hail this book as high literature signals trouble for the future of the american letters.  i know most people will probably vote this 'unhelpful' simply because i disagree on the book's merits.  that's fine. i, for one, strongly object to this novel on the whole.  i'm sure that as most of the teenage girls grow up and mature, they'll see 'white oleander' for what is is: an immature, adolescent novel masquerading as high literature. and i sincerely hope that no more young women identify with astrid in anyway.  that's the real tragedy 
 I first heard "Last of the True Believers" maybe 5 years after it was first released.  Since then I have been looking for something from Nanci as enjoyable as I found that album.  And I am still looking 
 I read this book on the advice of a friend who said it was an american literary masterpiece.  To my surprise I found the book boring and devoid of any value.  Miller spews out a self-absorbed diatribe intermingled with profane and tedious nonsense.    After a while I thought - why am I wasting precious time on this book?   There are other far better literary works.

 over half of this book consists of material already available in the "man" pages on a linux system.   the book boasts how it includes many many examples on how to use each command, this is utterly false. there are infact too few examples included.   100% of the material in this book can be found on the internet, on the linux system's info and man pages.   this book will not be friendly for the linux newbie. the title is misleading, "in a nutshell" usually means "the basics of a working system". this book is merely acts as reference for the abundance of reference freely available 
 Ideas have run out.  Paramount Pictures needed new writers with fresh ideas.  After six sequels can this be possible?  The answer is no, only if your an obsessed Friday the 13th fan.  This time round, Jason is unchained from his watery grave following his last duel with Tommy, accidentally released by a girl's telekinetic powers.  Tina, her mother and her psychiatrist have decided to stay at Camp Crystal for a psychology session.  Unbeknownst to Tina, her doctor is aware of her powers and intends to use them for his own gain. However, there are bigger fish to fry with the newly awakened Jason. It is up to Tina to put Jason back in his place once and for all.  This film saw the introduction of Kane Hodder, who, in fairness does a great Jason.  But the series has run its course at this stage with so many plotholes it doesn't bear thinking about. As well as this, the film is incredibly tedious and the jumps are few and far between.  Not a worthy sequel which would have been better off not made.  
 While I only am a little over half way through this book, I'm finding myself hating Will.  He's pathetic and boring and not at all a character that I can cheer for.  This book has been a tedious read overall.  I keep pushing through because I feel like it has to get better, yet so far it has not.  I'm happy that I checked this out from the library, so that I can return it and not have it collect dust on MY shelves.  The only reason why I'm even writing a review is that I'm so shocked about all the positive comments this book has received thus far.  I looked on Amazon to see if my thoughts were shared by others; I'm surprised that they are not.  I usually like this genre of fiction, but in terms of this book all it is is a bunch of whining and self-loathing 
 Stuart Blumin's look into the emergence of the American middle class is nothing more than his desire to see his own words on paper. Time after time, Blumin reiterates points that had been exhausted in previous chapters  of his book. The research Blumin did for this book was extensive, but  failed to capture the reader's attention. In fact, nothing in this book was  written for the reader. It is full of boring diatribes that leave one  feeling worse-off for reading. I had fully expected to be challenged and  informed by this book, considering the author. Unfortunately, I was left  with the understanding that Blumin just really likes to publish books. I  would rather shave my entire body with an old cheese grater and be dipped  in rubbing alcohol than have to suffer through this book again 
 This slim, poorly written, poorly illustrated, poorly referenced paste-up might have a few interesting tidbits, but it's so error-filled that it should not even be idly browsed. A few examples:  * "There is no official White House barber" (p 16). Don't tell Milton Pitts. * "Offices in the West Wing are usually ... windowless" (p 49). Huh? On Williams' own diagram, 3 executive offices are windowless and 16 have windows. * "The oval shape of [the Blue Room] inspired the shape of the Oval Office, when the West Wing was constructed in 1902" (p 21). In 1902 the president's new office was a rectangle. The oval-shaped ones were later additions. * He says Nixon filled in FDR's pool (p 49). Almost right: it's still there, just floored-over. * He calls the Eisenhower Executive Office Building by its former name, then says it's accessible by tunnel (p 45). It's not. There is a tunnel to the Treasury Building. * He gives a chatty but wrong history of presidential bowling lanes (p 113).  With so many patent errors and no references, the rest of his "info" has the ring of guesswork. (Williams has "written for the New York Times"? Written what!)  The book is lousy with fillers: A box on the colors in the U.S. flag. An entire page on HOW TO PUT YOUR HAND OVER YOUR HEART. Pages advising how to tell a joke, tie a tie, remember names. A list of some White House paintings - not photos of them, mind you, just a list.  The illustrations by Nancy Leonard are a computer graphic disaster. * She cannot be bothered to draw a round oval, but ends up with flat parts in the oval rooms, the south portico, the elliptical drives, and the Oval Office rug. Fireplace and furniture icons are grossly oversized and oddly angled. * Her colonnade pillars come in bunches between gaps. * Her graphic program apparently could not handle tricky angles in rooms, so these are represented by what look like potato chip outlines.  * She clearly relied on the Independent Counsel's West Wing map and uses that labeling (and mis-labeling). The famous press briefing room, therefore, is called "West Terrace Upper Level" without a hint of its actual function. * For decorative facing pages, she colors her floor diagrams to look like old-fashioned blueprints, but neglects to reverse the colors of the white and gray squares she used to make "holes" for doors in the wall lines, leaving a floor with weird, massive boxes all over it. * Other illustrations are worse than clip-art. The TelePrompTer diagram implies that the president stands on a glass screen.  Williams doesn't mention the East Wing, the third residential floor, or the sub-basements, apparently because these were not in the Zweifels' "White House in Miniature" book and so do not exist for him. For that matter, bills, vetoes, executive branch appointments, judicial nominations, treaties, and other stuff a president should know how to "do" aren't explained. (For example, can you veto a bill by phone? Don't ask Williams.)  A book like this could have been delightful. This one is vapid, ugly, and wrong 
 This book really sucked! Save your money!  The I have tried to contact Mr. Herman about some of the problems I have encountered with the contact addresses he provided.  He has yet to respond, meanwhile, I have wasted valuable postage for addresses that are incorrect or not in existance.  One other note, many of the persons contacted were not accepting new talent, and hadn't been for quite sometime 
 I heard an interview with Dr. Kushner on NPR today.  He explained how the comfort in the 23rd Psalm lies in the realization that, for example, God is not on the side of the terrorists, or the hurricanes; he is on our side.  Why define the world as divided so in the first place?  Terrorists are people too.  Nature is people too.  Until we accept the fact that God is in all of us, we will continue to place things in "good" and "evil" bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world.  Our comfort and relief from Psalm 23 will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we (WE, not God or some divine law of the universe) label as evil.  I rate the book 2 stars instead of 1 because it is clear the author means well and has a heart of gold, full of compassion.  Unfortunately his wonderful intentions are sorely misguided. 
 Ad hominem is a logical fallacy, you say?  That sounds like something a sexually deviant, financially-incompetent intellectual would say 
 This toy is not good at all! its hard for the reflecters to stay still and to connect. its hard to trace the picture because you can hardly see your hand! plus it the picture moves, thats it! you have to start all over again. its better if you just take a piece a paper and putting it over the picture and traceing it that way, trust me i ended up just doing that 
 look i really despise bush. he's an idiot. and i know people are gonna have different opinions on that. but what i wish wouldnt happen is people giving this 5 stars cause its against bush and they agree. seriously the music is really not good. however if you do buy it make sure you watch the DVD eh? its got a great will farrel skit on it. 2 stars for that and the few decent songs on here (ie no w by the ministry)  thats all 
 james were never a revolutionary band .ok brian eno produced this album.so what? he produced laid too which is a 5 star album...  they followed this with the equally dull Millionaires  avoid both,especially this  buy Laid and Seven instea 
 I found much of the humour in this movie to be downright silly and stupid.  In no way does this movie compare to others in the genre from the same period, such as "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" or "Sixteen Candles".  Just no comparison.  So I'm totally dumbfounded that many of the reviews here speak so highly of it.  If what I read is true, Cusack is very much justified in regretting participating in this movie.  It's a blemish on what has been a pretty good movie career so far 
 Murky:   In his book, 1984, Orwell described a contrived language he called "newspeak", designed to render politically incorrect ideas inexpressible. But before Orwell there were Russell and Whitehead, who contrived a symbolic logic that distorts ideas they deemed philosophically incorrect by combining logical quantification with expression of existence. As Whitehead wrote in his "Foreword" to Quine's Ph.D. dissertation titled A System of Logic: logic shapes metaphysical thought.   Thus in his "On Universals" Quine argued that in the Russellian logic realism must be expressed by quantifying over predicates so they reference universals as "entities". And he co-authored with Goodman "Steps toward a Constructive Nominalism", a nominalist manifesto, in which all philosophers are classified as either nominalists or "platonists" depending on whether or not predicates are quantified so they reference entities. I believe that anyone who says that universals are "referenced" or who uses the phrase "abstract entities" fully deserves to be labeled a Platonist.   But Loux uses the rhetoric from the Russellian nominalist newspeak. In the "search inside this book" screens at this Amazon web site the reader will find him reporting (p. 20) that realists say universals are shared "entities" and are "referents" of predicates.   I ask Loux: What happened to signification? The symbolic logician Alonzo Church recognized sense (i.e. signification) as well as denotation (i.e. reference) in the functional (i.e. predicate) calculus. I ask Loux: What happened to supposition, which distinguishes reference from signification? In his book titled Meaning and Necessity Rudolf Carnap explicitly affirms that intensions (i.e. significations) may be said to be objective without invoking any hypostatization (i.e. reference), and are indifferent to either concrete or abstract objects. I ask Loux: Since the demise of logical positivism does the Russellian predicate calculus have any applications in philosophy or anywhere else? Is Loux trying to appear contemporary with the Russellian rhetoric? I see murky writing.   Muddled:   Loux is sympathetic to Aristotle and unsympathetic to Quine, the pragmatic realist, who rejects first philosophies with their prejudicial ontological criteria for scientific criticism, and who affirms ontological relativity in which ontological commitment is subordinated to empirical testing.   Ontological relativity started as an analogy: Quine relativized ontology as Einstein relativized time. Einstein posited relativistic time as real time instead of Newton's absolute time, and he rejected Lorentz's making relativistic time apparent time. Likewise Heisenberg invoked this Einstein precedent for his own realistic Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory's positing of duality and indeterminacy. Today physicists describe reality in terms of superposition, nonlocality and Calabi-Yau spaces in eleven dimensions. Quine generalized beyond physics to our global web of beliefs.   Realism is a natural, primordial, irrepressible prejudice motivated by disappointments in our beliefs including falsifications of our scientific theories. On the other hand ontology is anything but natural or primordial. It is an elaborately complex linguistic artifact that evolves and that has a cultural history. It is reality as cognitively captured by the artifactual semantics of language expressing our accepted general beliefs including our tested and currently nonfalsified scientific theories.   But in Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic and in this book Loux rejects ontological relativity, and he calls philosophies using ontological relativity "anti-Realism". In fact ontological relativity and relativized semantics do not oppose realism, but rather they enable it in this age of scientific change. I do not find this book contemporary. Loux's "Realism - anti-Realism" locution is a false dichotomy. I see muddled thinking.   Marginalized:   While a student I found Notre Dame's philosophy faculty unsympathetic to contemporary pragmatism and its scientific realism. When I left their graduate school of philosophy I took with me the opinion that their academic culture is a marginalized backwater preferring to protect the past rather than forge the future with new thinking. I see in this book a textbook in Notre Dame metaphysics for Notre Dame philosophy students.   Readers who are cognizant of the influence of modern science on philosophy - notably how quantum theory occasioned the emergence and ascendancy of contemporary pragmatism - are likely to be more critical of this book than other reviewers at this Amazon site.

 More anti-hero "iconoclast" post modernism that has nothing much to say or nothing new to add. This is like diluted Henry Miller with less wit and style 
 Don't get me wrong, I love EEnE but I give this DVD one star! Why give us random episodes thrown together from different seasons? Why not release them to us by seasons?! These teasers just don't do the series justice! We need Season boxed sets!!!! 
 This is a brief and shallow book. It assumes that the reader, who is an options trader, has limited intelligence and will do stupid things. The best thing about the book is that it is short; therefore, you can quickly find that it has nothing to offer. .. 
 I am an experienced knitter. I own many knitting how to books. I have made knitted things I actually wear and enjoy.  This book is comprehensive alright, but I think it would absolutely snow under most beginners.   It is reminiscent of Military Specification Manual writing style with a chapter numbering system that sends you to figures 1.29, 2.301. And it shares a lot with old computer manuals in how generous it is in telling you all the things you can do in general definitions and not telling you how you do them in steps. If you already know how to do something, this is great.  I wanted to design a chevron stitch sweater. So I went to this book for various chevrons. The index gives you dozens of reference pages for chevron stitch, and page 124 is in boldface to indicate this is the main reference. This is what I read on page 124 in disbelief: Quote:  Two diagonal fabrics side by side moving in opposite directions. Figures 2.172 and 2.173 show row directions and shaping on a square. Work progress is at right angles to row direction--horizontal stripes emphasize the effect, while vertical lines will appear perpendicular to the rows. Experiment freely with overall shape, away from squares and rectangles. (pp 100,251) End Quote  Page 100 has a photo of a project where it is hard to tell what is a chevron stitch even if you know what it looks like. Page 251 is another photo of a knit top by the author illustrating a drop stitch boat neck top. I did not see any chevrons on that page, there is an inset of the model's huge wire wrap earring!  If you read the quote above, you might think you are reading a comprehensive English dictionary rather than a knitting how-to book. A definition of the chevron stitch and its parameters, and the direction of color changes in this stitch in a few words is very erudite. And LESS THAN USELESS to a knitter.  The approach to most decorative or different stitches is pretty similar to the chevron treatment. I know this is not a stitch dictionary, but its level of obtuseness to common stitches (like a chevron!) is amazing.  It is good for the many descriptions of casting on, holding needles, (shows even the Peruvian/Greek/Macedonian hold) working short rows, yarn overs, grafting and joins.  If you are an experienced knitter, you can learn some things from this book.  If you are a rank beginner, this is definitely not the book for you.   Total beginners should check out "I Can't Belive I'm Knitting" from Leisure Arts. That has just enough detail and nice drawings to get you started making a few things without scaring you 
 I don't really like books about older couples, and did not read all of this one because of that, even though I do like Kate Welsh as an author.  Here is the back cover review. For years, Evan Alton had avoided forming ties and concentrated on building his ranch. But now his twin baby grandchildren needed urgent care, and he'd do anything for them...even let Meg Taggert, the one woman who infuriated him as no one else could, stay on the ranch to help.  Lucky for Evan, Meg was there temporarily. Yet as they took care of the babies together, arguments changed to playful banter, and the harshness in their eyes gave way to understanding...and more.  Funny, suddenly matching wits with Meg was making Evan feel more alive than he ever had.  Could he be the one Meg was really sent to help 
 Nrretranders is not a scientist or researcher, but rather a science journalist.  That isn't necessarliy a bad thing in itself, but his book clearly suffers for his lack of scientific training, and the rigour it would have introduced.  User Illusion reads like a series of breezy, vastly oversimplified pop-sci articles.  His concepts - ranging from info theory to thermodynamics, are strung together with the loosest of connections.  For example, he compares the information intake of our senses with that processed by our consciousness in terms of bits.  But, he clearly has no formal definition of a bit in mind, using it to refer to anything from an actual binary bit, all the way up to an entire piece of music.  This makes it impossible to take his comparison seriously.  Consciousness itself is never even formally defined.  His treatment near the end of the earth's energy intake, and even dirty diapers, in terms of information theory is laughable.  The only useful take-away here is the reminder that there is a lot more going on inside our heads than we are consciously aware of.  A useful reminder, but that should not be news to anyone.  User Illusion also makes a good index of current (in 1991) 'sexy' science topics such as complexity 
 Farb's basic premise is that American Indians have ascended to the heights of culture (read: white culture) by 400 years of systematic genocide.  That's what the book boils down to.  Farb also makes numerous factual errors; e.g., he says the Mandan Indians are exitinct; umm, no, Mr. Farb, they're not 
 I would not buy this album because the bass fiddle is TOO LOUD and over-rides the pianist.  
 I can understand the hype for this album since Ray Charles' death.  But, being a true lover of the soul, feeling, interpretation, and just plain groove of Ray Charles, this album left me cold.  Especially the plain-jane back up singers (no one compares to the amazing Margie Hendricks), the pre-recorded big band doo-wop generic sound...it just has no feel to me.  I grew up with other versions by him with most of these songs, and these to me just sound like demos or half-baked sessions with the producer telling Ray to "not over-do it".  If you are familiar with ANY live recordings of Ray around this period you know EXACTLY what I am talking about.  It is undeniable.  The 1963 "Live in Brazil" DVD showcases a couple of these songs...and they will bring you to tears!!!  "You Don't Know Me" on that DVD is perhaps the most beautiful tear-jerking rendition EVER RECORDED.  The version on this album, with the generic backing, the holding-back vocals, have NOTHING compared to this live version from 1963.  It hardly sounds like Ray.  I know I'm in the minority, but just praising this album because he's gone is ludicrous.  Also, the version of "You Are My Sunshine" from that same underappreciated DVD (the rehearsal concert) is unbelievable, mainly due to Margie Hendricks insane and heart-felt Janis Joplin-like vocals.  THIS is how music should be done.  Live, playing off another, feeling, grooving with the song.  This studio LP, however, falls WAY short.  When I first bought it, I was amazed it was done purposedly by Ray.  I know it was done on purpose to throw a left curve, but Ray should have recorded it with his band, his singers, live in the studio, without holding back.  If you take Ray off the recording, it sounds like generic early 60's pop-teen fluff.  And that's NOT good 
 It seems i must  agree a hundred percent , if not more, with our good friend mrashdan_mradzi who has written his long review on this book. The simple fact that at least one of the incidents in the book is false clearly shows that this book is a danger to a new believer or anyone even curious about the Islamic Religion 
 I read this book in my 9th grade english class, The book was not appealing to me at all, There is alot of bad language, and it was wrote from a girls point of veiw. The book was about an overweight girl and a homosexual boy that become freinds and get picked on. Brendan the homosexual, messes up a bullys truck, and is put in a group of people, including the fat girl and the bully, to talk about what they did to be put in the class instead of expelled 
 I have been meaning to write Dr. Wilson a fan letter because I have enjoyed his work immensely.  However, I am deeply offended that he and his publisher would pass off an excerpt from ALL THE RAGE as a "new" Repairman Jack short story.  I wonder what Jack would do if he encountered an author exploiting devoted fans.  Maybe it wasn't F. Paul behind this....maybe it was RASALOM.  I regret purchasing this book and would like my money back.  I think Dr. Wilson owes his readers and explanation and or an apology.  
 Too bad there isn't a 0 star rating. This was simply awful.  I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years - waded though a lot of her semi-readable stuff - waiting for another decent installment.  But I give up.  No more Kaye Scarpetta for me.  This book cured me - for good 
 Entertaining and fast read marred by naive Noam Chomsky economics.  Assuming you can get over the author's silly dedication to "those, globally, whose lives have been wrecked or snuffed out by the Great Neoliberal Dream and Slash-and-Burn Globalization", the book makes for a quick "slash and burn" read.  'Mad Max meets Michael Moore' is an appropriate  description for this book.  There is much that is implausible about this book: coporate car death duels between bankers to win financial contracts, a utopian socialist Scandinavia in the latter half of the 21st century (that model is collapsing as we speak), segregation of 90%+ of the population in corporate controlled "zones", a fellow with the initials "DC" who runs a dominant oil company that yes, has the same acronym as Halliburton.  You get the drift.     Whenever the author described the weather I was expecting to read about record temperatures being set due to capitalism induced global warming. Fortunately, the author didn't go this far.  In summary, it's an entertaining cyber punk dive into the anti-globalist mind, a jaunt through an "inevitable" nightmarish corporatist world where humanity's best hope lies in socialist Sweden and where humanity's engine of corporate death resides in the US and UK.  Ho hum.  
 I picked up this book to learn newer & better SOA/Web Services architectures from the perspective of someone well-known and experienced. However the book turned out to be very disappointing for what I was looking for. In my opinion, if the target audience of such books included PM, Architects and such, then authors should avoid giving the "history" of every single thing. Here author wastes 50% of the book in doing that. Sorry, but we all know XML, SOAP, HTTP, PKI.. and so on.  Secondly, as some other reviewers have pointed out, very simple and established architectural patterns have been elaborated in a very verbose manner - almost to the extent that they may sound complicated to some.  The book however does a good job presenting the gamut of issues, generic techniques and specs. For that purpose - its a good book for people who dont have any relavant background. In simple words - if you dont really know what a "service" or "composite application" is, then buy the book.  Honestly - I didnt gain much from this book. I believe that I'd be okay with keeping track of all the specs and examples out there on the web and should save my $50 and many hours of essay-reading by not buying such books 
 Can you say "sanctimonious hot air", boys and girls?  This author should know better. I only got through the first few pages of this while I was bookstore-browsing one day before I tossed it aside with a roll of my eyes.  Kitwana completely misses the point.  The "loss of a mainstream cultural identity among whites" doesn't turn these kids onto hip-hop.  Nor do today's underclass whites' socioeconomic status (identifying with being a minority) and being raised in more racially-integrated neighborhoods solely make them idolize and mimic rappers.    The reason Eminem is the biggest selling rap artist today among white youth is the same reason Elvis and the Beatles were huge in the 50s: APPROPRIATION, black American creativity in the Arts and Music arena is a CASH COW.  We live in a Capitalist society, we worship the Almighty $$$, and any time there's money to be made off of the popularity of some new thing, it is pimped out for all it's worth.  Everything is for sale here and inviting any other theory for this "whites loving what blacks do" argument is akin to spinning your wheels in a ditch. One major support for my opinion is this: blacks had to do much assimilating into the white Anglo-Saxon culture of the U.S. in order to achieve success, wealth, and equal representation of their civil rights under protection of the law.  "Survival of the Fittest" in a social context is common sense - adapt/adopt the ways and habits of the ruling class to raise yourself and your family up, and you will be tolerated (but still not truly welcomed, trusted or appreciated).   Black culture, marketed and sold as an image, a lifestyle, to other races is a big moneymaker because interracial love and whites with blacks is still taboo to many (and I daresay MOST) people. All sorts of bizarre, racist lies and jokes are still popular (just not PC) and feed the psychological flames of fear of the unknown. The psychology of racism works both ways - as a tool for fear, hatred and ignorance (the three-headed dragon that never dies) and as an emotional vessel for the expression of exotic sensuality, sexuality and rebellion.  I call it the rape of the African queen, but that may be too harsh for some.  From the antebellum period of the 1600s when slavery was constitutionally protected, up until the Civil Rights Movement, whites have always admired, patronized, supported and profited from black art forms, not just Music (Jazz, Bebop, Rock and Roll and the Blues before Rap, all of which have deep roots in Afro-Caribbean culture) but our achievements in the Sciences, in Engineering, Sports, Medicine, Education, Dance, Theatre, and so on.  Even when black American athletes were treated worse than dogs in the street at home, they were sent to Greece in the 40s to participate in the Olympics, because EXCELLENCE cannot be ignored.  It is costly to hold talented black people back, and when they excel, they are considered ASSETS (instead of second-class citizens or property).  But it's still all about money.   Americans must have the most short-term memory of any other creature on the planet when it comes to race.  Either that, or they just like living in a dream world.  Books like this one try to convince the reader that there's something going on other than white folks turning a buck off of hard black labor (akin to the slave days).  The fact that now, in today's society, more blacks have education and affluence, have more equality under the law, and can make nearly as much money as "The Man" (lol) doesn't change the reality that CAPITALISM makes it all possible.  It's a conceit there's anything else going on BUT the mass exploitation of race.  There's always been a strong, historical undercurrent of attraction/revulsion of whites toward blacks, this dangerous sexual paradox, and it continues to this very day.  This book should be four pages long, at the most, with a picture of Al Jolson in blackface on a $100 dollar bill. Or, better yet, Eminem, since our TiVo, Xbox, Internet and Ipod generation of profligate youth don't study their own history (unless it's about war or Christianity) and wouldn't know who Jolson is.    Even though I don't mean to equate ALL Rap music as Minstrelsy, to a disturbingly large degree, the most anti-social, anti-law, violent and "proudly thuggish" Gangsta Rap is an update on the stereotypical Black Menial, all brute strength and raw sexuality, but no brains.  Gangsta Rap is self-destructive, but it is based on something all men love - the extravagant power of the Mafia.  A dark-skinned millionaire with gold teeth, dressed in a suit and tie (or track-star party clothes !!!), spending all his money on jewelry, cars and mansions, carrying a Glock - this is the updated Black Buck of the 21st century. Like Shaft, dangerous and cool. And we can all appreciate a scary "urban" legend.  Besides, Christian values are full of duality - white/black, good/evil, rich/poor, and this is one way for whites to celebrate that walk on the wild side.  To play with fire but not get burned. So out of a compulsive Liberal-guilt-for-white-privilege complex (which is self-pitying behavior) or a delusion that the differences between whites and blacks no longer matter (which is insulting), many young whites co-opt black styles until they grow tired of it, subvert it, or find a way to exploit it themselves.  I'm just letting you know how this works through a CAPITALIST perspective.  It's just business as usual.  And I guess after my explanation, it still must be said that to most black people, Jewish people are white people, too.  We don't differentiate.   The use of the terms "wangsta" and "wigger" are laughable and obnoxious at best, not damaging to any white person's psyche, because they're still white, no matter what music scene they're into. There are sociocultural reasons.  Many whites grow up in mostly black neighborhoods, and like any other group in that environment, many of them learn to take on the appearance and mannerisms of the prevailing ethnic group.  They "talk in ebonics" and throw up gang signs to be ironic... is this odd behavior funny to the rest of us not raised in these environments?  Sure, you bet.  We love to poke fun at people who don't quite fit.  Human nature, I guess.  But this book doesn't even begin to articulate or provide any measures to eradicate the problem of racism or classism.  Classism combined with racism is worse these days.  Rich white kids especially think it's cool that they can somehow "be down" and "get gangsta" with disenfranchised black kids, which is really downplaying the seriousness of the social disparity among blacks and whites, as if the world's just a great big ferris wheel of stupid fun.  Some would say maybe it is and I need a sense of humor.  But tell you what.  Instead of reading this book, read a book by Dr. Cornell West or Tony Brown instead.  Even "Soul On Ice" by Eldridge Cleaver.  Then you'll begin to understand why whites love rap music so much. And why most blacks still mistake flattery for fellowship.  
 i'll be the first to admit that i'm biased based on my expectations from shaara's father's great book, the killer angels.  it is not fair to compare the two, but because reading the father's book lead me to buy this one, i thought i should mention it.  this book does not contain nearly the details and intimancies of the father's book.  it is not surprising since this one covers a much longer time frame than the battle of gettysburg, so shaara has less pages to devote to each person and battle.  but the result is a less satisfying book.  it skims rather than digs deep 
 This book is little more than recycled propaganda from about 1915.But it is viciously anti-German and that is enough to make it a "classic".Truly one of the great hate books of all time.Germanophobia sells,always has and probably always will.Something for you aspiring historians to keep in mind.  If you want to know how WWI really started,read Harry Elmer Barnes or Sidney Fay 
 This is the first Grafton book I've read, but I'm pretty sure it will be my last.  Simply put, this is the worst book I've read in the past year.  The plot is ridiculous: it centers around the murder of woman who is prostitute/porn star/water treatment plant worker.  The characters only exist as canned responses to the investigator's questions.  Critical clue are revealed in predictable fashion to achieve an utterly anti-climactic ending devoid of any epiphanies or suspense.  
 This book may have been useful back when the sock pocket was a big celebrity.  In today's marketplace, this book just doesn't add any significant value.  I have respect for the authors since I have heard them speak in San Francisco.  It's too bad the hype doesn't live up to my expectations.  The Internet Economy of the late 90s deserves better 
 Star Parker opens the door to subjects we, Americans of African descent, need to critically consider. Why are we still debating issues that the Liberals have promised they would fix - for years. Why are out-of-wedlock births epidemic in the communities of color? When did being conservative mean you had to abandon intellectual honesty for liberalism? Why do we have these media appointed "black leaders" that have no connection to our daily lives? Why does the title "Reverend" have the power to cloud the minds of black folk and bestow upon them omnipresent knowledge?   I have needed to read this book for a long, long time. For all us, Americans of African descent, take heart someone speaks the truth if you would just consider 
 it is no problem to admit that i heartily envy ms kushner writing skill: she is a wondrous writer, she handles her language with a subtlety unheard of and still she manages to avoid any overwriting, any mannerism.  the story itself, though, is not great: some reviewers say it is true to the legend: should it be really so, then the problem might lie in the original plot.  be it as it may, characterization is dull, except for the elderly couple, and elfland is lushiously boring, the queen being the worst of all.  the verses included are enjoyable 
 try enya , or sarah brightman, yes they may be overated, but they are also THE BEST PERIOD..i hate to say it but emiliana needs to go back to iceland...try celine dion, dolores from the cranberries,italian singer laura paussini, eroz rammazotti, now thats creme!!!!!!!!! not  EMILIANA TORRINI from iceland!!! in my opinion, she doesnt hit a single note, humm thats so sad..whats up with tuna fish????  the only way i like my tuna is in a sandwich...not in a song.....lo 
 I bought Regency Etiquette expecting a reference book which would explain in detail forms of address, rules of precedence,  how to make a formal introduction, whether a gentleman precedes or follows a lady up or down a staircase, and other specifics of correct behavior for the period. Had it contained this information, I would have considered it well worth the purchase price because I would have referred to it many times.   It is instead an interesting if repetitive specimen of the conduct book for young ladies, covering behavior in a very general way - you should dress to suit your body type and station, dress and carry yourself modestly, not allow gentlemen friends to take liberties, etc. The only specifics covered are the rules of precedence, and even these are given only for precedence among women, e.g., daughters of dukes, daughters of marquisses, viscountesses, etc. There are also some strange cosmetic recipes included at the end of the book, many of them so bizarre it was hard to imagine that any women of any era would be willing to put such concoctions on their skin or hair.  As another reviewer said, having read this book once I felt no need to read it again, and for this reason I regret spending $18 to buy it. However, if you are looking for an example of a general female conduct book of the period, you may consider the money well spent 
 I too was duped into believing I was buying a new Stone Barrington novel only to find that it was 2 old novels that I have already read.  Lesson learned...always read the Amazon customer reviews first 
 Before I start, let me nail my colours to the mast: I'm pro-science, I'm pro-evolution, I really like the idea of rational enquiry and I'm a sceptic bordering on the cynical. I'm *not* some lentil-munching, kaftan-wearing, feng-shui-hugging hippie with airbrushed unicorns and a yin-yang sign on the side of my Kombi. Honestly.  Now we've got that cleared up, let me say it straight: This book takes on some big arguments, but, other than humorously swatting some flies, loses hands down. All it succeeds in doing is illustrating that there are fakers, losers, charlatans and wankers to be found in the Social Sciences departments of any given University. Anyone who's been to university and didn't know that deserves a clip around the ear and to be sent to the back of the class. Now either Sokal didn't know that ( - ~clip~ -), or he's spent half his book shooting fish in a barrel. That might seem like good sport, but before long it becomes obvious it's a cheap thrill.  Having said that, I sincerely doubt that the titillation of seeing dumb French Feminists taken apart is what made this book such a splash: I think it's because of Sokal's purported intent: to undermine the notion of cognitive relativism, especially as it associated with modern philosophy of science, in particular the work of Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend. This is the battle: Sokal aligns with those who say scientists are the exclusive purveyors of a shining light called truth; the Barbarians at the gate are these simpering postmodernists who want to tear the temple down.  While the poseurs cited in this book are certainly (for the most part) phoneys or idiots, I think Thomas Kuhn was neither, and while Paul Feyerabend overplayed the court jester hand, he had some important things to say too.  So, to the first point: Proving that one writer (or a hundred, or a thousand) who purports to adhere to relativism is a charlatan doesn't establish anything about *the idea* of relativism. All you have established is that you have a found yourself a charlatan. Give yourself a star.   But while you're pinning it on, remember that postmodernists do not have a monopoly on illogical, bamboozling, balderdash:  Example: Sir Roger Penrose (Emeritus Rouse Ball professor of mathematics at Oxford University, no less) and his dreadful, lumpen-headed, and deliberately bamboozling anti-AI tract "The Emperor's New Mind". The very point of the (no doubt correct but nonetheless entirely irrelevant) science deluged on the reader in that book is to obscure the fact that the real emperor was Roger Penrose and his arguments on AI really blow the kumara.   Example: Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker's Linguistic Nativism, which has held sway for a good thirty years in many linguistics departments, and is anything but post-modern: nativism holds that humans have an innate understanding of grammar hard wired into their biology. From my paltry readings in linguistics and the philosophy of language, my impression is that Pinker's and Chomsky's arguments are seriously flawed. (See: Sampson: "The Language Instinct Debate" for a thorough linguistic critique of nativism; see Rorty: "Contingency Irony, and Solidarity" for a philosophical perspective on the contingency of language). Make note of this example, as it becomes relevant later on.  Secondly, Sokal and Bricmont (quite deliberately) refuse to engage on certain topics, in particular on cultural or aesthetic relativism, which they say (without providing a reason) "raise very different issues". Take that star away, for this statement betrays a fundamental misunderstanding about relativism. Actually, ethical, aesthetic and cognitive relativisms raise different manifestations of *exactly* the same issue: Cognitive relativism, in that it relates to "epistemic" truth (as opposed to "moral" truth or "aesthetic" truth - both of which seem intuitively more questionable ideas) is simply a cut closer to the quick: indeed, the aesthetic and moral brands of relativism rely for their plausibility on cognitive relativism anyway (i.e. if the truths we understand about the physical universe are contingent on our language, then it follows that ideals of right and wrong and beauty must be similarly contingent on our language).  Thirdly, Sokal provides the following account of cognitive relativism:   "While scientists ... try to obtain an objective view ... of the world, relativist thinkers tell them that they are wasting their time and that such an enterprise is, in principle, an illusion"  Now that, to put it mildly, is a *very* punchy version of relativism, and not one that any credible relativist philosopher I know of (and certainly not Thomas Kuhn, who spent a whole book explaining how and why the process scientific discovery works) subscribes to.  That is, in the trade, known as a straw-man argument: You set it up to knock it over. Here goes:   P1: Relativists say science is a waste of time P2: Science helps us reliably predict and react coherently to phenomena occurring in the world  P3: Things which help to predict and react to such phenomena have genuine utility  C1: Therefore, science has genuine utility C2: Ergo, science is not a waste of time  Case closed. Is relativism dead? No: the problem is, most relativists I know would completely agree with all of the above argument except for premise 1. The cat is most definitely still out of the bag. (In a nutshell, all reasonably stated relativism says is that you can't know that your theory actually maps onto the actual configuration of the outside world; it may, it may not: logically there will always be some other possible explanation for the same set of data, however implausible or difficult to imagine, and in part that difficulty in imagination may be a function of the historical contingency of our belief in, and description of the world in terms of, the current "paradigm". Relativism simply says the best you can do is to know that, for now, your theory works, not that it is *true*. Though Sokal and Bricmont may disagree, I don't think this is controversial amongst philosophers nor, really, scientists.)  Lastly, in criticising an admittedly utterly ludicrous passage bestowed on the world by that splendidly silly feminist philosopher Sylvia Kristeva, Sokal makes the following footnote:  "...Kristeva seems to be appealing ... to the 'Sapir-Whorf thesis' in linguistics that is ...that our language radically conditions our view of the world. This thesis nowadays is sharply criticised by some linguists: see, for example Pinker ..."  Hold the phone. The implication is that the Sapir-Whorf thesis (as to the contingency of language) has been discredited, but by none other than Steven Pinker in his "The Language Instinct" which, as per the above, is at the very least a controversial piece of writing. This is an extremely important point, since it's utterly central to the credibility of the anti-relativist cause, and if one takes Geoffrey Sampson's book (cited above) at face value the nativist claims themselves are built on very suspect reasoning and scientific research. It seems to me (and to writers like Richard Rorty) that language must radically condition our view of the world, because that's the only basis on which we can even describe it.  At the end of the day, properly stated cognitive relativism is no a threat to modern scientific discourse, except that it relegates the scientist from "truth knower" or "person through whom you may have exclusive access to the truth" (sounds a bit like a grand high pooh-bah or - dare I say it - high priest, doesn't it?) to "person whose theory works the best for now" and who may be in competition for that status with other people in the community whether or not they're scientists.   If science *does* work better than feng shui or healing crystals (and I, for one, think it does) then this shouldn't be a particularly troubling way of looking at the world for a scientist who is at ease with his views and his value to the community. So it makes the knee-jerk reactions against relativism, from the likes of Sokal and elsewhere Richard Dawkins, all the more mystifying.  Olly Buxto 
 Kevin Trudeau leads his readers into believing they will get the solutions they are looking for but when the time for presenting them comes, he sends his readers to his website where they have to pay an outrageous membership fee. He condemns those who are out to make money at our expense then turns around does the same thing.  I give it two stars because there is some knowledge to be gained but no solution unless you are willing to pay.  A big disappointment 
 Although this may be a good marketing book for writers, I found the lack of professional typesetting bothersome: using lines of hyphens between entries, instead of subject headers or bullets; using bold AND italics for book titles are just a few problems. But the biggest error is that there is no index in the back of the book. A book such as this begs for a lengthy index of author's names, subject headers, book titles, etc. I found it frustrating trying to navigate through this hodge podge of advice. 
 i gave it 2 stars as i felt that overall i would not recommend this book 
 Muybridge's "The Human Figure in Motion" is a classic.  The frame by frame photographs of figures (male, female, athletes, children) are vintage photos from the latter half of the 19th century. They document action: carrying objects, a man jumping, child crawling, etc, as well as activities common to the time that are not evident in everyday activity now, such as discus throwing, fencing, woman pouring water from a jug, etc.  These photos, although small, are still of major importance to the artist who tries to understand muscle groups for drawing the figure.  Great resource book 
 I wish I had read the other reviews before I purchase this DVD.  It is obvious that a profession choreographer was not involved in the making of this product at all.  You are shown too many moves at once and they are shown to you very quickly.  Even the "break down" section of the DVD is impossible to follow.  VERY Disappointing 
 If a collection of essays can be judged by a single essay within the collection, then this book must be awful.  I only read one of the essays, but it was enough to make me put the book down forever 
 The Call is set to Carnival music and is simply irritating.  The scenes are disturbing (for example a fly eating someone's head).  It is also dull.  I was neither entertained nor inspired by this.  I wouldn't watch the video again if someone paid me to view it.  It is a shame to get a video and immediately throw it away 
    The quest for the limits of deduction is a well-precedented and exciting topic, and is worth of deep study.  If this is your opinion, then this book is worth glancing at.  Certainly Chaitin's unique approach to tackling the notion of incompleteness cuts to the core of the matter, and is free from the beautiful self-referential chains that bind the reader from a clear understanding of Godel's first and second incompleteness theorems.      Even so, Chaitin's opinions of science, his iconic worship of Leibniz (and consequent condemnation of Newton), his accusative implication that Godel's contributions to deductive logic are overblown and confusing, make this book difficult to read.  On the one hand, Chaitin appears to be a haughty mathematician reaching to mask his low self esteem.  He constantly references his 'teenage' work, and the technical reading that he was able to accomplish at the age of 12.  These comments are ostentatiously interweaved into a forest of exclamation points, and the thesis that he alone understood and extrapollated on Leibniz's understanding of algorithmic complexity.  I believe that this book is very much about an author desperately trying to establish his legacy as a great mathematician, and not just a simple read about the limits of knowledge.  If you can stomach pages of writing from a self-aggrandizing braggart (establishing himself as Leibniz's natural successor in the understanding of information), and have a deep need to understand the notion of incompleteness in a new and innovative light, then I recommend this book only to you. 
 This is the worst product I have ever bought. In fact, I had bought 3 of this disaster and had to throw all away as useless. Its one function in life is to hold coffee, and it can't do that because the lid falls off if there is even slight wind. If you want to buy this product, just flush money down the drain 
 I have read a lot of books on value investing.  This book is really thinly recycled gruel.   It presents the value basics, but in a way that would not be terribly useful to a person who has never heard of value investing.  For example, one technique he recommends is to calculate the price people might pay to buy a company in a leveraged buyout (LBO), and then buy at a discount to that.   Now, if you are person who can accurately make that calculation--no easy thing for the man on the street--do you need a book that tells you that market timing is bad and you should buy stocks when they are 'on sale' and 'here is what a P/E ratio is'?  On the other hand, in a way the book is not detailed enough.  Browne has for years put out a little booklet called "What Has Worked in Investing" or something like that ... and it's quite nice.  You can get it for free on his company's website.   It is full of all the evidence that value investing works--lots of numbers, lots of tables.   Well, he has a chapter in the book called "Don't Take My Word for It", where he recycles that pamphlet--only taking out all the numbers and tables.   So we're left with a lot of text that rattles on with "blah blah blah" where a simple little half page table would have told the story in a way anyone could understand (again, see his free booklet which is well laid out and easy to read).  Get the free booklet on his company's website but if you want to learn about how to become a value investor, this book will not carry you far.  And if you already are an old time value investor, it's a yawn 
 Alas, I've joined the group of dispointed consumers! I love Alton Brown, but this so called "book" is less (WAY less) than steller. I actually saw this at Chapters for $1.99 and couldn't bring myself to part with the Twoonie required to purchase it. All the previous reviews sun up my feelings - but I just had to add my two cents 
 the supplier sent me a second rate product. I expected a beautiful clean cut hardcover book to keep for ever... but instead i got a book that bad oddly cut pages. I am very annoyed and hope that the supplier sends books that are of good quality. the books is defineatly going to be a superd read.. but i wish that the seller sells quality produts. i am pissed 
 National Geographic Magazine is famous for their excellent photography; it is the very reason I picked up this volume. However, Wide Angle: National Geographic Greatest Places failed to live up to my expectations. I was underwhelmed not only by a large portion of the images, but mostly by the poorly executed concept. In a title that clearly implies these are the greatest places featured, I felt the chosen photographs illustrated some lackluster locales. Furthermore, the organization was too loose. The book could have benefited from better formating not only of its categories, but of the photos themselves, which are often stretched in an unflattering matter.  
 ...From what i have seen it looks very very roughly based on the book. The book is very good (even though I am to old to read it :P ) and from what i have seen of the film it looks awful compared to the original story. The actress they chose for Ella was a bad choice. Anne is a good actress but here she is playing more a "princess Diaries" girl, which is a clumsy, sometimes cringeworthy and not a very strong character and not Ella who although is obedient has courage and is a strong character. If they were going to make a film on the book they should have stuck to the story much more. What is up with the freezing in mid-air, evil uncle and Ella going out to stop the segregation?!?! This film is a bit too much like Shrek whereas when reading the book, the funny green ogre did not cross my mind. I wish someone would attempt at making a better version as it is an amazing book and shouldn't have its name ruined by the film. However, enough about the film (stupid as it is) and lets focus on the soundtrack. One word - Brill! Songs are good and Anne Hatheway does have a good voice (not too high tho please!) Shame some people won't ever get round to the soundtrack due to the film... Feel free to contradict or argue xD I shall be waiting... : 
 I keep running into Booksellers, Book Collectors saying "But McBride's Books Say". Please take all and any information with a grain of salt, when some of the information are just what others are saying. There are mistakes with all EXPERTS, remember the Earth is round not flat. Do research of your own, most(99.5%) of the correct information is available for free, the rest is theory. Keep that in mind 
 This is one of the most tediously judgmental biographies I've read in a long, long time. D. J. Taylor spends most of his time correcting or chiding or simply doubting Orwell. He sifts through "Such, Such Were the Joys" determined to prove that Orwell exaggerated how unhappy he was in school. He defends the families that Orwell characterized in ROAD TO WIGAN PIER as if this were a legal brief and not some of the most vivid prose in English literature. He discusses the great essay "Shooting an Elephant" solely in terms of whether it's literally true or not. And so on. Asking a few questions of the material is one thing, but Taylor grinds on and on and on.   He is so determined not to let Orwell get away with anything that this book never achieves any dramatic or narrative momentum. The only bits of life are the short snapshot chapters that describe Orwell's voice, say, or his face. And Taylor flubs long stretches of the story. His pages on the background to the Spanish Civil War and the factional fighting in Barcelona are total gibberish. I had to pull out a couple of other books to find out what exactly was going on. It was at this point I decided to stop reading.  For all their faults, the Bernard Crick, Stansky/Abraham, and even the Michael Shelden are better, more readable biographes. 
 One of the worst movies i've ever seen, no real plot and acting is as bad as it can get. Not even Samuel Jackson's appearance saves this sorry excuse for a movie. Horrible. Awful 
 If the church is our example of marriage Christ LOVED us first. He did not need to be respected first. I agree with the main idea of the book, however the author puts more pressure on women than on men. Men, lead the way in love as Christ did, even when he received no respect but crucifixion 
 I have two Great Danes who love chew-treat toys. Especially KONG. I brought the Everlasting Treat Balls Home and they both were able to pop out the treat within 2 minutes! They enjoyed the treats- but the expensive plastic ball is useless. I will be returning this product tomorrow 
 The first Farseer book impressed me with its great writing and interesting characters. The second book, though not as great, was still a solid sequel. This third Farseer book is a mess (see Kaymin's comments). The 757 page book (paperback version) should have been edited to fewer than 500 pages. A few of the ill-considered, disjointed plot lines also should have encountered the delete key.   What could not be repaired are some of the idiotic key elements such as the fact that no one remembered that the ancient race who helped the citizens of Buck were actually dragons that exist as stone statues until imbued with the memories, souls, and lives of multiple humans. What the heck? And somehow, the protagonist, FitzChivalry, continues to make the same stupid mistakes he did as a teenager and still manages to survive. Of the main characters, only his wit-bonded wolf made reliably sensible decisions.  Given the flaws described above, I am astonished by the many five star reviews of this book. I believe that fans of the first two books were overly generous to this one 
 The premise of this book is interesting; for some unknown reason a few immortals are born here and there around the planet. This is not so much a novel as a disjointed collection of vignettes and short stories that cover the centuries since ancient Phoenicia to a bizarre future where everyone is immortal. If you are expecting the derring-do and character development of the television series Highlander, skip this book. It drags unmercifully in parts, and is overall unsatisfying and (dare I say it?) boring 
 I read this book long, long ago and I will NEVER forget how bad it was.  It was so bad I had to change the title of my "ishhh list" to my "Gingersnaps list" cause thats what this book is full of.  Too bad I can't give it negative stars 
 This book is a waste of time. It's boring. I would expect a little boring given the subject matter, but it's a real snoozer. The information is simplistic and the presentation insulting to anyone of average intelligence. Don't waste your money, don't waste your time 
 Not enough basic recipes and not enough information.  I returned this title, it just didn't appeal to me.  If you want some more intricate recipes and some great basic convection oven info - try "The Best Convection Oven Cookbook".  Personally, I'd like to see some one write a book with roasting times, chocolate chip cookie recipes and more of the basics 
 Lead singer, and founding member of The Lilac Time, Stephen Duffy's greatest claim to near fame may be that he bailed out of the 1980's synth-pop group Duran Duran just before the Durans became mega-stars via MTV. Doggedly pursuing a solo career that yielded a few minor hits in England and Europe, Duffy, by the late `80's, had formed a pop folk quartet called the Lilac Time and they made one brilliant record. And Love for All is not that brilliant record, although there is much to recommend here if you like XTC-style pastoral and dreamy pop music. The production is top notch with XTC's Andy Partridge lending a hand on seven of the twelve songs. Partridges' influence makes many of these songs sound like out-takes from XTC's "Skylarking" or their Dukes of Stratosphere project. The delicate pop tunes that do stick in your head after repeated listens, are also influenced both lyrically and sound-wise by late 1960's Donovan. "All for Love & Love for All" is a great pop tune and the other gem on this record is "It'll End in Tears (I Won't Cry)". Duffy sounds more like Al Stewart or Donovan than John Lennon, which results in a smoother, and gentler folk feel to these songs. Others have called the vocal delivery on this record thin but again, Partridge's production brings Duffy's vocals right up front in the mix, so that the words are clear and they blend nicely with the instrumentation on these catchy melodies. They could have used more guitars (and sitars) rather than the piano introductions to some of the songs. Nevertheless, "& Love for All" is a good record that achieves its' modest goal of carrying on the fine tradition of late-1960's folk-pop.  
 This book is plainly boring in every way. The plot should be replaced and the character was completely and utterly uninteresting. The first half of the story deserved a whopping rating of negative 2 stars, and the second half deserved roughly one star. If you have any intention of reading a book that you will cherish in your heart, then I suggest that you would please disregard this novel and find one that is more interesting, like "Barney Goes to the Zoo". Do not, and I repeat: DO NOT read this book. If you would like to take interest in this novel, save your money and check it out of the library or borrow it from a friend. You WILL be disappointed 
 ropes are cheap,and while strong,make the swing sit at an angle and swing not straight, but in an eliptical figure eight pattern 
 It is rare to read a book in which the author seems to care so little about the quality or integrity of what she has written.  More amazing is the respect critics have accorded this work.  The author seems utterly indifferent whether the reader tracks the journey, so to speak, and is rewarded in the end.  Solecisms abound, plainly not caught by Gordimer or her editors.  The language is jarring and aimless, snippets of conversations half-heard, and it would be overly generous to one-half of the equation to call this "stream of consciousness."  Sure apartheid was bad and capitalism is at times flawed, but that is the stuff of tracts, not literature, and it is tempting to think that this work, and perhaps more, receives plaudits for being politically correct, given Gordimer's role as a pillar of PEN.  For literature about South Africa, Coetzee and Brink seem the way in, or most certainly, Alexandra Fuller's recent account of her childhood.  Do not be a stooge to integrity as I have been after starting to read Burger's Daughter and plow your way all the way through this jumble of self-indulgence 
 I am glad I got this book from the library as it is pretty much a rip-off "Compromising positions" by Susan Isaacs.  Bored housewife - murder in the suburbs - blah blah blah.  
 this is a crass emotional manipultion..all be it well produced manipulation that gives the viewer a warm fuzzy feeling while very slyly promoting war..suggesting war is a duty to your country or what have you. At the same time manipulting the viewers emotions very very effectively.  War is mass indescriminate death of fooled young men and innocent civilians directed by millionaires who's prime purpose is to profit from the killing.   Think for a minute about what you're being told behind this mass of emotional manipulation 
 Having not seen the orginal Rudolph TV show in a very long time I forgot what the story line was... remember that in this version of the story the snowman eats reindeers and apparently elves or anything else that would be upsetting to a child. There are a couple of scary illustrations in this book. My 3 year old was in love with the Rudolph movie but once he saw this book he refused to ever have anything to do with Rudolph again because he said he "didn't like the scary snowman".  Yes, I know it's a classic, but be warned 
 I've been like many reviewers a long time fan of this author and have found this latest "Evil" novel to be less then inspiring, or fun to read.   It does read like a textbook as far as the topic of psychic issues.  Our teaching was couched in conversation normally between Rafe and Isabel. We would hit these class lectures normally right in the middle of the murder/mystery portion of the book, and I would just be getting into the meat of the story, and then I would be derailed by "too much information."  This is not to say that I don't care for instuction and added background.  I do, but there is a time when it is just too much.  We unfortunatly hit this wall of information throughout the story.  This was just an okay read.  There was plenty of suspense (who was doing all of the killing and why) but I just felt that the fleshing out of the storyline, as well as character development was not truly priorty while writing the novel.  The relationship between Rafe and Isabel was rather confusing.  She spent most of her time lecturing him on paranormal issues, and less time letting her hair down and being relaxed while she was with him socially.    To be honest I did skim a few pages, but still, I was okay as far as not missing anything important.  This was not her strongest effort and if you are picking Ms. Hooper up for the first time I highly recommend her other earlier reads or even the other two "Evil" reads.  An author can't be on "top" all of the time and we should just remember that she is capable of doing so much better.  I'm really looking forward to her latest series she has started that will still feature Bishop and his team, and hope that she is back on track as the author we love.

 NOTE: This review is not about the trilogy (which is great). This review is about the many DVD releases.  The worst thing that ever happened to George Lucas is when Peter Jackson released the Extended Version of LOTR. Jackson showed fans we could demand, expect, and receive more from Hollywood. The impact of Peter Jackson sent shock waves among fans, who released a four-disc edition of one of the greatest movies of all time. Even old Hollywood guards, like Ridley Scott and James Cameron (no surprise they are not Americans) took notice and improved their DVD releases. This change has been powerful, except in the case of Lucas and to some degree his pal Steven Spielberg, who continues to stick to their old habits by being dinosaurs when it comes to business and satisfying the consumers.   The many re-releases shows greediness, stubbornness, and lack of respect for fans. No one is upset with him for cleaning up the original version, but please allow fans to have the 1977 version and the updated version with better picture and sound quality. In addition, please stop using the "Limited Edition" you like to use to get fans to buy new copies of Star Wars; it is both false and tiring. Release these films in Anamorphic Widescreen with 5.1 Surround Sound and allow the 1977 version of the movie be release.  Lucas's creditability has gone downhill to some degree because he is only known for his Star War movies. Unfortunately, his latest releases have only damaged him further because the quality of the prequels has been less than stellar. His shady practice of video/DVD releases of his past glory has resulted in some fans losing respect for him.  One must wonder what went through Lucas mind when Peter Jackson won an Academy Award for Best Director and not him. Maybe if he focus on making quality films (like he once did) and not playing the DVD re-re-re-release game, then he could win one.   
 Too bad that the last of the Ripley books was a bit of a let-down.  A great set up and interesting premise, the book is marred by its poor resolution.  What potential - two vulgar Americans who become Ripley's neighbors with a hidden agenda...the "cat and mouse" of this book should have been great, but sadly it falls short.  In my opinion, Ripley's Game is the best of the Ripley sequels - this one doesn't even come close.. 
 I don't ordinarily write reviews, but I feel the need to steer people away from spending money on this book!  This was a horrible waste of money, and of time spent in reading the first third or so I read before I quit.   Patricia Gunn Allen is not simply hooked on Political Correctness (which I could deal with).  She substitutes it for decent scholarship and for writing ability.  After the pointless detours into the legends of her own New Mexico Native American clan and 21st Century Physics, the attempt to relate the "myth" of Pochahontas to the Legend of one of the Kngihts of the Round Table (I think it was Gawain and the Green Knight, but I'm honestly not sure) did me in.  I wanted to know something about Pocahotas -- the Woman!  Or, as the title of the book says, the Medicine Woman, Spy,  Entrepeneur and Diplomat!  And that is what I could NOT glean from this book at all. 
 The title of the Riddle of the Sands is exotic but beyond that - this is an unbelievably boring tale of two friends who come together at some godforsaken islands to reveal a British traitor.  That's the gist of the novel. But what follows is a convoluted storyline full of slang, garbled nautical lingo rendered in half completed sentences that have no head or tail. Understanding such a text will require a supercomputer not to speak of a mere mortal. The writer seems to have written this book in some opium-induced hallucinatory trance. This is a heck of a one-way trip to self-congratulatory egotism, if I ever saw on 
 I liked: 2:Aging Spinsters 6:Pillow Fight 13:Puerto Rico Way  the rest sounded a bit bland. The song lengths are not to long which is good because even if these songs were any longer they would start to be boring 
 I just read this short story and I didn't like it is just to hard to read and their is really nothing that makes you want to keep on reading this story.  It is verry (not my type).  I read better stories by better  authors.  A good author is Dean Koontz now he has good books and stories.   You would probably like Dean Koontz  more than this Edgar Allan.  Without  having to be confuse at any moment while your reading 
 0 stars:  I stopped reading this when this pseudo author tried to describe the misery in Atlanta.  Bad stuff happened in Atlanta.  This "so called" author takes a terrible situation and tries to fit it into her stupid nothing story.  My book is for sale on ebay.  AND I have not EVEN finished it!!! 
 Yes, Jordan writes well, uses words and descriptions beautifully. One of the many glowing blurbs on the dust jacket described it as "elegiac" and it certainly is, but elegiac only takes a book so far.  Beyond that, you need interesting characters that the reader cares about, set in a story that moves with a compelling narrative.  Perfect example, ATONEMENT.  Sadly, SHADE joins the pile of books I put down after wading through more than 100 pages. I could not finish it even though I was trapped on a long airplane flight with nothing else to read 
 The book's summary was actually better than the actual read. That's why I decided to try this author for the first time and more than likely this will be the last. I found the conversations between all of the characters boring and unrealistic. The relationship between Caroline and Max was super boring. Here you have an abused woman who could not stand up to her husband, all of a sudden calling the shots with another man who wasn't exactly a wimp.She demands that he be a person of character when she lies about her whole life.  And the scenes where Caroline and Max are very intimate in her apartment with her son in the next room and also in the office, turned my stomach. At the time of this review, I am still plowing through it. It is one of those novels that never seem to end. I keep turning the pages to see when the chapter ends. I'm not sure if I will finish it. I usually do not write reviews, but every so often I feel the need to release frustration and anguish. I can't wait to read something more appealing 
 The DVD for "The Golden Coach" is for the most part fine, but the final minutes, which are crucial to the full impact of the film, are ruined by deplorable mastering. The scene appears to be out of focus and the colors are washed out to the point of barely being able make out what is happening. I believe Criterion made some kind of mastering error, because Martin Scorsese's introduction to the film explicitly refers to the wonderful restored ending of the film. Criterion should withdraw the DVD and offer a replacement 
 My 7 year old son got it for Christmas. He was really excited. It is definitely a neat toy. The whole family was into it. However, it only lasted one day. It would no longer charge and I am just going to take it back because I am in no position waste $20.00 just for one day 
 Eugene O'Neill may have been the father of American theatre, but the excellent writing he became known for is not portrayed in Long Day's Journey into Night. O'Neill's characters were shallow, pathetic and seemed to have great moodswings.The father-son relationship between James Tyrone and his son, Jamie, is meanspirited, and they tend to blame eachother for the family problems. Tyrone regularly refers to Jamie as a useless failure, and a drunk, not only to his face but to other family members, and in turn Jamie refers to his father as a man who would rather save a dime then save the life of his son, Edmund. Tyrone says such things as "You'd be content to sit back like a lazy lunk and sponge on me for the rest of your life!"(p.32) and comments to Edmund that, "If he's ever had a loftier dream than whores and whiskey, he's never shown it."(p.131). The characters of the parents are pathetic, the mother all fluttery and drugged, and the father as the stereotypical old, cheap, and mean failed celebrity. The only seemingly normal relationship is between Edmund and Jamie as for the most part they exchange brotherly love. The relationships and conversations between the family members seems entirely unnatural, they go from scathingly angry to chipper in a matter of seconds. It is as if they entire family is bipolar.  Long Day's Journey into Night was based on the life of O'Neill himself, with the character of Edmund as O'Neill. The mother of O'Neill was truly a drug addict who had lost the son between O'Neill and his older brother, and his father never accepted O'Neill for who he was. These sad beginnings continued throughout the life of O'Neill and was evident in the writing of this piece. If the characters in Long Day's Journey into Night are closely based on his family members then O'Neill had a more sad life than anyone could possibly imagine 
 This was my second Netgear product I bought (previously a wireless modem which I was only okay with not impressed)  The idea of a network storage appeals to me.  But this drive just is not good.     In reading the previous reviews I found that it was a finicky thing, and be careful on the drives you buy for it.  Well I searched and searched and found a drive that worked and bought both yesterday.    Tried to set it up today and connecting the drive went pretty well, but that is where everything started to go down hill.  Midway through the install it tells you to okay any error messages (which turn out to be things like this is untested on XP and might not work kind of errors) and suddenly my computer reboots.  Figured it would have told me it was going to do so oh well, and it never goes back to the install like most programs do when they require a reboot.  Tried again, same thing happens.  Started poking around and find out that not only do you have to check the drive you put in to the SC101, you need to look in to your own computer.  To quote Netgears web site, "SCSI disk drivers from the Promise company conflict with the SC101 device drivers. Promise drivers are typically used for RAID 1 or for SATA drives. Many newer computers use Promise SATA drivers."  My computer is just a week old and has these newer drivers.  Back in the box the SC101 goes, and I try to uninstall the software as this product will not work for me.  Tried the 3 things when you have trouble it suggests, and none work.  This is where I get really frustrated, Netgear support.  I waited 35 minutes for someone to pick up the phone, who ultimately told me it was my own fault and I'd have to pay to have that "cr*p", yes he said it, from my system.  I needed to hire a local computer vendor and it would be my bill.  I have to pay to get this junk off my computer.  Way to support your products Netgear.  The tech support person who got on the phone had an accent that was hard to understand, and went through huge mood swings during the call, from happy, to argumentative, to depressed, to happy again.  I was freaked that this person knew my home address!   All in all, this is a great concept.  After reading up on it and now experiencing it, I think it needs a ton more engineering and refinement before it is brought to market.  Maybe by a company with better customer service.  It really requires a level of technical expertise that is not there with the average consumer 
 What a lot of self indulgent drivel. I can't believe that a great mystery writer like Rita Mae Brown actually wrote it.My computer forced me to give it a sta 
 "Skinny Women are Evil" might have been a good book, if it weren't for the following flaws:  1. THE STEREOTYPES ABOUT SKINNY WOMEN - While she acknowledges that there are slim women (including one of her late friends) who are affirming of big, beautiful women, the constant bashing of women smaller than herself  is somewhat sad.  Most of the slim women I know aren't hateful of fat women; if anything, they are concerned about their health and well-being.  I have three good girlfriends I knew from college, all of whom are smaller than me. Not one of them ridiculed me because of my weight; everyone of them loved and accepted me as I was; and , in fact, helped me get dolled up for many an evening out while we were in college.  My wedding party had women of ALL sizes; slim, medium (I was a size 12 when I was married), and one large and lovely friend who carried herself with far more grace and class than the author of this book.  Nobody was hating on each other because of size that day; they all celebrated my happiness with me.  So I can't relate to this most-skinny-women-are-evil thing.  2. PROFANITY - I am sick and tired of the wonderful genre of comedy (especially among African-American comedians) being sullied by the constant use of foul language.  This woman beats the late Richard Pryor when it comes to the art of cursing.  I felt like I needed a long shower after reading this book.  And the fact that she thanks her aunts for being examples in profane language makes me truly sad.  I'm 32 years old, and if we can't count on our elders to have some sense and dignity, our generation is doomed. We can be humorous without using gutter language.  MoNique, girl, get Jesus and get an education so you can learn how to be funny with class.  3. SEXUAL STEREOTYPING - I am all for being knowledgable in the "womanly" arts like cooking and housekeeping (which even a CEO should be able to do), and satisfying your man sexually.  But that sexual satisfaction should not be given to any man until you are MARRIED.  Otherwise, a woman of any size should have the self-respect to abstain and save her virginity for her husband.  After that, feel free to get your sexual groove on!!       The way MoNique talks about pleasing men sexually as one of a fat girl's tools to getting and keeping them is almost akin to prostitution.  There is more to a relationship (fat or thin) than just sex and food.  What happens when the fat woman suffers an illness that will not allow her  to do all of these sexual gymnastics (who can possibly be comfortable having sex with their leg bent back, no matter what they weigh)?   If those are the only reasons a man is with her, he might as well hit the road, because big girls deserve to be loved for their totality like everyone else.   4. STEREOTYPICAL PROMOTION OF GLUTTONY - Furthermore,  if you really love your husband or boyfriend, why would you want to send him to an early grave by feeding him unhealthy food?  I can certainly agree that healthy eating should not be about starving oneself, but the quantities of food MoNique reccommends are outright dangerous for anyone to be eating.  And all it does is feed into another stereotype: that all fat people do is eat, eat, eat!  Large people are doctors, attorneys, police officers, teachers, etc.  There is more to our lives than Applebee's or Ruby Tuesdays. I presently work 20 hours a day, am active in my local church, and am working on developing my music ministry.  I workout by walking at least 3 miles an hour, 4 times a week.  So this fat girl is NOT sitting at home all day eating Haagen-Daz!  That is a myth from the pit of hell! While MoNique does advise that there is a limit even for big women as to what is a healthy weight, the vast majority of her book promotes the very gluttony that would send them way past 300 lbs.  Some of us are meant to be large, lovely, and healthy.  Others of us (like myself) would do better to trim down to a healthier weight.  We need books on more balanced views regarding body image, weight loss and maintenance, and loving yourself at the size you are without hating people who are smaller or larger than you.  This book isn't one of them! 
        The book is called The Circuit. This book is about a boy named Francisco Jimenez who wants to be another person. He had a hard time in school because he almost knew no English. He couldn't understand her. He had 3 brothers and 1 sister and a mom and dad. The worst thing to him was getting deported.        In school he had a problem with 2 kids named Curtis and his friend. They were the bullies. Once Francisco had wore a sweater that belonged to Curtis. Of course he didn't know. He was lucky they didn't beat him up. Later they became friends.         His brother that was born after him had a rare disease, but he made it through. I think that people who would like this book are people who have boring lives. After every chapter he wanted you to put the book down. He didn't leave any suspense. I hated the book so much. 
 Don't read anything by Dershowitz before you've read BEYOND CHUTZPAH: ON THE MISUSE OF ANTI-SEMITISM AND THE ABUSE OF HISTORY, by Norman G. Finkelstein (University of California Press, 2005) 
 I have definitely found the consistency of Showtime's "Masters of Horror" anthology series problematic.  I was thrilled by the conceit, pleased by the selection of talented directors, but somewhat mystified by some of the actual episodes.  The second season, in particular, started out rather unimpressively.  John Landis, who clocked in last season with "Deer Woman," returns with "Family."  While many people didn't care for "Deer Woman" (about a woman with a deer body, in case you don't understand the title)--it was, at least, humorous and bizarre.  I wouldn't have recommended that episode, either, but it attempted something different.  When I saw the preview for "Family," I was pretty stoked.  It didn't, however, look horrifying--it seemed to be relying on the comedy angle.  That's cool, I enjoy comedy/horror.  After watching the episode, though, I think it's fair to say that it's not funny enough to be a comedy, not scary enough to be a thriller, not particularly original, and the twist ending was telegraphed a mile away.  George Wendt stars as an ideal suburban husband who is not what he seems at first glance.  His family, after all, isn't alive--and they're not even his real family.  They are skeletons that he has accumulated from various victims through the years.  When a young couple moves in across the way, he becomes infatuated with the wife.  He thinks she might be an excellent addition to his brood.  What follows should be a fun game of cat-and-mouse, but it just doesn't get going.  I think the main problem is the tone.  Meant to be a satire, most of it comes across flat.  Wendt, who should be having a ball, delivers a one-note performance.  You might smile a few times, but this is ultimately forgettable.

 I usually enjoy his books, even though they are formulaic, but this one was so thin in plot it was sad.  It was obvious from the get go who the bad guys were.  Of course there was the usual requisite sex scenes, even these were thin.  The dialogues were stilted. There was no character building if per chance you hadn't read his other books.  I agree with the reviewer who said this must have been a churn book.  I don't usually write reviews, but felt compelled to comment on this boo 
 I was sure that it would be really scary; however I was wrong. It is one of those movies which do not raise your heartbeat and do not have any real special effects. You can buy it maybe for your DVD collection, bout do not pay too much 
 A book for someone who is developing first embedded system(s).  Limited coverage, but has some good references at the end of each chapter that might be helpful to the reader. 
 While this is a well researched and thought-provoking piece of literature, I do have some critical comments to make. Firstly, it is apparent that the author's own holocaust experiences (or more specifically, those of his family) have left him with a vested interest in how the material in this book is presented. Secondly, there is a LOT of content to trawl through to get, in my opinion, a few pieces of interesting material. Finally, the underlying theme or accusation that without IBM the holocaust may not have happened, or would not have been so sever, is (again in my opinion) flawed. As the book shows, IBM certainly made it much easier for the Nazis to locate and identify Jews, it would not have been impossible without IBM.  Having said all this - it was an interesting read and although overly wordy is certainly worth reading 
 Maybe the author wrote this book as part of his therapy.  It could have been such a nice book.    To read about something as idiotic as putting a small dog and a weasel into a barrel and closing the lid until one killed the other is just too much.  The dog is the one left alive, but has been hurt so badly they have to shoot it in the head.  Then there is the pig mating scene.  Yes, we all know "it" happens, but my child does not need to read about "thrusting" and blood running down the gilt's leg.  The boar owner makes a comment that the next time the gilt will stand still for it.  Great message for young girls.  When I asked children what they remember about the book, they tell me the above stories.  One did not even remember the boy's father dies, but remembered the above graphic situations.  Much is lost on them.    The graphic situations ruined what could have been a good book 
 Here is a quick overview of how I figured out the monetary system to the point of being confident that my understanding is reasonably correct and being able to explain the basic scam in about 45 minutes.   First I became convinced that if I am ever going to understand how the world works I should probably figure out an answer to the question "what is money?"  Surprisingly, a search on Amazon.com did not return very many books on the topic.  Like any good college educated liberal I chose the one book which garnered praise from all my favorite trusted sources such as the New York Times and the Washington Post.  I didn't see how I could possibly go wrong spending $12.92 for the 800 page book "Secrets from the Temple: How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country", which The Nation said, "May be the most important political book of the decade."   Unfortunately, after reading William Greider's 10 year, day by day account of Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volker's back and forth decisions on raising and lowering interest rates, I still did not have the foggiest clue as to what money is or how it is created.  I'm sure most people would have given up at this point but I was not ready to throw in the towel.  For some reason I was not convinced by the book's conclusion that it was critically important to maintain the money mystery because "Taboos uncoded lost their power to persuade...The mystery was necessary, therefore, to sustain social faith. Knowledge was disturbing.  Not knowing the secrets was reassuring."   I needed another book, however the only ones that the New York Times seemed to recommend were all described as condensed versions of "Secrets of the Temple."  I had no choice but to bite the bullet and for the first time in my life order a book which was not recommended by the New York Times.  I ordered "The Creature from Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve by G. Edward Griffin.  At least Willie Nelson seemed to like it.  Actually, I wasn't quite sure if Willie Nelson was wholeheartedly endorsing the book in his review which simply read, "Scary. It's the story of the world banking system. Enough said."   I was quite pleased that Jekyll Island contained a pretty good description of the money creation process.  However, the book contained a lot more than that.  All I can say is that I often see my life as divided into two main periods; before reading Jekyll Island and after reading Jekyll Island.  I finally knew what Willie Nelson meant by "scary."   Now that I was starting to really get somewhere in figuring out how money is created, I needed to find more information to clear up some of the details.  My wife even got involved in the search for truly academic and scholarly information.  I will be forever indebted to her for discovering a free downloadable copy of a book entitled "The Mystery of Banking" by Murray Rothbard.  This was exactly what I had always been looking for.  It clearly explained the process without dumbing it down in any way or obfuscating the details in order to "sustain social faith."     That is essentially how I got started in learning about money.  I have found this to be the most fascinating field I have ever encountered and I am very glad that I didn't take William Grieder's advise to remain blissfully ignorant. 
 I read this book early in the fall of my 1L year.  At the time, I thought that the book was useful and that reading it would give me an edge over my classmates.  In retrospect, the book did not give me any edge and reading the book was a waste of time.    The book does give you confidence.  It leads you to think that you will be able to take apart a legal exam, reduce it to its essentials, and reason in a manner that your professors will appreciate.  I guess it might be worth your reading if you need a shot of self-confidence.    But I do not think that the book will make much of a difference in how anyone does on law school exams.  The authors' main point is to look for ambiguities (or "forks").  When you see something on your exam that looks ambiguous, try to explore all the ambiguities.  In other words, argue in the alternative--i.e., point out that if X is said to occur, then Y results, whereas if A is said to occur, then B results.  Let your professors know that you can see the little things that might produce completely different legal results.    This method is great as a theory.  However, it is difficult to apply the method in an actual test setting.  I remember that my first exam during my 1L year was in criminal law.  I was given a long fact pattern, and I tried to apply the "Getting to Maybe" method.  One problem I found was that I was pushed for time.  It was not possible to discuss all the ambiguities in the amount of time allowed.  The method the book suggested was just not possible in the context of my three-hour bluebook exam.  There was no way I could explore all the ambiguities on the exam the way the authors suggest.   Another problem I have with the book is that it is not really giving you any special advice.  Reduced to a sentence, the authors are just telling you not to be conclusory with your answers--in other words, show that certain items in the fact pattern could be argued multiple ways.  This is hardly novel law school exam advice worth $22.00!   I have read reviews by people who claim that this book helped them make law review or whatever.  I also know many people who have read this book and have gotten below average law school grades.  I do not think that this book will make a difference in how anyone does in law school.  If you are one of those people who has to read everything, because you don't want your classmates to have read something you haven't read, then by all means read this.  If, on the other hand, you are concerned about using your time effectively, then you are probably better off working on your outlines or reviewing your lecture notes rather than wasting your time reading this book.  
 Excellent book! Terrible narration by Mandvi. I cannot understand why he did not learn to pronounce the common Indian names in the book,... wasn't that the point of using an South Asian narrator 
 I read this book in an earlier edition borrowed from a friend.  I ordered it with the intent of sharing it with people.  When I received my own copy from Amazon, I realized that to lend it out would seriously undermine my credibility.  Here's why: almost every page has a distracting typo, including the back cover.  Although the content of the book is arguably sound, the extensive typos in this printing compromise the message to the extent that the book is virtually useless.  In network marketing, where the all-important goal is to establish the legitimacy of the industry and raise the level of respect for the companies and people involved, a book which creates the opposite effect should be avoided.  
 After finishing this book I have decided to write my shortest review ever for Amazon. I have two reasons for doing this:  1) There is not much I can say that probably hasn't been said by 2,408 other reviewers  2) Maybe Robert Jordan will follow my example and learn to be more concise with his next installment in this series  As has been stated this book could be sub-title "Much Ado about Nothing" with apologies to Shakespeare. The descriptions are incredibly over long (I have sympathy for the reviewer who had to actually LISTEN to all this.) and almost nothing is resolved in this novel. My only hope is that Jordan has managed to set the stage for the next installment in this series and according to his website he is intending to finish this series in the immediate future. I would only recommend this book if you are a devout fan of the series and intend on following it to its' conclusion. However if you do not want to labor through the 822 pages, just read the reviews here on Amazon and you will find all the events that take place in this novel described in a much more concise version without all the extraneous narrative 
 I'm a sports photographer and shoot a lot of soccer and baseball games.  Of these two sports, I totally disagree with this book's approach.  I tried to return this book to Amazon but can't 
 Yes it is true that you need special learning to understand Pound.  I did my undergraduate thesis in Pound and I am still confused.  I am now a student in Biology. Pound said (somewhere) that biologists are the best scientists because they observe the world. He thought scientists were stupid otherwise.  Since Pound I have discovered Dawkins, Ridley, William James, E. O. Wilson just to name a few authors.  They make sense to me.  Get the Cantos only if you are really dedicated to understanding one man's view of history and culture. He really believed that culture particularly past cultures affected people.  In this sense he was a behavioralist.  A little science would have helped him. This book is a throw back to the age of the oral narative when gods came down and took possession of a person. Somewhere in the Cantos he says : "The Africans have more sense than the Greeks"  who says?  Where is the proof.  He thinks he has found some. Also he writes: "We should keep our promises to the Arabs" maybe that is true.  I wonder, as a follower of Musolini would he be a follower of Osama today just to get into hot water and be controversial.  Like Homer he was blind as a bat! "A serious Character"  a biography of Pound is a good read.  
 I purchased this book as well as FREE college and training money for women. Both books provide TONS of resources but you will need time to sift through them to determine your eligbility.   However the books are HUGE let downs in that they have duplicate information, not only on the pages of each book itself, but both of them carry identical programs or information. They simply changed the print and layout of the books.  My best advice is to buy whichever of Mr. Lesko's books you beleive is best suited to your own situation, and save your money, don't purchase any others.  You will only get repeat information 
 We asked for 2 of these and got both. The material was itchy and scratchy and never got softer. It was very thin and you could see the pattern through the sheet. It was easy to put on mainly b/c it was a bit big. They ended up in the closet in no time 
 I understand that the whole idea of this book is to make the reader think for himself about 'quality', which is a very interesting philisophical concept...this is presumably why Pirsig makes time for the reader to think about it by making 90% of the book as boring as possible.  This book falls between reference, fiction and biography and satisfies none of these forms. It's quite amazing how by using the right words Pirsig can make a simple theory seem extremely complicated 
 I wanted to like this book. However, I found the writing very droll. I just couldn't feel the emotion, the ideals, the "rapture" of the subject matter. Instead, the book is bogged down in endless and pointless biographical details...this person did this, and then this, and so on. Maybe I'm not giving it the benefit of the doubt, but there are other books on transhumanism I found far more interesting, informative, and readable 
 People were talking about this movie as if it were the next Silence Of The Lambs.  There are several reasons why this is not so.  1. The Dumbest Cop In The World:  This character never calls for backup, and is too slow to think of the most obvious clues.  At the end, he even throws down his gun to have a fist fight.  He'd never survive on the Sopranos. 2. It's sooooooo 1998.  This movie assumes you know nothing about the internet.   3. It tries to be cool by combining BDSM, body modification, and rituals, but in the end it just makes all these things look bad. 4. It's inconsistent.  The Dee Snider character "retires" all his piercings for a few years, and then suddenly they're all back in the next scene.   5. It's unrealistic.  Where the heck did Snider get that second dungeon from in just a day? 6. I won't even get into the gaping plot holes.  The acting, pretty bad.  The dumbest cop in the world character has just one mood:  Grumpy.  Amy Smart is totally wasted in this movie.  Snider's pretty good though.  Actually he's really good.  Really, bottom line:  You have only two reasons to buy this movie. 1. You are easily entertained and you have no problem with plot holes so big you can drive a Twisted Sister tour bus through them with room to spare. 2. You're a Snider fan and you must own this.  If you belong to one of those two groups, go for it.  For Sister fans, they'll enjoy how the movie roughly follows the plot of the song Captain Howdy/Street Justice.    You've been warned!  
 This account starts out very interestingly but then falls into bland accounts of body markings left by aliens. The marks supposedly left by the aliens are discussed in such detail that I found myself scanning over much of those parts. Additionally, the people in this book don't think very logically. They never set up some sort of video recorder at night to see what was happening during their "abductions". It was almost as if they wanted to be abducted so they could sit around and talk endlessly about the markings left on their bodies. There is also reference to something important which is going to happen just after these incidents occurred in 1988. Well it's been 10 years and the only thing that happened is I wasted my time reading this book 
 Get "Universe by Design" by Danny Faulkner or "Starlight and Time" by Russell Humphreys 
 This book is DEPRESSING!  I have nothing against children's books dealing with death, but in this one, grandpa just up and drowns at the end.  Very sad 
 Professor Cohen makes the mistake of many social scientists; he determines his conclusion, then searches for examples which will support his case.  For every Lincoln in history, there is a Hitler, who wrests command of his armies from the professional military and leads them to utter annihilation.  Lyndon Johnson, with the barest of military credentials, attempting to decide tactical air targets in Vietnam from the White House, is another example of poor civilian leadership over riding men with actual combat expertise.  There are several more examples I could list.  A better method for this book would have been to examine all cases where civilian leaders forced their military commanders to deviate from one path and follow another, and to then draw conclusions.  Instead, Cohen, with his pre-conceived notions, attempts to "prove" his thesis by drawing on only a few of the best examples which support his point of view.  This is another case of an author pushing a political agenda by disguising it as scholarly research.  Cohen's examples and history are entertaining, but his methodology will only fool the ill-informed 
 Why would anyone buy a biography of Jim Morrison by authors who write on page 465 (bottom of page):  "Maybe what destroyed him was their refusal to let him set them free, or more likely, his realization that he had wasted the best years of his life on a few pages of misguided philosophy."  The authors are making reference to the period of time when Jim Morrison was down and facing the thought of having to return to the Florida court system to once again face the trumped up charges that he faced in the Florida crimminal case launched against him.  Jim Morrison "wasted the best years of his life on a few pages of misguided philosophy"? I think not. I think the authors "wasted their time writing this book, and it is a waste of time to read this book". Aloha. Peace. 
 Well, they weren't kidding when they said "free stuff" from Uncle Sam. Trouble is, most of it you don't need or qualify for, which I probably should have seen coming when I ordered it. It lists hundreds of completly unrelated programs, such as medical care for children with birth defects resulting from a parent's exposure to chemicals in the Vietnam war. Farmers growing a specific crop, in a certain region, in need of a particular item. Published writers looking to cover their expenses while they write full time for a while. Teachers interested to training abroad, exchange-style. That sort of thing. But hey, you just might be one those people. The book is hardly a "book" and more a very lengthy brochure (feels like 20 pgs max, it's not in my hand at the moment). Not enough pages to it to justify the $5.00 + $3.00 s/h expense, I say. A good third of the numbers and addresses are to get free information sent to you (see, we said "free" didn't we?) whereas you might have been looking for free assistance, grant money, etc. Again, random topics like veneral disease, homeless programs, military career training, and so on. In all, this would be worth the time to read through if someone handed it to you for free, and indeed I am interested in a few of these resources, after our family's immediate needs of income, housing, and health care are met. It's clear this book is not going to meet them today, and perhaps it's most redeeming feature is that it won't take up too much space sitting on your shelf waiting for some of this information to become relevant to you later.  ADDITIONAL *** Disabled people and Veterans will probably get more out of this book than anyone else, so for them it's probably worth the $8.00 
 I am trying to finish it. There are few philosophical remarks that I enjoyed 
 I will preface the review that I believe most of the tenets of "Peak Oil" and related arguments.  I picked up this book after seeing it in a side-bar banner add on a popular peak oil forum.  I was disappointed as soon as I started reading.  my main comments on the book are 1)  The book doesn't offer any new data on the topic, but instead gives a rehash of peak oil along with some alarmist consequences 2)  The book doesn't offer any tenable strategies to survive the author's "power down" scenario.  Kunstler in his book "Long Emergency" gives more meat here (though still not too much). 3)  The author gets sidetracked in a conspiracy theory discussion on Bush, the Iraq war, and various other ills of the military-industrial complex.  Generally I think these types of theories don't add a lot to the discourse, and was annoyed to see "Bush is Bad" references sprinkled throughout.  Bottom line is: not terrible, but not worth $10 
 When I bought this book, I was already a "pre-trib" guy, and a big fan of the Left Behind series.  I thought this book would help me as a Bible student to have a clear grasp of Biblical eschatology.   After I read this book, I realized that the Bible has absolutely nothing to do with a secret rapture followed by seven years of anti-christ led chaos.  I was amazed at how weak and utterly careless Lahaye is in his exposistion of Scripture.  For instance, his insistance that the 'Day of the Lord' and the 'Day of Christ' must be differant.  One of his main arguments in favor of a secret rapture is that since judgement is not mentioned in John 14:1-3 or 1 Thess.4:16-17, this MUST be a seperate event from the final judgement!   One good thing that came from reading this book is that it led me to consider other interpretations of the end times.  For far more careful study, try "Four Views on the Book of Revelation," by C. Marvin Pate, "The Last Days according to Jesus," by R.C. Sproul, or my favorite, "The Church and the Last Things," by Martyn Lloyd-Jones 
 This is basically just a bunch of random memories from a minor player in the "scene".  The crowd that she ran with was hardly anything interesting or noteworthy, as are all the anecdotes she relates to those of us who might have not been there.  I was there, and I suppose if I thought about some of the minor scuffles and brushes with the law I was in I could have written the same book.  Only I think I wouldn't be so vague as Ms. Cooper in describing the events and their outcomes.  Overall I was expecting much more from this book but was severely disappointed 
 The size is good but the second one we ordered leaked. The cap did not fit... The after taste is not so strong but very difficult to see the difference from an ordinary stainless steel container/warmer which costs only $6-$10 dollars in the market around. Too pricy and the thin plastic cap does not match well with the product 
 I would only recommend this product if you need something that only lasts six months.  There is a reason the warranty is only 90 days.  The performance (sound quality) steadily declines over time.  The ihome worked great when it was new, but it won't play songs from the ipod anymore, and the radio is a static box 
 I purchased this book based solely on the reviews posted here.  I immediately noticed some typos and more importantly, a couple of wrong answers in the chapter quizes.  The wrong answers are what has really scared me - in one instance, the explanation for the answer they give contradicts the answer given.  I stopped studying from the book so that I could obtain the errata sheet - I certainly didn't want to learn incorrect information/techniques.  To my surprise, I didn't find any errata sheets on their website, so I e-mailed customer service to obtain one.  I was given a one-page errata for the Practice Test only - these were errors I hadn't noticed, but they stopped at the Practice Test - they didn't proceed into the chapters of the book.  When I asked Customer Service for a more complete errata, they responded that they didn't have one.  I find it difficult to study from a book in which I have no confidence 
 People ordering this should know that Skye, the singer of the past Morcheeba albums, is not on this record.  The two men who started the band got a new singer, who just isn't as special, and now the band sounds like a lot of other bands (unfortunately).  With Skye gone they just don't stand out from the rest.  :- 
 I bought this for my mom who enjoyed the series and I found that I actually enjoyed it also.  The one problem, and a big one, is that the dvds are defective.  I tried playing them on three different players and the results were the same.  The pixels were messed up on several of the shows and, in two cases, stopped playing altogether.  A couple of the shows could not be watched to the end because they would start and stop and then eventually stop completely.  Returning the item is too much of a headache so we decided to let it go.  I also purchased seasons 1 and 3 for her and have no such problems.  One I believe I purchased through Amazon and the other elsewhere.  We just decided we will be purchasing no more boxed sets in this series.   
 This book is littered with very poor grammar, layout and typesetting from cover to cover making it a difficult and painful read for a technical book. The enclosed CD rom comprises a heap of code, very poorly formatted (and expressed) lecture notes and unrelated information. This book is also very mathematical and as such would not be recommended to a novice 
 Now, I realize after taking a closer listen to this album that this album is not a gospel rap album. On ''Know thy self'', Krs claims that there are many ways to god which is downright not true. Krs claims that any ''God'' that's worshipped will lead you to heaven. Think about that, Allah, Buddah, Jesus, Aphrodite all have nothing to do with each other! Only Jesus deserves to be worshipped! Jesus is the son of god, He did die, And he's the only one that rose again so we could all have a chance to enter heaven regardless of our sin [Which every man and woman has]. As for the cd, I won't lie, It sounds really good and even features a few gospel rappers [T-Bone, B.B. Jay], and Krs even makes significant quotes of actual bible verses, But when it comes down to it, Krs still fails to acknowledge that Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. This cd gets 2 stars from me for the fact that at least Krs is done dissing Jesus [Something he did on every album after ''Criminal Minded'' and every album before ''The Sneak Attack''] and at least he still ain't afraid to expose the problems of this world, But Krs, If you're reading this, I think you're an extremely talented rapper and you truly need to accept Jesus into your heart. Hope the review helped. Be blessed. 
 The title of this book makes you think you're about to read about a character that is attempting to feel a little more free - maybe adding some spice to the love life and other spicier thing - but that's really not the case. The character instead spends a lot of time trying to help troubled women in her community, which is quite noble - just not something somebody necessarily does with a red dress on.  The reason the story must go this way is so that Ms. Cleage can take the time to spoonfeed the reader on how they should feel about the city of Idlewild, black culture, and black women. Some of the very uncreative dialogue among the characters is so overopinionated and irrelavant that I think even Ms. Cleage might have forgotten at times what her book is supposed to be about. The love exchange that happens (but never really goes far enough) is the highlight for me.  I must also add that the rushed ending also does the book little justice 
 The authors Andreas may have had some interesting points to convey in a concise clear context, but took the lazy approach and used mind deadening conversations from recordings. This technique filled space with maximum  words and minimum worthwhile content. In my opinion, grossly overrated by  previous reviewers 
 I had to read this book for school. I thought I would love it, but it turns out I was WRONG. This book was mind numbing. It is drawn out and boring. I almost threw the book away and rented the movie. I should have. This books sucks. Don't waste your time reading it 
 I had so many bad burns with my first spindle that I had to ask for an exchange.  The new spindle had at least 5 bad burns too.  Also, the edge of the disc wasn't rounded but had a sharp lip on the underside.  Never again will I buy Memorex discs DVD, CD or otherwise 
 This is a really useful book, tons of tips, saved me a lot $$ and time.  The downside is too heavy to carry in the parks. The most valuable thing I learn is to rent a multi-family vacation house with my friends, 16 people for only $199 a day. We all enjoy the stay at a spacious luxury resort. check this out: http://www.cyberrentals.com/index.cfm/property/12668 
 For starters, if you want to start saving money then don't buy this book or waste the gas to get you to the library!  By far the WORST wedding book I have ever read (and I've read lots of them).  This book has hideous reception suggestions such as using your parish CAFETERIA to host your event.  Using olives as an "appetizer", having a fake foam cake, having an amatuer dj who plays "for free to get experience" and many other bad ideas. Words cannot express how bad I thought this book was.  I actually called another woman and read her a few quotes to get her opinion and she laughed so hard she actually cried.  The fact that the author kept plugging her other stupid wedding planning books was almost as tacky as some of her suggestions. Right up there with the tackiness of a cash bar.   
 I love a great escape and a good story.  This was none of the above.  It reminded me of dull elevator chat that you aren't really paying attention to anyway.    Rarely can I not finish a book, but that's not the case with this one.  
 If you're looking to learn how to appraise a home than this isn't the best book to get. As a beginner it was hard to get a grasp of appraising 
 I have just spent over one hour scrubbing my toddler's hands from this permanent ink!  I have tried hand soap, soaking in detergent, boraxo, make up remover and brute force, and have yet to make more than a dent in her blue fingers.  Don't buy this unsafe product!!!!  Now I have to continue scubbing... 
 As a work of fiction this is a fine book. Mailer is a great writer and as I don't think this was one of his finest works, it was still an enjoyable read. What I was a bit irked by was the lack of focus on what I thought was going to be the central plot of the novel - Adolf Hitler's childhood. This was a book about his father Alois mostly. It detailed Alois' childhood, relationships, work, children, retirement and death. As soon as he died there was 20 pages left in the book. Yes, you can say that we can gain some sort of insight into Adolf's life indirectly by seeing what a person his father was but this is not very complete. My expectation was that you would see sections of his father throughout his life, sections of his school friends, deep traumatic experiences and what inevitably started him down the road of politics. The ending of this book left me feeling very incomplete, almost as if there was a second volume somewhere that I forgot to purchase 
 I am a wife who was cheated on. How pathetic that there is a book out there to help the other woman. Don't waste money on this book as I will give you advice for free. Ready? Don't date married men you slimeballs 
 Not only is the plot pretty weak, but the writing style is very unlike the older "Cat Who" books. In fact, it doesn't sound like the "voice" of Lilian Jackson Braun at all. In the past I don't recall every other sentence ending with an explanation mark. Nor do I ever recall so many extraneous characters being introduced to readers with no apparent contribution to the plot. In some cases it looks like the copy editor was asleep. Examples: on p. 131, "During Polly's absence, Qwilleran had plenty of dinner invitations" and again, on  p. 140 "During Polly's absence, Qwilleran received many invitations to dinner." I'm disappointed.. 
 This is one of the worst books in the world---in my humble opinion!  OK, I'm in the minority.  Most of the reviewers LOVED the book.  I think this book is a waste of beautiful words!  Yes, Conrad had a beautiful English vocabulary.  But, the "story" is "encrusted" with so many words you'll tire of it after awhile. OK, try the book, but now, at least, you won't feel as I did,  "What's wrong with ME that I don't like this book."  You won't feel "alone" in your reaction.  I think "Heart of Darkness" is a much better book.    Comments?   boland7214@aol.  PS:  As of 1-15-07 I see that I have ZERO "yes" votes for my review.  That's "mean".  I'm just giving my honest reaction.  You don't have to agree with me but why not give me a break for spending the time and energy just to write my thoughts----thoughts which MIGHT help someone....maybe not you....but someone.  Thanks.  
 The book is extremely dry and is very wordy.  There is a lot of information present and the subject is rather dry to begin with, but this book still falls short.  It also lacks examples of major documentation (requirements definition, requirements specifcation, etc. 
 I hate to say this about a classic, but--I found this book incredibly boring 
 This is a book by JA Jance?  This book took a potentially good storyline (plot) and made it seem stupid because it was so simplistic in its writing style, which is UNLIKE JA Jance.  This book seemed to be to be written for a young-adult reader audience.   I had to force myself to read it all the way through because I must admit, I was curious as to the conclusion, but I did not derive any pleasure from reading this book.  A waste of time 
 I bought this thinking that it would work better than scooping kitty litter into a small trash bag and tying it off and then placing it in the trash.  I was WRONG.  This does not hold much waste and takes up un-necessary space.  If you want to buy something for your soiled kitty litter get a diaper genie and throw your trash bags of waste in that.  I have three cats and have to empty this Litter keeper at least every other day.  I wish I never bought it 
 I have noticed that of the very few reviews written on this book none of them were writen by the actual teens that the book is written for. I read this book a few days ago and it took every ounce of my self-controll not to throw it on the ground and spit on it. Through the whole book I got the distinct feeling that the author remembers nothing of what it is like to be a teenager or if they do than they were one of those teens that I feel like throttling when they pick fights with friends just to create drama in their otherwise meaningless lives.  The charectors in this book have these totally unreasonable reactions to everything that happens. I wish that I had not read this book and I only did because I was reviewing it for a program that my mother does as a librarian. If there are any teens out there reading this review and pondering whether or not to read this book I recomend that you steer clear of this one and go pick up something a little more worth your time. You will only glare at the back of the book with a bad taste in your mouth when you are done. I felt like the author was constlantly thinking the whole time while writing 'Remember these kids are stupid scum and don't think for themselves at all, I should make the kids in my book like that.' It absolutely drives me insane when adults talk down through their writting. The only good thing I can say about this book is that it is a quick read. It took me only 3 or so hours to read, but the bad side of that is that's 3 hours of my life that I will never get back 
 I was very disappointed in this book - I felt I could have written it myself, using platitudes and the type of jargon one finds in a women's magazine article.  I would have preferred more concrete advice, instead of touchy-feely pseudo-psychology.  I didn't learn a thing I didn't already know 
 I was extremely disappointed with "After Midnight".  The author, his widow, has written the book from her own life's perspective, and there is sadly little about the true Brad Davis.  His homosexuality, or perhaps bisexuality, is mentioned only in passing, and anyone in New York or Hollywood that knew him will tell you that this was a huge part of his life.  I guess a book written by his wife can't be expected to delve too deeply into this area, but even other interesting details - his drug addiction, his acting technique, etc. are only minimally suggested here.  I wanted to put the book down after two chapters, but kept waiting for it to get interesting.  I suggest the publishers retitle the book "My Life with Brad Davis - The Saga Of A Wife Kept In The Dark", or something similar, to indicate to readers that this book is about Susan Bluestein, and tells very little about Brad 
 One of the first genres moviemakers turn to, when wanting to stir up a little historical or emotional reflection, is war.  Films about war make up some of the oldest in the history of the media, many of them about battles that never took place.  But throw in a dash of historical accuracy here and there (and at the producers' discretion) and you have a recipe for "classic" status.  Exhibit A: "Zulu."  Nevermind that this is the retelling of a senseless battle fought in the name of British colonial expansion, in which countless men died, Brits and Africans alike.  Who cares that the Zulu empire was as oppressive and unforgiving as any tribe on the continent.  Forget that the ultimate outcome - "victory" at Ulundi - resulted in British control of Zululand and naturally, a barbarous system of apartheid for the next 100+ years.  (As one reviewer pointed out, the Africans who played extra roles in the 1964 film weren't even able to go see the movie under the current policies of apartheid.)  Nevermind all that.  Tally ho, mates!  This is war, and war is classic.  Gather round and hear a tale of glory, courage and heroism... again.  Sure, the heroes in question are fighting in the name of racism and greed, but fighting bravely nonetheless.  And to counter any suggestion that the filmmakers condescend to the adversary, the Zulus are presented as equally brave.  Yes, bravery abounds.  After all, what better match for the white man's unflinching imperative than another power-hungry, merciless (but brave) army: that of the Zulus.  Make no mistake, this war story is told from the perspective of the white minority in Southern Africa; there are no significant individual characters on the African side.  And looking at things from that angle, one would have to spin the British effort in a somewhat positive light, or never sleep another night.  But to pretend that it is accurate or just to arbitrarily assign themes like "glory" and "patriotism" to what adds up to brutal militarism, is to deceive one's self utterly.  If anyone can tell me how the effort to defend British fortifications in South Africa in 1879 has made Africa (or the world) a better place, I will gladly take it all back.    In the meantime, filmmakers will continue to rouse passionate armchair patriotism, recalling the brave men who sacrificed their lives for the greater good, whatever that might have been.  Unfortunately, it is the public willingness to accept these tales as accurate, these missions as noble, and these surges of testosterone as plenty justification, that many more men and women will be needlessly sacrificed for years to come.  "Zulu" is indeed a classic war movie.  But ask yourself: is that always a good thing 
 Don't buy this album. Every track is edited to its shortest version possible. The album is useless for all those DJ's probably wanting to include some italo disco classics on their sets. Even for the ordinary listener and for those who want to get a snapshot of 80's eurobeat this album could be really disappointing because of the absolute merciless editing. Some of the songs here were entirely created for the club and DJ scene, so never had a real radio version. Probably, the editing here is even worse than radio editing. Instead of this I recommend the "World Of Italo Dance" compilation by ZYX Records and, even better, the huge "I love disco" series by the Spanish label Blanco Y Negro, which features complete and 12" extended versions.  Here you have some examples of cruel editing:  P. Lion / Happy Children / 3:40 Koto / Jabdah / 3:36 Sandy Marton / People From Ibiza / 3:48 Laserdance / Humanoid Invasion / 3:20  See what I mean? Don't buy this album 
 As one of the reviewers noted in his review, I too have given many postive marks to those who have given five-star reviews for this novel; because some reviewers have made very good arguments in defense of this novel. [I never give negative marks on anything, even if I don't like a review, but I do give plenty of positives] Therefore, before you begin to throw the bricks and sling your arrows at me, please let me try and explain why I gave this book such low marks. First of all, I have tried to read--or at least decipher "Finnegans Wake" on four different occasions. I see from some of the reviews that anyone who attempts to disagree with this novels merits gets pelted with negative marks. For those of you who enjoy this novel, good for you! I do not profess to be as knowledgeable as some of you may be on this books merits. But I DO KNOW WHAT I LIKE! And I did not like this novel.  I first tried reading "Finnegans Wake" when I was in High School [it was not required reading] because I heard so much about it that I wanted to read something challenging. And challenging was an understatement. Realizing I was young, I attempted it much later while in the military. As if military life were not frustrating enough. It was not until I entered college, where I was reguired to read the novel, that I did so with true earnest: Due to the fact that I had to write an essay on the novel. I did receive an A minus on the paper. However, to be honest, this was after profusely littering the paper with as much b***s***, that to me Joyce littered his novel with. My professor must have seen some great merit in this essay---at least I felt so at the time.  However, wanting to truly understand the novel, I decided to REALLY try and capture what Joyce was trying to write. This too led to my dislike of the novel. Not so much with the books difficulty [although that was a problem], but with the simple question: Is it really worth reading? My answer? No! For me a novel has to give me that quality of enjoyment that makes the journey a delightful one. It has to capture my soul! This novel never did capture my soul. Give me unabridged editions [the only ones I read] of "The Count of Monte Cristo" by Dumas, "Les Miserables" by Hugo, "War and Peace" by Tolstoy [once is enough please] and more importantly, my favorite author, Dostoevsky, "Notes From the Underground," "Crime and Punishment,"  and "The Brothers Karamazov." These novels have given me something back in my life for the efforts that I put into reading them. They were profound and affected me deeply. They ALL gave me something in my life.   In conclusion, to those who find this novel worth the high praise it has garnered, I respectfully disagree. There are many great novels from which to choose to spend and evening, afternoon, or morning perusing. And while I do not look negatively on your opinions; if this book gives you enjoyment, then great for you. For me, however, the book gave me nothing. Nor do I wish to spend what little time we are alloted in our short life to spend it on this type of reading. That is my honest opinion. I am sure a 5 star review will give me many positive marks, but that is not why this review exists, or what I am about. This is just my honest opinion.   Today I am going to start reading two novels that I have been wanting to read for some time, but have put off until recently. "Growth of the Soil", by Knut Hamsun, and "The Master and Margarita," by Mikhail Bulgakov. I hear they are good novels; and after laboring over "Finnegans Wake" for too many hours in my life, I will begin to start on that reading list of mine. I'll let you know how these two novels work out. One thing I am pretty sure of, however, is that they will probably not frustrate me as much as "Finnegans Wake" did; and in fact, no other novel has been more of a disappointment to me than Joyce's so-called masterpiece 
 This book is aboslutely worthless, unless you're totally clueless and have never ventured over 20 miles from your place of birth 
 I don't write many reviews, but this movie was just so pitifully lame that I felt it was my public duty to warn you about it. The fact that Amazon tries to bundle it with "House of 1,000 Corpses" must be some kind of joke! The dialogue and acting don't even rise to the standards of a made-for-TV movie. The cops don't look, talk, or act like cops, and the lead detective/protagonist works damn hard not to express any kind of personality (his only emotions appear to be boredom and irritation).   Also, though they try to sell this as a horror film, it isn't. This film doesn't even try to be scary. The first half is a boring, brainless detective story with robotic detectives tracking down a pretentious Buffalo Bill-esque sociopath (Dee Snider). In the second half, our psycho gets released from prison, apparently reformed, but after the townspeople try to lynch him he goes bad again and has to be put down for good.  What really makes this a waste of time is that our psycho isn't even a killer. He captures his victims and tortures them for a while. And the torture is nothing terribly gruesome, either. His idea of torture apparently doesn't go much further than sewing his victims' mouths shut and giving them unwanted piercings. Then the cops find them and haul them off to the hospital. The only victim he actually kills dies accidentally. This dung heap of a movie is just not scary, and not worth your time 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 Maybe I'm crazy, but I've always considered a clock to be the inner workings - springs, pendulums, and such.  This book doesn't tell you how to build those - it is merely a woodworking book that talks about the design of the cabinets that house clocks.  Not for a horologist 
 Roadhouse two is a cute premise, trying to milk the idea of the original movie.   DEA agent Sahne Tanner (Jonathan Schaech) is the son of Dalton from the original film. Many times during this film, his character is told sorry about his father's death. that is the only real connection from this film to the other.  Will Patton's acting is under used  as Tanner's Uncle  Nate who owns a Louiisana roadhouse  on the river, the Black Pelican. Tanner comes to help his Uncle Nate. Jake (Gary's son) Busey plays Wild Bill, the local drug dealer/gangster who wants the Pelican for his own base of operation and will do anything to get it.   The film is filled with action and low on plot. Not really what i call entertainment  SPOILER ALERT (DONT READ UNLESS YOU WANT TO KNOW!)-Busey Character tell Tanner that he killed Dalton, The epic finally battles ensues with the ending we all can see what happened through out the whole movie  Lets say this, I hope there isnt a ROADHOUSE THREE  Bennet Pomerantz  AUDIOWORL 
 As a first time mother, I was looking for a book that would answer my seemingly endless list of questions. While this book does provide some good information, it is hard to decipher the facts from the sarcastic comments and attempts at wit. Every section and statement is worded in what I assume the author saw as a clever way, but after trying 5 or 6 topics, I gave up trying to get any useful information. If you're like me and are looking for a more straight-forward, well-researched book, try Your Pregnancy Week by Week by Glade B. Curtis. It is by far the best organized and most clearly worded pregnancy book I have read - having tried The Pregnancy Bible, What to Expect (too cynical and scary), as well as The Mother of all Pregnancy Books. 
 After a week of use, the knobs on the blade drive coupling chipped/broke off.  A look at those knobs revealed that they are made of plastic!  No wonder they broke.  The blender looks sturdy and solid - yet such an important part that makes it operate is made of some cheap plastic!  As far as I am concerned, this blender is a piece of garbage.  Why bother to have it repaired if it's bound to break again?! 
 Until Lord of the Flies I had NEVER left a book unfinished. Flies was excruciatingly dull, and uses way too much advanced vocabulary making it impossible to understand. The plot was horrible, and the characters under developed. I had trouble keeping the characters straight. They just seemed to blend together and had no distinct personality. I pity anyone sucked into reading this. It was one of the worth things I have ever read and I absolutely despise it. I would just like to know what the heck Golding was thinking when he wrote this! If it was possible I would have given this book a negative ten. A one is much too high for such a poor excuse for literature. 
 I have read Bird Times many times.  The articles are much less complicated than the Bird Talk magazine articles, which are fairly simplistic as well.  I recommend that you look at the cover and see if there are any articles that you want to read.  This magazine usually takes me 15-20 minutes to read, and that is if there is an interesting article.  Fewer ads than Bird Talk 
 the movie title itself says a lot, the movie itself is a total scam, fools people to rent or to watch it. a horrible directing, script and performance. you'd better jump off empire state building in the late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain-dean bad movie 
 I also think that this book is too full of academic theory and techniques, and this may be the reason it comes off as so cynical.  It works best in providing factual background that would be difficult to find otherwise.  But when the book shades into critique, the tone becomes dry and pre-occupied, if not positively dispiriting -  particularly when the co-authors subject Tarkovsky to their brand of Freudian analysis.  The result is a disjointed collection of facts and vexing speculations, which on balance does a disservice to the poetry of the films.  I personally much prefer Maya Turovskaya's book, which doesn't have the encyclopedic range of facts one finds in "Fugue" (a friend of mine described "Fugue's" method as "trainspotting") but is a far more inspired and illuminating combination of intelligent insight and love of its subject 
 I found the book to be a waste of time, energy, ink, and trees. It is nothing more then common sense re-emphasized. It gives a little bit of understanding the basic personality types, but does not give one the ability to "speed read". It basically says stuff like 'if a person is shy and doesnt socialize well, they are an introvert', well duhhh. DO NOT waste your money on piece-o-crap book. It is useless 
 I won't repeat what's already been rehashed in previous reviews, but I just had the feeling that Cox didn't take the time to truly develop her characters and plots.  The unique slice-of-life details were interesting but certainly not sufficient enough to sustain this work on its own.  The plot wraps up too quickly and too unrealistically in many ways, not the least of which is Melanie's sudden attack of moral conflict.  The story begins while she is in the middle of an affair with a married man, which suddenly looks like a bad thing only after her lover gets involved with the scandal at hand (not to mention yet another woman).    Another thing that really irritated me was the whole "Democrats - good, Republicans - bad" dichotomy.  Themes should be universal. I think even fellow liberals like me can handle a small dash of neutrality in fiction.  Perhpas the nicest thing I could say about Dog Days is that, at 274 pages, it's a quick read...but brevity, in this case, ain't the soul of wit.    
 I must be getting old since I've never done this sort of thing before, but I was so frustrated after about 70 pages of this book that I brought it back to the store. Expecting a solid historical novel set in the declining days of Roman Britain, I found that it started off smartly enough . . . lots of action tautly presented (apparently essential in today's market if you want to see your stuff published). But the tale just didn't catch fire. Told from the protagtonist Publius Varrus' point of view, the story sputters along as our hero leads an expedition into the British hinterlands to trade for iron (becoming ever scarcer as the Roman occupation winds down), stops to slaughter some invading Celts and burn their ship, rushes back to sit by the fire with his superior Caius Britannicus (of solid, old Roman stock and an old friend) to decry the aging process, etc., then dallying gratuitously with the lascivious wife of another friend (who finally kills her in a rage, along with everyone else in his household and himself), and listening to his own fine upstanding mate bemoan the moral deterioration in their little Roman colony as a harbinger of terrible things to come! All in the first 70 pages or so -- I couldn't take much more of it and shut the book, rushing it back to the store to reclaim my cash. Haven't given up on historical novels but this one clearly didn't work for me. Perhaps I am just growing less patient as my own aging process sets in. Still many others here liked the book so perhaps I just didn't stay with it long enough to give it a fair chance. The truth is my eyes aren't what they used to be so I don't want to waste them reading things which don't take off in some fashion for me. And this one just didn't. -- SW 
 Trying to figure out if I like the book or not.  It is a reasonably paced adventure with frequent sex and loving descriptions of skimpy clothing every few pages. Matter of fact, trying to figure out the author's reason for frequent sex and loving attention to detail on skimpy clothing appearing throughout this book kept me from following the plot.  
 I love Bone, but you gotta admit this album is terrible. Bad beats, bad rhymes the whole nine yards. It seems like Bone went from Thug to Corny and thats coming from a true Bone fan. A truly wack CD put out by one of the best rap groups of all time. 
 This item worked for a while, but required fiddling (unplugging and replugging repeatedly) with the lighter socket each time I restarted my car.  Eventually, however, it blew out the fuses in both my lighter sockets.  Don't waste your money on this piece of crap 
 I must admit, the setup that Aimee Bender constructs is fascinating: a girl in a claustrophobic town with a strangely beautiful glass hospital quits everything she adores until her routine is disrupted by the threat of her carefully sheltered world coming crashing down. However, the array of what start out as endearingly delicious quirks in Mona and the townspeople can't sustain themselves and become tiresome and forced by the end of the book. I simply could not find it within myself to care for the fates of any of the characters, whose actions and fates are all too trite and predictable.   The most frustrating thing about this book is glimpsing the potential that it failed to live up to. The book seems to awkwardly straddle the line between the grippingly realistic and the delightfully dreamlike. It would have been effective either way, but in the middle ground it seemed to take, An Invisible Sign of My Own was dull and bizarre.   One of the many plot weaknesses pertains to Mona's professed adour for math, which seems to supplemented by a knowledge nothing more complex than long division, despite a high school education. And the question of Mona's education leads to a entirely new debacle of how she is qualified to be any sort of teacher. This could very well be nitpicking, but Bender certainly doesn't seem to have done her research or have constructed a world convincingly magical enough for a reader to overlook illogical characterizations and plot twists. Mona herself comes off as irritating in her self-destructive self-pity rather than sympathetic. Her students are laughably (and not in a good way) precocious, wholly unrealistic without being interesting, and not at all endearing. Her love interest has little depth besides the plot device role he is assigned.   I could not help thinking of the whole plot as a uncompelling and unskilled rehashing of Animal Dreams by Barbara Kingsolver, which I'd have gladly reread rather than waste my time on this one. This whole book reeks of trying too hard. 
 The only reason why I saw this was because of Susannah York. This shows she was more capable of the dix she played in "The Killing of Sister George" and was a fine actress. Otherwise this movie is blah. It's okay to make a surreal other world but you have to make it interesting. The men in this movie are so disgusting one can't blame her for getting mad anyway. For another pointless film of this caliber see Secret Ceremony 
 Well, if you're looking for enlightment or a life-changing way of thinking after reading this book, chances are - it isn't going to happen.  This was like cotton-candy for the female mid-life crisis soul.  I don't know, I just felt like it was cute (like fuzzy slippers) cute, but boring as hell on a Harley.  Me no likey.  Different strokes for different folks, I suppose 
 It is difficult, nay, impossible, to like a book when all the characters are obnoxious, money worshipping parasites, and that is exactly what we have in this novel.    Out of the blue a godfather appears, a deus ex machina, who offers an idealistic lawyer, Clay Carter, more wealth than he can imagine or use.  Anyone with a brain would know that there has to be a hook within the bait, a very sharp, very large hook.  With apparent ease, this naive lawyer swallows the hook and makes millions and millions of dollars before he so much as senses that he is in deep trouble.  Enthralled with the gaudy toys and women that money brings him, he immediately loses sight of reality.  What a hollow and useless individual he is, as are those he hires to assist him and those with whom he associates in his lawyer world.  Whether or not there are such individuals (Enron?) is beside the point.  They may exist, but I for one am not eager to hear their life stories. The atmosphere in which they live is boring, as are their conversations, their lack of values, their hobbies, their sex lives, and their comeuppances.  Somehow, even in their fall, they never lose all their money and they never quite realize what hollow individuals they are.  Having read most of Mr. Grisham's other books, I expected better from him.  
 The "theory" expressed here is really nothing new, and seems like repackaged emotional intelligence and other ideas. The author continually uses personal stories and anecdotal evidence as proof of many of his ideas. While I agree that IQ does not tell the whole story, this book doesn't add anything new or unique to the discussion 
 I bought this for my 8 year old to practice hitting. Although well built, it is poorly designed. The place where the Hit a Way attaches is not logical and causes interference with the legs. The cables on the Hit a Way are so stiff that the ball loses velocity quickly and does not wrap and come back around for the 2nd hit. You might get one or two hits in before it is unusable. A GIANT waste of money. The only reason I give it 2 stars is the construction is solid 
 I liked this author's previous book "A Woman of Substance," so I ploughed my way through the rest of the series. The quality of her writing and characterization has steadily deteriorated with each successive book. I actually find myself sympathizing more with the "villains" than the supposed heroines of the piece. Every time heroines Linnet or Evan refer to Evan's "adopted" sister, the supposed "bad seed" Angharad or old Edwina thinks that "genetics is everything," I feel like slapping someone. Maybe Angharad is jealous and envious because her family was so obviously biased to the supposedly perfect Evan! I feel the same way about Linnet's sister Tessa, who rapidly became my favorite character in this series, such as it was. Tessa's jealous because everyone DID favor her little sister Linnet, who reminds everyone of Emma Harte. The whole family's devotion to the great-grandma who died more than 30 years ago is unnatural. And, sadly, Bradford's dialogue stinks as much as her characterizations. I don't know if even a soap opera would take her on as a writer. 
 I didn't believe the negative reviews, but I'm a believer now! And I don't mean that I believe in ET! I gave this movie one star only because there was no less-than-one-star choice. I can't decide whether this is actually intended as tongue-in-cheek, but it is chock full of bad science, sprinkled liberally with comedy. The title, however, is very accurate - "Without Warning" - I sure didn't see it coming! By the way, if you would like to purchase a copy of this thriller, I happen to have one that was watched less than once (it was just too overwhelming and I couldn't sit through it all!). Well, gotta go. Have more important things to do, like count fly specks on the wall 
 Ok, I'll admit, the nail clippers rock.  I have no problem using them, they are sharp, cut evenly and are the perfect width.  That said, throw everything else out.  The bulb syringe is useless, keep the one that you get from the hospital.  Get an ear thermometer, it's a heck of a lot easier.  The spoon...not even going there.  The med dropper isn't easy enough to use.  My suggestion?  Go find a syringe with a cork attachment.  You take the top off the bottle, push the cork attachment into the opening.  To use, flip back the attached lid and put the med syringe into the opening, flip the bottle over and draw the med into the syringe.  This is the best way to do it.  
 We received this product in a clear plastic molded container, however there were no instructions at all, nor was there any label.  We immediately thought, this must not be a new product.  Not knowing exactly how to attach it to the PSP or detach it, one of the clips has broken.  We also have more questions - can the battery inside this charger be replaced? If so, what kind is it?  I think we'll be returning this product 
 I was very disappointed.  The author's reasonng is fallacious, his research spotty. Could have been written by a high school sophomore.  There are much better works out there 
 Desdemona is an odd ball in her family.  She comes from a family of theater people, but she doesn't have any of the family talent for acting.  Instead, she runs a catering company that helps keep the rest of the family financial stable.  Stark runs a computer security company and first meets Desdemona when he is jilted and Desdemona is trying to collect on her catering bill for a wedding that never happened.  The characters in the book seem flat and with about 100 pages left I found myself skimming because I didn't really care what happened.  Sometimes the characters just acted completely irrationally.  For example, they didn't call the police when major evidence was found in a murder case.  I just couldn't get into it when the characters seemed so ridiculously unreal 
 the only reason I got this book is because it was in the Oprah's book club. I was sorely dissapointed. The story felt slow and disjointed to me. And my prevailing feeling at the end was "so what". That it was supposed to be a love story did not interest me. The sentiments expressed did not move me at all, it seemed very ordinary, almost everyday. But who knows, probably an everyday, ordinary sort of life story is what some people want to read so they can identify with- god forbid 
 I've tried this product many times using different methods and every time I end up with horrible streaks all over my applicances.  I'm not the only one.  Do a search on Google (...) and read a ways.  It seems hardly anyone is satisfied with this product.  Others recommend using Weiman's or Bar Keeper's Friend.  On the plus side, it does seem to clean the stainless steel surfaces well if you don't mind the streaking 
 I think this book was the boringest, and dumbest book ever!   But I have to say that the movie was pretty good and funny so you have to give that credit 
 Precious is an interesting document of a band in flux, searching for a sound. Gnecco's voice is in fine form, but on only his second record, he is repeating himself. The wonderful falsetto is heard hitting the same notes over and over again, which begs the question, is there true vocal range here, or a couple of parlor trick notes? We will not be sure until we hear more form OURS. When not in falsetto, Gnecco is developing a kind of warble that will alienate many listeners who prefer a cleaner vocal delivery. In addition, the chemistry between the band seems off, making the album sound incohesive or even over-dubbed, The guitar lines which Milone and Gnecco intend to create tension which boils over to melodic changes, seem dissonant and unneccessary. This music would be better served by simpler production. Ethan Johns could probably stand to play a bit more drums - it almost seems like he is deliberately restraining himself in the context of music that isn't sure weather it's hard rock or singer-songwriter stuff. "Leaves" is the lone high spot for this album, with its catchy Beatles meets U2 progression. The rest of the album, as typified by "Kill the Band" lacks cohesion, hooks, and musical identity. Instead of just letting the songs flow and write themselves, it seems like Gnecco is forcing things and deliberately trying to be complex with concepts that are essentially simple. Lyrically, Gneeco could use some help, as he is repeating rhymes, and syllabic patterns all over the place. From a standpoint of lyical meaning, the album is pretty much the standard emo / alt rock / depressed vibe. Nothing new here. Maybe just a sophomore jinx. stay tuned 
 this has got to be the WORST film I've ever seen. its not sad. Its not funny, jest over blow mellow dramatic garbage. I don't have any sympathy toward nick in this movie, because he does give you anything to work with or want to keep him. the actor is the worst of all. i cant tell if he's sad in some seens, or angry or jest retarded. I've seen some sad movies but this one jest sucks, I guess its aimed at a different time of homosexuals instead of the present. it probably worked better back in 96'. but this movie is SO SO SO BAD. its embarrassing. do not rent it or buy it or view it on television. NOTE'S: THIS FILM HAD  SOME GREAT TALENT A song from Olivia Newton Jon, and (one of my most personal favorites) Mila AND my favorite comedians Margaret Cho. She's to good but...why this film, she (and Mila ) are to good for some want to be tearjerker movie like this.      
 I expected more, and better, from the ASPCA. This book is so basic, much too elementary for anyone who already owns a cat.  Really.  In two years I've learned more from my cats than this book could tell me.  The  information level is cursory, and in some cases, spotty.  It was published  in 1992, so there's NOTHING here about breakthrough medications for flea  and heartworm prophylaxis.  The only good thing to say about this book is  that the photographs are beautiful.  Wish I could send it back and buy  something more informative 
 This book cntained to much self accolades and too little real information. I did not finish it 
 Any drummer deprived of hearing this recording is likened to a person being deprived of his morning orange juice - forever. It is not all about the band - the crowd is wild - & the 2 drum solo / challanges on the recording are a must hear for every living musician & anyone else that can apreciate 7,543 ways to treat your snare drum with love 
 A friend loaned me this book, and I found the premise intriguing and the promise of an escape-read appealing. Maybe you do have to be Southern to "get it," as another reviewer claims.   Though I enjoyed the setting (which was well-described and interesting), a few of the characters (especially the preacher/candidate who gives it all up to God with something bordering right on lunacy), and the consistent battles with hot flashes (a subject I'm learning more about every day), I was brought up short by the offhand racism in both the attitude and characterization of this book. The main character, Lin, considers herself enlightened because she wants to bring water service to the poor black part of her small town, but she makes these kinds of observations: "An Oriental couple--Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese? I could never tell--hovered close to the register...A young black couple with a runny-nosed baby argued in some kind of an indecipherable rap jargon..."  Trust me, there's plenty of this to go around, including a loudly dressed hippy lesbian whose art is all concerned with the organs of reproduction, who (of course) makes Lin very, very nervous.   Yes, maybe you do have to be Southern to find this amusing. I kept trying to like the book, and failing. I guess since I'm divorced, I am also supposed to be amused by Lin's hatred of men. No men are good, no woman has a happy marriage, any woman who is married is just putting a good face on the fact that her husband is messing around. Love does not exist outside the Breedlove family, apparently, and is only seen in self-sacrificing old white women who show Lin the meaning of real love (it involves forgiving a man everything and changing his Depends). Who does this character think she is, I wanted to ask? She hides a bunch of nice furniture paid for by her husband so the IRS won't get it, shoves it into a garage apartment, and thinks it's a triumph?   Add in the mawkish conversations between Lin and her in-recovery brother where they sit on the porch and she says how badly she misjudged him and he tears up and says, "That means a lot coming from you, Lin," (this happens over and over and over again, or at least it feels as if it does) and the talky-talky-talky descriptions of corrupt city politics, and I really had to wonder how on earth I was going to finish it.   Perhaps the most offensive part of the book it is the aborted romp between Grant and Lin. She knows exactly who he is and what he wants, and he goes to a great deal of trouble to treat her with gallantry, even though he is not offering her love. When they FINALLY get to bed, after too many descriptions of his legs and chest and spicy man-tang scent, she keeps laughing at him. When he becomes frustrated and lashes out, she erupts in hatred at the man. "Oh how dare he desire me and not love me! He should be thrashed, the scoundrel! Thank goodness I ate five brownies, got drunk and called a girlfriend rather than have some sex! I am a true Southern lady!" It's baffling, insulting, and representative of the huge ax-to-grind, chip-on-shoulder attitude of this main character.   I finally had to admit that I found her loathsome and the book tedious, and skimmed about a hundred pages, just to say I finished it. No one else needs to bother.   
 We have had ours for almost a year - it still works great, but there is one big problem - the display is a white/violet bright light.  Great for visibility of the clock when you need it, but unfortunately, even when it's on the lowest setting, it lights up our whole room!  My husband sleeps through it fine, but I need a dark room to fall asleep and I always have to throw a sweater or towel over it.  We finally gave it up and switched back to our old clock radio 
 Don't be decieved with this candle burning book. This is not traditional candle burning, it's new age nonsense. Theres one simple test you can use to determine wether a book is reliable. The author has chosen to use the "k" spelling of magic making it magick. This "K" spelling was invented by aliester crowley, a drug adict and mental case. It has nothing to do with candle burning with the psalms. This book is new age rubbish and should not be considered authentic or practical. Don't let anyone fool you into thinking magic should be spelled with a k 
 This movie is very mildly amusing for about ten minutes.  Yes, it is slightly interesting to see the Cannes environment, but not enough to watch this film. It could be a cure for insomnia, though.  Fans who are looking forward to seeing their favorite actors in a satire will be disappointed.  You can count in seconds the amount of time any famous actor is on the screen, and it's really just very boring. All those fans of Johnny Depp: be particularly warned. He may have co-star billing, but blink and you'll miss him 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 The title says it all. They could have put a better group of songs togather 
 I'm sorry - I absolutely loved "Instance" and was hoping for something of comparable caliber. Instead I found myself dreading the time I would waste slogging through it. Sort of the way I felt about Michael Chabon's "The Final Solution" when half-way through I realized that that's all there is and what a shame to waste the energy writing even a novella on so flimsy a framwork.  Lewis Libby's "The Apprentice" is a better rendition of the "slender little mystery elevated towards art" genre which isn't really saying all that much.  Spend your time reading "An Instance of the Fingerpost" twice. 
 I don't understand why this book was published by a reputable publisher.  Normally this sort of thing would only be published by the vanity press at the author's expense.  The whole thing is mostly a bunch of anecdotes that are supposed to depict the author as indispensible and important.  There are too many passages like this: "I picked up the phone.  On the other end was Admiral Rickover. He says 'Cragen, you dirty old sea-dog.  We are completely screwed unless you help us.  Can you come to the rescue once again ?'".  I'm sure Cragen has had an interesting life, but they way he's telling it, it's quite boring, because he repeats over and over "I am great.  I am smart. I am important.  Admiral Rickover needs me.  I am great." Fortunately I got it on clearance at B&N for a couple of dollars, and that's about what it's worth. 
 I never received this product and will not order from you again. When there is a problem, you are not easy to reach 
 I have a 1956 copy of this gem printed by J.H. Gottmer in Belgium and distributed in the U.S. by the Newman Press.  I was looking for an identical copy to give to a friend when I was connected to this site.  While I do not like Msgr. Knox's scripture translations, which my breviary contains, I still prefer it to the edition you're selling here and will continue searching for it because I want nothing to do with liturgical books up-dated by Vativan II "scholars.&quot 
 This film is a slick, contrived, hollow exercise in style.  It is a typical "Miramax" foreign film.  The director has a snazzy, Robert Rodriguez style (the director actually studied under Rodriguez at Austin Film School).  Fast cuts, funky graphics, cardboard characters, no depth, cliches, everyone flashing their guns every 10 seconds, shouting off Tarantino like obscenities (including a few American pop culture references).  It's basically an American film, except it was filmed in the streets of Caracas.  Miramax (who distributed this) always takes on these type of films.  They're technically foreign, but they're done with an eye towards the mainstream, so they are not "too out there", so to speak.  Miramax would never touch a real auteur filmmaker like Alexander Sokurov or Bela Tarr.  Their work is very distinctive, and it's what art cinema is supposed to be.  The film isn't horrible, but it's nothing special.  You'll forget about it immediately after seeing it.   
 If mind-bending thrillers like Basic Instinct prove anything, the theme of an expert becoming obsessed with his cryptic subject presents a great deal of potential. This film attempts a similar tapestry. Our protagonist (Ewan McGregor) finds himself progressively involved in eavesdropping a disturbing femme fatale across the street (Ashley Judd) who's in the blackwidow-spider type habit of zapping all males she beds. Problem is, nothing much happens of this premise. We never find ourselves feeling for the agent or his liege. No romantic overtures with dangerous undertones. No edge of the seat interactions ala Sharon Stone films of the early 90s. Instead, there's a queer apparition of the agent's daughter that punctuates every second scene and adds to the pile of threads that end up nowhere. Such constant failure to take advantage of its almost-intriguing buildups gets the film my generous 1-star rating, anyone but McGregor's biographer needn't bother 
 I've read every one of Iris Johansen's "suspense" novels and have loved most of them.  The last couple though have been so painful to get through. This one however, I don't think I can even finish.  I read where someone called these characters "cardboard," and I couldn't agree more.  The female heroine randomly throws in curse words in a cheap attempt to create tension between herself and the supposed male protagonist.  Whereas in the Eve Duncan Books and the Wind Dancer books we are drawn into the story and come to care for the characters, it is patently obvious what will happen with each of these characters - makes me think of a writing 101 class.  "Now this should happen here, and this here, and this here and boom, climax, happily every after."    I hope that Iris can get her groove back and begin writing novels worth my time.  
 Really Really boring, don't think anyone should waste their time reading this garbage.  Horrible 
 A previous review says that this book is about the "human heart trying to understand itself", but I found it daunting for my human heart to understand this book.  I was assigned this text book in college, and I suspect in that in academia there is a "Emperor Has No Clothes" phenomenon, where people are averse to criticising badly written books for fear of appearing intellectually deficient.  While I do not doubt Ms. Nussbaum's intellectual capabilities, she needs to adopt a more clear writing style 
 Reading this book was a total waste of time. I met the author recently. She asked if we thought any of the book was irrelevant...personally I thought the whole book was irrelevant 
 The plot is new..yet..it didnt offer what his other books have.. Kept dragging on with the same reasoning..over and over and over again 
  this anime seems indifferent to me. It should be better to play lineage or something than whatch an anime who deals with characters in a online game. Can't say bad or good only that it doesn't interest me into watching the whole series...too childish mayb 
 Even the avid "trekie" reader of the Star Trek science fiction novels, movies and television series must suspend disbelief, when he finds Captain Kirk saying "Beam me up, Scotty."  But the biblical literalist reading this book need make no such effort, when he reads in this book that Jesus will effectively beam millions of true Christians up to heaven in the world-wide "Rapture."  Though the characters and their roles are fictitious, the book specifically references the relevant biblical passages for the believer.   The story line opens with the chaotic moment of discovery after the historic mass Rapture event, and the remainder is a moral melodrama concluding with emotional born-again conversions.   In the September/October 2006 issue of Foreign Affairs Walt Mead writes that fundamentalists are not hospitable to the idea of gradual progress toward a secular utopia driven by technological advances and the cooperation of intelligent people of all religious traditions.    Instead fundamentalists separate themselves from the world and have a premillennial pessimism about prospects for social reform.  Billy Graham's biography by Strober notes that they criticized Graham's "new evangelism" for its inclusiveness and for its involvement in addressing social problems. Yet their separatism does not preclude proselytizing as portrayed in these novels by the "Tribulation Force" or as exemplified by Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority.  They are also committed to an apocalyptic vision of the end of the world and are hostile to international institutions such as the United Nations. Mead notes that it is no coincidence that the Left Behind novels show the Antichrist rising to power as the secretary-general of the United Nations.  The U.S. Statistical Abstract reports that the per capita numbers of fundamentalists are growing exponentially, while evangelicals and liberals - e.g. Southern Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Methodists - and Catholics are continuing their per capita declines.  Such data and the reported popularity of these Left Behind novels indicate fundamentalism's growing appeal in reaction to contemporary American society.  I see the readers who seriously respond to this book as the "left behind" in the backwash of the tidal flows of cultural change in modern American society, and as conservative Christians who believe it is better to stay behind.  And in not just a few respects, they may be wise to do so.  Thomas J. Hickey  
 Tho' Aerosmith's first greatest hits package wasn't perfect (lacking Train Kept a Rollin' and featuring edited AM single versions of a couple big hits), it still stands hair and shoulders above this "Second Coming of Aerosmith" mix. Where Dream On was a definitive power ballad of its era, Big Ones is overstuffed with the lame metal mellow-dies (Cryin', Amazing, Crazy) that have become the bad boys' schlock in trade.  I reckon chart peak/career low I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing will have to wait for Hits 3.  Even the so called rockers (the dumb and dumber Dude Looks Like a Lady and Love in an Elevator) can't hold a Bic lighter to fine, funky seventies fare Walk This Way and Same Old Song and Dance, and I refuse to dignify anything from Get a Grip with an insult.  it only gets worse, and sadder, after THAT album, folks.  What's the point of being the longest lived rock band after Mick and Keith if you're not even gonna ROCK anymore??? (Sigh)...call me "Jaded". RATING: TWO LIPS 
 I have never saw the original Nikita merely because its hard to find. I settled with the American remake as a last resort insted. It can't be that bad its got a few legendary actors in it like Gabriel Byrne, Harvey Keitel & Anne Bancroft in it. Not to mention my childhood dream woman Bridget Fonda. Damn is she sexy. But boy was I so wrong.  Anyways, the film is very violent for all the wrong reasons. Has swearing for all the wrong reasons. Even a drug addict like Fonda wouldn't mouth off everytime she opens her mouth. Thats not the girl I fell for. The pace is every sloppy. Its hard to believe how many holes in the screenplay there are for such a simple story. What is the major problem is its lack of plot. You just sit there after her missions not knowing what will happen. Its unpredicable in a bad way. There are no twists off any kind. I found the ending quite stupid. It seemed like an easy way out because the movie was almost at its 2 hour point. After the credits I felt dissapointed.  As for the actors. The beautiful Bridget Fonda puts in a good one in my book. Her blank stares are quite annoying but her sexy angry look works so well for this movie. Gabriel Byrne one of favourites puts in a kind but strict performance as he gradually becomes a father/kinda love interest figure to Fonda. Who wouldn't fall in love with her? The two work well together I'll give you that. R.I.P Anne Bancroft, forever Mrs. Robinson to me, is also scrict but very understanding to Fonda.Its also good to see her in films now that she passed away around 6 years ago I think. Finally Harvey Keitel, good in his early career is very dull at this point but since his playing a character who is dull and coldhearted, lets nothing get in his way, has no attachments and is plain evil works for this movie I guess. You see how generous I am to the actors. I could be mean to them for being in a so-so movie but I like them too much to say bad things about them. Oh did I mention I think Bridget Fonda is sexy 
 I was looking forward to this item, but I was sent the cheaper, non-organic version twice.  Amazon informed me that they couldn't guarantee when the problem would be fixed.  If someone orders this and gets the organic version, please post.  I'd love to buy these in the future!  
 I think Dr. Laura should title her next book "The Secret of My Success: Stupid People."   Julie Townsend, Metairie, L 
 I watched this movie in Religion and was dissapointed that it didn't follow the book. I read the book as a child and saw almost every version of the movie available, but now seeing this one again (I'm pretty  sure I saw this before) I was annoyed at how much it changed the book. I think if your going to take a book and make it a movie you have no right to take such liberties. The way Mary discovers the garden and the key are absolutely rediculous. Also I don't like colin's strange fortune-teller like air. I had no emotional reaction to the ending where the children are all grown up because they just seemed like random actors and didn't even remotely resemble the children. Don't get this version if your a purist 
 I really was excited about this book from reading reviews and giving it a quick scan in the bookstore.  Unfortunately, a scan is all it is worth.  The first section of the book seems to alternate between the author's pride at being "the ATM" of the Irvine Company, (paying out cash for political favors), referring to himself as "the Wizard", and moaning about his relationship.  I don't deny the passion of Mr. Wisner's feelings, he seems to have been very committed to his relationship, but it takes an incredibly skilled writer to convey longing and heartbreak.  This comes across like an episode of "The Young and the Restless".    His travel accounts are somewhat engaging, but he still fails to connect with the reader.  I have also traveled around the world, and understand how relationships can be very complicated with cultural differences.  Mr. Wisner seems to take more pride in his prowess than writing an insightful scene.  I would really suggest choosing something else, this would have made a good blog, not a book.  
 I picked up this O'Conner book because every once in awhile I hear about her being "the definitive voice of the South" or "very disturbing" - I like disturbing and since I'm not overly familiar with the South, the definitive voice of it seems a good place to start.  But I just couldn't do it.  I read maybe 4 stories before I had to put it down for good.  I found the characterizations sophomoric and, well -- I suspect the overt, unsubtle, judgemental observations constantly being offered were snide parody, read in this day of self-consciousness they read like pandering to the lowest common denominator.  Timely, maybe.  Timeless, it's not 
 The writing and story are disjointed and the grammar of the author is horrible.  I'm not even talking about the quotes of individuals involved, but the author.  I'm on page 84 and don't think I'll finish this book.  It's too painful to read, and not because of the story it tells 
 This and 'Legend of Dr. Drake' were the 2 worst comic collections I ever have seen.This is 'Dr. Drake' only without drunkeness and hotties 
 With the credentials of these authors, I expected something better.  The book is not well-edited; typos abound and the sentence structure is frequently shaky, to say the least.  I would not normally continue reading a book that suffers from as many grammatical problems as this one does.  However, the logical and systematic way in which the authors examine the available material on abductions is interesting, and some good points are raised regarding the validity of the research that has been done thus far on this controversial subject.  This was enough to sustain my interest through about half the book; after that, I began to notice flaws within the authors' arguments which were no less inconsistent than those upon which they had harped for the better part of the book.  It appears to me that they are as prone to jump to conclusions as the investigators they criticize.  The only saving grace of this book is that it does offer a useful counterpoint and critique to hopefully improve future research in this area 
 This Bobber Cooler is definitely a conversation piece.  I have had so many comments about it. I used it when floating down a small river near home (No Rapids, just calm water), it doesn't hold its weight, literally. The first thing is that the opening is in the center of the cooler, making it impossible to get drinks out with out pulling the whole cooler out of the water.  The opening seam rides just barely about the water, and since it is round the weight shifts a little and the seam will dip into the water. The cooler then fills up with water, which almost immediatly melts the ice, and as it fills up it will sink to the bottom.  maybe if there was a rubber gasket to seal it better, it might be ok.  The 2 plastic clasps on each side used to close the cooler are really easy to break off, plus they are facing the wrong direction. If you bump something like a rock or a log, it will push the clasp back and then unlatch the cooler.  This cooler might be good to use in bodys of water that do not have current, like a pool, but I don't suggest towing it behind anything.  I suggest using one of the many inflateble coolers on the market 
 This book is just about the worst thing I have ever read.  One thing though... it talks about the end of the prairie home companion show... was there some break there or what?  the show is on every weekend.  Purple Monkey Dishwasher 
 I was thoroughly disappointed in this book. It seemed to have so much promise! The main character was completely unlikable- she made me NEVER want to get married! She is the epitome of a woman who is willing to settle simply to be married. She seems to view her fianc as a decent catch, but not as something she is madly in love with.   In addition, I strongly disliked the author's writing style. I can't put my finger on it, but it just felt rough and forced, like nothing flowed smoothly. Choppy I suppose. Perhaps this appeals to some, but I found it hard to read. As someone stated in an earlier review, I also can't stop reading in the middle of a book or I would have stopped. It was that bad.   Read at your own risk. 
 Some of you are probably in the same situation as me. You want an electric drumset, either because you live in a condo or apartment and the neighbors will call the cops if you're creating 190 decibals of noise from an acoustic drumkit, or because you like the bells and whistles that electric kits have, or both! But you dont have $5,000 of spare cash lying around to buy a fancy roland v-drums kit.  The makers of this drum set attempted to create the solution to our problem, but unfortunately, they didn't quite succeed!  The first thought that came to mind when I sat down behind this kit was, "geez, this thing is kind of small." I started playing a drumbeat. The next thing I thought was, "this set feels flimsy, like it's going to tip over and break!". It felt like a kids toy! I felt a bit silly while I was playing it to be honest. The brain was very simple looking. The sound selection was small and the sound quality of the drums were on par to what you would find on a casio keyboard circa 1987. Taking this drum kit out to a gig in front of a real live audience is simply not an option.  I gave one star for the ambitious low price, and the other star for their effort to fill a gap in this market. There's not really anything else to compliment on.  After doing a lot of research for decent quality, low priced drum kits, you'll realize that you will have to spend atleast $500-700 to get a decent electric drumset (used), brand new, atleast $900.   If you get this kit, there's a pretty good chance that you'll be dissapointed and lose interest in it very quickly, and not play it anymore. (or it may break before then). I would highly recommend investing a little more money and get a decent kit.   It's all or nothing!     
 Amazon's aggressive marketing tacticts now include shipping you goods when you called them to cancel it. I will never buy from Amazon again. I bought over 100 items over 5 years. I purchased the camera on a 1 day delivery plan. They then just ship 4-5 day completely insensitive to a photographer's needs. I cancelled order 2 days before it ships, they say sorry we cannot cancel. 2 days??? come-on. I guess the $3000 just creates nice interest. The end for me and amazon, I do not like this kind of "aggressive marketing".  Good advice, Rather buy direct from B&H Photo, pay double if you like, but you will get what you pay for there, not aggressive marketing and shoving of a product down your throat at their terms. I am truly annoyed. Run, hide. 
 The 2 patterns I have followed from this calendar have been wrong or missing information--can't follow them and get the (poorly) pictured end product when the darn pattern instructions leave steps out!!!  Did I just happen to pick the only 2 patterns in the entire box that are wrong??? Don't know, don't plan on attempting anymore projects from this.  It's gone, in the garbage.  Don't waste your money or your TIME 
 I loved these earbuds for the first two months. I raved to my friends. I bought pairs for several people at work. Then, about a month later, my boss came to me and told me one of the earbuds stopped producing sound. I thought it was because she was rough on them, but then quickly thereafter, my earbuds did the same thing... then another coworker had the same problem... all withing weeks of each other after purchasing them around the same time.   I know they're cheap. I know they're comfortable, but seriously, you're going to spend three or four times the amount over the course of a year just replacing them, so you might as well buy something slightly more expensive and get more wear from them 
 There came a time in my life, not too long ago, when I realized I had zero acting talent and [pulling] in my gut every time I was topless just wasn't cutting it anymore. Now if only David Hasselhoff had done the same.. 
 The "filler" songs on this CD are some of the worst I've ever heard. The lyrics sound like they were written by sixth-graders and the music has no character. I thought I was getting something similar to the unique, gritty sound of The Cranberries, but alas, this is closer to Hilary Duff. Aside from "Rebel Heart" (which is one of my favorite songs ever), I can hardly tell they have any Celtic connection at all! 
 When I saw this show in my local store I jumped right in and bought it. I expected an intelligent and entertaining show. I loved the movie Rounders and I thought this show might live up to it's potential, sadly that it not the case. This really could have been a great show, but it's just chewing gum for the brain. If you liked Rounders and like poker don't buy this as you'll be disapointed.  
 If an author choses to write a politcally charged novel, there will be bias. What I look for is some balance in the arguments. But, like his brother Rush, David writes with blinders on and misses the obvious contradictions in his arguments. The Democrats are not like Republicans! Of course not. The current Republican party is overwhelmingly an ideological, lock-step plutocratic mob who won't tolerate open discussion of an issue. Democrats on the other hand are diverse, open minded and welcoming of new ideas and thoughts. David Limbaugh would have you believe that is chaos. Open, intelligent discussions are what is missing in the Republican party right now.  A book does not have to be well written to put across the author's theme, and the ideas he is promoting, but when it is dully written, poorly researched and obvious in its misinterpretation of issues and situations it is difficult to give it much credence.  Basically I have read this book before, several times. There is nothing new, in fact it sounds like a few days of Rush on the radio, usually wrong and overwhelmingly insulting to anyone who can think for themself.  So, all I see here is an poorly written dull diatribe of the same old propaganda from the right - "Don't confuse us with the facts we already have been told what to think." 
 Some readers may be interested to know that the setting of this novel -"Sambuco" - is actually Ravello, on the Amalfi Coast, until recently the home of Gore Vidal.  The movie being filmed in the village was Beat  the Devil, directed by John Huston and starring Humphrey Bogart.  (In the book Bogie is the obnoxious drunk Burnsie.)  Cass Kinsovling's household seems to be in the ground floor of the old Caruso Belvedere.  The atmosphere of this book is not unlike the film version of The Talented Mr. Ripley, another tale of Americans in Italy in the 1950's.  For all of Styron's fine writing, this is something of a period piece.  The moral crisis that is at the heart of the book - the "fantastic going to pot" of  Americans in the post-war period - is not of much concern to anyone today.  Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice are Styron's masterpieces.  May he rest in peace.        
 This book is a compilation of stuff that is readily available on the net. There is not any new, groundbreaking or special advice contained within.I feel that anyone with internet access could have written this book within just a few days 
 I know I'll get criticized for not "getting" this book.  I read many books of the entertainment industry having studied the Red Scare of the 50s, numerous autobiographies, stories of the business side of the biz, and other novels such as this.  Most of my novels have been of more recent history and I read this based upon recommendation that it portrays another era.  Frankly, this bizarre underbelly of Hollywood is off the charts.  The one message of the book to me was that even in a more simplistic period, the lure of screen led to the same debauchery seen today.  Don't know why I didn't get it as this book is so highly recommended but be forewarned, it's not for everyone.   
 Though this book had some insights into the problem we Jews face, it did not offer any hope.  Antisemitism is not merely a 'Social Problem' it is an international, religious, and political problem that has spanned the centuries.  The author condemns antisemitism, yet bashes African American Christians and Muslims.  It is exactly this attitude of intellectual elitism that destroys the peace process.  Martin Luther King, Jr. preached a much more desirable gospel than Marvin Perry.  He called on his people to walk in love and not return hatred for hatred, violence for violence.  Essentially the doctrine of 'do good to those who hate you' is a far better approach than anything this author suggests.  He does not have a complete, or even clear understanding of the 'Jewish Problem'.  I doubt that any of us, Jews included, understand the monster that is antisemitism.  It is an emotionally and spiritually complex issue that may never be fully resolved this side of the New Jerusalem 
 I really enjoyed this book. Though slow at times, it was livened up with witty anectdotes and mature bathroom humor. The book describes the chemistry of everything from why your urine is yellow to how voodoo zombies actually occur. You will find out more than you wanted to know about everyday chemistry, and it might change your views on some things. The story of the namesake of the book describes the use of high density plastics to make radars work in airplanes, to build hula hoops, and high density plastic balls for pigs. 
 Perhaps this video will satisfy the readers of Lincoln's various works, such as The Sacred Place, The Messianic Legacy, and Holy Blood, Holy Grail, or at least show them the places discussed in detail within those books. The DVD will probably be a fine asset for those currently reading the aforementioned books.   However, it is simply not successful as a stand-alone video or as a video about The Da Vinci Code. The narrator, Mr. Lincoln, takes us through the quaint and beautiful countryside of the Languedoc, home to the Cathar heresy and the Albigensian Crusade, and points out some interesting details in his wandering. Yet he rarely ties the details together into a coherent picture, and often makes comments that would seem to undercut the very idea that he intends to create a coherent picture. As well, he relishes in showing the destruction wrought to many of these mysterious details by treasure hunters and vandals (many inspired, it would seem, by Lincoln's books) and repeatedly editorializes against their actions. I finally fell asleep at around the 90 minute mark---I cannot imagine what else Mr. Lincoln could have found to drone on about for the remaining half hour.     
 I think Dr. Laura should title her next book "The Secret of My Success: Stupid People."   Julie Townsend, Metairie, L 
 I purchased this unit of beach cat sailing as I had hoped to use it as a starting watch and perfomance monitor. Unfortunetly I found the unit to be sub par at best. I used the unit for two days of sailing before it's failures became too great for me to deal with.  The first issue I experienced was the paint on the front all came off on the first day I used it after a touching it with sunscreen on my hands.  This isn't exactly something I would expect from an outdoors product.  The second issue I had with the unit was that it locked up frequently, requireing a reset of the unit. I am willing to tolerate a mild amount of this in an electronic product, but once every few hours was far too much.   The third issue and the one that really made it unusable for sailing was the pins that held the unit to the wriststrap would easily pop off when the unit was mildly bumped. I had the top pin pop out twice and the bottom pin pop out once while in the middle of a race. After each time I was forced to just take it off and stuff it in my pocket until after the race for fear the other pin might pop and I would loose the unit overboard.  I was excited when I saw the feature set of this unit, but I would say it has a long way to go to live up to what it is billed as 
 I was a little disappointed with this item. I was expecting the item being more sturdy, it seems to me that the turntable is not going to last long. It is not a good buy.  
 I found this book to be disgusting, and lacking any redeeming qualities or messages.  I agree with the reader who stated the language is shocking, only for other reasons entirely.  If you don't like trash, you won't like this book 
 I hate it when rock stars form those g0d awful "supergroups".  Can't people see that putting a whole bunch of different people from different bands together in one band is just a marketing scam and nothing more?  There's no such thing as a good supergroup.  The Supergroup is the only kind of band that deliberately tries to $uck.  When Damn Yankees released their 1990 debut, every song on it was so incredibly generic, there was no hope for this band.  The whole album seemed rushed and thrown together.  They had nothing meaningful to say with these songs, it just seemed like they were pumping out filler and hoping somebody would be stupid enough to fall for their "supergroup" scam.  The big, booming, arena rock choruses just ring hollow.  I guess they're trying to be catchy and have memorable hooks, but to me, it just sounds like a lot of filler.  Supergroups will always suck, because they diliberately try to sound bad!  Thats right people!  Supergroup members know that since they're already popular, the album they're putting out is guaranteed to be a big seller----"Why bother trying to come up with good songs?  We're already popular, so people will buy it no matter how bad it is! Lets just put out filler."  Supergroups are a TOTAL farce, its just easy money for the people involved, and nothing more.  If you buy ANY album by ANY supergroup, than you my friend, are a sucker!  If you want to hear Shaw or Blades at their best, just keep listening to any Styx or Night Ranger album, and avoid anything by Damn Yankees, or any other supergroup 
 This is definitely not a book for those who really wants to learn mass transfer and unit operations. The author only skims through the important concepts and the examples are either over simplified or irrelevant. The example questions are full of mistakes and the answers provided are wrong. For the studious chemical engineering student who is interested to understand the important concepts of mass transfer, stay away from this book. This book totally mess me up. Now I am using Transport Processes by Geankoplis, which is in my opinion, more direct and conventional, and easy to understand than Cussler, who writes the textbook like a story book!! The Mass Transfer section in the book Transport Phenomena  by Bird also do better justice to this subject even though it is more suited for graduate students. My advice: Don't use this book if you want to grasp unit operations well 
 I never recieved this book.  I have no clue what has happened. 
 I was so looking forward to rewarching this movie after having not seen it for severals year. a third of a way through it, it starting to skip and freeze. I played it all the way through but took forever. At the ending it was workinhg again., But I missed a great deal of the movie because of the dmage. I guess you get what you pat for when you get it through someone and its used. Won't be doing this again!   
 After having just finished Victor Chan's collaborative work with the Dalai Lama, "The Wisdom of Forgiveness", I was prepared for a book where a lot of the content was atmospheric rather than substantive. However, I was barely one chapter into "The Art of Happiness at Work" before I began to get the creeping suspicion that I was being hustled. This is basically a Howard Cutler self-help book that has precious little of the Dalai Lama's insights. Which would be alright if it was presented as such more honestly. The few bits of wisdom from His Holiness seem only a token to allow Dr. Cutler to then take off on his own theories, and anecdotes about his friends who aren't happy with their new cars. Don't waste your time. Especially if you are looking to extract any teaching of Buddhism. At best this is a dull, uninspired read. And at worst, it seems like a marketing scam using the name of the Dalai Lama to sell another chicken soup book. Chan's book is a far more honest and pleasurable read. And any volume actually written by the Dalai Lama himself would be recommended. 
 The CD which comes with this book contains the best stuff from the book and you have to pay about $30 for each semester you want to read the info from the CD. The book is full of examples, but little how to use the info or even how the examples used the info to get to their success 
 There is no information in this book that I haven't read or been told before.  This morning I tried to make one of the recipes from the book, the "Wholesome Whole-Grain Muffins" and they were a disaster.  Behan instructs that this recipe makes 18 muffins, but I used 18 muffin cups and the batter overflowed and made my kitchen smell terrible (not great when a pregnant woman is feeling nauseous anyway) and they are burnt on the edges and not quite cooked in the middles.  This is coming from someone who loves to bake and has a little experience behind making muffins.  The batter was very watery and the small taste I took (what I could stand after smelling burnt batter all morning) was very, very sweet.  I would not recommend purchasing this book 
 To paraphrase the maker "...regardless of nationality, religion or race, we can not bury our heads in the sand and ignore the type of gross inhumanities that have been committed in CHINA for decades. No matter how horrifying it is to watch, we need to see the truth in its entirety to fully comprehend and acknowledge what is essentially an ASIAN holocaust."   Tibet is just the tip of the iceberg:   "In Tibet, hundreds of Tibetans have been incarcerated for peacefully expressing their political and religious beliefs. Conditions in prisons are reported to be dismal, with numerous accounts of torture and ill-treatment. In particular, PRC law enforcement officials have perpetrated violent acts against Tibetan women in detention centers and prisons. Buddhist nuns and lay women have been subject to torture or violent, degrading and inhuman treatment, including assault, rape and sexual abuse. In June 1994, one Tibetan nun died while in custody, reportedly as a result of a beating by guards. PRC authorities also have severely restricted religious practice; out of the 6,000 Buddhist monasteries that were destroyed by the PRC since its 1949 invasion of Tibet, only a few hundred have been rebuilt.   PRC policies, including population transfers of hundreds of thousands of Chinese into Tibet, threaten to make Tibetans a minority in their own land and to destroy Tibetans' distinct national, religious and cultural identity."   Ok, so using your typical Republican logic, we should be invading China. Why aren't we? Instead we are trading with them, Republicans are supporting it, and they bash anyone who is against what made it all possible, namely the WTO.   We now trade with Communists. Isn't that a hoot! A couple of short decades ago we were fighting Communism in the same region, and 50,000 of our troops died for yet another lie. You should be ashamed.   The longer I live, the more I see that political parties in the US and makers of dreck such as this are more on the side of big business and the oil soaked rich than they are on the side of any "people", including Iraqis.   Quit parading Iraqi victims of Saddam (we were his best friends when he was gassing the Kurds, remember? - we responded by giving him more money) in the name of your sick game of supporting the super-rich in their exploitation of this region. 
 Yes, I admit I was a bit shocked reading up on Danielle Steel's personal life-but it has inspired her to write best-selling novels.  I honestly don't give a damn if she was married to two ex-cons, and if she has married  5 times.  I value her work as a writer, and I think she is a very talented  woman. There's noone else like her. So she's human for God's sake, who  isn't?  She's tought me so much about history alone from her books.  I  don't care to know about the trash these two authors dug up on her-Its  almost insulting. 
 As a parent of a child with Tourette's, I feel I must warn anyone trying to learn about TS to ABSOLUTELY NOT buy this horrifying book.  It is full of completely outdated and flat out wrong information that has long since been dismissed by current clinical studies.  Please skip it and go read Brad Cohen's boo 
 I think this is exactly the kind of textbook that should be distributed in abundance throughout all states wanting ID as part of their science curriculum. This will not only guarantee my two daughters a great deal less competition in medical school, it will also help fill the need for astute, critical thinkers in the food service industry.  An EXCELLENT BOOK! David/San Francisc 
 An exciting subject matter made into a boring incomplete account.  Bernard Lewis is, no doubt a Scholar of exception ability, but he has missed the boat here. He seems obessesd with only the Islamic sources concerning the Assassins. He has neglected, or choosen to leave out, much of the crusader/Mongol source material.  He trys his best to legitimise the Assassins as a real Islamic sect, rather than an pagan sect operating under the pretence of Islam.  Lewis also attempts to distance the Assassins from the Templars and Crusaders, commenting very little on the endless envoys, pacts, tribute payments,and treaties between them. Nothing on the Assassin envoy that discussed the possibilty of the the Assassins turning christian (that the Templars murdered).   The book was a painfully boring read as well 
 The book covers a LOT of topics but it assumes too much.  Even on Chapter 1 the author discusses topics that I didnt know about.  Name of the book is "Network Tutorial"; bad name.  I would call it Networks Unleashed.  It also seems a bit outdated to me, the latest edition was released in Jan/2003, yet there is too much talk about Windows 3.1, OS/2 and NT.  Linux and XP are rarely mentioned.  I dont recommend it, its good but not worth the price tag 
 Just a few good recipes, if you like bananas. Too much eye candy and too few recipes. I'd pass on this one 
 Just about 2 good songs.  Rest is annoying and oversung and too poppy and shallo 
 I started this book because I love the quote about writing being but a different word for conversation.  Yes, there are moments of great wit.  However, they are lost within a mass of verbiage so dense that it makes your mortgage agreement look like a Little Golden Book.  It's not the sublime non-linearity of Joyce's writing or Ornette Coleman's playing.  It's the amplification of the self to an unbearable degree.  Certainly a unique achievement, I guess.  But so is Lou Reed's "Metal Machine Music.&quot 
 Bridget FOnda at her best performance? Guy, this is a lousy picture, where everything is wrong: the director seems to don't know what to do with the weak script he had in its hands; Sutherland and Ann-Miller seems to be  working to pay their bills, only; and Bridget confused the order to act  like a deaf woman and acted as a sleepy girl all movie long !  Every minute  watching this pocture was wasted, but I rented it because of the cast. Sad  mistake.. 
 I have had these books on my shelf for a number of years, having never gotten around to them.  They should have stayed on the shelf, as I now know.    I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy, so I recognized many of the tropes that Pullman tries to pull off.  I must say that Holly Lisle pulls off the multiverse much better than he does, and that's not saying a whole lot.  Like most people here, I found myself drawn in by the first book.  That one was well written, if a bit heavy handed in how good Lyra was, how brave she was, how she could do anything even if it was previously impossible for anyone else to do - like break her father out of his Svalbard prison.  However, the books declined in quality from the first page of the second book.  Will takes it much too easily when he finds that he has committed his first murder, especially for a boy of 12.  As a reader, I am willing to suspend belief quite a bit, but this particular plot point snapped that thread for me.  Once that was lost, it was extremely difficult for me to engage myself with the text once again.  As far as the ending goes, what a disappointment.  It seems as if the third book was trying to tell three vastly different stories.  Frankly, if Pullman had created a novel entirely about Mary Malone slipping into the world that she did and studying it in a scientific capacity with no way to return, that would have kept my interest much more than his rabid defamation of Christianity.  Also, Pullman fails to deliver on the cohesion of comparing Mary to the serpent, Lyra to Eve, and Will to Adam.  There was no offering there by Mary of something to tempt Lyra with as happened in the Garden of Eden.  Without this crucial component, there is no way that Lyra can be Eve reincarnate.   The propaganda that Pullman purports as truth would be all right if he was claiming it as his own, and that if others believed it, that would be okay.  However, he very cleverly lulls the uncareful reader into believing that what he is saying is a universal truth.  I had no idea that atheism was so nihilistic, yet that is the view I came away with when I finished this trilogy.   I would never recommend these books to anyone.  Rather, I would steer them towards better fantasy novels - like Rowling, Tolkein, Robin McKinley, Patricia McKillip, and Ursula K le Guin 
 All I got was some very average Beethoven performances from Leonard Bernstein, a conductor usually renowned for his extrovert, fascinating approach to various music but who so misses the mark with this dull cycle of the greatest symphonies of all time. One of the main problems is possibly the fact that Bernstein chose to record this cycle, ( his 2nd cycle of Beethoven symphonies ), with the Vienna Philharmonic. His earlier one was with the New York Philharmonic and that was a lot more youthful and vigorous. These Vienna versions are much more mellow and relaxed, I love the Vienna Philharmonic but they've played this music to death and I don't think they can really be inspired, full-throttle like a younger, less tradition ingrained orchestra. And to add insult to injury, Karajan's Berlin Philharmonic was always much superior in these years in terms of virtuosity, finesse, power and everything you need to feel the impact of Beethoven.  Still, the Vienna Philharmonic is one of the finest orchestras in the world and it leaves it up to the conductor to truly inspire them. This is where Bernstein fails, every single one of these symphonies is safe, lackluster and middle of the road. Let's take a quick, one by one analysis of the works.  Symphony 1 is done with charm and grace, Bernstein obviously enjoying the mood but I miss the sprint and attack that Karajan brings to this music. Symphony 2 is where Bernstein truly shines, he puts in plenty of power and concentration throughtout and the slow movement, the larghetto, is gorgeous. All in all, a success. Symphony 3, the Eroica is where the trouble starts. It's boring, it's deflated, it's dull compared to Bernstein's earlier New York version and Bernstein typically falls flat on his face when compared to Karajan or Klemperer in the Eroica. The funeral march by Bernstein can put you to sleep, where is the emotional gravity that Karajan brings to it in his devastating digital record? Symphony 4 is good but not great, a general run through with a few interesting touches. Symphony 5 is a dismal failure, the famous first movement is the worst I've ever heard. It's obscenely slow, 8 minutes, 38 seconds! Compare that to most versions which average like 7 minutes, 20 seconds. The rest of the symphony is nothing special but at least better than the atrocious first movement. The Pastoral symphony is well played but isn't in the league with Karl Bohm or Vladimir Ashkenazy. Symphony 7 is one of the best performances of the Bernstein cycle, with lots of energy and drive. Symphony 8 is humorous and lively, not massive like Karajan, but that's ok.   Finally, Symphony number 9 is where you should hear true fireworks from Bernstein, instead you get your typical run through as if this was some background music. The choral finale especially is a total let down compared to Solti's magnificient 1972 version or Karajan's 1977 recording. I hope Bernstein's later performance for the coming down of the Berlin Wall is not as routine as what I hear here. I have yet to hear that famous record.  All Beethoven symphonic cycles are eventually disappointing because no one conductor can approach perfection in every one of these works. Bernstein succeds in symphonies 2 and 7 in this set, but that's really it, the rest are average or worse. Karajan's early 1960's cycle is the one to go for if you desperately need a complete set by one conductor. It's not perfect but the most satisfactory available.  For individual symphonies, try Karajan in symphony 1, Karajan, Szell or Bernstein in symphony 2. For the Eroica, Karajan's digital version or Klemperer's 1961, Szell and Furtwangler are also great. Symphony 4 goes to either Szell or Karajan, Symphony 5 to Giulini, Furtwangler, Karajan and Kleiber. The Pastoral goes to Bohm and Ashkenazy or Bruno Walter. The 7th goes to God knows who, I haven't found a perfect Seventh, yet! Try Thielemann, Furtwangler or Bernstein. Go with Karajan's digital version for the 8th symphony. Last but not least, Solti, 1972 for the the Choral Symphony, as well as Karajan, 62, 77 and Furtwangler, 51, 42, all great.  Man, that sounds like a lot, but that's Beethoven for you. You can't ever find the perfect interpretation, because they simply don't exist 
 This is from the Stephen Hawking website:  "It has come to our attention that the book "The Theory of Everything: The Origin and Fate of the Universe" has been published. Professor Hawking would like to make it clear that he has not endorsed this book. The text was written by him many years ago, however the material has already been published in books such as 'A Brief History of Time'. A complaint was made to the Federal Trade Commission in the US in the hope that they would prevent the publication. We would urge you not to purchase this book in the belief that Professor Hawking was involved in its creation. "   To sum it up, Dr. Hawking did not approve of the publishing of his work, so DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK 
 Desmond, that's great, but how do you know when you're going to die 
 yes this book is about a love story between bussy and dame monsoro.  her husband monsoro is not getting any, how would you feel. this book teaches you a lesson and this lesson, don't buy books you don't know, cause they [are bad 
 Disappointing, the drive is very noisy, when you reboot the drive runs with the fan on high then shuts down. I would not recommend this drive to anyone 
 I was appalled, but not surprised, to find that this Warner Bros DVD was almost inaudible when I played it. It's got the same truly dumb Dolby Digital (only - no PCM) audio set up as for "Blow Up" and "Death In Venice". They all offer "1.0" ONLY - and even then it's at about one fifth the volume it needed to be.   I cannot believe that Warner Bros didn't see the clear logic that even a mono film should be encoded as 2.0 at the very least, but having the volume so low is not only totally inept - it shows complete disregard for the consumer. It is necessary that the volume of DVD's be relatively uniform - otherwise pressing "stop" while playing this DVD on your DVR (with inbuilt tuner) might just see your expensive speakers die in one almighty blast of whatever televison channel it was tuned to.  A good example of how a mono soundtrack can be used to best advantage on DVD in Dolby Digital is "A Night To Remember" - which makes effective use of both front and centre speakers (in 3.0). Many people these days will be hearing their DVD's through surround sound systems - so why on earth would anyone design sound to come from the center speaker only?     I've no doubt that this is a great film - but my ability to enjoy it in this particular DVD format has been hugely discounted. Warner Bros deserve a good slap.  
 I got about half-way through the book and had to stop.  This has to be one of the most unreadable and worthless books I have ever touched.  The narrative was utterly implausible.  A variety of unbelievable characters crash down the front door of a foreboding self-styled intellectual on the very day he planned to escape to a remote location to finish his magnum opus.  His friend had beaten his wife.  His ex-wife's brother wants him to get her to give him money, and to say that his ex-wife has come looking for him.  His sister leaves her husband, whom she claims has tried to poison her.  This has the air of a farce and never loses it.  Murdoch never establishes any proper characterization of these people, all who are obvious archetypes for this or that kind of person that Murdoch wants to treat in her didactic Chicken Soup for the Philosopher's Soul.  The protagonist's ruminations are unbearably repetitive--he goes on and on about art while piling up metaphors that don't mix.  Worse still are the breaks in the narrations in which the protagonist directly addresses the reader.  As if the dialogue between the characters was not a thin enough veneer to cover Murdoch's moralizing, here the reader is directly confronted with all kinds of platitudes about friendship, art, and more art.  It is perfectly obvious that the end of the book will see the protagonist revealed as a disgusting human being who should have loved his neighbor.  Vladimir Nabokov wrote in his postscript to Lolita: "I presume there exist readers who find titillating the display of mural words in those hopelessly banal and enormous novels which are typed out by the thumbs of tense mediocrities and called "powerful" and "stark" by the reviewing hack.  There are gentle souls who would pronounce Lolita meaningless because it does not teach them anything.  I am neither a reader nor a writer of didactic fiction, and ... Lolita has no moral in tow.  For me a work of fiction exists only insofar as it affords me what I shall bluntly call aesthetic bliss, that is a sense of being somehow, somewhere, connected with other states of being where art (curiosity, tenderness, kindness, ecstasy) is the norm.  There are not many such books.  All the rest is either topical trash or what some call the Literature of Ideas, which very often is topical trash coming in huge blocks of plaster that are carefully transmitted from age to age until somebody comes along with a hammer..." ("On a book entitled Lolita," (New York: Vintage, 1997), 314-15) 
 I suffered a break up exactly one week ago and was in the bookstore searching for some solace.  I looked through this book and I am sorry to say it made me feel worse than I do right now, if that's even possible.   The book does an excellent job relating to how you feel after a terrible breakup--after the first week of course, I am pretty miserable--but besides that, the strategies offered are really awful and could possibly set you back.  Among the bad ideas throughout the book:  (1) Call your ex.  Excuse me??  I need to make a clean break here and get on with my life, not risk the possibility of being re-rejected or offered some false hopes.  (2) Go out and have sex.  It should be self-explanatory why this one is not helpful. (3) Have an "implosion" ceremony, where you take out ALL the remaining mementos of your ex (that you should have carefully saved, according to these authors), and surround yourself with them while you watch old home videos and/or listen to the songs you had together.  Spend the entire day in mourning and don't do anything to improve your mood.  Follow this day with a celebration of the ending of the relationship.  (4) An extensive checklist in the beginning of the book that labels your symptoms as "compulsive," "hysterical," "depressive" and other words that make you feel like you've really lost your mind.  Perhaps this book could be helpful, but ideas like these should best be carried out with the supervision of a therapist 
 Kiyosaki warns you stright away that this book will not suit 9/10 people.  Still I proceeded to read the book and found the information presented to lack substance and detail.  Some of the infromation contained in this book is indeed useful but it is very hard to asborb what is useful when the book has been written in a non consise and repetitive manner.  Kiyosaki mentions the stock market bear run of 00-03 and investors losing 7-9 trillion dollars in detail so many times that you begin to look for any other information this book has to offer.  No mention is given to the stock market rally after this time and the gains that followed.  For someone that does not seem to like the idea of mutual funds and the stock market in general, Kiyosaki loves to quote Buffet.  He seems to understand the market better then people such as Graham and Buffet in the way he can predict market cycles and is able to time his investments.  Based on Kioysaki's own statement, this book will not suit 9/10 investors 
 I thought the book would address more than the South Texas Area.  Rather misleading title- It is difficult to find information on roses that do well in zones 6-9.Too many pages devoted to flower arranging and  potpourri  making 
 As many people may know by now, Sony was recently caught with egg on their face when a security specialist found out that a recently purchased CD (Van Zant: Get Right With The Man) from Sony music not only installed DRM software (digital rights management, to limit and outright prevent copying music to certain devices), but it did so in such a sneaky way that it hid itself entirely from Windows, and opened the system up to security issues such as viruses.  This CD has the same copyright protection, called XCP. When installed, Sony hijacks your computer and installs custom software which:  1) Hides itself entirely from Windows by installing as a rootkit 2) Hides itself in such a manner that any files begining with $sys$ are also hidden. For example, if you install the XCP copy protection software on your machine, and rename "document.doc" to "$sys$document.doc" it then becomes invivisble to you forever. 3) Installs its own custom CD-Rom drivers to hijack your system. It also sneakily names these drivers "Plug and Play Device Manager" to seem as if it's a part of Windows. Trying to delete these drivers manually will disable your CD-Rom drive entirely. 4) Offers no uninstall option until you manually contact Sony  As of my writing this review, Sony has "apologized" for this incident, and claims they will "re-evaluate" this copyright protection software on their CDs in the future.  In the meantime, a virus is currently running wild, which names itself begining with $sys$ in an attempt to hide from the user and virus scanners.  Several class action lawsuits are also pending against Sony right now.  In summary, as you can tell from above, Sony's actions here are absolutely horrible. This is your music. You purchased it, and they should not have any right to dictate how you can use it, let alone install software which compromises your system security.  This is one of the CDs with Sony's XCP copyright protection software on it, and as a result, you should not buy it to send a message to Sony that this will NOT be tolerated in the future 
 This review concerns the original 1936 edition and the revised 1974 edition which is slightly different from the original but basically tells the same story.  Nancy meets a young Indian boy (named Coya in the original, Rishi in the revised) who lives with a circus.  The boy is being mistreated by a man named Rai who claims to be the boy's father, but Nancy doubts this claim.  Nancy saves Rai from an elephant and to show his thanks he gives Nancy an ivory, elephant charm which he says can protect the wearer from harm.  Coya/Rishi runs away from the circus and Rai and the Drews take him in.  Later, Rai changes his mind and wants the charm back and he will do anything to get both the charm and Coya/Rishi.  Also figuring into this "mystery" are a strange woman and a bizarre house out in the middle of the woods.  The house, apparently, has no floor, but it does have a secret passage and a bunch of swings and trapezes hanging from the ceiling.  This book was just plain awful!!  The mystery, what there is of one, is stupid and boring.  The house serves absolutely no purpose other than to use up pages and it makes no sense.  Who would build a house like that out in the middle of nowhere?  The strange woman in the book is more annoying than anything and comes off as too scatterbrained and weak-minded to be the great criminal mastermind that the plot requires her to be.  The book has little in the way of action or suspence.  This book is just bad, bad, bad!  Take my advice and don't read it 
 I picked this book up from a local bookstore because it was flagged with a "recommondation" tag, and I've discovered some pretty great authors following the recommendations there.  Unfortunately, this one was a bust.  After reading the first 50 pages or so, I noticed the pull quote on the cover that announces "Swordspoint has an unforgettable opening and just gets better from there."  In all honesty, I couldn't really remember how the book began, and I'd been reading it for less than an hour.  There are two main problems with this "historical fantasy" work.  The first is the workmanlike prose.  Characters always speak with adverbs tacked on to force the tone.  Here's a quick recap of one such conversation that covers about five paragraphs of text thanks to the long stretches of dialog:  xxxxxx she said fondly.  xxxxxx said Michael with an impish grin.  xxxxxx the duchess said dryly.  xxxxxx Lady Godwin said firmly.  xxxxxx the duchess was saying consolingly. Now, everything is serviceable enough -- nice, adjective-laden descriptions, a metaphor here and there, but there's not a lot of creativity in the author's style.  After a while, it feels like reading a newspaper article.  The second problem is the plot.  The author was aiming for a kind of "Les Liasons Dangereuses," with lots of court intrigue and subtle positioning in the complex fight for political power.  But to pull that off, you really need some kind of mystery or subterfuge that keeps the reader guessing, or at least holds his/her interest.  There's really none of that in Swordspoint... the "court intrigue" is incredibly blunt, more like a daytime soap than a good movie 
 "Neo-Goth" is definantly not the right title for this compilation when there is only 5 actual GOTH bands on this release, most are EBM or Industrial bands. I am giving this 2 stars only because the actual Goth bands on this release are good (and even some of the Industrial tracks, even though they shouldn't be on such a misleading compilation). This is a very sad representation for all of the impressionable baby bats out there who pick up this "beginners" title, no wonder our scene is dying more so every day... 
 RELIC was great. This is a mess in which the characters make zero sense and the action is almost preordained.  The biggest fault lies not with the plot or the action but with characterization. There is no main character, just several with  varying degrees of visibility.  The story was never personal since it came from so many different directions.  A filthy rich man has 3 sons sired by 3 wives.  He raises them as many parents do - pushing, pushing, pushing around the clock. One lives beyond his means, another goes hippy with fake gurus while the third is steered away from his first love (dinosaurs) into the world of vetinary medicine. All men receive a summons to his house for an important announcement.  The house is empty save for a video - he has gone to die (cancer) and is buried "somewhere" in the world. Their mission - find his tomb and collect the treasure buried with him including an ancient Codex in Mayan containting cures from native plants.   So, using the oldest plot device in history, the chase, we plunge ahead.  The vet meets up with a feminist right out of the 70s, prickly, asserting the rights of womanhood every chance she gets. She's the type that screams sexual harassment over a swimsuit calendar. The sons split and search on their own but of course are reunited in (of all places) Honduras.  Along the way they are shot, attacked by Indians, soldiers, animals, insects, face starvation and non-stop rain.  It is never explaind how a single old man (with cancer yet) manages to transport a huge treasure all by himself but let's not get technical.    Needless to say a bad guy appears, a former partner who is an almost likeable sociopath. You can write the rest of the tale - they find the tomb, dad is still alive (don't ask), bad man shows up, gets killed and the kids divide the treasure and reconcile with repentant dad before he conveniently dies. Somewhere along the way, tough gal blurts out she is in love with the vet so they hook up and start translating the Codex for "humanity". Despite  this treasure trove of ancient wisdom, the average Mayan lifespan was less than 30 years - LOL 
 A rehash of old info - neither interesting nor compelling. Many other books on building your woodshop are considerably better 
 I bought the previous model of this dehydrator.  I seriously would not even give this machine 1 star, but there is no lower rating.  I bought mine a year ago, used it once, and the bottom heating element burned every single tray that I rotated to the bottom, which you have to do in order to get anywhere.  The entire machine was worthless within a week of me owning it.  I did eat the beef jerky, but that was the most expensive jerky I will ever make!  I called immediately to complain, talked to a guy named Saul, who said the unit must be defective, DUH! and he would send me a new unit and a return authorization.  I have gotten neither, I am just out the money.  I have called back, faxed, mailed, waited on hold, and finally decided that Ronco products are CRAP.  I will never give him or his company another cent.  Buyers please research your purchases, I see from other reviews that I am not the only one with a complaint.  Buy a different machine 
 Not quite a bible - no clear explanation of channels, layers, advanced methods.  Somewhat unfocused narrative.  Better title would be Basic Photoshop for Beginners 
 If you loved the Back to the Future trilogy and, generally speaking, time traveling extravaganzas on the silver screen... simply forget about buying this DVD. All being well it would make you feel like a total idiot for the first half of the movie, while you try to figure out all the "time-traveling science" you've been taught so far, then space you out close to the end, leaving you totally speechless. This is not good, simply because the producers and the writers probably went crazy themselves trying to emulate the real time-traveling pros, while winding up with some abrubt, nonsense end of the movie, with absolutely no sci-fi logic at all: they simply had to eventually stop shooting, so they just thought any happy ending would have done the trick, no matter the time differences and the numberless loose ends still untied in the plot. Not a sci-fi movie and not a romantic story either: look elsewhere for any of these two types of movie 
 The tracks are great.  Much better than the original versions.  But I can't (easily) rip this CD so that I can listen to it in my house.  Thus the product itself is useless.  I'd give this product a negative if I could 
 Lets get 1 fact out: IRON MAIDEN DOESNT CARE ANYMORE!!!  How can they be SO brilliant with # of the beast, Piece of Mind & PowerSlave & then put out 5 terrible records in a row starting with X-factor?  This record is soooo boring! I bought it based on Wickerman which I found to be OK, reminiscent of  the old Iron Maiden & then they just ran completely out of material. Track 2 on sounds exactly the same, long boring slow tunes that never end.. going track after track, album after album. Does "Dream of Mirrors" ever end? I cant ever tell.. I just lose my attention due to its such a GD drag. Then they hit me with "Thin Line" which is even less interesting than the most boring professor I had in the most boring class in my entire college career.   You cant listen to the original "Iron Maiden" release & then seriously listen to this new crap & release it, unless you just dont care. Obviously they dont CARE!! This record is TERRIBLE!  If they did care they would relisten to the first 6 or so & rethink thier efforts & either improve the sound or just end Iron Maiden & come out with a new band named "Too old, too tired!" & quit defiling the great name of "IRON MAIDEN" 
 I was incredibly dismayed when I saw this book at a bookstore yesterday, particularly because I love my own iPod so much. This book is the epitome of the dark side of the iPod craze -- people who know nothing about music suddenly trying to pretend they do. If you need this book, you should not own an iPod. Discover your own music, form your own opinions, and try to learn something on your own before you blindly follow some critic's dictate of what mainstream schlock you ought to fill up your trendy gadget with 
 This books hints of things to come, but never delivers.  The author sets up interesting relationships and situations, and then does nothing with them. A truly uninspired work.  
 I have only received the paper for 2 weeks. Where is it? why did it stop comin 
 Unrated Edition - Though some strange things happened, overall this movie was not very engaging -- the only thing that kept me from just turning it off was the possibility of Tara Reid taking her top off (which didn't happen) 
 Not are the recepies similar to each other, most of them are not very good. Grapefruit - excellent Rosmary - OK Tangerine Brandy - Ghastly Better books are available 
 the design of this product (that it is a backpack) is PERFECT for my husband's lunch at work, HOWEVER, it is too small for the two or three medium-sized gatorade bottles and lunch contents 
 This book is fine. However, the process in getting the book was horrible. I was done with my thesis defense by the time I got the book then you want me pay again. It took forever to get the book.....bad business. This was totally unacceptable 
 I thought this was a fun read some years back..well-written..hence my first inclination to give it 2 stars, but taking another look..if a man ever wrote about his "repulsion" over sex with an overweight woman, the way Robin describes sex with Michael, we'd be taking to the streets in protest...there was such an unkindness to it..and this was a woman with a dear, overweight friend...I'm changing my mind..back to one star..too much shallow emphasis on looks, money, etc..it's not a race thing..it makes all women look bad. Well, maybe just these women..I'd like to think some of us are different 
 This is a product of the lazy, latter-day Leonard who knows he's a great writer who can just sit back and let it flow. The onetime master of concision now takes a hundred-odd pages just to set things up.  Even his ear for dialogue has started to fade on him. Now everybody like, y'know, talks like, uhh, some kinda boob, get what I'm sayin'? The line of self-parody is lying a little too close in these pages.  He still has a hand with the quirky minor characters, though they can't carry an entire 350-page plus novel. But this one did make it clear to me why Leonard is so popular with the pomo crowd: his characters inhabit an utterly amoral universe, one with no values or standards whatsoever. Here, e.g., the protagonist is that well-known figure drawn from life, the friendly, easygoing loan shark. In your traditional crime novel--Chandler or either MacDonald can serve as examples--the action occurs against a hard-edged moral framework that is at least given lip service. Now I won't demand that every piece of fiction act as a morality play. But this was a case where I finished the thing, and kind of enjoyed the ride, but didn't like myself for it. In Leonard's recent novels, all that matters is who gets to take home the candy. And when you get right down to it, that just ain't enough. 
 I just did not like this book, it just did not have much of a point.  Even the usual witty repartee between Amelia and Emerson wasn't enough to salvage this book for me.  The whole plot seems pointless with Amelia and Emerson just meandering around Egypt's various famous archaeological sites.  As much as I hate to admit it, I really missed Ramses, and that whole England bit was far too boring.  Let's hope the next book redeems the series for me 
 Having seen the recent headlines regarding the conflict in the Middle East, I was looking for a book that would help me better understand the perspective of both sides and justification for each's actions.  This book fell far short of the mark, becoming quickly clear that the book was highly biased in support of Israel.  The book felt more like propaganda than literature.  I don't know the basis of the conflict.  I just want to understand both sides of the conflict, and that is why I bought and read the book.  However, the book quickly builds to an assumption that all Arab's and Arab Government entities in the Middle East are "Terrorist" in nature intent on killing Jews, but gives no explaination as to WHY they would want to kill Jews?  I am sure that both sides have some reasonable basis for their claims, but this book only tells the Jewish side of the story from a Jewish Studies Professor whose partents are Holocaust Survivors.  I was very disappointed in a book that implied objectivity, but seemed to only tell one side of the story.  
 After reading all the reviews this book had I was very surprise to see how terrible this book is.  Make sure not to buy this book I was very very disapointed, it is supposed to be for an intrudoctory level, but this book is way below that, the only person who should by this book is someone who has never used a computer.  This is very disapointing considerint other Sam publication. Botom Line DON BUY THIS BOO 
 This volume has just about all the wrong versions that are supposed to be extended long play club versions. Not to mention, it's almost all tracks that have been used on other volumes in the series. Track times:  1. last dance (5:53) (edit) 2. thank god it's friday (4:27) (7") 3. fame (5:17) (long version) 4. star wars theme (6:26) (not the 15 minute album version) 5. chase (4:23) (1985 REMIX) 6. Maniac (4:21) (very hot 7" remix) 7. breakin (4:36) (7") 8. disco inferno (6:29) (edit) 9. What a feelin (3:55) (1990s remix--this is actually the version used in the movie "The Full Monty") 10. More than a Woman (3:20) 11. If I Can't Have You (4:03) (clumsy extended version) 12. call me (3:31) (7" 
 Calling "The Truelove', whose story is primarily that of Clarissa Oakes, a woman who has been sexually abused from early girlhood until she boards Aubrey's ship [and, one might argue, until she leaves] a light hearted romp is misleading.  Hardly the first time this series has dealt with the impact of a woman on 'the wooden world' that Aubrey, Maturin and the ever changing cast of supporting characters inhabit, this time it shows everyone behaving in odd and surprising ways. Jack is thick headed and oblivious. Stephen, normally so clear-eyed, sends Clarissa, who admits not only to disliking children but to throwing an infant down a well, to stay with his wife and their newborn. Pullings throws off his sense of duty and is befuddled as well as bewitched.  Since Clarissa [like all O'Brian's 'strong' females] is really a man in a skirt [for a woman in uniform we have the aptly named Killick, in all his shrewish glory] she is far too flat, vague and undeveloped to carry such large portions of the plot with any measure of success.  This is definitely the worst book of the series and, sadly, in some ways not a good book at all. Not just because the plot is so out of place in this series, or even because characters you have grown to know start behaving in ways that are inexplicable, but because they have almost disappeared from the story to be replaced by someone you can't actually care about because she seems so fake 
 Deeply disappointing in quality and quantity for this Bryson fan. I order his titles automatically, but would have passed on this had I read the reviews first and realized it was a CARE puff piece  
 I found this book very confusing and the sections just don't match together. There are better books out there for sure 
 Yes, this a review about book 3, but in fairness to Sally Melville, there is a bit of background on why and how I got to book 3, and why I rated it one star. If you are seriously wondering if this book is for you, please be patient and read it all. This book is for some people, it has many great qualities, but it also has some serious drawbacks.  As a new knitter, I bought Sally's first book based on the reviews, and I loved it. The instructions and illustrations were excellent, and the patterns that could be made with just the knit stitch were surprisingly nice. Something I could see myself making and wearing.   I was disappointed with the patterns in book 2. Enough that I would not have bought book 3 if I hadn't ordered them together based on how great the first book was.   As soon as I put down book 2, feeling disappointed, I picked up the third book.  I was sure the designs would move away from the square, oversized  "I just learned how to knit" look.   I couldn't have been more wrong. The instructions and illustrations were, once again excellent, and for that reason I'm keeping the books.  Except for the shawls, and tea cozy, the patterns can only be described as hideous. I'll practice the knitting techniques in the books on squares with left over yarn, then find patterns somewhere else for things I wouldn't be afraid to be caught dead in.  In book 1 she says she is rushing to get the other books out, and it shows in the designs in books 2 and 3.  It's a shame that she does a fabulous job of teaching the "how to", then pairs it with a section of "oh I wouldn't want to do that"   Addendum 7/18/06  I was told that pictures in the book didn't do justice to the items when knitted, so I tried one. It does look *slightly* better, but still shapeless, and I won't wear it. I have to stick with my original rating.  A for instructions, Sally tops the chart here, but still F for the pattern designs.   I would highly recommend these, though, for a beginner who is having trouble following the instructions in other books. The Sally Melville series will have you knitting like a pro. Just buy some very cheap yarn to practice the garments on. After that, you'll have the skills, knowledge, and confidence to tackle a great looking patterns with better yarns.  
 The book was primarily a reprint of short quotes grouped together by subject. There was no summary information or analysis. I stopped reading half way through. Very boring 
 for the price its not bad, but as a watch you get what you pay for. The band felt fake, and the watch itself is too think for my taste. I ended up returning the watc 
 I've hardly ever been in a Wal-Mart.  Despite not liking to shop at Wal-Mart myself I don't have any stronger feelings against them than against other "big box" stores such as Home Depot, Target, K-Mart or Lowe's.  As far as I'm concerned they're all temples of materialism that blight the landscape and cause traffic jams.  So what's wrong with Wal-Mart in particular?  Bill Quinn, the curmudgeon author of this blog-like diatribe, relies on unnamed sources, data (some of it improbable) without references and lots of anecdotes that may or may not be true.  His redundant message is that the Bentonville blankety-blanks, as he repeatedly refers to Wal-Mart, possesses the (in)human characteristics of "evil" and "greed" and manages, apparently thorough some satanic process, to violate the laws of economics and simultaneously treat all employees, vendors AND customers like dirt and single handedly destroy small town America's utopia-like "mom and pop" main street commerce (whatever that meant in the 1990s after decades of Sears, K-Mart, etc.).  But every so-called shady or dirty tactic the author singles out to revile Wal-Mart with is practiced in some form by all aggressive, professional retailers.  And do so-called "mom and pop" stores always provide health insurance and pay more than minimum wage?  Hardly.  And if vendors and service suppliers lose money selling to Wal-Mart then 1) why did they sign the deal and 2) why are they selling to Wal-Mart more than once?  These complaints make no sense.  Quinn's suggestions for "fighting" Wal-Mart range from common sense (storekeepers update your business skills) to ineffective (letters to the editor) to improbable (running for political office).  This moonbat even suggests such retro-60s touches as forming a protest to chant (I'm not kidding here) "one, two, three, four, we don't want your lousy store."  Quinn is a fanatic.  He sums up by writing, "The long and the short of it for me is, I hate Wal-Mart."  And that, in essence, is all he says in 171 pages with lots of white space that reads like it was written over a long weekend and is six years out of date.  If you're a Wal-Mart hater you might enjoy this.  Otherwise save your money and fight Wal-Mart by spending the same amount on something fun at a "mom and pop" store.  Or from Wal-Mart or an Internet retailer, whichever you like, because in America we're not only free to say what we want but we're free to shop where we want.  No index, no references for many key assertions, no new information since 1999.  
 What is the weight of this product?  Am I paying for one ounce or one pound?  It's frustrating to be about to place an order and find vital info is missing.  Catherine in Yuma, A 
 Poorly written. Brutal content. Chinese portrayed as barbaric people with animalistic behavior. Lalu's father sells her to bandits knowing 50 men plan to gang rape her to death.Refers to how her dark skin lessens value. Lalu, 13, contemplates suicide as an honorable solution. The bandits draw lots to see who goes first. 43 is upset because she will be "mushy" by his turn. She is sold to a brothel, ends up in a saloon owned by Hong King,a cruel man who rapes and prostitutes her. Writing painfully too simple. After the first 100 pages, most of this book moves slowly like an amatuer biography written by a family member about grandma. A boring, brutal book written at a 1st grade level. Can be disturbing to those sensitive about children being raped 
 Mandelbrot has been pushing his fractals longer than most of us have been around. They might well describe the markets better than the CAPM but do they predict better is the key question? William Sharpe, who "invented" the CAPM, makes this very point on his home page. The CAPM captures risk and return, albeit imperfectly but what does Mandelbrot capture? Certainly not an audience as his theories will remain tangential until they have practical use. He wil always be at the frontier until his theory has a practical application, something for good and bad the CAPM has. The normal curve, is, with the lognormal distribution, the entry point to the world of heavy tails and quirkier distribtions and these are all used in markets world wide every day of the week; even the CAPM is widely used in corporate risk assessment. Ditto the imperfect Black Scholes model which allows us to predict, accurately enough for our purposes, the price of a European call, and thence a put etc etc. Although improvements have been have been made, it is like mother nature: unless the improvements give us better predictability, they are probably not worth the effort. Because the BS model gave us that predictability, it is widely used. Until Mandelbrot can do the same, his work will remain tangential at best, irrelevant at worst.   
 I didn't enjoy this book, even though I'm partial to sea stories.  There is not a single likable, admirable character in the book.  I don't think the author, Robert Stone, has spent much time sailing or knows much about the sea.  I would not recommend this book to anyone interested in reading sea stories.  Actually the sailing material does not play a large part in the plot and is not convincingly portrayed.  So what then is it about?  It seems to be about the misery of modern American life.  Stone wants his novel to be deep and epic but it is just depressing and dorky.  The symbolism and ideas are mostly shallow.  There's obscure religious undertones that made no sense to me.  The parent/child relationships portrayed in the book are utterly banal and ugly.  I found no humanity at all in any of the relationships.   And consider the title-"Outerbridge Reach."  Outerbridge Reach is supposed to be an area in New York Harbor where derelict boats lie (get the symbolism?).  But I think the author wanted to title his story "Outta Reach" and came up with this 'clever' twist on the title instead.  Basically what the book is about is how fulfillment, love, and happiness are outta reach.  If you like this kind of depressing thing, you'll love this book.   I don't and I didn't.  Having said all this, I must admit that I did read the entire novel which I don't usually do if I dislike a book.  The reason I read on is that Stone writes well and has an elegant and interesting prose style.  He knows how to skilfully pace a story.  It's a shame that his talent is wasted on such negative content 
 The essence of the book is "corporations behave badly".  I happen to agree but I don't need 339 pages to tell me this.  I was hoping to learn something here.  I was hoping for some history of how corporations developed.  Nothing of the kind.  Just a comparison to the gilded age (late 1800s) repeated throughout the book that is obvious to anyone who knows American history.  Those liberals who love to read long winded tirades that support their point of view may enjoy this book.  But if you aren't a liberal or if you are a liberal with a brain, this book will bore you to tears 
 It simply scares me to think that some who read this book will believe that what it says is true. While this theory of economic imperialism isn't technically impossible, it's the kind of idea better left to an ideological blog somewhere instead of a book purporting to be a true account. Books like this make the left look as naive and stupid as Ann Coulter books make the right look bigoted and, well, stupid. This is an incredibly implausible account, and books like this, claiming to be nonfiction, undermine good writing and reporting everywhere. Shame on the author and the publisher. The only redeeming quality of this book was that it contained a list of other books published by Berrett-Koehler, the contents of which make it obvious that BK is simly a peddler of 4th rate crackpot theories, all of which appear to be of the nonfiction variety. 
 That any reviewer can grant this book five stars, as some here have, boggles the mind.  I have to seriously ask them what books they read that they consider this one worthy of such a high rating.  Yes, the subject of the James boys is inherently fascinating and, yes, Ted Yeatman's research was extensive, which is worth one extra star, but as a writer he failed to present his material in an interesting fashion.  First, he is too much in love with facts and uses them whether they are necessary or not.  (I do not need to know, as just one example, the name of every insignificant Missouri militia outfit that ever marched in the same county as the James boys unless that name is relevant to them.  Footnotes would have been a better location if Yeatman felt compelled to include this arcane data.)  Another reason the narrative bogs down is that Yeatman failed to heed his word processor's grammar checker when it pointed out the thousands of passive sentences he wrote.  Or perhaps he had that feature turned off.  If so, he should flick it back on immediately.  Lastly, a good writer spins out a narrative that flows like water.  Yeatman's jumbled writing contains too many icebergs the reader must dodge or sink in the process.  I am not yet finished reading it and am not certain that I can continue to the end much as I want to learn about the James boys.  What a shame.  Bad writing made this book a great waste of the author's extensive knowledge.  I fail to understand why Cumberland House published this book without extensive editing or not publish it at all.  Obviously, they thought the subject material would carry it 
 I didn't purchase this shoe. I ordered two pairs of another Dr. Scholl's that day.You must have an error in the records 
 The unabridged edition has 25 CDs. To abridge down to four is ridiculous. The story jumps around so much that it is very hard to follow and keep the characters straight. I was left wondering what the story was about, having just heard the highlights, like reading Cliff notes instead of the book. I subsequently ordered the unabridged edition 
 India is starting to look more and more as the real cradle of civilization so flying machines might not be too far out there. Childress has a theory without proof then writes a whole chapter on it (anti-gravity). If Childress had a better grasp of science he might be on to something but so far he seems too open to alternative science, Orthodox science isn't perfect but disregard and misunderstanding of it isn't a way to build your case 
 Maybe not a bad source for an exepienced SQL programmer, but very frustrating for a beginner. There's no such thing as "generic SQL"; regretfully, it's vendor-specific and doesn't really comply ANSI stndards.. 
 Please read this book so you can expirience a real fraud and the snake oil seller this man really is.The books starts out interestingly enough and certainly captured my attention -I had already read his first book and Quantum Healing and thought of them as the real thing until I read this one. Its starts out as an interesting autobiography, goes into his "spiritual awakening" and once he has your attention he begins talking about the supernatural abilities the yogis have. He talks about how yogis can levitate, actually he says they have "levitating contests" -I'm not kidding- like a form of Olympics of levitation. What evidence does he show -non what so ever-. After this I realized what a quack this man is. He has a billion books, a "healing center" in San Diego -and it's not free or cheap- and a lot of people that buy his "self-help" advice that make him rich. I have to admit I believe in yoga and its unique health benefits but this man is using and abusing people to make himself rich. His autlandish claims of levitation contests through meditation and other things like that are just a pack of lies. Please don't waste your good money on a fraud like Deepak Chopra. 
 I had to read this book because of a school project. This was a terrible book. I hated it from the beginning because it had no plot, story line, or good characters. About halfway through the book, one of the main characters, Mando, just left. it didn't say where or why he left, but Scott O'Dell didn't bring him back in the book. I am a little glad because Mando was just a pain. But unfortuanatly, Zia stayed. She was in every scene and was very boring. If anyone wants to read it, then i hope this helps you... THROW IT AWAY!! 
 I like Eyewitness Guides a lot, particularly for their glossy graphics combined with comprehensive information, but this really doesn't make the cut.  How is it possible to cram Scotland into 224 pages? Well, it is not.  Besides having very poor coverage on Glasgow and particularly Edinburgh, it also has - well, more poor coverage.  Maps for the bigger islands in Northern Scotland are sorely lacking.  More effort has really got to be invested in making this guide before it is worth your money.  I know DK can make some really great guides, so it saddens me that they are now churning out trash like this 
 I have long considered myself a Christian with moderate theological views, standing between the extremes of both right wing fundamentalism and liberalism.  So when I saw this book on the shelf I looked forward to reading it.  Unfortunately Bawer's idea of a "fundamentalist" is anyone to the right of the notorious Bishop Spong.  Time and again he employs the "either/or" fallacy: either one is an enlightened, left-wing, revisonist, touchy-feely, creed-hating "Christian" or a naive, dim-witted Bible thumper.  Nowhere in Bawer's prejudice is there any sign of the tolerance he lambasts others for lacking.  Nor is there any mention of believers such as Tony Campolo, Jim Wallis, Luke Timothy Johnson or Ron Sider, who stand in the center of many political and theological issues. According to Bawer such individuals simply don't exist.  In addition he makes numerous false statments.  A glaring example in on page 40, where he claims that the doctrine of the substitutionary atonement was invented by Augustine in the fifth century.  He ignores Jesus' own statements  throughout the four gospels on the meaning of his death.    In fact he shamelessly employs a pick and choose approach to Christ which ignores anything the Lord said that doesn't fit his politically correct conception of the Saviour.  The result is a Jesus that resembles Alan Alda far more than the character portrayed in Scripture.  I could go into detail about these weaknesses, but to do so would simply be a repetition of prior reviewers.  Suffice it to say that those looking for a balanced treatment of Christian fundamentalism should look elsewhere.    
 This book is exactly that. I know Mr. Morehouse and one of the people he writes about in this book... my father, Mel Riley. All I can say is, you should read Paul Smith's accounts if you want the truth pertaining to the Stargate and RV stories. There is also a documentary, if you can find it, made be Discovery BBC called "The Real X-files" featuring a true and honest view of RV and it's history with the military and all those involved. Giving this book much more than 1 star is really admitting lack of intelligence.  
 The disapearance of USSR was terrible for Tom Clancy - it deprived Jack Ryan of real evil enemy so the author had to invent some new ones. After going through the Japanese and the Arabs he couldn't find nothing better than... vegetarians!!!  This whole book is a pathetic joke! Good Lord, when I think that once I actually DIDN't sleep for 48 hours because I couldn't stop reading "The Cardinal of Kremlin". Mr Clancy Sir  you were so great in the past - what happened? Now every next of your books is simply worse than the previous... And just to be clear - politically I am as much on the right (Republican) side than you, so this is not just the hostility of a political enemy but a sincere disappointment of a former fan Could you try to write something good once more? In memory of good old times? Please? 
 This has to be Stephen King's worst work adapted. This adaptation is even worse than Needful Things. Children Of The Corn (I am talking about the original and not the crappy sequels) was miles abouve better than this garbage. Just a stupid movie adapted from a lame book. Just plain trash 
 This was the first book I bought when I became interested in picture framing. Since then I have read many other books on the subject, met many professional picture framers, taken courses in the subject, joined the Professional Picture Framers Association, and basically learnt much much more about the subject. I CANNOT recommend this book to any one who is new to picture framing.  First, the information is scattered between many chapters, and is difficult to pull together.  Second, many very important topics receive very little coverage.  Third (the major problem for me): the author is first-and-foremost, a wood worker, and this is reflected in the book. Thus, there are many chapters discussing tools that most professional picture framers would never buy, methods that most professional picture framers would never use, inadequate discussion of conservation framing vs. non-conservation methods, mat cutting, etc.  If you are interested in making your own wood picture frames, this is the book for you.  If you are new to the subject or are interested in many of the other aspects of picture framing, you would be much better off with one or more books by David Logan, Vivian Kistler, or others 
 While I know that this book is considered by many to be a great classic, when I read it I literally had to force myself to finish this book over the course of a month, when normally it would have taken me a matter of days. The writing dragged on and on and on with little details and events I could have cared less about. The characters did not appeal to me, except for Claudia and ""SOILER"" she was killed off rather quickly, compared to the rest of the book. The only thing that attracted me to her was her determination and more ruthless personality than Lestat and Louis, who were, in my honest opinion, too effeminite for me to greatly like. I suppose the overall story is interesting, but it is so lost in a web of mind-numbing writing and weak characters that it was impossible for me to enjoy in any way. 
 The man died as he lived a loser. This uneducated thug was nothing more than a racist piece of crap. Plain and simple truth. The only praise he deserves is praise that he is dead. Thats one less racist thug off the streets. A two year old can write better music than he did. Heck calling his stuff music is an insult to music and musicians every wher 
 The fact is this guy does not give the most solid advice for directing.  He rips on Spielberg, and basicly calls martin scorsese a Hack.  He tells you that a good idea is to sleep with your producers to secure you job, just a lot of things that are not that helpfull.  He does have some good things to say, but you have to dig through so much crap that it's not really worth it.  There are plenty of other good books out there, and this would be one to pass on 
 I eagerly awaited this album, ever since hearing Mr. Mitchell sing in the Kiss Me Kate CD. His singing in Kiss Me Kate is unbelievably gorgeous, with his lustrous baritone nuancing every phrase and word. The singer on this CD is hardly recognizable as the same singer. The timbre of the voice is not the same, Mr. Mitchell is trying to sound like a lounge singer, not the magnificent Broadway star he is. I hope he does another album, the next time bringing to life great Broadway songs in the style of his Kiss Me Kate and Man Of La Mancha performances. 
 While I have found a couple of recipes in this cookbook that I enjoy, too many of them call for processed, preservative-laden ingredients.  Any cookbook that calls for using cream-of-whatever condensed soup in a recipe is one to be avoided 
 While I have earnestly hoarded many of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt series, Kurt Austin cannot measure up to his predecessor. Sadly, this is clearly the problem with Clive Cussler & Paul Kemprecos's "White Death." Kurt Austin's character comes across to the reader as a bland imitation of Dirk Pitt as Cussler recycles several of Pitt's phrases. Additionally, Joe Zavala, while not unlike Al Giordino (from the D.P series), is far to similar to Kurt Austin, and the impressive contrast, so commonly present between Dirk and Al is conspicuously absent in Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala. Like many of Clive Cussler's novels, the novel opens with a historical expostion- here it is of a Basque merchant fleeing from the Spanish inquisition. As expected, the narrative then chronicles a maritime disaster, and the plot continues as an effort to unravel both mysteries.   The Sea Sentinel, a ship painted with a garish combination of colours, while attempting to stop traditional whale-killing, unexpectedly veers from its course to ram a Danish coast-guard craft. Naturally, the two sink into the depths of the ocean, and equally expected is Kurt Austin's lucky intervention. Here, however, the reader is introduced to yet another insidious corporation in the form of "Oceanus," a company specialising in the creation of bio-fish, mutant fish that grow far faster and larger than the average salmon. Perhaps Oceanus is behind the collision?  While this may seem like a rollicking good read, the novelis sadly diminished by the incapability of the two main characters to carry the narrative, their bland, stereotyped characters and a rather cliched plot (in particular the ending). That Cussler or Kemprecos misspells "Hiram Yaeger," a stalwart of all Dirk Pitt texts as "Hiram Yeager" compounds this problem, and it seems almost as if the novel was rushed.  In conclusion, while superficially an involving and interesting read, "White Death: is unfortunately diminished by a stereotyped plot and one-dimensional characters spouting frequent cliche. Unlike the vast majority of Clive Cussler books, "White Death" is unfortunately an ultimately unsatisfactory read.  
 Despite coming up with possibly one of the greatest ideas of the 20th century, Byatt, in all her annoyingly feminist glory, has failed completely to construct anything which might in any way interest even the most inanely boring person on the face of the planet. Each and every character is lacking in charisma, humour and, in fact, any other attractive facet about their personality, offering the reader no interest or reason for empathy, thus leaving no hero, so necessary to such a story.    Then there's the sub-plot literature which was all, unfortunately, written by the woman herself. To interlink the text with poetry and letters is, admittedly a good idea, but the quality is dire. Could it be more pretentious to fill a book with sections that the author herself admits will not be read by most? And chapter 10...just too long. So unneccessary.    This is, without a doubt, the single worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read, and would recommend it to no-body other than those who consider suicide by boredom a good idea 
 This book has basically ruined my life. I no longer will hold to a man's standard just because he wrote a book about his personal experiences. Very old fashioned. This book does not apply to the general population of people who are Christian. This book is not recommended for people 21 and up. This is basically a childish, immature kind of book only meant for youths. Zero stars 
 As far as Cheap Trick cd's go this one is no where near the best, but I would say it is no where near the worst as well.  Underneath all the bad sounding 80's synths, is the heart of a pretty solid cd.  The songs themselves are not bad.  I know it sounds like a broken record (no pun intended), but I can think of no other band that suffered from lousy studio production more than Cheap Trick.  If you were to take away the overbearing 80'e synths, and other stupid 80's sounds, and just strip the cd down to its essentials, what you would have hear is a pretty cool power pop record.  It's Only Love I would say is one of the best song's from their 80's era (and it is the only song on here that escaped the synths and other useless sound effects and what-not).  Name of the Game, has the same drum sound as their version of Terry Reid's Speak Now, from their first album.  It is a song about how repetitive love is over time.  The people are different, but it is all the same, and it never really changes.    Having seen live concert video's from this era, you see how well these songs sound if it was just the band playing and no gimmicky production.  I heard a live version of It's Only Love, and when they hit the chrous close your eyes and you hear Nirvana.  It is what it is.  It is proof that if the band had the proper people on their label in place they never would have sank into the nether regions of the 80's.   Cheap Trick went back in the studio a few years ago with record producer Steve Albini, and re-recorded thier 2nd album In Color.  I think they should leave In Color alone, and Redo this album, only with Tom Petersson's 12 string bass giving it that much needed low end.  Some people might scoff, go ahead scoff.  I suggest if you can play guitar, learn these songs, play these songs, and then you tell me they are bad songs.  I would agree bad production, yep it sure is, but there is nothing on here as insipid as Wild Wild Women or Rock All Night.  Nothing against Jon Brant, good bass player, nice guy, but he brought nothing to the band musically.  I would really like to hear how this would have sounded with Petersson playing his 12 string monster on this.  What this album really lacks is a low end.  I think all post Tom Petersson cd's lacked that low end sound that he brought to the table.  That and he could write songs as well, which made his contribution to the band more vital then just being a mere "hired hand."  Re-record this straight-up raw live in the studio and I promise you the musically illiterate will sit down and shut up.  Oh, and their worst CD...Busted 
 I have read several of Hiaasen's books and loved them.  They were very funny.  This one is not.  It is an endless description of naked strippers.  I found the main character, Erin, to be very unappealing.  She is just so stupid.  Her problems are all of her own creation.  And she is not funny.  I think you have to be a man to like this book.  I, as a woman, just found it exceedingly boring.  I kept waiting for it to get funny.  It never did 
 This book sets out to tell that it was Jackie Kennedy's mother that instilled strength in her daughter. What she acctually did was instill a self-hatred. There is a great book called "Mrs. Kennedy: The Missing History of the Kennedy Years" by Barbara Leaming. In that book the author states repeatedly that her mother treated her older daughter horribly. Onassis's mother would tell her daughter that her hair was too kinky and she had big feet her eyes were too big, her hands were too big and that no man would marry her because she was so unattractive in every way. Her mother may have been saying these things to make sure her daughter would act wisely so she could land a man, but it is obvious that these taunts had a neg. effect on her daughter. Onassis thought that her marriage to JKF was a faliure because she believed his cheating was the result of all the neg. things she thought she was, all those neg. things her mother said she was. Jackie thought that she had to stick out the marrage because she was lucky to have found a man that could look past her "ugly" looks. Hopefully the readers of this book will not be suckered into believing that this woman, Janet A. was a great woman. She was cruel to many people. The only good thing I can say about the subject is that she is a prime example of how far woman have come in this society. From being raised as Janet A. was to "land a man" to finding fullfilment within and not through wealth and marraige 
 One has to admire Wittig for persisting. _The Lesbian Body_ is an extended love letter from one Amazon (not an Amazon.com!) to the woman she loves. The book can have an intermittently disconcerting fascination, and it is agreeably off putting, with first person pronouns divided up ("m/e" [and in the French version "j/e"]), presumeably to break down language false to the lesbian self and the experience of love the book wishes to embody. Moreover, the attraction of the narrator for her inamorata is not confined to anything like usual romantic palaver; it can derive from, say, sweat. It is often expressed in violence. "Under m/y frantic pressure your head becomes detached at the level of the cervical vertebrae." I guess this is love, if between consenting adults.  I don't find the new language _more_ satisfactory or illuminating; it is just different, for the sake being so, nor for me does feminizing the characters in the _Iliad,_ as _The Lesbian Body_ does, add to an understanding of them or make the stories alluded to more moving, entertaining, true, or, given the sketchiness of the references, much unlike what they were in Homer.  Interrupting the paeans of love, at apparently arbitrary points, are lists of body parts, often sounding like extracts from a medical textbook. "THE DORSALS THE ILIACS THE TERES THE QUADRATI." Is this the inevitability of the phsyical? Or a remaking of love in a way the outside, non-revolutionary world will or must find foreign?  The best that can be said about this experiment is that, like the writing of Gertrude Stein, it can shake the reader out of traditional ideas of fiction or writing and bust up stale social notions. By the last page, 165, I had had enough. It was actually more fun to write this review than to read the book 
 I used to make these during "kakelinna" (time in Norway when Christmas baking begins) with my "farmor" (paternal grandmother).  I still have my grandmother's old cast iron krumkake iron and after trying this one, I will never deviate from the traditional iron again.  Christmas baking in Norway isn't about making a lot and saving time, it's about family.  Although the older ones take longer (but taste better), it is a great time to reflect.  If you have the energy to use a traditional one, I recommend it...the cookies are temporary, memories are forever 
 Worked good for a few months.. then battery started draining fast.  Now after just 1 or 2 calls the battery is dead.  
 On page 198, Mark Fuhrman writes, "When I first decided to write this book [regarding the controversy surrounding Terri Schiavo], I felt that the one contribution I could make to this case was objectivity..."  This claim, at face value, is dubious at best. Fuhrman candidly admits that he got involved in this controversy at the request of Sean Hannity, of whom Fuhrman is a frequent guest.  Hannity was, of course, an outspoken supporter of the Schindlers and has had them as guests, along with Fuhrman, on Fox News' "Hannity and Colmes."  In reading the book, I found his "objectivity" to be anything but. In chapter 12, "Possible Scenarios," he offers six speculative theories as to the events that led to Terri Schiavo's collapse.  Each scenario makes Michael Schiavo look worse than the previous, although only the last one truly suggests criminality. After offering these theories, Fuhrman concludes the chapter with "One of the above scenarios describes within a certain range of accuracy what happened to Terri Schiavo. I wish I knew which one."  This seeming fairness on Fuhrman's part is belied by the book's closing paragraph. He plainly admits he can't know for certain what happened between Michael and Terri on the day of her collapse, but Fuhrman is inexplicably convinced that Schiavo is guilty of murdering his wife: "I am worried about the other Terri Schiavos out there, the ones we never hear about.  The women who die at that hands of their husbands or boyfriends...How many men have gotten away with murder?"  For someone who claims to "have no personal investment in any particular conclusion," he is very quick to accuse Michael Schiavo of murder. It is a shame, because some of his theories seem plausible to me, which is all that saves this book from a one-star rating.  I would have preferred to give it one and half stars, but that's not possible here.  Fuhrman's pretense of fairness aside,the book is remarkably dry.  There is no warmth or humor to be found in these pages.  This aspect, along with the lengthy discussions of biological processes (explanations of bulemia, various types of physical injuries and bone scans), make much of the book read like a medical text. Moreover, this consistent tepid tone throughout the book make his clarion call to save the "Terri Schiavos" out there seem insincere. His concern simply doesn't ring true. Particularly inconsistent with his comment stating that while he didn't like Michael Schiavo much, "that doesn't mean he killed his wife."  I hadn't planned to mention this, but it is impossible for me to consider Mark Fuhrman to be a credible source of information on anything. Here is a man who first gained notoriety when he was caught lying on the witness stand during the trial of O.J. Simpson. He claimed not to have used a certain racist epithet for the previous ten years, yet tape-recorded evidence proved otherwise. When tried for perjury for this incident, he pleaded "no contest." He is also one who invoked his rights against self-incrimination (Fifth Amendment) when asked if he had ever tampered with evidence during the trial of O.J. Simpson. It is mind boggling that this man should be taken seriously 
 I'm struggling through Shadow of the Giant. Normally when I read a book, I read the entire thing in as close to one sitting as possible. Giant is taking me a while - a chapter at a time, and I'm only halfway through after several months, and have no particular motivation to pick it up at any given point in time.   It reads like a plot outline, not a novel. Nearly every scene is "tell" and not "show." The characters are plot devices instead of real people. It just doesn't pull me in the way Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, and Ender's Shadow did. It's like reading through a textbook. "This happened, and this person did this, and that person did that, and here's why." With occasional bits of dialogue thrown in here and there that didn't necessarily show off the most important parts of the scene.  I don't think this should have been published as-is. It's a draft, not a finished novel. And considering just how long the draft was, when almost all of the scenes - written out properly - could've been 3-5 times their present lengths, this could've either been the outline for multiple books, or it needed a lot of pruning 
 I've purchased the original PCM encoded CD more than once because I enjoy this album so much.  I was happy to see this album release in surround sound but was disappointed by the lack of content and very disappointed with the fact that I still can't figure out how to fast-forward through songs on the 5.1 side of the disc.  Why would you disable that option?  I guess the people who made the disc had a lot of extra time on their hands from not having to add extra content to the CD.  The recording label obviously wants the quick income of reselling this album without having to put any effort into remixing it or adding content 
 Full of beautiful pictures and containing much helpful information, one would think that this book is the perfect resource for home gardening enthusiasts and hydrangea lovers.  However, the most important information for gardeners without a degree in horticulture is the USDA Hardiness zone.  In my opinion, without this information, the book is useless.  I had high hopes that this book would contain it all; I was sorely disappointed.   Keep searching unless you just want to add one more hydrangea book to your collection 
 Unbelieveably bad album from Osucka Papsmear  I kinda knew this would suck before I bought it but it was the only way I could get the proof of purchase seal for the Misfits 45 they put out through Misfits records. You look at Horror High's roster and you get Michale Graves,Zombeast,Calabrese etc,etc all great bands and then compare them to the garbage being put out by Misfits records and I really don't know how long Misfits records can survive because it's roster should resemble some of the talent on Horror High's roster instead we're getting garbage like this from some 40+ yr olds trying to sound like 20yr olds trying to sound like early Blink 182 or something. I think Jerry Only is surrounded by too many Yes men and I'm kinda dissapointed Marky Ramone lent his name and time to this abortion of a CD. "Sailor Moon","Astro Boy"...P*#! OFF!! Whatever happened to songs like "ASTRO ZOMBIES" that's what I wanna know. 
 In the attempts of the authors to provide an unbiased opinion of Organic foods, they created a book that seems to contradict itself.  The beginning starts good as it describes the Organic movement and helps to decipher Organic labels.  As you get further into the book, especially the chapter on dairy and milk you begin to get confused.  The book atempts to explain the different pesticides, hormones and residues in milk but leaves you more confused about what is acceptable and what is unpreventable.  The book completely lost me when it compared food items and tried to convince me that boxed Mac and Cheese with Yellow #5, Yellow #6 and tripolyphosphate was just as healthy as the organic version that did not contain anything artifically engineered.  You can decide for yourself but personally I felt this book was written by authors who felt the need to buy Organic foods was foolish and not worth it 
 This book doesn't exactly have an original premise; a West Point graduate named Philip Dru fights for the rights of the oppressed by overthrowing the American government and implementing a benevolent dictatorship (forgive the oxymoron) so as to correct the problems of society. Such a book, while shocking at first glance, is so common that rarely would I consider it worth reading. This one, however, comes with an interesting catch... it was written by none other than Edward House. The name might not ring a bell for most people, but Colonel Edward M. House was Woodrow Wilson's closest advisor during the first six years of his presidency, and as such this book yields amazing insights into the philosophical and personal character of a man who was one of the most powerful in the nation (and, for a brief period of time, in the world). For that alone it deserves to be read. It suffers, however, from House's own shortcomings as a writer. The prose is pedestrian, the dialogue cliched and trite, the narrative development utterly predictable (and often unrealistic), and the explanations and analysis given to major problems of the day simplistic and absurd. Indeed, it is amazing that a man of Wilson's great intellect and brilliant insights would have ever associated with, much less trusted, someone who could write something so poor. The fact that Wilson was one of our greatest presidents is a wonder, given the content of this book; aside from its historical significance, it has no redeeming value. 
 I had high hopes for this one and ended up pretty disappointed. Yes, the writing is wonderful, and I enjoyed the gradual unfolding of the walking tour--it's the only thing that kept me reading, actually. But Susan's  apocalyptic near future is too mysterious. So is the reason she is only now  trying to figure out what happened during her parents' trip. You can't help  expecting that there is going to be some link--even only  psychologically--between this trip gone wrong and the world gone wrong that  Susan lives in--but no, there doesn't seem to be. We don't even know what  happened to the surviving two members of this foursome after the trip. Nor  do we have any idea who Susan is or how she changed because of what  happened. I also disliked nearly all the walking tour participants.  Ruth--blah, Bobby--yuck, Brenda--awful. And while Carole intrigued me, I  was never convinced of her supposed instability except for the very bizarre  postcards she sent to the poor 13-year-old Susan. In the accounts of the  trip itself, she often seemed like the most understandable member of the  group. And then Monkey--who was he, so menacing and perceptive and  intrusive. And in the end, apparently an artist as great as Carole, as  well. All in all I think it could have been a better read if Davis had  provided just a bit more of a foothold in Susan's world 
 okay. has historical relevance as a memoir of an Afrikaaner boy growing up in S. Africa. 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 The majority of this book is empty exposition.  People move about meaningless lives without purpose.  The "protagonist" merely drifts through a life which offers him a potential to engage at every turn, which he either doesn't recognize, actively avoids.  When he IS finally forced to take action, the plot is cliche, but you figure, you hope, you PRAY that it will be redeemed by something in the end.  Meanwhile you've got an antagonist that was lifted almost directly from The Karate Kid.  The "twist" ending never validates a single one of the pages you've wasted your life reading, and ultimately adds up to a useless stack of paper with no soul or meaning.  True Story: The moment I finished reading this book, I stood up, strolled across the lunchroom, and threw it into the garbage can, so no one would ever need waste brain cells on its pages again.  I hate Ransom like I hate Illinois Nazis.  Read ANYTHING else 
 As one of the Co-Founders and former Director of Guatemalan Operations for PlanetOutreach, I discovered this book was published after leaving PlanetOutreach in 2002. The author was misinformed about how our internet cafe / telecenter was actually launched and who was involved in making it happen. In fact, the author made it seem that PlanetOutreach was a project of eBay and it certainly was not, although we did receive a grant from their foundation to make it happen. Persons mentioned as being a significant part of this project came down to San Pedro to visit only; from a few days (Meg W.and Henry G.- to take a tour of the village and project) to three weeks (Griffin - who helped with painting bookshelves only). Naturally, I was stunned to see credit given to people when they played a very small role (if any!) versus the four us who founded it (Karina, Ron, Debbie and me). Naturally, I was disappointed to see how the author chose to innacurately profile this innovative enterprise.  Two of the first employees I hired and trained, Mary and Otto,  continue to stay in touch with me through email. In fact, Otto, the first employee of PlanetOutreach, and Cata, his wife, gave birth to their first daughter in 2005 and named her after me; I saw her in Sept 2005 and she's beautiful! 
 the plot is a little bit superficial and has, like the film industry, not really some depth to think about. it's a discworld book with all this nice highlights of writing style but as the main red line is not a very interesting one to me, i find this book one of the lower quality discworld ones... if you are a discworld fan, then it's of course for you, but if you are looking for a first discworld book, then make sure it's not this but instead e.g. Small Gods or Monstrous Regiment or Pyramid 
 I too really enjoyed the first two books in this series and was saving this installment as one I was sure to love. But I had to skim the last 100 or so pages because I knew how it was going to turn out and the dialog wasn't fun or enjoyable to me. It may be true that Randall and Emma are true to life, but they're just not people I wanted to spend anymore time with. It's too often that teasing is confused with bulling and I think that Randal in particular was abusive and domineering towards the end, with the excuse of he's the cop so it's Ok.  Authority figures are tough to portray well, but authors can write characters as roll models. When there are those ideal authority figures, children can be children and that's very dimensional and rich. For Randal to be the love interest and not be nice to Molly is just un-excusable. And for Emma to be un-parented and friend to Molly is un-healthy 
 nicolas cage is good as the wierd lonner type roles and has an oscar to prove it. however this role calls for more than that you have to be a  straght arrow and he isn't. not one good part to this film. i was looking at my watch 5 mins. into this mess. tommy lee jones must have needed the money so i can forget his less than 100 % try as nicks trainner and commander. what a waste of tim 
 the content was fascinating and definately worth reading in hard copy form, but the audio c/d was a nightmare.  The narrator must have been hiring the recording studio by the minute because he read at a breakneck pace.  At first it was acceptable , but soon became difficult to follow then tedious and annoying.  The speed of the reading allowed for no digestion or comprehension of points , and soon was down right frustrating. As a consequence the second and third c/d's were almost a waste of time, I doubt if i could force myself to listen to it again, unless there was a way of play back at half speed. 
 If you're looking for an album of Bee Gees covers by an orchestra with an indistinguishable voice singing behind it then this album is the one for you. The mix is atrocious, virtually the only time you can hear Robin's voice clearly is when he's speaking at the beginning of the songs. This has to be the most disappointing album I've bought in a long time. I was looking forward to this album as I was interested in hearing Robin's versions of the Bee Gees songs originally sung by Barry, but I can make no judgement as I couldn't hear Robin on any of those tracks. The best example to try on the sampler is Night Fever; I could hardly hear Robin at all above the din from the orchestra (particularly the drums). In fact I had to listen to the track twice to actually confirm to myself that he was on it 
 This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only thing it had going for it was Tom Clancy's name in the TITLE! Their idea of technology 20 years from now is like "Back to the Future" on steriods. They used cheap gimicks like refering to "Star Wars 7" and an online court. They didn't even get many of the technological terms right! The acting was worse than daytime soap operas. The plot was nonexistant. The only good thing was the quality of the explosions. They were done well, but they were every five minutes... This is pure fantasy and anyone who has reached puberty won't buy it. This isn't a Tom Clancy flick. It is pure rubbish 
 - Bentley's 'Programming Pearls' offers many programming techniques and design principles. - But the text assumes that the reader is *extremely* familiar with C-style syntax and many advanced computer science concepts.  While Bentley emphasizes important fundamentals, his language is rather esoteric.  I bought this book because Steve McConnell ('Code Complete' author) recommends it for 'beginner' developers at his company (Construx Software); but I encourage 'beginner' developers (and even senior developers) to look elsewhere.  This book is meant for computer science graduate students. It incorporates more advanced math and more advanced computer science techniques than the average software developer will ever encounter.  Most of 'Programming Pearls' was penned before the widespread use of object-oriented programming; so Bentley heavily emphasizes code tuning. In today's world, most .NET and J2EE developers are likely to find greater efficiencies within their architectural design.  - Developers who need to either learn or revisit important fundamentals should read Steve McConnell's 'Code Complete' 
 Having just read the John Hammond bio that I purchased at the same time, I was not as impressed with this book. Even though I am familiar with many of the artists, it just didn't hold my interest that well. The author did seem to know his material, though. I just saw Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young again this summer. I wonder how they feel about each other now with so much gone on in decades before! It's a wonder more of these people didn't die of drug overdoses or std's! If you want an uplifting experience, this isn't for you 
 "Leaving Reality Behind.." is a myopic and biased account of a subject that just isn't that interesting.  Unless you were one of the eToys.com employees or one of the 'cutting-edge European artists' of etoy, the 'Toywar' was quite simply a non-event for the rest of the planet.  In essence, the authors (who clearly are sided and likely involved with the etoy camp) are trying to dress up a relatively trivial legal dispute over a domain name that is now about three years old.  Why is this interesting??  Throw another 'yet-another-dotcom-story' on the pile 
 The original Julie and Romeo was delightful. This book was utter nonsense.  A great disapointment. Finished reading it only to find out if it might get better as you went along. It Didn't 
 "If a nut on the wall is a walnut, what is a nut in the bathroom?  A pee can."  "Why did the baby cross the road?  She was stapled to the chicken."  Billing itself as "the mother of all joke books", The Jokelopedia has the apparent goal of turning your child (or grandchild, etc.) into a comedian.  Categorized by subject matter such as a monster jokes, classroom distractions, family funnies, etc., the book contains riddles, jokes, cartoons, and tips from famous comedians.  Many of the riddles have pun-ch lines consisting of puns:  some that I consider funny, and many of which adults will consider groaners, but will get a lot of giggles from 8 year-olds.    Although I tend to like puns more than the average person, as a practitioner of non-violent communication, I don't recommend giving this book to children.  I am concerned that roughly up to 10 to 20% of the laughs come at the expense of becoming desensitized to the suffering of animals and humans.  For example, there's a joke about a woman who buys a parrot, and to get the bird to talk, she buys a mirror, a ladder, a bell, etc.  She goes back to the store and reports that the parrot died.  The clerk expresses his sorrow over her loss and asks if the parrot ever said anything to her.  The woman replied that just prior to dying, the parrot said, "Doesn't that store carry any food?"  So the joke is that the parrot starved to death because the woman was too stupid to buy food in addition to all the accessories.  There are riddles that have punch lines at the expense of animal suffering, for example, "What's black and white and flat? A panda that's been run over."  And the tacky frog in a blender joke, mentioned by a previous reviewer, could give a child the idea to actually try this (likely very few children but it's possible).  Although much of the egregiously tacky material is in the "Snot funny" section, there is some in other sections of the book.  Another reason I don't recommend the Jokelopedia is because of the practical joke recommendations.  The child who tries out these suggestions will probably think he or she is being funny, but those laughs come at the expense of being rude and crude to other people, and insensitive to their feelings.  For example, one of their slumber-party jokes is to pour cold water over the shower curtain rod on someone using the shower.  Another is to put another child's hand in a glass of warm water to get him or her to wet the bed.  Yet another is to put some fake plastic vomit in the sink.  One of the elevator practical jokes is to bet the other passengers that you can fit a quarter in your nose.  Yuck.  Another joke encourages lying:  "Tell [your big sister] that one of her friends called (for this to work, be specific--use the real name of someone your sibling is close to and say one of the coolest kids in school is having a party tonight, but you can't remember all the details."  In case your budding comedian runs out of practical ideas to play on siblings and parents (yes, a parental practical joke idea involving the kitchen sink sprayer is provided--don't say you weren't warned!), there are five suggestions for tormenting the pizza guy.  One could, as another reviewer did, rip out some of the pages prior to giving the book to a child, or perhaps cross out portions with a thick dark marker like it's a government document.  (But if you rip out the page of slumber party practical jokes, the blurb on Lucille Ball is on the other side.)   Had I received this book as a child with pages ripped out, I would have been extremely curious about what was missing and sought out another copy!  Unless the authors write a new edition that takes out the practical and insensitive to suffering jokes, I don't recommend rewarding them by purchasing this book.  That's unfortunate, because I think some of the puns are very clever, and encourage children to have fun with the language. 
 The suggestions in his book are misleading.  Not for the motivated young people who want to make a difference in the world.  No one can argue with his conclusions about workaholics.  However, no one is going to achieve much success with a goal of living and raising a family on $6000 a year. I read his book in about 3 hours - really a waste of time as far as practical advice is concerned 
 Never seen the band live but this CD is a big disappointment. The sound is a low budget version of Santana / Los Lonely Boys. The songs are lame and way too commercial.  Hope their next album turns out to be better (a lot) 
 What a disappointment to come across this chronicle of a religious delusion by such a bright and promising ufologist. The Case for NASA UFOS dvd was awe inspiring, and David's analysis and passionate emphasis on the reality of ufos is excellent.  I was a bit shocked to see that he wrote this book premised upon the visitation of a non-existent fictional person such as "Jesus Christ", who symbolizes the binding of earth humans to the wheel of ignorance and superstitious belief.  I recommend that everyone read "Star Wisdom" by Gene Andrade for a primer, "The Talmud of Immanuel" concerning the earthly prophet Immanuel who's mission here was fictionalized and distorted and falsely represented in the contrived "Jesus Christ" myth, and to further investigate the "Meier Contacts" for more specific information and solid evidence ([...]) 
 Seems much more about cognitive therapy than behavioral.  I'm familiar with Linehan's model which seems, to me, truer to the behavioral paradigm of holding your thoughts, beliefs, and feelings while acting differently.  Linehan puts the dialectic between behaviors and private experience in the Buddhist sense of "walking with both things together."  The dialectic for Marra is between "hopelessness and hopefullness," "safety and freedom," "despair and inspiration," and "resignation and initiative" (to take a few examples from the book).  I think this misses the point entirely.  Whether you're looking for self-help or materials to assist with your clinical practice, check out some of the materials from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (Steven Hayes, Kelly Wilson, Kirk Strosaahl, etc.) or Linehan's workbook for DBT with BPD (you don't need Borderline Personality D/O to benefit from her fabulous work).    
 "They say that there are millions of alternate life pathways, that each and every one of us generates a new path and alternate persona with every choice we make."  Then why does this book cover the exact same ground covered on the television show?  Others have commented on the lazy editing and sloppy proof reading, so I will not delve into them here again, but they are there and distracting to the overall reading experience.    But these are minor, not because they are unimportant, but rather because the story they are obscuring is barely worth reading.  Killing Tara was a stupid concept and one that the writers of Buffy have been justly ridiculed for (not to mention the 15% drop in ratings after she was killed), this book compounds that sin ten-fold by suggesting that this is the only way it could have occurred; Tara dead, Willow insane and evil, a triple out straight out of the "Celluloid Closet".  This book is another bit of kindling on the funeral pyre of the positive portrayals of gays and lesbians in the media.    I feel sorry for the teen or pre-teen lesbian that picks up this book looking for an "alternate life pathway" for Tara and Willow only to see the same death, murder and insanity that faces all gays in the Buffy-universe.  Beyond the issues of clich√©s (and there are more than just a few in this book) there is issue of story. It always comes back to the story the authors and auteur will claim. Well in that case the story is resoundingly poor.  It is a thinly stretched idea from the "wouldn't that be cool" school of thought. Great, if you are Beavis or Butthead, but most readers demand and deserve more.  This is thread-bare idea stretched over three books. So I guess quantity is better than quality here.  Plot points not ripped off of the TV show (which had no business seeing the light of day in the first place) are simply repeated over and over (Oh! Willow is draining more dark magic! Oh no Buffy tries to reason with her and can't stop her!)  In the end I wanted Willow to destroy the world so we could be done with this, but alas all bad news comes in threes and so does this dreck. 
 For the life of me, I can't figure out why so many readers give this book glowing reviews.  I found it boring in the extreme.  I guess you need to be a real "neural network" fan to enjoy this type of writing. For me this tome is overworked and overly pedantic.    The basic premise is a good one (and could have been wrapped in a much better story), but the plot fails to get going at a pace that would keep even the most jaded "computer drama" fan entertained or interested. Characters are not fully fleshed out and the story arc self-terminates in many places.  I really had a hard time getting through this, not because I'm dull-witted but because I found it far too overcooked and "clever" for my tastes. Even though it was written in first person, I've never read a novel where the writer is so clearly self-involved.  As well, the devisive over-use of initials instead of proper names was irritating in the extreme and somewhat juvenile. OK, so the "author within the author" doesn't want to use names.  Make up something to at least give the character a face!   All in all:  a very tedious read. Save your money 
 This is one of the most boring books I have ever read in my life!! It was so anticlimatic, which was even more disappointing since I had to force myself to the end hoping something would finally happen!! The author doesn't do a good job with the relationships surrounding the man character Hannah and therefore falls totally short to engross the reader to even care what ultimately ends up happening to her.  It was a total waste of my time and my money 
 Merleau-Ponty's work is nothing less than a classic, one of the great works of philosophy in the 20th century. It should go without saying, then, that this work should be made available in an up-to-date and scholarly translation.  	Unfortunately, this is what Routledge has refused to do. Not only does this "new" edition maintain all of the known mistakes and inconsistencies of the original translation (most of which were not corrected when the translation was revised twenty years ago), but it also introduces literally dozens of type-setting errors. In addition to all of the obvious mistakes in punctuation and spelling (e.g., "intelfection" on p. xx; "in a world" instead of "in a word" on p. 129; "deralizes" for "derealizes" on p. 140; "writes" for "writers," p. 163; "Rinswanger" for "Binswanger," note 6, p. 185, and the list goes on and on), you will also encounter such lovely gems as "Bergson's inferiority" (instead of "interiority", p. 67) and "adduction" transformed into "abduction" -- when distinguishing between the two is precisely the point of Merleau-Ponty's discussion (p. 243). In short, an already flawed translation has now been bungled into a bloody mess. If you are reading this book for the first time, you would be well-advised to check the used bookstores for a copy of the earlier edition. If you are trying to use this text with students, lots of luck to you! 	It is also worth mentioning that Routledge has again failed to include a translation of Merleau-Ponty's original table of contents in this edition, so that many English readers are still unaware that he provided a detailed outline of the entire text to guide the reader. A translation by Daniel Guerriere is available in the Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology 10, no. 1 (1979) - although, of course, the page numbers no longer correspond to this "new" edition. 
 I knew that this concert DVD was an acoustic show so I wasn't surprised that the tempo was slow at the beginning. But to start the show with Gilmour tuning his guitar was a bit much.   Once he did start playing, Gilmour was having such a hard time finding his rhythm that I found myself praying for the drums to kick in.   By the time things settle down, the really glaring problem with this DVD comes to the surface. The mix is horrible. The crowd noise drowns out Gilmour at times when they cheer a song they recognize, he is almost inaudible when talking between songs and at many points the backup singers completely cancel him out. I found myself constantly adjusting the volume which really takes away from the "concert experience".  There are high points in the show, but the low points are rock bottom. Comfortably Numb is a song that millions of people know by heart. Two versions are provided on this DVD - from the concert and in the bonus section. Neither of the guest singers (Robert Hewitt and Sir Bob Geldoff) know the words, have to read from sheet music and based on their phrasing have never heard the song before. Gilmour would have been better off asking for a volunteer from the audience.   The very best thing on this DVD is, oddly enough, in the bonus section. Screamin' Jay Hawkins' I Put a Spell on You, a blues standard performed with Mica Paris and Jools Holland, almost makes the DVD worth buying. Almost.   Watch Jonathan Demme's beautiful treatment of Neil Young: Heart of Gold if you really want to see a great acoustic show. That is the gold standard. 
 I was beyond disappionted with this book.  The "myths" the title refers to are nothing but trivia, and many are "trivial" Beatles trivia at best. There are absolutely no revelations or new facts here.  It is also full of errors and inaccuracies.  The authors approach this book with arrogance, condescension, and a lot of snideness.  I'm very sorry I threw away almost $20 on this 
 There was enough redemption and entertainment in the first 2 books to have me reading the third, but what a way for Sinjun to go!  I liked Sinjun, I liked Colin, the Scottish adventure and running away from the overprotective brothers is great... So why does our Strong and Manly hero have to ruin it all by subjugating the eager and talented Sinjun to HORRIBLE sex.  And later in the book when Sinjun decides to "let" her husband hurt her, it's DISGUSTING.  Having a man force sex on a woman is NOT romantic!  Rewrite the book to take out the rape and I would love it 
 I bought this for my baby who, at 6 months was barely 16 lbs. She didn't hit the 20lb mark until she was past 18 months old, so she was rear facing for a long time. She loved kicking this but the mirror never worked well, I could adjust it and within a day or two it was all over and I couldn't see my baby again. The water seemed to evaporate and now just over a year later has hardly any water in it. We can't find any leaks but there's little water. The little fish inside stuck together right away and we could never get them back apart. Sadly we just gave up on it by her first birthday. It never worked for us as a mirror to see her and the toy part, while it was fun to kick at, was just worthless. My sister in law wanted one for my niece but I am glad she saw how worthless mine was before wasting her money on this 
   I've seen MIB I numerous times.  What I'm trying to find out is this....what was the name of the song that Tommy Lee Jones had on 8-track? I know it was by Elvis, but I cannot figure out the name of the song.  Any help out there 
 True or not, I can't help feeling that ANGELA'S ASHES has destroyed a generation of Irish/American writers (or any writer wanting to write in the field).  Not to say that CARRY ME DOWN is ANGELA'S ASHES all over again, but I can feel its ghosts tucked between Hyland's spare, plain, beautiful, yet graphic writing style.    Haunting is a word that will pop up time and again as you read the book, and it is a haunted book to be sure. The last time I actually got this involved with a character and their moods and feelings was with Will Perry in Phillip Pullman's A SUBTLE KNIFE, so, why the low score when all it seems I have nothing but praise and teaspoons of surgar for this novel... well, there are some problems.  As good as the prose is, it still comes across like a play with all the stage directions wedged into the story trying to pass itself off as legitimate fiction - it's not.  Everything is stark, sharp and literal.  Cup. Table. Chair. Fireplace - you name it, it all reads flat on the page and never sticks in your mind.  Some of the ideas do.  The subplot about being a human lie detector, the struggling and desperate end to a marriage and the breaking of the family unit, it's all done very well.  But then there are the triggers and emotional landmines that cheapen the deal.  The fate of the kittens being the most grevious, and sore thumbed.  It's a brutal scene, and pulls at your heart - not because it's so well written, but because it's murder most foul, plain and simple.  I could ring tears out of that scene in any novel, no matter the subject, so when I read it here it really felt like a scene Hyland had floating around in a journal that got transplated into this novel.  And while the dialogue was well written, and often sharp, it tends to sound flat inside your head.  Almost like you've walked into the 1,000 performance of a play, and the actors hearts are tired of the material - it's colorless, humourless and dry... but still compelling in its decay.  It's a tough novel, one that I wanted to love every time I turned the page, but by the last page I simply could not love it as a novel, but could find some heart for the process and art of it trying to be a novel.  CARRY ME DOWN comes across like a work in progress, much like its lead character, and as he develops we hope the novel will as well, but it never does.    It ends without ending, much like life itself 
 I must be the only one who didn't like this book.  I felt it was written in a one-tone, endless stream of the bad events and bad people in her life.  Not one good thing or good person.  Didn't pack any emotional wallop because she didn't seem to react to the bad things that happened to her.  Now maybe she had to be that way in order to survive, but it didn't make for interesting reading.  It was hard to sympathize with her because she had no reaction herself to all these traumas.  It's unbelievable that she and her sister turned out as well as they did, but I found myself not caring about them and therefore, not caring about this book 
 Grandmothers who buy this book for their own children's children are simply demonstrating their own lack of parenting ability.  I think this book body-slams Mom every chance it gets!  It also encourages children in the formative years to just ignore Mom and go with that fun-loving granny, no matter how important Mom's advice is to her growing daughter.  Any good granny should know, (except for the narcissistic ones who will purchase this book) that supporting Mom and backing her up is more important than being hip and wild.  All grannies who think about purchasing this book should step back about forty years and put themselves in the place of Mom, and then place the book in the hands of her own mother-in-law giving it to her daughter!    Mother-in-laws beware...if you don't want to enrage your daughter-in-law, choose another book! It's a shame because the idea is cute, but the delivery is point after point of parent bashing 
 jessica lange won an oscar for this, proof positive that some years are so bereft of strong performances, they HAVE to give it to somebody. apart from that, this is a silly exercise in anti-government paranoia, with a wasted tommy lee jones and not much else. 
 Don't bother.  Just don't bother.  It's sad to see 
 I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick. 
  Unfortunately, not as good as I hoped and not what it promised to be.   Plus, he was arrested for burning an American flag at a college campus - after all that he's done and what has been done for him.   Very unfortunate. 
 Remember the Farrar that belted out "On liquor I spend my last dime!!".. Well, that person is long gone and replaced by a whiney, nasal-sounding drone with little range and very little creativity. Okemah was a pretty darn good album and certainly better than most of his 'solo' material but this latest is dull and pointless with weak melodies and even worse lyrical content. 
 Pathetic was more the adjective that came to mind as I read this terribly written book. Yale Divinity grad? Other "advanced" degrees? Oh, dear. For all her supposed knowledge I didn't find her very enlightened. I give her 1 star for writing and publishing a book, (non-fiction?????hhhmmmm....) because that's more than I've ever done. So what message to the author do I have? That "class" is not defined by someone who listens to opera (one of her clients) and that knowledge obviously does not guarantee wisdom. The pathetic aspect of this tale was although she tried very hard to justify her reasons for prostitution, I cringed each time she indicated how happy, (smug??) she was because someone desired HER enough to pay $200 an hr. Wait. I thought she just finished telling us that men are pigs. IF this is a true story I feel sorry for her. And how old is Scuzzy by the end of the book anyway??? Fast forward and suddenly she's married I think with kids etc. True Confessions mags are more scintillating....when you're 13,  not to mention possibly better written. One final note to author. Yes, I am sure. No, I would not do this to make $. Not because of being a prude morally but because of all the yuk factor out there. Geez, I wear gloves in my profession to draw blood on sweet little old ladies and children. No way strangers' body parts are going into me no matter how much $$ is on the table. YUK. But for others, well like her Pakistani client, ooops I mean lover....oops I mean pig/client, 'whatever. 
 I would strongly advise against purchasing this item.  I just bought one and spent nearly five hours trying to get it working.  That includes 1.5 hours on the phone with a Linksys representative.  When he said I had to reformat my hard drive, I terminated that conversation.  Then I tried email support.  After following two or three links they sent me, which essentially had me repeat what I had done over the phone, I gave up.  Then I got a call from Linksys and spent another 45 minutes with a representative.  In the end he said he couldn't make it work on my computer and I should return the item.  I have used this same computer with a "generic" USB wifi stick for over a year.  After the representative gave up, I borrowed a D-Link wifi and installed it without any problem.   
 I thought this was the MOST boring book I've ever read! I hated it and about 1/3 of the way through I quit reading it 
 Easily the worst textbook I encountered during my undergraduate years.  Unfocused, sparse, and almost completely lacking example problems.  Riggs touches briefly on lots of topics and treats none of them completely, leaving the reader lacking any notion of how process control actually works in real life.  I'm not a big fan of the book by Seborg et al. either, but if you have to choose between the two, go with Seborg 
 If you wish to believe you are permanently damaged, and blameless, and wish to stay damaged: This book is for you. Ms Miller's thesis is  that all of us have been damaged by our parents and we can never overcome that damage and loss of potential. While I am aware, after years as a psychotherapist, that some parents are genuinely abusive, I am also aware that maturity is transcending ones childhood and becoming whole. For some maturity is too much emotional work and they choose to remain damaged, blameless and whining victims. Their choice. Ms Miller further infuriates me by maintaining all children were abused and those believing they had a happy childhood are in denial, dellusional. This book offends me, as a psychotherapist, as a parent and as a mature adult who needs not be a victim of childhood. I suggest instead the Wolins book on Resiliency. And stop whining!!!! 
 This book is not good at all FOR STUDENTS. The organization is confusing and mathematics used to derive the equation does not show any physical meaning. Examples given are confusing and misleading. Avoid this book at  any cost 
 I think this book must be able to hit someone well. I think if your just starting out, Christian and sort of interested in unschooling this might be a good book for you. Unfortunatly for me I have been homeschooling awhile and found this book a waste of my time. I don't like how they tell you to be wary of curriculum companies and people trying to sell you things but in the next sentence they are pushing "their way" on you. A little two faced for me. But I did walk away with some good information so it wasn't a total waste. I have read worse books on homeschooling that is for sure 
 I purchased this humidifier, and it worked wonderfully with a soothing blue night light for my son for about a week. One night, it just stopped producing that humidifying mist and could not be coaxed into working again. I called the company, who told me to promptly cut the cord and throw it out, and they would be sending a new one to replace it (with no cost for shipping to me). I received the new one a week later, which to my disappointment, did not have the nightlight feature. I also noticed it was from a different brand company. I can't remember the name but it also began with the word "sun." So far, the new humidifier is working fine (about 2 weeks now), but it has a lower water capacity so I have to refill it every night (vs. every 2 nights with the original one) and the lack of the nightlight is a big disappointment. The process of replacing, however, was very smooth and also free so I'll give them 2 stars for that 
 One of the greatest video game fighters in history, excluding Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter's popularity eventually produced excitment for a feature film, even starring Jean Claude.  The result, a bomb.  Fortunately, Street Fighter is not even as bad as the 2nd Mortal Kombat movie, but it is still pretty poor.  I have tried really really hard to enjoy this movie, especially since just about all the Street Fighter characters are in the film and stay fairly close to their video game identities, but the ridiculousy dumb humor, crappy acting, and lack of any good-looking action forces the film to suffer.  Jean Claude even looks weak in this film, but compared to the other actors, they still manage to make him look good.  The story is weak too, with a lot of nonsense to kill time in what is already a short movie, not even an hour and half.  The only highlight is the fight between Bison and Guile (Van Damme), where they actually use some moves from the video game such as Bison's elevation ability and Guile's flash kicks.  Unfortunately, editing doesn't make the fight look very real at all.  I only like this movie because I love the video game, and this is the only movie made with these guys, that is not animated.  If you don't enjoy the game, you will most likely hate this movie.  If you love Van Damme, this is one of his weakest entries.  Only obsessed Street Fighter fans will want this film 
 horrid movie. i can't believe how disappointed i am in this anime. i had heard so much about it and how it is a story that is at the same time most touching and sad. but it's not. the little girl annoyed me so much. i just can't stand spoilt kids like that and seita probably would not have died if it had not been for her. omg she just annoyed me so much throughout the whole movie. can't stop ranting yeah... for those who haven't seen it, you might like it like everybody seems to but... i would not recommend it at al 
      Although I have used many electronic cuff devices in the past, this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings.        Firstly, the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way.         In a clinical setting, it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings. It is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement. I have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what I considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way. Imagine had I taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result.       As a rule, I never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings. Many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security.       If you are considering buying this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting, please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions.  
 This book is okay, but it could definitely be better.  For a basic statistics class, this book contains WAY too much information to digest in a semester of college.  No professor I know of has ever gotten past chapter 8.  Further, the problems are quite wimpy as far as the amount of thought required for them.  Quite wimpy.  Could be better.  The only good thing is that for doing it on a spreadsheet, the data comes on a CD, so that you don't have to re-type it, thankfully 
 Ill start on a more positive note: this book has a few neat things in it.  Like all the "complete" books, it has a smattering of prestige and base classes, and a few among these shine.  A verbatum set of words can be applied to the feat section as well, but the rest of the book, is pure bilge between two stiff pieces of cardboard.  The lack of inspiration is just the surface: Most of the material is transposed from older supplements, and most of that has been updated nicely, but the new stuff within it just simply falls flat in the balance, and concept department, the two most shameless of these being the tactical feats, and the hulking hurlur prestige class.  Tactical feats are like normal feats, only you get the equivalent of 3 feats! The shameless lack of thought in planning such a thing makes ones head spin. The weapon style feats also feature such innovative techniques as "Axe and Dagger", a popular mongolian fighting style for the truly moronic.   The worst of it is the Hulking hurler: a 3 level prestige class thats let you throw stuff really hard. 50+d6 hard if you sink a lot of gold into strength boosts.  A couple of my friends hero arena'd this at level 10, and the Hurlur took out two red dragons turn one.   Just when you thought the book couldnt get any worse, you flip to a section which explains how to effectivly make a character based of previous campaigns your DM has run. If you buy this book, smear whiteout or something similar over the title of this section, and ink in the real title: "MetaGaming, and How to Do It"  In closing, dont get this book.  The material within can be found quite readilly in other books, and the new stuff will only be allowed by the most incompetant of DM 
 I'm not going to waste much time on this book review except to say that of all the books I've read on this disorder this one is the worst.  This guy comes across as a total jerk and I think this book is a fake. I think the writer of this book is secretly laughing at all of us who purchased this book and I sincerely feel this guy wrote this book as a psychology student joke.  If you want to read the best book on this disorder read The Minds of Billy Mulligan 
 I had such high hopes for this product. I thought it was going to be the perfect scent for me. As it turns out that couldn't be futher from the truth. It smells like cheap old lady perfume. YUCK. To top it all off they raised the price of it by 5 dollars!! Talk about inflation. OUCH! 
 Not very interesting and dated, like something out of Reader's Digest. I laughed a lot at the dated profundity but the list was not quite as funny as Letterman's top 10 
 Our book club read this last month and not a single member had anything good to say about this book.  As the facilitator, I was surprise by the consensus since we usually have at least one or two members who love the monthly selection.  The writing is disjointed to the point that Ms. Krauss loses her reader.  Then when she introduces the potential that many of the chapters might just be imaginary interactions between the characters, the reader is left extremely frustrated.  I really cannot imagine how Ms. Krauss' novel has garnered so many stellar reviews 
  I would not recommend this book. I found this book a real disappointment.  I do not wish to spend an hour figuring out what the calories in every meal are.  There is a lot of information, but it is spread at random all over the book and the index is almost completely useless.  It also recommended calorie intake levels that I believe would be appropriate for a roofer or a dockworker, but for most people with sedentary jobs, she was very far off.  
 I like many others have had major issues with this crock pot burning everything I make. I lent it to my sister in law for Christmas, ahe has another brand pot at home and hers did not burn at all, or boil. Mine had the same food in it and was boiling and burned the dish. Even on low it boils and burns. I will be contacting Rival now that Iknow that I am not the only one....  I would not recommend this brand or unit.. 
 I had the complete opposite experience with this workout than did the previous reviewer.  The combination of doing upper and lower body exercises simultaneously caused my heartrate to soar which caused symptoms of overtraining.    Many people love this video but I just had a bad experience with it 
 JD Crossan is an ex-priest and product of the 1960s who left his vocation.  Time and time we see this associated with a pathological sense of guilt as is sadly shown by this book.  Though clearly talanted, Crossan's personal sense of shame/guilt cloud his reason.  His drivel continues in his other works.  Look to other writers on Jesus to get healthier analysis of Jesus 
 The massage portion of this heating pad is no more a massager than the vibrate on a cell phone.  There is only 1 heat setting, which is OK, but it's a bit hot for only one setting.  It's like the High setting on my 3 setting hot pad 
 I bought this Mp3 player about 5 months ago and it just stopped working. I did nothing to it to provoke it to break. It has a 1 year warranty by iaudio, so I have spent the last 3 days trying to get a hold of the company, but quess what! they don't exist! A phone number leads you to a website that dosen't work, how convienant for cowon to be ripping off consumers with thier crappy products. STAY AWAY FROM ALL COWON PRODUCTS. i just lost 100 dollars 
 This book was just a major disappointment. The subject is superb, perhaps the true golden age of baseball, but Roger Kahn ruined it with his windy political opinons. Mr. Kahn seems almost confrontational with his political views, and seems unable to present any baseball history without them. I finally stopped reading it about a fifth of the way through and am very sorry I bought it. Read "Dynasty" and "Bums" by Peter Golenbock for real history. Don't waste your money on this stinker 
 In White Money/Black Power, Noliwe Rooks undertakes to boldly challenge the reader with an idea she pretentiously assumes will shake the foundations of contemporary notions of American history and unsettle a na√Øve African-American cosmology by suggesting that the origin of Black Studies lies mingled in to social-historical forces (not other than, but) in addition to, African-American student activism.    I am appalled to see in publication, such a shallow, banal and opaque presentation of argument and elementary cognition - from no less than an associate professor of Princeton University.  The ideological content of the book is sparse, yet the writing in which it is delivered is down right embarrassing.  Here is an example of the crippled syntax, stilted logic and sophomoric historicism you stand to encounter from a perusal of this questionably academic text:  "Black Studies offers us all a way of theorizing about race and racial difference that is more important now than ever before.  The story of Black Studies' relationship to our contemporary period is central, little known, and important, and it concerns how and why we remember as we do."  (9)  Why more now than ever?  Does the department, the discipline confer this supposedly newfangled ability to "theorize"?    For the reader, such convoluted delivery shatters the author's floundering ideas into dozens of annoying questions which promise no insight into the content of her argument, and provide no greater clarity to problems posed by the very nature of the text's composition, let alone the positions it takes up.  As quoted above, for instance, "offers us all..." refers to an unqualified everyone which conjures ambiguity and calls into question the statement's own credibility.  Are all Americans included?  Or only all scholars of the discipline?  Perhaps all human beings are referenced?  The question is relevant if the assertion is meaningful - and if the assertion is not meaningful, then why has it been written?  This particular question holds relevance throughout.    Certainly there are ways of identifying and defining the significance of the imperative of Black Studies on American college campuses today - but Rooks offers no concrete assistance with her assurances.  If anything, it is this manner of assistance those of us in support of the discipline are ultimately called to regret, on behalf of which we are compelled to apologetics.  She also fails to credit the many writers who are producing scholarship in the field about its history.    Another question raised by the above quoted text has to do with the generic, undefined "contemporary period" that Rooks informs us is "our[s]."  One would like to know who is referred to in the "we," who "remember as we do"?  This, and how, precisely, we allegedly remember.  And furthermore, why history has become solely a project of memory, of recollection.  This is a terrifying and revealing assumption on the author's part, especially given her child-like summation of the mental phenomenon: "Memory is both public and private, both historical and contemporary..." which rambles on into "...I wonder if how we remember tells us more about our past or our present."  (7) At this point, for the critical reader, Rooks' musing peters out in a wisp of smoke, along with what was evoked of all our shared wonder.  The questions that recur to the reader, questions accidentally raised by the problems of the text, must ultimately be released into the ether of bafflement if one is to get through the 177 pages of White Money/Black Power - which we cannot recommend as Rooks' colleague Cornel West has notably done.  This brings sadness to the heart of this reader whose admiration of the latter's scholarship has been an affinity more readily defensible prior to his endorsement of this bafflingly arcane volume.    Returning to a consideration of the central argument of the text, Rooks urges the reader to yield to the unpopular truth that white philanthropy should be awarded at least equal credit in the architecture of this brainchild of 1960's higher educational reform:    "Racial inclusion, white philanthropy, and historical memory are ultimately at the center of the creation story of African American Studies and at the core of this book."  (6).  While "racial inclusion" is an ill-advised phrase, the fact that "white philanthropy [is]...at the core of this book" partially explains the obsequious and cowardly rhetoric.  Racial equality, and integration are terms that do not theoretically equate with Rooks' "racial inclusion" inasmuch as the latter tacitly enjoins race as an essential feature of the individuals expecting equal treatment, equal citizenship, equal status in American social, political and cultural life.    Such expectations are not synonymous with nor mutually exclusive of "racial inclusion" - but it is crucial to point out that an African-American individual seeking social justice in the United States is not necessarily seeking to be included in the construct of whiteness, nor automatically in pursuit of entrance or membership to a racial identity condoned and constructed by society's racial imagination.  The grasping of this truth is an essential condition of proposing anything of value in regards to the politics of race as it relates to social justice in America.  Yet this is not an understanding exhibited by any means in White Money/Black Power.    Its language remains so impotent of cogent discourse in this way that one detects a great ambivalence to confront the eloquence and erudition of historical protagonists to whom professors such as herself, and critics (or students) such as myself, owe the painful pleasure of engaging such questions at institutions of higher learning in the United States.  This is not to sentimentally romanticize the achievements of the Civil Rights and Black Power eras - if we must allow that these eras have past - but, at least we must to pay homage to them.  Yet this just doesn't appear to be Rooks' style:   "If we reflect on it at all, we tend to remember the period [in the late 60's] as a jumble of images: cities burning, Black fists raised in a salute, and Afros framing Black faces."  (7)  I can't say that "we" accounts for myself, and I wonder at the professionalism and conscious motivations for such a statement.  Who, exactly, is the author trying to reach?  What LCD is being identified, anticipated?  And at what peril!  Herself a professor in this field, Rooks she seems to exhibit inexplicable indifference towards the Black Power generation and its movement which informed the socio-political foundations upon which her discipline was erected, and her career ostensibly rests:  "...The arrival of Black Studies on predominantly white campuses was often announced and preceded by cries of `Black Power!' and clenched fists raised in what was universally understood to be the Black Power salute."  (3) But perhaps her narrative voice can be more easily explained if her professional and intellectual security is bound up more with the mythic generosity of the "white philanthropy" establishment which she faithfully chronicles than with the living legacy of black, radical democracy her historiography defines itself by circumventing (in the name of contextualizing).   It goes without saying that this is not in keeping with the legacy of The Harlem Renaissance, the aims of the Civil Rights movement, the imperatives of Black Power, nor in keeping with the ideology of their finest architects who eschewed the obsequious groveling for Rooks' "racial recognition" and championed truth to power civic participation, knowledge of self as historical, political power, communally and independently pioneering the practice of American democracy, choosing inclusion as-is, multi-culturalism as distinct from assimilationism and sell-out capitulation to capitalist identity politics and diversity tokenism.  Furthermore, from her language, it is hard to imagine the audience she envisions - while her politics are more easily abstracted.  Another example in which the history of Black liberation struggle is conveyed in dicey, squeamish, "fair and balanced" typed rhetoric:  "Two things stand out from that period [of the founding of Black Studies]....   First, during the period, students offered a profound critique of the society's handling of racial exclusion, and second, the broad participation of white and brown college students in demands for an end to elitist and Eurocentric higher education was widespread."  (3)  Despite my many curiosities regarding this period of the text, I will limit myself to asking one question:  what scholar of American history worth his or her keep could assert with a straight face that the activism of the Civil Rights era targeted "the handling", rather than the fact of segregation and Jim Crow?  Perhaps for Rooks, the "handling of racial exclusion" has been perfected to a science which no longer warrants our "clenched fists" and "salutes."  But this would be a cynical assumption to make.    My contention with Rooks' "story" is not merely the splitting of hairs.  It is a simple plea for erudition in the scholars who undertake to contribute to and publish in the field of African-American Studies.  I could go on; each page of the book - which I have had the long-suffering to read - has been filled with as much ink from my own pen, in annotation of its polemic shortcomings, as was wasted on the paper at the time of its printing.    In place of this vapid title, I suggest reading, Dispatches from the Ebony Tower by Manning Marable, or The New Black Renaissance edited by the same author.  Of course, if the specificity of Rooks' topic is its selling point to the reader perhaps The White Architects of Black Education by William H. Watkins would be better suited to conventional expectations 
 I am on my third off-camera cord (about one per year).  Two have broken.  As other reviewers noted, the four screws under the metal retaining clip on the "female" end of the cord loosen and eventually fail.  I have found that a thin narrow knife can be used to remove the black "spring" cover over the screws on the shoe.  You can then tighten the screws with a screwdriver.  If you use Locktite on the screws then they will not loosen.  Canon should do this at the factory.  I use this cord with a Stroboframe "portrait/landscape" grip which raises the flash over the camera by six inches thus eliminating red eye and providing a much more pleasing light.  The stroboframe grip comes with the right size threaded screw for this cord.  When my cords failed I lost the extended-through the lens metering just like another reviewer noted.  I am not a professional photographer and only use the camera occasionally yet the cord still fails.  Canon should re-engineer this cord to make it more durable.    Unfortunately, I do not believe that there are alternative cords. It looks like I will need to keep buying Canon cords 
 Maybe this product is terrific at what it does, once configured.  My experience with Belkin tech support, the documentation, and the firmware was very, very bad.  After 24 hours of frustration, I finally returned the WAP.  Then I spent an hour recovering my original configuration.  Note that if you are trying to use this device as a range extender, you will probably be interested in the Super Secret "range extender quick start guide" on the Belkin support web site.  It's not included in the box.  My impression is that engineering designed a good product, tested it in very narrow circumstances, then told the tech writers what to write down.  Clearly no one tested the documentation 
 I read this book before reading it to my little one and I am glad I did.  Not only does it not have a positive message, it is a story of rewarded laziness and greed.  And the message is not subtle either, it is all out  there in the first line .."Jamie O'Rourke was the laziest man in all  of Ireland." -- and he was still so at the end of the book -- and  proud of it! The only decent aspect of the book are the illustrations which  are very nice, but alas not enough to risk sending a totally wrong message  to our children 
 keith rehashed not new?  what is this coming so wack you sound like you are lost.  Love your earlier work.  Going to see your show tonight 
 As a teacher of third grade I like to read some jokes to the students.  The title said for kids, so I thought I would read some to my class.  After a few non-laughable ones, I started reading through some and discovered that most of the jokes would be accepted well by middle school students and above.  Some were very tasteless including cannibalism.  Do third graders need to mull over jokes about cannibalism?  I didn't read those to the students so I ended up marking the ones that were acceptable (maybe two out of five or so).  Still most were not funny and needed explaining to the students.  What made me surprised was that the book was offered by Scholastic Book Clubs at the 2-3 grade level.  I would pass on this one unless you are over the age of 12 or so 
 I bought this thinking "Failures due to normal wear and tear", which is checked on the checklist of items covered on the overview page, would include accidental damage such as dropping.  However the pdf indicates that (3) DAMAGE FROM ACCIDENT, ABUSE, MISUSE, INTRODUCTION OF FOREIGN OBJECTS INTO THE PRODUCT," is not covered.  This is just an extended manufacturer's warranty.  A call to customer service confirms this - damage due to accidents are not covered.  Save your money 
 I bought this SD card from J&R Music last week. I thought I would get the authentic card from PNY so I just used the card with my camera and threw the package away. A couple days later, I took the card out to put all the picture in my PC and realized by that time, the card is only 1GB. I contacted the customer service department and they said they won't deal with me unless I have the original package (which I don't anymore). They adviced me to contact the PNY store. So I did a little research and found that the exact same card is from Toshiba (Model:SD-MO2G) and J&R or whoever their suppliers are just put a PNY label on it to sell it as a PNY. If you don't believe me, just type Toshiba SD-MO2G on Google and the picture is exactly the same except for the little lable. I really don't care if the card is made by Toshiba or PNY as long as it is 2GB, but it isn't. And that would make it really tough to recover your loss from any party (PNY, Toshiba, or J&R). I already contacted my credit card company for a dispute. Little advice for everyone, STAY AWAY FROM THIS PARTICULAR CARD AND J&R STORE and also check the card validity with your computer as soon as you get the item 
 I have tried really hard to like this album.  I have all of Don Henley's solo albums, all of Glenn Frey's as well, and every Eagles album, of course, and they're all very good - except this one. Actually, two stars is almost generous, because this CD is beyond mediocrity.   Don Henley is very opinionated as usual, coming down hard on everything from mass media to people who believe in UFOs, and he finds room for a few love songs as well. But he and his co-composers apparently forgot about the music. "Taking You Home" works. It's a pretty nice little ballad. And that's about it. Try as I might, I can't recall even a single chorus from the remaining twelve songs. Henley and his co-composers seem to have so much so say they forgot to write some decent music to go along with the (generally very eloquent) lyrics.  I remember listening to "They're Not Here, They're Not Coming" for the first time. I kept expecting some kind of a hook, some even slightly memorable chorus, anything. And it's almost there - but no. And that's a shame, because some of the lyrics are really good, and they could have used the company of some well-written tunes. But no, no hint of a riff or a hook anywhere.  (I know I won't get too many helpful votes on this one ;o) But reviews are written for prospective buyers, not for fawning fans who already made up their mind and decided that Don Henley can do no wrong, remember? 
 Don't buy it. Get a book from wrox or sun 
  Actress Julia Summers is being vaguely threatened by a sometime stalker.  She's ending her starring role on a prime time soap, "River Run", to be the next Bond girl.  (She was raised by hippie parents, Freedom and Peace.  It didn't connect with me how she became such a Fleming fan while living a vagabond and unconventional lifestyle with her free-spirited parents.  Anyway.)  "River Road" is going to film the season cliffhanger in Blue Bayou, Louisiana.  The Blue Bayou mayor asks his FBI agent brother, Finn Callahan, to bodyguard for Julia and protect her from the stalker.  Finn is at loose ends, enduring a four week unpaid leave of absence from the agency.  Seems he tracked a serial killer for three years, caught him and, when the killer tried to escape from the hospital, Finn beat him up.  Finn doesn't understand why his FBI boss had a problem with that.  (Yeah, I'm rolling my eyes here.)  I liked some of the secondary characters and wish there had been more about them.  The conversations between Julia and Finn were boring and I felt no chemistry between them.  The stalker and serial killer and James Bond fixation were blech.  On page eleven "her green eyes limpid pools of desire" was particularly blech.  And it's really too bad Ms. Ross made the Louisiana bayou so ho-hum, about as interesting as a local city park . . . in fact, local parks are more interesting.  This is the second book in a trilogy.  It's possible reading the first book (which I didn't) would make this one more enjoyable, possible, not probable.  
 Did not expect much for 10 bucks... but give me a break, 2 weeks and the plastic streched and tore around the handle up on top of the smoker.  I think a heavy duty trash bag is what this product is equivalent to 
 Having been a teenager once, I can certainly understand the inner turmoil and angst teens experience.  However, in PUMP UP THE VOLUME, the movie's attempt to martyrize teens and make all adults look like uncaring morons only serves to underscore why so many adults look with disdain on teens.  The teens in this movie seem to have little respect for authority and their assignation as to being tortured and misunderstood is vanquished in their juvenile behavior.  Even our hero (well played by Christian Slater) cannot communicate with people on a one to one level; he instead decides to become some kind of salvation to his teens by using his pirated radio shows to cause some kind of uprising among them.  As a proponent of truth, he is a vapid antithesis of truth: he fakes masturbation to arouse the youths; he doesn't use his real name or voice; and on a call with a potential suicide victim, he treats the caller as someone who isn't serious and never really offers any kind of consolation.  The suicidal teen says he is lonely and we automatically assume he is lonely within his familial structure, but isn't he just as lonely with the peers who mourn him after his demise?  The adults are played almost as caricatures and the teens as misunderstood heroes.  Sorry, folks, been there done that...living at any age requires a commitment to better yourself and do what you feel is right.  Questioning authority without any viable alternatives, as none of these teens do, merely escalates the generational gap, and movies like this are merely attempts to exploit the so called misunderstanding of youth 
 They smell like mothballs! I'm still airing them out after wearing them once, and realizing how bad they smell.  Would recommend against them, solely based on the smell, even though they look great (the reasoning for the 2 stars vs 1 star 
 I wish I had followed Everett Logan's advice and skipped this cassette. You can tell that the material itself is great, but the narrator is terrible, terrible, terrible. He dumbs down the text. I bought this to give to someone recuperating from surgery, but decided to listen to it myself first. I'm glad I did -- I would have been embarrassed to give this to anyone 
 Dang, Carl, how could you?  Let me start by saying that CH is one of my favorite writers.  His stories aren't necessarily epic in nature but his dialog & characterizations & writing in general are virtually beyond reproach.  Even though his storylines border on slice-of-life rather than edge-of-your-seat thrillers, Hiaasen's writing is typically so good, his books are still extremely entertaining page-turners.  That said, Native Tongue was quite a letdown for me.  Usually I'll finish a book like this in one or two days.  I struggled for almost two weeks to finish it, putting it down at the drop of a hat.  In his defense, this was one of Hiaasen's earlier efforts.  Everything since Native Tongue has been infinitely better.  If you're new to Hiaasen, don't let this book turn you off.  His other works are definitely worth reading 
 This book is good if you want to be warned over and over to wash your hands! If you are looking for the difference between viruses and bacteria, actual scientific references or interesting facts about how germs and bacteria live, reproduce and colonize us - look elsewhere. This book was too preachy and didn't have enough information for anyone with a genuine interest in biology, human physiology, or health. 
 I have long had the desire to read a Grisham book, because I have heard good things.  Well, my chance came and I was sorely disappointed.  The audio cd's were on sale at a truck stop and I decided to get them for The Chamber.  The opening to the book kept me going, but by chapter three, I had already decided this, "If Sam Cayhall lives I'm going to be mad because I get furious about hate crimes, and if he dies, he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the "hero" to the story."  Sadly, I pursued curious about the ending.  I'm very glad I got the cds instead of the book, because it only took six hours to get through it.  Sure wish I had those six hours back and the money invested so I could try a diferent author.  Mayber Grisham's other books are better, but I won't be reading them 
 This film was INCREDIBLY bad, easily the worst I ever tried to sit through. The editorial review said that it's hard to imagine a better Quixote than Peter O'Toole? Well, I sure can: his name is Brian Stokes Mitchell, and he at least can sing his own part. The poor man who dubbed over O'Toole, couldn't hit the side of a barn with a good note. The sad part is, I love musicals in general, and so I kept watching this one, hoping it would get better, but finally I just gave up. If ANY musical is in need of an onscreen revival with better performances, it's this one 
 If you're looking for a thoughtful critique of the media, look elsewhere.  This book contains more name-calling within its pages than a junior high school does within its doors. The author indiscriminately hurls the epithet "right-wing" to describe just about everyone who isn't a Democrat.  Did Ted Kennedy ghostwrite this?   Bill O'Reilly is not "right wing" or Republican but rather a grandstanding populist.  John Stossel is not "right wing" or Republican but rather a libertarian.  Brock can't even give them the dignity of using an insulting term that actually describes who they are.  The left simply loses credibility and strips "right wing" of any discerable meaning when they brand everyone from George W. Bush (the biggest spender since LBJ) to the Cato Institute to Adolf Hitler as being "right wing."  Maybe most people in politics don't think about the meaning of words, only what effect they have, but readers of a long book deserve to have their intelligence respected.  Brock doesn't.  The errant insults, hyperbolic generalizations, and misrepresentations go on and on in this book.  At least Ann Coulter's off the wall attack books are entertaining.  Brock's sense of humor is apparently still under development, if he has one at all.  Yes, the book has some information in it that some people may find useful.  But the sneering writing style, for me at least, totally overwhelms and negates any value I may have otherwise derived from this hatchet job of a book.  So I'm giving it only 1 star 
 this cd is really good and boasts many talents, but...like the old gloria record ep, it gets old. if you've never heard this kind of music before, then get it by all means. but if you know of mineral, you'll probably like mineral better. it sounds a lot like u2 and radiohead. i see them live a lot, and basically, i've been disappointed lately. i used to think their music meant something to them. the last time i saw them in austin, they looked bored. i don't know...maybe the boys will cook up something new with their new music. let's hope so 
 I have more than 15 years of project management experience. I've read this and quite a few other PMP books from cover to cover. Most of the reviews on this page sound like a propaganda to me. This book gives you the impression that it's a big book and must be covering lots of material. But this, in my opinion, is not true. It's big due to the large font and because most of the space on each page is empty.    Furthermore, the book is mostly a re-hash of the PMBOK Guide but only with less information, and without any apparent consideration to and description of the exam objectives or specifications. (I found that this is the problem with most of the PMP books except the one by Sanghera). Most of the topics in this book are not covered to adequate depth. For example, Pareto chart is presented without much explanation: just one example of an approach that permeates throughout the whole book. Using simple language is good  property of this book, but at places the concepts are oversimplified so that the accuracy can be questioned.  Most of the review and exam questions are too simplistic. They may be ok for the CAPM exam but NOT for the PMP exam.  To me, it's does not seem like a professionally prepared book. For example, binding is weak, most of the tables and figures are not numbered, and index is very poorly prepared and is not very useful.  Just considering the shallow coverage of the topics, I would not count on this book solely for the exam. We are lucky that there are quite a few PMP books out there to choose from. Here is my recommendation of PMP books in descending order:  1. PMP Exam Prep by Rita Mulcahy. Quite a bit of exercises and explanations. At least refers to PMBOK Guide when does not explain something.  2. PMP In Depth by Paul Sanghera. Pretty much self contained and adequately covers almost all the exam topics. In the beginning of each chapter, describes the PMP exam objectives covered in the chapter.  3. PMP Study Guide by Joseph Phillips. Quite a few topics are covered in much detail. However, at places not very compatible with PMBOK Guide.  4. The PMP Exam by Andy Crowe (this book). A good additional resource. But not comprehensive enough.        
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 If this had been the first Crais book I'd read I wouldn't have read any others which would have been a pity as all his previous books (except the Forgotten Man) were excellent. The Two-Minute rule (note the use of the grammatically correct hyphen) has two main characters, Holman and Pollard, who are made of cardboard and are not in the least bit interesting. The plot was okay but the end was silly. I was bored throughout most of the book and couldn't wait for it to finish. If you want good Crais then read Demolition Angel, Hostage or LA Requiem and don't read this one. 
 With 566 previous reviews (perhaps 565 more than the book merits), it might seem that there was little more to say. However, extremely few of the 566 reviewers have any expertise in biochemistry, a subject that Michael Behe mentions not only in the title but also throughout the book. He argues that his conclusions follow necessarily from the study of biochemistry, and he implies (without going so far as to perpetrate an outright lie by saying so in so many words) that anyone with a knowledge of biochemistry will agree. This is so far from the reality that even his own academic colleagues at Lehigh University find it necessary to post a warning on the departmental web site stating that his views are his alone. Far from what Behe pretends, nearly all biochemists consider that the studies of protein and gene sequences of the past 35 years have constituted one of the triumphs of the Darwinian view of evolution, providing a huge new body of data in support of natural selection. This does not make them right, of course: truth in science is not decided democratically, and overwhelmingly preponderant opinions sometimes turn out to be wrong.  Nonetheless, anyone adopting a minority position has two obligations: to acknowledge that it is, in fact, a minority position, and to offer very strong arguments that have some chance of convincing the majority. Behe doesn't bother with either of these. As he is writing primarily for non-biochemist readers he allows these readers to imagine that there is no significant opposition to his views, and as he has never tried to make his case before an audience of his peers he has not tried to deal with this opposition. Worse than that, he is content to attack Darwinian evolution without bothering to offer any kind of falsifiable hypothesis to replace it.  Perhaps the most serious fault in the book is the confusion that pervades it between studies of the origin of life and studies of evolution. Although Charles Darwin did have some suggestions to make about the origin of life it is not that that he is famous for: his reputation lies in the theory of natural selection, which is not concerned with the origin of life but with its subsequent evolution. It is perfectly possible to think that there remain serious difficulties in understanding how the first organisms came to exist but at the same time that natural selection offers an almost complete explanation of evolution. Indeed, that would be the position of most biologists: hardly anyone considers that the origin of life is well understood. In the book, however, the ideas of irreducible complexity are presented as if they were an argument against natural selection, when they are nothing of the kind. Insofar as they are worth bothering with at all, they draw attention to some of the points that a theory of the origin of life will need to explain.  In relation to the questions that most exercise creationists -- the degree of relationship between humans and apes -- irreducible complexity has no relevance whatsoever. All of the examples that Behe gives, such as blood clotting, operate exactly the same in chimpanzees and humans, and have precisely nothing to say about whether or when chimpanzees and humans had a common ancestor. The biochemical evidence actually goes in the opposite direction from what creationists would like: 40 years ago virtually all palaeontologists thought that the separation between humans and African apes occurred about 30 million years ago, but now almost everyone agrees that it was very much more recent, and it is precisely the mountain of biochemical data that has brought about the change. In fact Behe tells us that he finds the idea of "common descent (that all organisms have a common ancestor) fairly convincing" -- a sentence that seems to have escaped the attention of creationist readers anxious to find a real scientist saying things they think are in support of their views.  With all this, why give the book two stars? The first is because one star is the least that Amazon allows, and the second is because although this book is dangerous and seriously misleading for non-specialists, it is also one that scientists, especially biochemists and molecular biologists, probably do need to make the effort to read, if only to know at first hand what the "scientific" case against evolution consists of 
 I threw it away after listening for the first time.  I am not easily offended, love Chris Rock and the angry genre, but Kinson is really ugly with his humor.  His politics are right of right, which may be part of the offense, but enough is enough.  
 As a physician, research scientist, and former engineer, I agree with the author, Michael LeGault, that there is no substitute for a disciplined, evidence based, and carefully reasoned approach to thinking and problem solving.. no matter how intuitive or inspired one may feel.  I also agree that our education system is failing miserably not only our children, but the future standing of our Country - by totally abdicating it's responsibility to inculcate such a cognitive skillset in our children.  What I object to, however, and frankly find apalling, is the author's oversimplification of complex issues like CO2 emissions & Climate change, or his insinuation that ADHD may not be a legitemate clinical entity, or his lumping Daniel Goleman's book "Emotional Intelligence" with Gladwell's "Blink"..  This last gaffe I found particularly grating, as LeGault presents a false dichotomy between the (as Goleman calls them) "high road" mental processes like objectivity.. or disciplined, carefully reasoned thinking, and "low road" processes like intuition; which so vitally subserve the gut level social smarts that every day, guide us through our myriad social interactions, and help us survive and even thrive amid the harsh political realities of our "workplace", be it a newsroom in Toronto, a Research Hospital in Philadelphia, or a grammar school playground in Mississippi.  Mr LeGault's book would be fine if we all lived on Planet Vulcan..  Seeing as how we do not, however..  I would strongly recommend to anyone interested in reading this book, that they also read Daniel Goleman's new book "Social Intelligence".  Contrary to LeGault's opinion, the two paradigms are complimentary to one another, and both absolutely necessary if one is to be high functioning and at the same time, human.

 As an expectant mother of bi-cultural, bi-racial, and hopefuly bi-lingual child, I am reading any kind of books which might help me. On the contrary to many praises, this book was a big dissapointment for me. The authors keep repeating the same thing chapter after chapter, and failed to give any concrete evidence to explain why. If you just want to read many bits and pieces opinions from bilingual children's parents, this may be the right book for you. I rather recommend "The Bilingual Family. 
 The coffee came in a timely manner and is quite tasty.  However I bought 6 bags and didn't get my free bag (buy 5 and get 1 free 
 Why do I have to give this even 1 star? The early examples in the book didn't work, so I put it down and never went back to it. 
 20 odd years ago, when all I was reading was SCI-FI and fantasy, my mom insisted I read Ludlum's Bourne Identity. I remember really enjoying it and read several others of his through the years. Looked forward to and enjoyed the movies, but alas the Janson Directive, while fasted paced, offered me nothing new. Maybe it was the two recent movies with the agency's secret program always chasing someone, maybe those intervening 20 odd years of thrillers, suspense and techno thrillers made me an informed consumer.... Close but no cigar. Too many expected and predictable almost caught `yas / barely get-a-ways / one-ups-manships between the master vs. the disciple. I think today's readers have seen more than their fair share of someone being tracked by their best pupil or for that mater dusting off some ancient Obi-won to dispatch their star gone rogue to enjoy this book. 
 Buyer beware. After paying for this book, the DVD-rom will prompt you to pay another US$30 for 80 additional exercises. That's a hidden expense which is not mentioned in the product description. This is wrong. I suppose for a book which is not intended for the beginner, the author assumes that you have the extra cash to spend on the additional exercises 
 I bought four books in my quest to learn to properly sew curtains and drapes. I have been sewing since girlhood, but simple curtains and throw pillows are the farthest I've gotten into home decorating sewing. (I'm a grandma now).  This book only got 2 stars because of the lack of photos, not of finished window treatments, but of projects in the making. I find the illustrations not too good and in most cases too difficult to follow. Guess what? That leaves a person having to figure it out on her own - guess I could have done that without the book!  In fairness to the author, this book did have something the others did not. This book has fairly extensive sections on fabrics, types, colors, usages, care, colors. Also, the back has yardage calculator charts which no other book has. Unfortunately, I would not buy this book just for that.  I think if this book were to be published with photos instead of difficult to follow illustrations, it would be a must-have for my sewing library. As it is, I cannot recommend it 
 Bryant's book is a very comphensive introduction to holistic Christian development.  It tackles the difficult issue of how development can be distincitively Christian and tackles it well.  I was disappointed however in the lack of treatment of the place of the Christian community.  This is a good foundational book nevertheless 
 I guess there's a reason why we're supposed to care about Horowitz's journey from Maoist to right-wing hack, but I didn't discover it in this tiresome book. If people are interested in some reminiscing of sixties radicalism, and the issues people who battle the establishment (not serve it) face, I'd recommend the DVD, "The Weather Underground. 
 Not real high on my nautical book list.  In my opinion, it's more a story about the author not having time for his boat and in the care of others it sinks.  It's a reminiscent look back 
 I was very disappointed with the content and overall tone of this book.  I went to the library looking to find an unbiased guide of what to expect during the birth of my child, and instead came back with a very anti-medical diatribe that tells women why they should NOT have certain procedures.  I wanted to be able to read about what to expect, and then MAKE DECISIONS FOR MYSELF.  I question why this book was titled "The Thinking Woman's Guide" now, as it really gives you nothing to think about as much as it bestows guilt.  Goer fails to play devil's advocate on the side of obstetrics, again and again stating that there are no "pros" to some procedures and tests.  Oddly enough, the blurb on the book's back cover reads "But when it comes to one of the most important decisions of your life - how you will give birth - it is hard to garther accurate, unbiased information."  Interesting how Goer falls into the trap of bias herself 
  I bought this splitter because I was having problems with low signal quality after a split on my digital cable.  So I replaced my inexpensive splitter with this fancy shmancy one and..... the picture got much much worse so now I'm out twelve bucks. 
 Had to stop about 1/4 of the way through it and give it away 
 I agree with the other post. Great if you have a Nikon flash, but not much  help with other types of lighting solutions. The author needed to get into  more detail other than just flash photography. Also,the writing was hard to  follow and confusing 
 The first 40 pages of this book was somewhat interesting. However, everything else was repetitious. Almost the entire book was about every film he starred in or directed......nothing new!  
 This brainless, low-budget attempt to cash in on the success of John Carpenter's Vampires was so foul and lame that the studios couldn't even bribe one of their lap-dog "reviewers" to crank out a glowing review for the DVD cover. Or maybe they couldn't afford the kickback--who knows? In any case, the bad casting and inept acting had a kind of narcotic quality like an over-the-counter sleeping pill and the movie had so many plot holes that I used the DVD later to drain my spaghetti. "John Carpenter Presents"--a piece of incredible crap!! Its general level of radioactive badness probably made me sterile 
 I never liked this story.  First of all, I didn't like the island of unwanted toys.  I also didn't like the way the movie ended because I didn't like the way the scene of Santa's noisy sleigh flying to that island made me feel.  And what was wrong with the doll on the island?  We had Charlie-not-Jack-in-the-box, an ostrich riding cowpoke, a jelly squirting gun and a doll with no visible challenges.  In addition to being maudlin, I didn't like the way Rudolf was accepted only after he bailed out the other reindeer.  Sure, the other reindeer loved Rudolf and shouted out with glee - they could afford to after he bailed them out.  Like couldn't he be accepted before he pulled that sleigh that foggy Christmas?  I'd recommend all the other Christmas stories before this one 
 A peculiar book. Sterling's descriptions of technological gadgets and governmental processes are convincing, but Zenith Angle seems to be missing some things. An obvious or compelling plot, for one - you can read 3/4 of the way through the book without figuring out what exactly is the point of the book. The characterizations are weird - a mixture of colorful, dull, and just plain odd. For a hundred or so pages it seems like it might be a good read, and then after a couple hundred pages more you realize you have just about run out of pages, and it hasn't become a good read yet.   Each page is well written, but taken as a whole, the book's pages add up to surprisingly little 
 Alan Alda is a funny man. But his book is not. He jumps from here to there leaving one to wonder where he is going with his story. Our book club was anxious to read something different but it was unanimous - thumbs down 
 Read Andrea Makris' law suit at www.thesmokinggun.com all the dirty details are there, and should be required reading for anyone who reads O'Reilly or takes him seriously. He SETTLED the case after smearing her and threatening her, he's a little wimp and a coward and a "loofa" loving creep. Keep him away from your children! I Know the guy. from Washington  Jeff Gannon 
 I read My Antonia and loved it so much that I consider it one of my favorite books.  And, that's why I really really really wanted to like this book.  But after giving it a chance for about 218 pages, I couldn't bear it any longer.  The problems I have with this book are as follows:  1) I understand the book's plot of the professor trying to find meaning in his life.  That's the book I was looking for.  The problem is that the Tom Outland character does not get you there and most of the text of the book is on this character.  2) Which brings me to my biggest gripe about this book, and Cather in particular.  Cather cannot, to save her life, write a believable male character.  Tom Outland is supposed to be an orphaned boy turned cowboy around the turn of the century, but Cather managed to make him out to be so unbelievably feminine that I found myself in wonder at how little she knows about men.  She holds Outland out to be the hero of the story, the inspiration behind the Professor's motivation.  That's fine, but if I'm supposed to conclude the Professor part of the story, then I have to buy Outland's character and it's just not possible.  Here are some examples of Cather not being believable:  a)  When she describes Tom Outland's hands through the professor's eyes, she describes them as beautiful and delicate.  Worse still, she bothers to describe them in detail.  Men don't do that.  b)  Around page 218 when she begins Outland's tirade against Blake she makes Outland sound off like a nagging wife about how Blake shouldn't have sold the pottery etc.  Men don't argue this way with friends; they don't have hissy fits - they stay quiet!  c)  After the argument in (b) above, as Blake leaves the scene, she describes Outland wishing to run after him and hold him in his arms.  Men just don't think like that.  d)  When Outland is in Washington D.C. trying to get people to take interest in the pottery he discovered, he lets himself get ignored, disrespected, and he waits by tolerantly while being stepped on by people in positions of power.  That's not a description of a turn of the century orphaned cowboy; that's a description of a turn of the century well-to-do woman of society - the only world Cather appears to know.  e)  Whenever Tom Outland meets other men in his life as a cowboy, they are always really "nice and pleasant".  Indeed they are overly accommodating.  Huh?  I could see cowboys being really respectful and accommodating to a beautiful woman of society (like Cather) but an orphaned cowboy?  She just puts too much of herself in this character.  I couldn't buy it.  3) Now before reviewers think my gripes are based on some sort of homophobia, let me just say that if it had been a story about men in love with each other, I would have accepted that as at least being believable.  But that's not Cather's intention.  Outland ends up marrying the professor's daughter.  Is Cather trying to send out a bisexual message of some kind?  Was the professor gay?  The text just does not support any kind of homosexual message either explicitly or implicitly.  4)  Cather plays out Outland to be this super human being.  Indeed he is the inspiration to the Professor and all the other characters in the book.  But if that's the case, why is he on the wrong side of the moral debate on the Dreyfus affair?  Cather wrote this book in 1925; twenty five years after all the facts had already come out on that case and yet Cather has Outland take the side of bigots?  5)  In Outland's tirade against Blake, Outland chews him out for selling ancient pottery belonging to native Indian tribes.  Earlier in the book it's concluded that the tribe was decimated by outsiders.  In chastising Blake, Outland declares that Blake was wrong to sell the pottery because it was not his.  He says that the pottery belongs to his country, to the State etc.  That's the best our hero can do?  Wouldn't the right thing to do be to leave the ruins to themselves and not dig up the belongings of the decimated people - i.e. let them rest in peace?  Anyway, I was sorely disappointed.  I gave The Professor's House one star more than it deserves only because My Antonia deserves six. 
 I received the coffeemaker as a gift, and was relatively happy with the machine, though coffee could have brewed a bit hotter.   However, within a year I noticed that the thermal glass lining in the carafe began flaking off. Like a fool, I just bought another one even though I probably could have gotten it replaced under warranty.   Well, another year or so later, I'm washing the new carafe by hand (as recommended with warm water, no extreme temps or abrasives), and set it down to dry. About 5 minutes later I hear a loud pop, and go back to find a pile of glass shards all over my counter and floor. Carafe #2 bites the dust (thankfully my kids weren't around).  And, in reading through other Amazon reviews of the coffeemaker, it appears my exploding carafe is not uncommon.  Regrettably, I (like about 80%+ of consumers) failed to keep the receipt, and was roadblocked by the overly apologetic yet useless call center folks armed with finely scripted objections & rebuttals. No receipt, no luck, can't help you. Yes, they were happy to help if I had a proof of purchase -- and would be happier to refer me to parts to buy another one. Beyond that though, well, nothing.   They even gave me the name of the person at the next level up who apparently only responds in writing though (Can I have that job?).   Hmm...."Bold design, precision, ingenuity and unwavering craftsmanship uniquely define the philosophy of the company Robert Krups began in 1846".   I'd say Robert's philosophy has gotten lost somewhere, unless he meant that the product's planned obsolescence should be equal to the warranty period.   Don't buy it, unless you plan to replace it every year. 
 This must be one of the latest entries in the Dan Brown school of writing. Name an expert, assign an audience, lecture on historical points and expect applause at the end. Well, Kathy Reichs can wait for a long time. There will be no applause for this book. I would like my money back. I'm almost finished and still can't really figure out what the plot actually is. I guess she will just pop the final lecture and the conclusion will name the murderer. What about motive, character development (sex + history), etc... This is my first novel by this author and it will be my last 
 I bought this book for .25 cents at a yard sale. Boy did I waste my quarter!   I found NO new meditation techniques in this little rag. It is clear to understand why the sales ranking of this book is only 608,394.   This is your basic, "You know the envision white light garbage and hold your breath to the count of ......". You know the same junk that all charlatons teach.  This book is pitiful at best. 
 I was disappointed in this book.  I knew peripherally the incredible turnaround at Nissan orchestrated by Ghosn, so I had hoped to learn more to apply to my own organizations.  This book would have been just as effective as a 40 page booklet--all the nuggets were in the first half.  Nothing new in the second half.  Borrow someone else's and stop at about page 60; you won't be disappointed 
 Two Federal Marshals are dispatched to a remote island housing a mental institution for the criminally insane to look for a missing patient named Solando.  Throw in a Hurricane that traps the Marshalls on the island, a lot of strange behavior, and you have the premise for Shutter Island.  The book does not live up to the expectations Dennis Lehane's readers expect from him (although looking at the other reviews I could be dead wrong about that).  There are glimmers of Lehane's talents, but the book feels like a rushed screen play.  There is action, there is mystery, there are menacing situation, but it is all very glossy and superficial.  The reader will also probably solve the mystery by page 150.  It is not all grim however.  The book does flow nicely, reads easily and the last 25 pages were very powerful emotionally.  I did enjoy the book, but would expect something like this from James Patterson (this would be an achievement for him) but not from a fresh talent like Dennis Lehane 
 This movie is billed as sci-fi and I'm surprised the editorial review says it is more realistic than Armageddon. What science? A fabric type suit that protects the wearer from 4000 degree temperatures and instantly pulverizing levels of pressure? I wonder how the suits were insulated to keep any inward wrinkle from doing the microwave effect on any part of the body it touched... AMAZING. For the characters to get out of the vehicle with a non-pressurized internal environment hundreds of miles below the surface of the earth, they would have to equalize for it and breathe a special air mix that is vastly helium to prevent too high an oxygen intake from causing oxygen toxicity. Next they would have to decompress to enter the vehicle again and at that depth, may as well figure on at least a couple of months of deco. However, no one has been able to use such an air mix below about 2000 feet yet, sooooooooooo, scratch that. That would mean the vehicle has to be pressurized so they can get in and out without all that. Too bad, won't work, still well beyond any depth they could breathe an air mix at. However, if they had taken this route in production, it would have been a great Chipmunks Save The World comedy listening to them talk. Also, if it was pressurized, that wild ride to the top at the end would have likely caused the vehicle to explode unless it could do some really rapid depressurizing. But even if it didn't, I'd hate to be the one taking the chamber ride to deco from that trip, which would have to be done inside the vehicle because it'd be impossible to transfer them to any other chamber than the vehicle itself while keeping them under pressure. And keep in mind that the first cases of decompression sickness, in this case "the bends", were recorded in the 1800s and thought to be some kind of disease. Those first cases were in miners and they were a lot shallower than several hundred miles.   A metal that gains strength as pressure gets higher, but aptly named unobtainium? Tell me how they made the craft with this metal when it can withstand the heat of the planetary core and applying pressure makes it tougher. The only way to form things is by applying some form of pressure. Maybe if they form it with a hammer and only strike it once in a while they might catch it unawares and can bend it here and there?  Armageddon is a scientific documentary next to this one. I read the reviews on it and saw where several shared the same gripes. Some were legit, some only highlighted that the science in the movie was of a higher level than their scientific acumen. And none that I saw pointed out the landing gears not shattering. Titanium or not, unless heated, they'd have splintered in such extremes of cold. But then again, being that the landing gear issue was never addressed in the movie, we don't know if they were heated or not.  The Core isn't an awful movie, but it also isn't very good. It's okay. It's better if you like science fantasy. It's just a bit disconcerting to see people say check your brain at the door before trying to rip a movie apart then make you wonder if they even just checked their brain. I'd suggest renting or borrowing from a friend before buying on this one 
 How often do you come across a book that is really disappointing? And when it is was it your fault because you chose it because of its misleading cover picture or its contents page? Dick Lutz, asserted writer of several books on animals and out-of-the-way geographical regions has provided us with some reading which must be below the expectation of even an average book consumer. His personal account of a trip to Patagonia with a certain tour operator might well have paid for his fare, however, it leaves much to be desired in the way of writing. Simplistic, badly-put together sentences many of which are semantically ill-formed make reading a continuous strain. "We then got into the zodiacs for a ride around Tucker Island. This is a bird paradise so we refrained from landing in order not to disturb them." (p.14)   What is meant to be helpful advice for a future would-be traveller to the place unfortunately does not go beyond a rudimentary enumeration of lengthy bus rides between unnamed destinations and occasional lunch menus. "We took the small boats to shore where we were met by buses and vans that took our group through the town of Porvenir and also to an estancia (ranch)." (p.15) Sentences like the following would not go uncorrected by any editor with a minimum of pride in their occupation and one must wonder if this book received a second reading by anyone at all before going into print. "The drive through the countryside was different from what we had seen until now." (p.15) and "After driving awhile and seeing some more astounding vistas we next visited another spectacular locale." (p.17) At some stage the reader must ask themselves if the book was intended for children and incredulously reads on page 79: "Since there is a Lesser rhea, it follows that there is also a greater rhea."  The chapters on the land, its history and its people certainly provide the unitiated reader with much new and useful background information although also here textual continuity is sporadic and superficial. Quotes are not always sourced and the few photographs receive no comments. The book does, however, have a good word index and provides an extensive bibliography.  Should you buy this book? Only if you really need to. 
 I read this book in preparation for my Cisco MPLS exam, on my way to becoming a CCIP. I bought the 2 volumes. After reading the first one, I decided not to go ahead with the second. I work for a giant service provider, which is a  fortune 500 company as well. I specifically work at the core network level. The core network transitioning from legacy SDH towards a pure IP/MPLS solution meant for me a fundamental understanding of MPLS. First of all, never throughout the book did I understand what exactly was the problem that MPLS was aimed at solving. The words are there and you will read them 3 or 4 times. But nothing will sink in. Configuration examples are there alright, but there was no clear, separate explanation of each and every component of the architecture. When and where do use MBGP, where do we redistribute which protocol, and so forth. You will have to do a lot of figuring out on your own, which will certainly mean a lot of guessing. And that is NOT why I bought a book on MPLS and VPNs :-) This is not a book written in a style which assumes that you know nothing about the subject. On the contrary, it is so complicated that I think you need to know everything beforehand, and this book is only for reference ! This is certainly NOT a book for MPLS dummies. The above conclusions I arrived at after I read one specific resource. Try to read the Cisco authorized course material, which is simply the instructor projector slides printed on paper, and a little explanation under it. Forget about the exam for a little while. For whoever is interested in REALLY understanding MPLS, and really understanding where each protocol goes, and the where and how and why of almost anything related to MPLS and VPNs, read that resource. Then compare it to this book. You will get my point 
 I found this book to be full of silly metaphors (as if that's the only way we could relate to  Dr. Twerski).  It just didn't get me the information I needed.  Perhaps others would find it motivational 
 I use "The Notebook" and "A Walk to Remember" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.  After a slow start with "True Believer," I was more satisfied with "The Rescue."  Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,  
 This book is unfortunately not up to par for Kay Hooper.  Her normal suspense is missing and you would have to be psychic to know who the murderer is (there isn't a single clue at any point in time).  The heroine keeps loosing her memory, so you don't even have the usual good characterizations of hero & heroine (since she can't even remember much about herself, much less him).  If you like Kay go ahead and read it, but I hope the next one is back up to her usual high standard 
 I blame the director for this one.   You have a fairly decent concept here, some excellent actors, and good gory effects. You also have the director taking the script and changing the intents of lines.   First off, we have a tramatized child supposedly inventing a friend. This was not handled well. Even a fine actor like Dakota Fanning can't do much when a director is....let's just say she did the best she could under the circumstances, as did DeNiro and everyone else in the cast. The father (DeNiro) is patient beyond belief, the girlfriend pushy. Anyway, as peculiar things begin to happen DeNiro blames Fanning up to the point of impossibility. Her reaction to her father and Charlie was all wrong and totally killed any believability for the ending.  By making every single freakin' male in the movie queer ("Golly, which one is a killer?") he just trashed any pretense of suspense. Silly occurances and meetings, inane extras --  no point in any of it except to detract from a struggling film.   I can't but believe the cast saw the script and signed on, never imagining how it would all be turned around into a second rate flick. You know who is going to die before it happens, you know who the bad guy is going to be, and you wonder about bad continuity and dreadful choices.  Don't recommend buying or renting. Borrow it if you must see it. 
 This book was interesting at first.  It shatters what most of us think the typical millionaire looks and acts like, but that only takes a chapter.  After that, it just keeps repeating itself over and over.  "Who do you think bought the $1000 watch and who bought the lower priced watch?"  Yeah, yeah, I get it; the millionaire has a lower priced watch than the overspending, no real wealth guy.    Then some of the examples are so over simplified or exaggerated that you know they are made up to make a point.  I want real examples.  I don't care if you give them goofy code names to protect identity, but don't come up with such bad comparisons to prove a point if it isn't real.    Then there is the advice on being frugal.  I am pretty frugal, but some of what they said would put me in the crazy house if I had to live like that.  Sure, I could cut out every unnecessary expense from my budget, but then I wouldn't be very happy.  Who cares if I have a million when I'm 60ish if I had to live miserably up until then.  What is that worth?  I know not to go out and buy a brand new luxury car, but driving around my 20 year old Jeep is no fun either!  This book is good for the first chapter and if you are just completely clueless or a compulsive over spender.  People with common sense need not buy this book, just check it out at the library like I did 
 My 1 year old son loves the Little Einsteins show, so I bought him this book.  I am sorely disappointed with the book, and my son doesn't care for it.  It's a complete ripoff from the Farmer Annie's Garden episode, and doesn't add anything to it.  There is only one lift flap per page.  The book could use more substance 
 A simplistic and self-serving rant?  A paean to Theory X?  Or was the author just a little cranky that evening?  One thing it is not is a work worthy of the "timeless classic of motivational literature" tag that has been applied to it.  It is not the first nor last time that passion will be mistaken for profundity.  The author's Apologia in this edition starts with "This literary trifle...", he need have gone no further.  Simplistic.  His world in cleanly divided between the few and rare carriers of messages to Garcia (I assume he regards himself among them) and worthless shirkers and incompetents.    Self-Serving.  "-but out and forever out the incompetent and unworthy go. It is the survival of the fittest" .. Until some golden-parachuted "business leader" fattens his comp package by whacking off the author's whole organization after a merger or by moving it to India, leaving him just another unemployed middle aged executive among hundreds or thousands, looking for a new job in a shrinking, age-adverse market.  He can go right on patting himself on the back, sleeping well, until the fateful day he suddenly becomes incompetent and unworthy by his own definition having failed to make his cherished economic Darwinian cut. (Even then he is probably worthy enough to train his offshore replacement on the way out!.)  "Look up Corregio". How can he compare a clear mission of obvious importance in a time of war to his pointless exercise in petty tyranny?  If as boss, he wore that "I'm the only one in the world with a brain and a backbone" attitude where anyone could see it, the capable, honest and diligent subordinate he seeks found a better job and left long ago, no doubt earning his lasting contempt for not being "Loyal to a trust".  Still, if fortunate, he might be allowed to occasionally treasure the obsequious and cunning who have learned to humor him or even a competent person with low enough self-esteem to stay on.  Thus his chances under "the law of averages" are probably a bit lower than most.   "Laid-off".  His quotes indicate that he means this as a euphemism for deservedly fired.  In our current corporate world (that the author did not live to see of course), capable carriers of "messages to Garcia" whose days were never "limited by the whistle" are being laid-off, without the quotes, in droves.    One thing is clear, he can feel his own pain, and share it too.  And every boss, high or low, good or bad, government or private sector, in the whole world feels it as well, and they will pay for millions of reprints.  While there are undeniably some real and timeless virtues described in this tract but their value is negated by the simple mindedness and sheer egotism of the presentation.   *****  One star for content plus one for concision.  (Is this review longer than its subject?  I did not count!  
  Ironic that a novel by a writer who despised penny pinching and greed would have his novel published in such a way that to make a few more bucks the publisher makes the book literally painful to read.   The text is simply too crammed on the page, following lines of text is awkward and the lack of spacing simply makes the book painful to read.   Theres other editions of the book that are cheaper and properly spaced. What a disappointment this edition is. Shame on Signet for this ridculousness 
 First of all, this review is based on what I got out of this graphic novel.  I may be very dense and can't understand subtle humor of this nature.  I found several parts of this humorous, but most of the time I was confused and lost in the story and where it was going and why it was going that route.  Maybe it wasn't supposed to make sense and I just didn't get it.  It any case, the art was, to say the least, incredible and visceral.  I would definitely get another penned by this artist.  But the story left me confused and somewhat disturbed 
 By chance before picking this up I had just finished The Heart is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers, and was struck by the similarities and differences. It's a great "compare and contrast" pair, as an exercise for high-schoolers.  Both are written as first-person accounts by teen-aged girls and are roughly contemporary. Heart published in 1940, and Castle in 1948, both about life in the 30s.   Both families are poor. In Castle though, there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs. This is supposedly because they "don't know how to do anything". So instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter. How charming! They are "eccentric", which seems enough in the author's eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves. Only Stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper, enamored of Cassandra, does work and gives the family his entire salary. But he is of the class that is expected to toil after all. Even he is rewarded in the end--able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum Topaz--striking poses.  Unlike the looming and grinding poverty of Heart then, the poverty in the Castle never amounts to more than a lark--educated folks playing at being poor until they're rescued by romantic circumstance. Not so in America where Mick Kelly, who didn't know how to do anything either, went off to work at Woolworth's, and to a life of little hope.  In Castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina, the inheritance. Two dashing young wealthy Americans one of whom has inherited the castle, show up just in time, with their chatty modern mum. They throw money around and talk too much, in the cliched extravagant American style. Most of the remainder of the novel consists of Cassandra and her sister Rose swooning over one brother or the other, with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being.   It's all so very charming, bourgeois, and harmless. If your life is hard don't worry--a man will show up to rescue you!  The reviews for this novel in Amazon are overwhelmingly positive. Smith was obviously talented. Her writing is elegant and a pleasure to read. I wish she had given Cassandra a little more ambition. 
 I'm thankful for the books Shank put out and they were somewhat useful for those who believe the Bible about the security of the believer rather than the Calvinistic "perseverance of the saints." But there's a  better book out now: contemporary, exhaustive and irrefutable called  "The Believer's Conditional Security" by Dan Corner. Write for  more info 
 this sucks, thats all i have to sa 
 The concept of this book intrigued me: analysis of the first really postmodern president America had, a man who was known for scanning the polls before he had an opinion on any issue, and a candidate whose success was made possible by computer analysis of voter opinion. However, the work itself is quite tedious. There is not enough analysis of characters, and too many scenes explaining the political process. There is too much emphasis on the development of a plot that's tangential to the study of tehse characters, and there is not enough room given to them so that, in breathing, they might exhale what we can then diagnose. I didn't understand why so much emphasis was placed on the narrator, either, since his role was not central. While I read this book without political bias, I was not blown away by its quality as a read or a political novel, but the insight into a certain president's character, and how that made him a success, was intriguing. Not sure if I'd recommend it to anyone except historians at this point 
 I was more upset with this book than anyother. I've loved every book in the series , but this one was more dissapointing.  I pictured EVERYTHING the sasme as in the movie though... thatrs just telling you how welll it's written and described. But, it was more about the Triwizard tournament the whole entire time. Still, i am addicted to the series . Either way you should read the story just to understand whats going on. I just wish it would have been more exciting and less predictable 
 I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).    Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of "references" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.    I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."  But in this case it would seem: "With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet. 
 What's the point of this. They could have released all the movies including the rarer "Get Out of My Room" in one set. They instead pick the classic "Up in Smoke" which has already got a lot of extras, and probably their worst movie (debatable with "Corsican Brothers") and certainly least funny. That DVD had no extras, and there isn't any extras advertised on the front, so I'm asuming there aren't any. This also leaves the door open to more sets, possibly a "Nice Dreams" and "Next Movie" combo, which we don't need either. The "Up in Smoke" movie raises it to 2 stars which is as high as it will go. 
 Not sociology at all, as the title and the book's categorization would suggest, but a political diatribe. His examinations of society's fears only serve as lead-ins for the venting of his personal agenda. To wit: you shouldn't be afraid of plane crashes, rare diseases, single parents, pedophiles, homosexual priests...you SHOULD be afraid of...guns, corporate downsizing (a dated reference, it was 1999), conservative moralists in the media and..well, guns. Ironically, he chides Americans for having jumped to the conclusion, initially, that the bombing in Oklahoma City might be the work of Islamic terrorists; what a silly thing to worry about, when you could be doing important work- like disarming the citizenry. The assertions of Mr. Glassner's book are not liberal, not merely "left-leaning;" but are knocking on the door of socialism. This quote from his final summation: "But the United States is a wealthy nation. We have the resources to feed, house, educate, insure, and disarm our communities if we resolve to do so." Like his millionaire buddy Michael Moore, Mr. Glasser, having secured HIS slice of the pie, no longer has any taste for the vicissitudes of capitalism. Neither, apparently, is he a fan of our Constitution, generally, nor of the 2nd Amendment, specifically 
 	Linda Lawrence Hunt must have had a time machine.  She chronicles Helga and Clara Estby's 1896 walk from Washington State to New York City in her 336 page book Bold Spirit.  She did so, even though all were unavailable to her.  Helga Estby, a Norwegian immigrant, keep many detailed journals during and after her journey, but her family burned them out of spite and shame.  Helga Estby walked across America to receive $10,000.  She planned to use it to pay off the debts she and her husband Ole and their ten children had accumulated.  Or so says Linda Lawrence Hunt.   	Bold Spirit is ten percent fact and ninety percent speculation.  Gleaning from only a few newspaper articles, public records, and a few interviews, Hunt manages to produce a considerably long piece of what she calls non-fiction.  For all we know, Estby planned to use the money to open up an opium den.  Just because the Estby's were struggling financially and Helga was offered $10,000 doesn't mean she planned to use the money to pay off debts.  Sometimes people do things that don't make sense.   	Hunt's "primary sources" are questionable.  Biased and inaccurate press is as much of an American tradition as hot dogs and beer, and it was especially rampant in Victorian America, as literacy rates and newspaper production rates were increasing but rules about unbiased media hadn't been established.  While periodicals help supplement a biographical account, they should not be the foundation of it.  Because time makes memories fade, interviews of family and friends are just as inaccurate. 	Hunt assumes the political views of Estby and her daughter.  She assumes that Helga was a feminist.  Had Helga been as strong of a woman as Hunt portrays, perhaps she would have written a book about her walk, like she had planned.  Perhaps she wouldn't have taken her nineteen-year-old daughter with her on the 3,500-mile walk.  Perhaps she would have opened up a school or started speaking to the community about her walk.  Estby becomes incredibly apathetic after the walk; perhaps she was depressed because of the death of two of her children while she was away.  Perhaps because she and Ole were never able to fix their relationship after she was away for so long.  Perhaps it was because she was raped or hurt on the trip.  No one knows, not even Linda Lawrence Hunt.  This kind of speculative "non-fiction" should not become a precedent in the historical world. 	This book would have been enjoyable if it were historical fiction.  Hunt could have used her imagination as much as she wanted to do pretty much what she did in Bold Spirit: fill in the gaps left by the documents.  She could have spruced up the story and added plot twists.  Her writing style is insultingly simplistic. 	I would recommend this book to a fifth grader.  The writing style is easy enough to understand.  The plot is basic.  On the surface, it is an encouraging tale about a bold, courageous woman.  But anyone interested in historical integrity, an interesting story, or reading anything past a fourth grade reading level should probably stay far far away from Bold Spirit 
 Reading so many of these reviews, I don't get.  I really don't.  In my opinion, this is a major disappointment.  The main plot is incredibly contrived; the subplots are intrusive and unnecessarily complex; the dialogue lacks inflection, pacing and character uniqueness (Connelly should read Elmore Leonard); and the characters, for the most part, are wooden and one-dimensional (Milton=bad, Kiz=good, Janis=loyal, etc.)  Also, whenever necessary, the author resorts to "character facilitations."  Need a spying device?  Bosch has the ideal friend, who can provide him the exact house and navigation equipment.  Need news information?  The ideal reporter owes Bosch a favor.  Need good legal help?  The perfect defense attorney owes Bosch a favor. Need a Las Vegas cover?  You get the point.  I won't even get into the implausible, "wrap-it-up" ending.  It's been well-stated by other reviewers.  As I said, I just don't get it.   
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 This book is quite disappointing, and I (someone with no accounting background) find it boring and too easy--the manual for an accounting software seems more exciting than this.  I feel there is little about accounting in this book; rather, I find a huge section praising what accountants do.  I think if numbers give you a headache and you abhor math, you may consider laboring through this book.  Otherwise, try something else 
 The title of that song is "Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)" by Baz Luhrmann. It is sometimes also called "The Graduation Song." Thought I'd help you all out 
 Corrected review:    On September 1st, after using it five times to stir soft ice cream,  I used this spatula to stir flour into oil and it broke with the steel stem sticking out.  Amazon emailed the promise to refund this product but I haven't seen the refund yet. 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 ... after that it was a total disappointment. There was little to no useful information & constant repetition of the same interview pieces, historical perspectives & even the exact graphics throughout all 3 programs. I have no more knowledge of any facts behind String Theory than I did before. At best this could have been one glitzy & mostly pointless program .. instead, NOVA gave us 3 full hours that said the same things over & over & over again. With Brian Greene trying his best to be the second coming of Carl Sagan & failing miserably. Clearly a case of the producers stretching out limited content to fill 3 commercial time slots. I expected so much more & will look deeper next time before I buy.  
 The major problem I have with this translation is the awkwardness of its language. There are long, unwieldy sentences with twisted syntax. Sometimes, the translation is obscure. For example: "...and the will of Zeus was accomplished/since that time when first there stood in divison of conflict..." Not every line is as bad as that, however. There are some passages that read fairly smoothly, and the last two lines of the fourth book stand out. The translation as a whole, however, mutilates the English language. There are better options if you would like to read the Iliad 
 Lovely expert dance choreography for the viewer to watch, but this video fails as an instructional tool. The styling tips in the introduction, such as how to ask and how to accept an invitation, are quite helpful. This is one of the few dance videos that I have viewed which addresses dancing etiquette. It is very annoying to have the man drag the woman into a closer dancing position when she has already set her distance for a social dance.  The man's movements are shown with the male dancer facing the camera. Teresa Mason does a poor job of explaining the dance steps. The woman's movements are never broken down, and she supposedly simply does the opposite, but in watching the video, you can see that that is not true, especially for the turns.   Running the video in slow motion does not help matters. Teresa Mason needs to give a clear step-by-step explanation; the male dancers should face away from the camera and slowly walk through the movements. Then the female dancer should walk through her part. The dancers should go through the steps together slowly once more, and then finally at normal speed.  The video shows a variety of dancing styles, but trying to follow and learn even the most basic steps is an exercise in frustration. 
 We loved Murphy's "Henry the Fourth", but we didn't particularly like this book.  While the artwork is delightful, the rhymes are clumsy, and worse, the premise just is not very interesting.  At least, finding out what happened to the cow's utter-mittens did not engage my kids (almost 3 and 5).    On the plus side, the book did give my almost 5 y.o. and myself a place to start talking about even and odd.  And the way that the artist showed the pairs of mittens and the missing mitten in outline made it easy to point out what the story was taking about.    But I'd give this book a pass unless you are desparate to find an edutainment introduction to even/odd numbers 
 I bought a new state-of-the-art computer in February that came preloaded with Windows Vista. I was initially excited to get a computer that was running the newest operating system, and I hoped it would mean that my computer would have a much longer effective life. I have been nothing but disappointed since receiving this machine, especially knowing that had I called Dell, they would have installed XP instead.  PROs: -Better security (it prompts me & allows me to stop some of the annoying "automatic" programs that software makers sneak onto your system) -Better appearance (this is strictly cosmetic, and I'd rather stare at an ugly screen that worked rather than a pretty, useless one)  CONs: -FREEZING: I use this computer 2-3 hours a day and I can expect 1-2 freezes/day. Restarting often fails, and I have to cut the power and restart again. -DISPLAY PROBLEMS: although the cosmetics of the program were better, Vista can't display anything right. I tried updating the display driver which caused a major crash after restarting. I had to boot in safe mode and rollback the driver to get my computer back. Apparently, the newest display drivers are incompatible with Vista. -INCOMPATIBILITY: Entirely too many programs are incompatible with Vista, including some fairly big ones (lots of Adobe software, iPods, display drivers, etc.) I know Vista is new, and these software companies are slow to adapt, but does it really make sense for an operating system like Vista to render virtually all of my other software obsolete? Why can't Vista play nicely with the other kids? -ITS SLOW!!!-- Part of the reason I bought a new, state-of-the-art computer was to replace my old laptop (which still runs OK, but has become a little buggy & sluggish in the past 4 years). Although this computer is light years ahead of the old one, it actually runs EVEN SLOWER than my old laptop. Technical support has largely attributed this to the demands of Vista.  BOTTOM LINE: 1. IF YOU ARE NOT GOOD WITH COMPUTERS, AVOID VISTA LIKE THE PLAGUE 2. VISTA IS A RIP-OFF. Save your money and keep/get XP-- I'm probably going to return my computer and make the manufacturer install XP so I can regain some speed and system stability. Maybe in the future Vista will work OK, but not right now... 3. The incompatibility issues-- though there are several-- conspicuously include problems with Mac-oriented software (iPod, Adobe). I can't help but feel that Microsoft built-in these specific incompatibility issues in order to battle Apple 
 The Vicar is imprisoned for debt, lying on a bed of straw in a damp jail cell in 18th century England.  His elder daughter has died of grief after having been tricked, seduced, and discarded by a Villain.  His son, in the navy, has been dragged to jail in chains for trying to fight a duel, his other children and wife are starving, his house has burned down and the Vicar's arm severely burnt.  Now, let's see----what else can we pile on here ?  Oh, yes, another daughter has been kidnapped by ruffians.  What should he do ?  How about delivering a sermon on happiness and the benign nature of Providence to his fellow convicts ?  This dude is wildly na√Øve and over-the-top optimistic or I'm a monkey's uncle !!  If fantastic coincidences and deus ex machina moments are your bag, you are going to love THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD.  If you are also a "phan of philosophy", then you may thrill to this 18th century version of the Perils of Pauline salted through with sincere observations on Life and generously long moral soliloquies.  There are earnest lectures on capital punishment and the virtues of monarchy.  The benefits to society of everyone's remaining in their place are also touted.  But honestly, for 21st century readers, THE VICAR OF WAKEFIELD is not a novel to admire in a literary sense. The characters lack depth or subtlety; many move across the stage like puppets. I understand that as an 18th century work, it is of interest to scholars and students of English literature or maybe, literary history in general.  For them, Goldsmith's novel may deserve more stars---you may, indeed, enjoy the English language usages of 250 years ago.  But as a literary work, in comparison with all that is available to us now, no, I don't think it deserves more.  You can learn about conditions and ways of thought at the time by reading the book and it may indeed show the indestructability of the human spirit (as the Afterword in my edition suggested).  However, large numbers of other writers have shown the same thing, only they have done it better 
 Ok, I was raised VERY fundamentalist but I'm an agnostic verging on atheist and grabbed this book as something to help fuel debates with believers. It is ok in that it presents alot of different ideas, but it has very little depth to any of them.  And for god's sake, if you are going to refute christian theory with any legitimacy ya might not want to have typos all over the place 
 I agree w/ T. Morrey's review "Worst publishing I have ever seen, February 7, 2005".  I haven't even read the book yet, so this isn't a review of the content but rather the quality of the "publication" itself.  The book I received -- and paid $20 for -- appears to be a crude copy of an original publication, so far as I can tell.  I very much doubt that the copy I received is true a HarperCollins publication.  Looks more like a photocopy.  I'll be trying to get my money back for this one 
 I admit I found the left behind series fascinating at the beginning, but I've noticed a steady decline in the quality of writing in the last few installments books, and a slow homogenization of all the "Trib Saints," into a single character. Absent are the somewhat strong individuals from the earlier books. Instead Rayford and Buck are virtually interchangeable (only Buck cries more). Chloe the super-mom who somehow manages to run an international co-op (along with other stay-at-home moms), from a burned-out skyscraper is an irritating sanctimonious pest, worse still is the transformation of Rayford who has become a one-man Rambo. Ben Judah seems to have become a somewhat disturbing cult-like figure of worship for post trib Christians. Are we honestly expected to believe Ben Judah is the only one who can read and interpret Bible prophecy?  I used to love these books, but I admit, I am tired of most of the main characters. The characters are all egotistical, self-righteous and sanctimonious. They show no compassion for the sufferers who are taking the mark, and even seem to take a certain glee in baiting Carpathianists and unbelievers.  Carpathia himself has become a buffoon. A cartoon villain about as scary as any villain on a Saturday morning cartoon. While I liked the series, the authors were at their best when the Trib force were a 'small group' out to defend Christianity from the anti-christ. In the Mark, they are clearly running the show. Ridiculous.  2 Stars. 
 James Glassman should apologize for his stupidity, his arrogance, and this book, which lured in a whole lot of amateur investors just as the stock market was about to go bust.  
 The CD says Kid Koala/Carpal Tunnel on it.  The booklet is right also.  But I play this disc, and it's not Koala.  It's some chick rapping over breaks with lots of big band samples. Wtf.    I mean, it's not bad.  Maybe I'll keep it.  But, you know, I'd like the album I chose too....  Thought you might want to know, ye prospective buyer 
 Ok folks what we're dealing with here is a whacked -out cuckoo bird who's probably a few fries short of a "Happy Meal".  The cover alone has been doctored to make the face appear more authentic.  Come on people  have you no shame 
 Despite coming up with possibly one of the greatest ideas of the 20th century, Byatt, in all her annoyingly feminist glory, has failed completely to construct anything which might in any way interest even the most inanely boring person on the face of the planet. Each and every character is lacking in charisma, humour and, in fact, any other attractive facet about their personality, offering the reader no interest or reason for empathy, thus leaving no hero, so necessary to such a story.    Then there's the sub-plot literature which was all, unfortunately, written by the woman herself. To interlink the text with poetry and letters is, admittedly a good idea, but the quality is dire. Could it be more pretentious to fill a book with sections that the author herself admits will not be read by most? And chapter 10...just too long. So unneccessary.    This is, without a doubt, the single worst book I have ever had the misfortune to read, and would recommend it to no-body other than those who consider suicide by boredom a good idea 
 The quality of the recording on the Audio Series is very poor. It distracted from the message. I was expecting this to be a audio version of portions of the book, but instead they are poor recordings of his sermons. Tape 2 of 3 was a recording of someone besides Tommy Tenney 
 Well, I had to succumb.  I was attracted to this alleged film by it's notoriety as possibly the worst film ever made and a few of my friends who told me it was not that bad.  My low expectations for it were not only met but were exceeded.  This film reaches new cinematic depths.  It's complete ineptitude lacks even the charm of "Plan 9 from Outer Space."  It's stabs at humor are beyond pathetic they're just desperate.  Tom Green has to rank as the most unappealing screen presence, ever!  I felt sorry momentarily for accomplished actors like Rip Torn and Julie Hagerty who signed onto this dross but, hey, they cashed the checks.  Watching a few minutes of this slop is painful.  Enduring the full length of the film is outright masochistic.  To get the stench of this swill out of my consciousness I'm going to have to watch an actual good movie, like "Showgirls" 
 Does not work with non-Apple base stations! I had a PowerMac G5. I was told by Apple retail store clerks it will work any wireless G access points. But No! At my house my PC can see no less than 6 wireless AP's (some from neighbors, one mine). But this Airport card can only see one (which is an Apple Airport Station)! Tried everything ( Googled, set encryption modes,  slow downed my LinkSys WAP tranfering bitrate to 2Mbps etc...) and no luck. Returning it tomorrow 
 I think that I am clearly insane, but I did not like this book. Everyone else in the world likes this book, but i am the insane person who does not. And I'm NOT sarcastic! I could barly read it a second time. I hated this book. 
 Maybe it redeemed itself eventually but this was one of the few books that I quit reading 3/4 of the way through. For whatever reason, the historical counterpoint was more distracting than engaging.  I was also puzzled by the lengthy focus on the gender issues surrounding the volunteer light house keepers and wonder what compelled the author to make such an issue of every movement and vocal inflection.  To each their own but it is not something I would recommend 
 Very disturbing --on serveral counts.  i had high hopes for Stephan flash back for someone 2000 years old of his life,relationships with other women in his life and most of all understanding his feelings towards Beatrix. i had a hard time following the story line due to the sexual exotic scenes with him and the Daughters. i really did not understand the purpose of it all in holding himself in.  i love Stephan and my heart went out to him because there was so much guilt within himself, feeling bad about Asharti and mostly the fact that Beatrix left him.  i wanted to cried through it all because i guess the love i wanted for him he could not have and if if he express his love towards Beatrix his idealist ideas held him back 
 Okay people, Robert Redford is an ATROCIOUS actor. He is a Hormel hamslice prancing around as a vapid left-wing pooh bah. Witness the scene in this film when he is "tired" and answers the phone. Ha! Okay, but on to the movie.   The Candidate is apparently for those legions of people out there in America who think they're good enough, they're strong ehough, and gosh darnit they want to make a difference! Oh, but politics is so evil! Well, I would never want a politician like this wimpus calling the shots for me or my family. This film squanders what could have been an insightful look at political ambition, instead Reds-baby is, as always, doofus #1. It helps that the evil Republican is nothing more than a windbag spouting off empty rhetoric. HINT TO FILMAKERS: Movies are more dynamic when there's an interesting, well-defined villian.   But, as a political junkie there still was enough here to keep me mildly interested, if only because it's a great portrait of the McGovern-era vapidity of the Left. However, this film fails not because of any political predisposition, for it doesn't even begin to explore the origins of political power. 
 Evelyn Waugh once described this book as 'gibberish' and added that you could see James Joyce going madder by the page.  That said, it's quite amusing to read bits from 
 Jack London's efforts at social novels, such as "Iron Heel" and "Martin Eden" were failures, because they are very cardboard and unconvincing. Jack London, the master story teller of the juvenile boys adventure novels, had a social conscience, but was not very good with expressing the social issues of the day, issues which usually belong in manifestos, not in literature. Jack London was no Dostoievsky, a true literary giant 
 I received this book as a gift from a friend who raved about it. I gave it an honest try, but I found this book unreadable. Maybe it's the translation from the original Greek text, but the sentence structure was very hard to follow. That being said, I found Zorba to be the type of person I would actively avoid spending any time with. Longwinded, drunken, sexist, and generally unpleasant. The narrator was annoying in his hero worship of Zorba, also. This book gave me a headache, and made my temples throb. I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow negative stars. I found it to be awful 
 I love Jet Li, I collect all his dvds but this movie really [stank]! Don't buy it even for the collection! Nobody will notice that you don't have it 
 This cookbook may or may not be good: but was apparently written by Bob and Ruth Grossman, not Eric Flint and David Drake.  Although these two have collaborated on several great sci-fi military books, I suspect the Grossmans wrote this version of the cookbook as well as the paperback edition 
 This book was as much the author's opinion and imagination as anything else. He makes claims that are not substiantiated by facts, biblical or otherwise. I will not purchase further books by this author 
 As a major Ja Rule fan i was very disappointed when i bought this c.d..  i bought this c.d because i had the last c.d pain is love and that was good so i tryed this one and now i regret it. i dont even think it's worth listening to. this c.d. was so bad that it mad me stop buying real c.d's before i listen so now i get burned copies. it's not even worth burning.  the c.d gets 2 stars  1 for effort and 1 since im a fa 
 I had never read a John Grisham book.  But I am generally a believer in the notion that "if something is hugely popular, there must be a reason for it being so."  So I assumed there was something massively entertaining about John Grisham's writing.  A week ago I picked up "The Street Lawyer," and I was prepared to be entertained.  Boy, was I wrong.  This book stinks to high heavens.  This man cannot write.  "The Street Lawyer" is badly written, stupidly plotted, and riddled with banalities and cliches.  I could go on, with great fervor, for hundreds of words, about what makes this book abysmally bad, but I'm going to save my energy.  Please, just trust me, this book is terrible.  I shudder to think that the American reading public is engrossed by this man's words 
 This is a poorly written work with disconnected arguments and observations. The premise of the book is interesting: most of the works on globalization and cities either focus on economic issues or cultural issues--this book will attempt to do both. From this promising beginning, the book falls apart from poor writing that takes the reader all over the place--geographically and temporally. Within the first few pages of the book, the discussions goes from the history of London during the Roman Empire to the fate of GUM shopping mall in Moscow in light of the Asian financial crisis in 1997. All this shifting isn't done with a postmodern sense of irony (although a crude understanding of postmodernism informs some of the analysis) nor social science rigor nor insightful observerations of a keen historian. The observations on cities and their relationship with globalization is rehashing of conventional wisdom and are just simply pedestrian. After suffering through the book, I'm puzzled over how Oxford University Press could have published such a book 
 The late Julian L. Simon who decimated (and won a bet) with Paul Ehrlich summed up Mr. Gore's effort quite nicely: "The book is as ignorant a collection of cliches as anything ever published on the subject."  And, "Just about every assertion  in the book points in the wrong direction - suggesting that  conditions are getting worse rather than better, which they are."  Mr. Simon then discusses the following subjects on which Mr. Gore was WRONG:  soil erosion; hardwood trees; DDT; Agent Orange; Love Canal.  Finally, Mr. Simon states:  "And the entire book is filled with this sort of environmental gossip, backed by no sources, and contradicted by solid data."     These quotes are from Mr. Simon's "Hoodwinking the Nation" which has some excellent chapters on "media shaped opinion" and the mis-use of statistics, sampling techniques and data which every citizen should read 
 In recycling Blakney's translation from the 1950's, Signet is trying to get something for nothing, namely, your money for a lousy out-dated translation.  Not only does Blakney misread the Chinese grammar in several places, his interpretations are both under-thought and under-written.  If an inexpensive translation is what you're looking for, Penguin has a $5 D.C. Lao translation that isn't all that bad.  If, however, you want really excellent translations, here's my advice:  For a more interpretive Neo-Taoist reading, pick up Victor H. Mair's.  This is a good place to start reading the Tao Te Ching, in my opinion.  If, however, you want a truly excellent translation, Philip J. Ivanhoe has done quite nicely.  Moss Robert's translation is just as good overall, but also includes notes on the differences between the MaWangDui and Guodian texts compared to the Wang Bi (which is what he and everyone translates), so that'd be my ideal choice.  Don't buy this book, it's a cheap way for the publishing house to try and score some sales from nothing at all. 	I'm currently working on a research piece on translations of P'u in the English texts, so these critiques come as the result of my working with all these books 
 I bought this to replace a C-Strobe light I used as a tail-light on my bicycle.  The C-Strobe was bright, flashed bright enough to make car drivers complain, and waterproof, just not rugged enough to survive being run over by a truck when it fell off my backpack.  This one was by the same manufacturer with "strobe action" and 1/3 the cost.  It doesn't flash, the "strobe action" is the way it appears to flash as you go in and out of the side ring of light.  It isn't anywhere near as bright as the C-Strobe.  I'm going to get a C-Strobe later this month from a local boating dealer 
 Save your time, money and patience.  This may be the worst book I have read since the equally monotonous, predictable Stone Barrington novel "The Short Forever".  Wow, this one stinks.  Like others, I put up with the shallow characters, ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers, boobs and guns to figure out whodunit.  Unfortunately, this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid.  Who on earth did kill Vance?  And come to think of it, who gives a damn?  I don't what women did to Stuart Woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt.  Every female character, save for Isabel the maid, felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero.  Each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb, vacuous, self-centered and thoroughly unlikeable - hey a couple are even truly psychotic!  The only normal female character who spared Stone, Mary Ann, unfortunately has a room temperature IQ.  I am hardly a prude, but I lost count of how many women either Vance or Stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth.  Mr. Woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than I thought 
 Clifford Stoll wrote the highly-entertaining and engaging "Cuckoo's Egg," about his successful efforts to track down the person (or persons) who have hacked in to his computer network.  Unfortunately this book, which can be termed a cautionary tale about the internet and the world wide web (called back then the "information highway" or "information superhighway") has become outpaced by subsequent events to an almost absurd degree.  While Stoll's writing is still engaging, and his contrarian views interesting, so many things he discusses are (in his own words about the Internet) "stale, incomplete, misleading...or simply wrong."  The most prominent example is his assertion that " The Internet is a poor place for commerce."  There are other assertions in the book that are equally dated.  (Stoll, it might be noted, after calling the possibility of e-commerce "baloney," now sells Klein bottles on the Web.  So much for his predictive abilities.)  While it is certainly no crime to have gotten predictions about the growth and use of the Web wrong--after all, almost everyone did--this book, with its almost-Luddite overtones regarding the internet, is really not worth the time except as a nostalgia item 
 This book totally sucks! When I bought it, I was like, yes! a good book finally! But majorly, this book is the worst book ever! I repeat: DON'T GET THIS BOOK 
 Truly amazing. Finally a book that captures the essence of disgusting. Words cannot describe the dullness that drifts from the pages of Black Rage, like the smoke from a factory. A thought that could have been condensed into a sentence or two the authors have managed to expand into 200 pages of nothingness.  Though it may have started off as a cute idea, it quickly turned into a nauseating yet boring book. If you enjoyed Black Rage you may also enjoy the encyclopedia, thesaurus, or just sitting in a room for hours doing nothing 
 I'm making an exception to my usual practice of not reviewing anything on amazon, due to the utter vileness of this movie.  I saw it when it came out in theaters and hated it, and then a friend purchased the DVD and convinced me to give it a second chance...  all in all, this movie ended up taking about four hours of my life that I will never get back.  The performances are thin and uneven, the plot is inconsistent, and the dialogue sounds like it was pulled from fortune cookies made by the cast of Friends.  To be fair, this movie does face several major obstacles.  It has the misfortune to depend on the "acting" of glorified Ken doll Freddie Prinze, Jr. and the vastly overrated Julia Stiles, and in addition to trying to rise above these challenges, it also attempts to survive the intrusion of Ashton Kutcher.  It fails on all counts.    I do not hate the whole romantic comedy genre; nor do I hate the "teen" movie sub-genre, under which some would place "Down to You."  (In fact, "Can't Hardly Wait" is one of my favorite movies.)  I simply hate BAD movies, and this movie is a true abomination.  If you enjoy the experience of wanting to drill into your own skull, then by all means, buy this DVD.  If, however, you value your sanity, then please do not make the same mistake I did; stay far, FAR away from this movie 
  Even when I was entering my teen years, this wasnt appealing. Its too slow, forced anger, and no damn riffs? 
 While the concept was certainly revolutionary at the time this book was written, I found the story itself uninteresting and sexist.  I would not recommend this book. 
 Though I love his show, this book does not seem to have the outstanding qualities I expect from Jeff Smith.  You would be better advised to purchase his "Frugal Gourmet Cooks American".  THAT one is a treasure 
 i got this book because i am struggling as a woman to come to terms with male/female hostilities. and what immediately struck me about this book is that the author is going through a protracted, painful adolescence, and while he may be very intelligent he is emotionally immature. he is basically blaming some all-encompassing concept of "WOMAN" for the pain he is feeling about his struggles with his manhood. and other books such as those by lionel tiger also come across as deeply bitter and full of blame. but i think to place blame on women for your lack of strong identity is misdirected. your father was supposed to teach you the basics of being a man. if he failed to do that, then you will struggle for your identity as a man well into middle age. i think it's too easy to blame your demons on goddesses and witches and gypsy women...and i think these men are absolutely terrified to confront thier fathers, but making the hero's journey into the self and confronting your father is exactly what you need to do. i also think blaming feminism for taking the traditional male role away is a sop. men need to be men, regardless of whether their lady works or not. being a man is much more than providing financially. to have courage, integrity, requires true growth, not whining and blaming. this author reveals his immaturity right off the bat when he tells us he cut ties with his wife of seventeen years and three children, because he was in love with a younger woman, and then when the younger woman threw him over for a man her own age, his world fell down--and he proceeded to use yet another woman for sex to numb his pain. immature, and a little pathetic. the women in his life seem to be crutches for his frail ego. no wonder he had problems 
 Every pictures looks like they were tooks in 1940's. Chapter on electrical tools is completely outdated. Nothing about new material like HDF/MDF. There's no "easy to understand" drawing nor plans. For a beginner it's not very interresing, this books is more based on "reading" and explanations than showing "how to". I'd ratter recommend books like "Complete guide to furniture and cabinet making" by A. Ray 
 Captioning is a valuable service to provide for those of us who need it.  In the film "Miranda" there is no English closed-captioning track, and the only concession to captions at all is the track in Spanish.  I have noticed that British efforts are frequently released without captions, and in "Miranda" there are the usual modern faults:  nearly inaudible whispering, inadequate separation between dramatic lines and accompanying music, British terms and pronounciations which Americans need to hear more accurately, and so forth.  The use of Spanish subtitles does NOT help whatever in these matters.  Otherwise, I do believe Christina Ricci is suitably admired by the photographer 
  Amazing how Walsh, after having filmed such great classics, could have fallen so low. This is a film for young TV audiences. If you have absolutely nothing to do on any given afternoon you may find it tolerable too. Predictible dialogues, exaggerated stereotypes...  Plays better with the sound off 
 I read this book in the first couple of weeks my new life in Austria. Now, after having lived here for two years I can honestly say this book is terrible. There have been very few occasions where I felt that I could agree with the authors' assessment of Austria, in particular with regards to cultural obeservations. I can't help shake the feeling that the Author was a bored diplomat's wife who cobbled together a book after a few discussions with her ex-patriot friends. 
 Lee Server's biography of Robert Mitchum was a brilliant page-turning narrative of a fascinating, unique, and enigmatic movie icon. This book on Ava Gardner, however, is a disappointment, a poor choice of subject, and an ultimately tiresome account of a woman who had all the breaks and all the luck in the world and did nothing with them. It's a tiresome chronicle of her drinking and sexual excesses from which the reader learns little about life. It's really a sad, depressing portrait of a vapid actress who lived off her iconic beauty like a parasite. 
 this book sucks.  plain and simple.   i have some respect for the author, i've used his libnet and he's a funny guy.. but this book is garbage.  the last good thing mike schiffman wrote was libnet, and after that he figured why not just take it easy and write dumb books like this for the rest of his life, be a manager @stake and get paid way more than the researchers who are doing the actual work.   he goes into stupid crap like backdoors in inetd.conf, how outdated can you get..  what is this?  incident response to that crappy phrack article he wrote years and years ago about simple unix backdoors?  hah.  the real challenge here is for a real hacker to read the whole book and maintain his sanity 
 As I read each "chapter", I find that I can see her punchline coming a mile away. Notaro does a great job painting a picture of herself with these stories and I feel like she's sitting there next to me telling me how her visit with Nana went or how she's landed a job to get her mom off her back. But it's like you're listening to the loud girl at school. The one who wants every one to hear her funny story, but we're all kind of bored with her tales by now. Because she tries too hard and she's predictable. I can also tell by the gleam in her eye she thinks she's creating a hilarious set-up, but I know what she's going to say before she says it and. I really wanted to like this book, and I feel bad writing a negative review. Usually I just wouldn't say anything, but I'm compelled to let people know I'm underwhelmed.   It's not something I won't finish reading. But I wouldn't recommend it either. There are a couple of gems, and her subjects are all situations women in their 20s-30s can relate to (being the butch protectress of your hot friend at bars, using public restrooms, trying to get male attention, how to get drunk faster (skip dinner)) but for the most part, Notaro is trying to be really clever, but has taken a long leap past the clever line and landed just shy of annoying and blatant. If you want self-depricating humor and amusing family memoirs, spend your money on David Sedaris instead. It's not from a female perspective, but it's laugh-out-loud entertaining 
 I am a fan of Catherine Coulter, but it is just as well that I read this book after many others of hers, or I may not have become a fan.  It was pure drivel and very difficult to read.  I hoped that maybe it had a slow start, but no such luck, it was bad from start to finish.  Read her other books, but skip this one 
 If anyone would visit Dallas, Texas and the location where JFK was shot, you realize just how much disinformation has been written on this subject, especially this screen play. I found the entire screen play just a fatasy  of paranoid exploitation by a profiteer claiming to sell the truth! For  example, the grassy knoll is less than 30 feet from the road way, with an  easy 10 second slow jog, up a knoll about 3 feet high from the road way, to  the fence on the Grassy Knoll. If shots came from there it was easy for any  policeman to run to that area, let alone see anyone tryimg to shoot from  such an open area. Even a quick getaway is not as easy as this screen play  makes it out to be, since you can preview the entire parking lot for over  100 yards. Also, the distance from the sixth floor to the road is far  closer by observation that anyone can imagine, except for Oliver Stone.  These easy observable locations makes the Warren Report much more accurate  than this screen play. Also, the people who benefited by JFK's death was  the Democratic Party and its leadership not any right wing Republican  radicals? Johnson won overwhelmingly and the Democrats took even a stronger  positions in the House and Senate. Moreover, to support such a screen play  based upon the past reliability of the author in biographies that are  suppose to be real stories about real people is another reason to doubt its  integrity. Again, another example I can cite here is "On The Fourth Of  July" where Ron Kovic was beaten and thrown out of the 1968 Democratic  Convention, not the Republican Convention. What few know is that Oliver  Stone was a delegate to the Democratic Convention but this fact permits him  to change facts in this film based on poetic license. So be it, but such  behavior cannot be construed for the truth by a truth teller. The same for  this screen play, it is a great work of intentioanl fiction meant to poison  the minds of the reader to reasonable, objective and available facts, and  does it very well indeed, If the public prefers to remain blind, so be it!  Some will say these are stupid stories for stupid people, others will say  it is a great tale but please remember it is just entertainment. Well, this  screen play is a very entertaining story but please don't call it a book of  facts, truth and accuracy. It is a very good fable as well as the film 
 This book could have been so much better since the plot is really good. The writing here is a knockoff of Michael Crighton and really doesnt juve very well. I found myself skimming the pages after a while. The subject  of a super algorithm to translate code that has been corrupted is a good one and almost deserves to be written over again 
 This is horrendous movie. I will never claim it as the movie of my generation. It's one of the many reasons why I absolutely hate the "80's". The others are:Breakdancing, The Yuppie lifestyle,Power hungry businessmen/women, Women with manly handshakes, New Wave Music, and junk movies like this. I know that the main character is nothing less than a manipulator who is only concerned about himself, and what he can get out of life. He ridicules his friend because he's sick, and doesn't feel like driving Ferris around...especially in a Ferrari that mysteriously gets lost in the parking garage, so what am I left to believe I have to wonder if this is where Ice Cube got the inspiration for "It Was A Good Day". I don't care what decade it was, or what was cool back then, or now manipulating your friends is "NOT" I repeat"NOT" cool. I know with John and Johnette Q. Public this is something of a sexual relase. I could picture private parts of men and women everywhere getting soaking wet from this movie, and I find it so repulsive that everyone out there finds this funny. 
 Ahh, so the illustrious Robert Jordan has graced us with a prequel.  Great.  More Wheel of Time to digest.  So how was it?  Honestly, it wasn't that bad of a book.  Much shorter than his usual efforts, the pace moved along faster than his later WOT installments (for the most part), and some interesting stuff in there about the end of the Aiel War, Lan's part in that conflict, and his eventual meeting with Moraine.  Sadly, those storylines mentioned above occupy only the beggining and ending of the novel.  Pretty much the entire middle is filled with the same dredging, monotonous crap that ruined books 8-11: namely, women bitching at each other.  I clung to the hope that the female characters in the prequel would not be subject to the same plague of whiny, insecure, petty bickering than has infected every single woman in the later WOT books.  I was violently disabused of that notion.  Young Morainne and Suian are sad dissapointments.  They are not the young and inexperienced, yet determined and formidable women you would expect.  They are carbon copies of Elayne and Egwene - stupid, jealous, unbelievably fickle characters that make you want to scream.  And a good 1/2 of the novel regards their day to day activities in the Tower: fetching tea, worrying about the Mistress of Novices, staging sorority girl pranks, and all that other crap we've already been through with Egwene, Nyneave, and Elayne!  Get to the point!  Did the book really need to be written?  No, especially with the end of the actual series looming, and so many loose threads still to tie up.  All in all New Spring was not terrible, but I really wish RJ would focus his effort on producing a few good books to wrap up Wheel of Time.  Then maybe he can start screwing around with prequels - if anyone is still interested at that point, and the way it's going now, I would say very few would. Count me out 
 My best USB drive is the Lexar Media JDE512-231 JumpDrive Elite USB 2.0 512MB drive which I had for about a year and a half. But I needed more space, so I thought I would buy this as the upgrade since it's made by the same company and has the same brand name and they don't make the other model in 1 G anymore. This drive is very slow. I timed the same backup procedure on both drives, and my older 512 MB was at least twice as fast 
 I went with this unit based on the Magellan name but have been very disappointed. The Magellan name doesn't mean what I tought it did. It worked fine for a week, then became very sporadic at holding a signal. Tech support had me ship the unit back for repair, and it was returned two weeks later with the same problem. That led to more calls to tech support with long waits on hold only to be told I had to ship the unit back again for repair. I'm hold again now as I write this. Bottom line is that I've owned this unit for nearly two months and have gotten maybe 8 hours of use out it. Save your money. Buy another brand. Or just get a map.  
 This book is a big whine about the author having a poor mother and absent father. The group sending the mother on assignments and him having to be separated is no different than happens to children of corporate executives. The child missed his mother and blamed the group. Children were given tremendous freedom in the Rajneesh organization - who would complain about that?   Rajneesh is still the best selling author of spiritual books in India - if you are interested, read one of his 330 books, then decide (or search for readings online for free).  Swami Dhyan Sagar 
 Bryson is a pretty good writer. His prose is flowing and very easy to read. This book is 300 pages and I read it in 3 days.   My complaint is his lousy attitude toward people. He made fun of just about everyone but gave his most scathing comments to overweight woman. Plus, this is a book about traveling across America. I don't mind Americans complaining about what's wrong here. I do it myself occasionally. I don't mind people in other countries criticizing the USA. I make judgments about other countries, some unflattering. But there is something grating about Americans living in other countries coming back to travel the USA and taking potshots at our way of life and poking fun at the working poor. Stay in England if it's so bad here 
 Terrible, all around bad movie. Don't waste your time 
 Too intellectual! Too narrow! So cumbersome!  Additionally, the translation, from Greek to English, is definitely not accurate. There exists ACCURATE translations of this wonderful work of Herodotus. These intellectuals seems to have written this book to astound their fellow literati; not to expound the truth 
 Simply, a terribly written book.  It has a shallow plot, flat characters and no style.  His descriptions of people are often late, and tend to consist of someone's skin colour.  And that's all.  The story moves ok at first but degrades into the most uninteresting chase/camping trip in the history of the world.   The ideas presented are soft, touchy feely sort of "the soul is love" type crap.  Seems like it's a rip off of The Celestine Prophecy, which isn't something anyone should want to rip off in the first place 
 This was my first Carlotta Carlyle book, and I thought it was boring. I will not read another one. I love murder/mystery books and this was not a page turner. The ending was very disappointing 
 Nowhere in the description of this book does it say that you need J++ or Access, however, all the examples required them.  All I wanted to do was learn SQL, not purchase J++ and Access, nor did I want to learn them.  My goal (when I grew up) was to learn SQL as applied to any database, hopefully IBM DB2 
 I bought it new. After using this shaver a couple of times in a shower, it stopped working. I took it to a Braun affiliated repair shop. Braun wrote that the shaver has water damage to the interior, including the electronics. They said this is NOT a manufacturing defect and left the costs of repair to me.   I checked the manual before I used the shaver in the shower - it does not say that you cannot use it in a shower. I have not opened the shaver, I have not cleaned it in water.   Thus, based on my experience, this shaver and Braun are a scam as far as I am concerned 
 I thought that The Corn Grows Ripe was a boring book that I wouldn't recommend to anyone who wants to read a good book.  The reason I wouldn't recommend it is because it didn't have any exciting events and you never really got to know what a characters personality.  Throughout the book you never get to know anything about the main character Tigre.  In the book you keep reading and waiting for something interesting to happen but nothing ever does.  Also the plot of this book was about a kid planting corn because his father couldn't because he broke his leg and that is possibly the most boring plot ever.  It was set in a small village in the classic Mayan period.  I don't think you should read this book but if you need to I think you should be under the age of 9, because it is simple, has pictures, and it has huge font.  I don't think a boy would like it because it doesn't have any action it is basically reading about a normal life, and I think that, that's also why girls wouldn't like it.  I think the only type of reader that would like this book is a reader who likes reading books with nothing interesting or if they like books about the Maya 
 This overview of the cold war suffers from serious omissions. First, Walker neglects to describe some of the darker aspects of the cold war such as the crimes and atrocities associated with both Soviet and US backed puppet dictators. In particular, he never discusses how the US overthrew democratically elected governments in Latin America and replaced them with brutal dictatorships friendly to American businesses...Guatamala especially comes to mind. The oppression of Eastern Europe as it came under Soviet domination under Stalin also deserves more attention.   Second...the role of China in the cold war could also have been discussed and analysed in far more detail. Being the most populated country in the world, the Communist victory in China indeed was of extreme significance, especially during the Korean war when over a million Chinese troops fought the U.N. forces in bloody battles. China also played an important role in providing weapons and resources to North Vietnam in the Vietnam War thus prolonging a conflict which the U.S. ultimately lost.   Another aspect of the Cold War given little attention relates to the third world conflicts. A number of Soviet client states were established in the Middle East, including Egypt, and this contributed to the Arab-Israeli conflicts, especially the 1973 War. The civil wars in such countries as Angola and Ehtiopia, both related to Communist revolutionary insurgencies and takeovers also get minimal coverage.  Instead the author elaborates on such convoluted and monotonous topics as how the Cold War distorted the world monetary-financial systems. Thus besides failing to discuss important topics the author takes an exciting and intriguing subject and presents it in a boring and tedious manner 
 These are not what you'd expect from Wusthof. The Wusthof symbol on the handle is a STICKER (!!!) which bleaches out after washing. Also, after 1 months use and washing, we're getting rust spots. While these knives are sharp, they are not holding up appearance wise. Very disappointed 
 THE ONLY THING I SEE WRONG WITH THIS MOVIE IS THE TITLE BUFFALO SOLDIERS. WHY WOULD THE PRODUCER OF THIS FILM DISHONOR THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN ARMY MEN WHO ORIGINATED THE NAME BUFFALO SOLDIER. HE COULD HAVE CALLED IT DUMB SOLDIERS. THIS MOVIE POISONS THE MINDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO THOUGHT BUFFALO SOLDIERS WERE GOOD ARMY MEN WHO DID THEIR MILITARY JOBS WELL. WOULD IF I MADE A MOVIE CALLED TOP GUN, AND SHOWED YOU HOW SUBURBAN WHITE KIDS SHOOTING UP A HIGH SCHOOL IN COLORADO. AND WHATS REALLY SAD IT'S THAT NATIONAL CABLE TV WILL NOT SHOW DANNY GLOVERS BUFFALO SOLDIERS MOVIE. I SERVED IN THE ARMY AND THE MARINE CORPS, SO CAN YOU UNDERSTAND WHERE I AM COMMING FROM 
 The first scene in 'Strange Days' -- choreographed within one extended shot, for at least a few minutes -- is phenomenal in execution and possessing rare grit. The rest of the film doesn't follow suit.  It's not a bad film by any means, and that's why I think it's such a boring experience; the cinematography is at times stellar, and likewise in its finer moments (of action, mostly) it can resemble the direction of James Cameron, and surely that's a huge compliment. On this minor subject, I tend to think that being Cameron wrote and produced the film, he at minimum had to have a reasonable role in "creating" the film -- my guess is he probably helmed certain scenes, in place of Bigelow). I say "reasonable", however, because the overall result is far, far lower than Cameron has ever directed, both in flair, substance and intellect. It might be more disturbing in some respects, but that doesn't necessarily make it bold or reflective.   I really think, overall, the film suffers from its exaggerated sense of self-importance, when the storyline and characters don't provide much to empathize with. Therefore, the whole thing becomes a sort of drag -- one that just so happens to take place within a time and environment that's coated with a sordid ambiance. And regarding this -- what's with the seemingly anarchistic dystopia, only ---4--- years after the film was released? It seems the only reason they chose this time frame is to capitalize on, I guess, the fundamental appeal of "2k", but it has little relevance to the plot, if any. The problem, though, lies in the fact that the nasty, chaotic world in 'Strange Days' is far too unrealistic to be 1999 -- in terms of technology, first off (in concept it makes sense, but here we are in almost 2007 with no such devices; I'd say about 2020 might be a little more practical an estimate). Secondly, though, and more important, is the depiction of such a nihilistic mentality filled with sleaze. As has proved with time, we don't evolve from one state to another that quickly as a collective; in the four years between 1995 and 1999, a great number of things seem to have rapidly changed for the worse.   Still, we can, in retrospect, look at a film like Ridley Scott's sci-fi classic 'Blade Runner' -- released back in 1982 and depicting a Human dystopia circa 2019 (which also happens to take place in L.A.), and though we can ponder the ideas and sentiments of the picture, we can also see, living in 2007, that his portrayal of a world 30 years from now was simply too bleak and one that will hardly match up to the Los Angeles of 2019. Compare Spielberg's contemporary take on a familiar time period (I don't remember exactly; something like 2050 I think), and we see the enormous contrast between each film's reality. This is inherently a risk of sci-fi located in the future, of course, but as 'Blade Runner' and a handful of others have proved, how much of a film's predictions matches up with the coming reality is not of absolutely essential importance, as long as it possesses depth and ideas that evoke thought on a more subtle, universal level. Not only does 'Strange Days' lack conveying these things, it seems almost asinine that they were SO obviously off target (I mean, c'mon!) in throwing this world at us and claim it's only 1999!  Another thing I found within the film is that while it's dark and often grotesque, it's also unintentionally goofy. The acting ranges from good to pretty laughable, and these are by and large solid actors; one could argue the result in that respect is due to Bigelow.   For a similar themed movie I'd recommend David Cronenberg's 'Videodrome', though one must go into that with some particular cautions. Even more akin among the two is Ralph Fiennes character to 'Videodrome's protagonist played by James Woods; in the first half hour of 'Strange Days', I literally thought he was aping, or perhaps homaging, Woods' performance given the context.  Not a dismal effort overall, and it tries. As is pretty obvious, though, I for one don't care for it. 
         This album, overall, was not what i was expecting to get.  I thought I was going to get an entire album of songs like "The Promise", however after that opening and amazing song, the rest of the album goes into some sort of adult contemporary music thing.  Bottom line: this album is only worth it for the song "the Promise", unless of course you're a fan of adult contemporary 
 This album is all about sex and infidelity, is this all way Usher's life is about. This album contains to substance worth listening to. This album is a total waste of money. I like 8701 100 percent better 
 of stupidity! smoke on the water have the most stupid guitar rif of the rock history, boring boring boring, but if you like it ok 
 Waste of money.  Waste of time.  Well-known cast.  Amateurish direction.  Plotless.  Politically correct to the point of being stupid.  The film's incessant attempts at humor fail.  Eric Roberts' character laughs-off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film.  He is self-important, Godless and emotionally false.  It's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character.  The best performances in this film were given by Gregory Harrison and Lee Grant.  The best scene is Gregory Harrison and Eric Roberts' passionate farewell kiss.  Most authentic moment in the film: Lee Grant's reaction to her dying son being carried off.  Very difficult to watch through in one-sitting because it's so repetitive and vapid. You will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments.  If you choose to waste your time with this film, you'll be sorry you did 
 I bought this book because it was reviewed well.  I have no idea who liked it, or whom it is for.  It's definitely not an investor's book, despite the title.  It's more of a theoretical diatribe by the authors against Graham and Dodd -- read that instead.  It claims to be the updated version.  The preface mentions Enron, but everything else is from the 60s and 70s.  Examples talk about oil at $5 per barrel.  Overall, it's a disappointment, with very little that's useful or interesting 
 This book will be a relatively satisfactory read for people who have already bought the angel story hook, line, and sinker.  If you're looking to be convinced, however, look elsewhere.  All this book does is present a bunch of anecdotal stories (most easily resolved through rational investigation, misleading, distorted, or purposefully vague) and claim to have produced irrefutable evidence for the existence of angels.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the whole point of religion was to accept things on faith, without having to prove them empirically.  If I were religious, I would find this book somewhat insulting, since it devalues the message of faith and attempts to replace it with shoddy, anecdotal evidence.  I did find one disturbing quote on page 7, however: "more than sixty percent of Americans believe wholeheartedly in angels," clearly advancing the idea that something must be true simply because a majority believes it is.  This textbook example of a bandwagon fallacy underscores the shoddy reasoning present througout the entire book.  If you're looking for something rational, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a good piece of historical fiction, I recommend Orson Scott Card's "Alvin Maker" series 
      The layout of this book is 'perfect.' This small hardbound volume is that of a childs pocket book but manufacturered with the refinements of a valued classic newly put into print. The fonts are serious and straight in character... a little on the large size. The pictures are realistic in form. The appearance on the shelf is superfically excellent.       Promoters hype and judging the book by its cover can only result in disappointment. Had less attention been paid this volume I would use only slightly milder metaphors. The read is less than inspiring to other than a new adolesent female reader with less than spiritually nuturing parents. The content is unsophisticated and superficial about its topic and may tend to support the confussion it is addressing. This book is heavily promoted on the Authors name recognition as can be noted by the books cover.       The read is very short and simple. I felt obliged to finish the volume in order to say that I had completed the task, but was less than inspired by the lecture to turn the page. This is a very attractive one time read: a beautiful date that would have done better to never have started a conversation.       For all the professional production and publicized hype, this book is prefereable to teen romances but less incitful and less inspiring than the venerable Dr. Sues 
 OK, Mr. Koontz,  Could you please write a book that is not about dogs and how they are proof of god's existence.  This lame theme is more like preaching than entertainment.  Leave your retarded religious beliefs out of your books and maybe your stories will be good again.  Your novels used to be thriling page turners about survival...now they are just lame religious stories about god and dogs.  What has happened to you, Mr. Koontz?  Are you losing your mind?  Have fun at church...and don't forget to donate another $1,000 to President Bush.  I refuse to read any novel of yours that was written after '95 or so.  That seems to be around the time that you became a kook 
 This book includes basic information on mood disorders, including major depression, mania, and hypomania, all components of what used to be called manic-depression and is now known as bipolar disorder.  I found other books more helpful as far as scientific knowledge and explication.  I found Kay Redfield Jamison's books insightful, inspiring, as well as incredibly knowledgeable.  I found this book annoying, and it relied too heavily on the double whammy of an explanation or point made by one of the medical authors with a lay person follow-up by Nancy, a patient with bipolar disorder whose experiences and anecdotes are leaned on heavily throughout the book.   In trying to warm up what they perhaps feared might be an overly objective, medical reference book, which it is far, far from being anyway, the authors used Nancy as a device to humanize the condition.    I got very tired of Nancy and her loopy examples.  When not preening over the authors' attention as the pet subject of the book, she was just illogical and somewhat strident or annoying.  She had a very definite "voice," which to me was loud and probably possessing a strong New York accent.  I feel for Nancy and her experiences with this disorder, but her examples had no resonance for me and detracted from any actual information.   Go for Jamison definitely and browse through some other newer sources.  Skip this one 
 The book is an easy read but the connnections that the author makes are very tennuous.  He talks about coincidences in life but the stories he writes about are vague and far-fetched.  The style of writing is not all that creative so the book does not offer very much 
 This was my first book I read by Gertrude Stein, and frankly, it will probably be my last.  Her subject matter is bland and uninteresting.   I understand her rejection of conventional prose, and she does have a unique  style of writing, but I just don't like it.  I can understand and  appreciate why she wrote it the way she did, but it barely kept my  attention.  And her use of stereotypes was extremely blatant 
 Car!  For Arnie that is.  Arnie is a gawky, awkward teenage male with few friends and few skills.  But he does come across a car named Christine, which he proceeds to fix up and clean.  This car in turn comes to own him as it itself is somehow inhabited by an evil demon that allows the car to come to life at will, and cause accidents, run over others, and even asphyxiate one unsuspecting intruder with exhaust gas in its cabin.  Together, Arnie and Christine form a bond based on loyalty and violence.  The car makes him cool and he uses it to get even with his enemies and those that would hurt his car; the car in turn protects him.  Over the course of the book, Arnie turns from an innocent and weak teenager to a violent-prone and temperamental adult.  But all good relationships come to an end; and the book ends with Christine being crushed into a cube at a garbage dump.    This book is one of the shorter books of Stephen King.  Written in the early 1980s, it is readable by high school kids, and is easy to get through in one day.  There is minimal gore, some violence, and enough drama to keep one interested.  All in all, nothing fancy and nothing extraordinary from the king of horror 
 In the chapter about South Asia, the authors have written quite a lot about the "Kashmir problem" but not once have they mentioned the ethnic cleasing of 350,000 Kashmiri Hindus that took place in 1990. I just cannot believe that they don't know about this 
 I've visited the author's website and listened to an interview with her in which she raised a dichotomy: these days a lot of Americans "bash" the U.S., focusing on the "bad things" but few people emphasize the "good things." However, what the U.S.--and the world, for that matter--need are youth with the skills to critically analyze information and seek out the truth, not make simplistic judgements about "good" and "bad" based on blind adherence to self-serving ideals, principles or, in many cases, outright myths that pass for historical record. Her use of the word "bashing" to characterize any criticism of Americans seems to say a lot about where she is coming from. She gets one star, though, for urging parental involvement in education. But I will not be purchasing this book, based on what the author herself has said about it 
 I don't want to insult this book, because so many people hold it in such high regard. After all, it is listed on four respected Top 100 Book lists. But one thing is certain -- this book is not for me.   Now I am a fairly patient reader. But after reading hundreds of novels, and well over a hundred confirmed classics, I've learned what I like and dislike in a novel. This book has much that I dislike. It saddens me, too, because I went into it expecting a really great read. However, it is my firm belief that reading fiction - even highly challenging fiction (which this is not) -- should be a pleasure, rather than a chore. Therefore, after enduring 300 pages of unending tedium (with another 550 pages to go), I chose to quit and move onto something else. I have to admit I felt pretty guilty about it, too. But soon after, when I found I was enjoying a software textbook far more than "An American Tragedy," I realized I had made the right choice.   You must decide yourself whether or not this is a good book. All I can do is explain what I don't like about it.   1. Page after page, every thought and action of the primary characters is meticulously and exhaustively analyzed (think of "Crime and Punishment," or Stendhal's "The Red and the Black," taken to a ridiculous extreme). I have always hated this kind of "psychological" story telling. Ugh.   2. Dreiser frequently uses long, serpentine sentences and narrative passages that constantly interrupt the flow of the story. They are crammed with double negatives and distracting tangential side trips (think: Hawthorne). In my opinion, this is why Dreiser is largely forgotten. His modern contemporaries left this kind of wordy baggage behind. For this, I am eternally grateful.   3. Many thoughts and worries are driven home again and again. I find this obsessive repetition to be unnecessary and tiresome.   4. In spite of Dreiser's extensive character development, his humorless and detached style leaves me empty and uncaring.   5. The main characters are constantly unhappy with their circumstances, no matter what they achieve, or what opportunities or good fortune come their way. They ride emotional roller coasters of indecision and always crave more (think "Sons and Lovers").  I don't even want to associated with this kind of people, let alone read about them. Doesn't the world have enough materialistic whiners?  If you enjoy wordy psychological novels, then you will probably think this is a tremendously great book. By all means, place your order and enjoy. Many of you will love it. I hope you do!  If, like me, you prefer lean prose that gets to the point and lets you figure out a thing or two on your own, then you may want to leave this one behind. If this is the case, try reading Booth Tarkington, John O'Hara, Sinclair Lewis, James T. Farrell, or Scott Fitzgerald. They write about the same era, and address many of the same issues (class, status, social climbing, and sex). However, they do so with a much livelier style 
 I'm taking a college course and this book really bites. Reading it just leaves me in a daze. He goes on and on about how this method won't work and that method won't work which completely covers up what we need to learn. I'm getting 98.18% in the class on term 8 of 10, but it's not due to this book. Unfortuneatley I'm stuck with the book because it's what the school uses. Find another one 
 I honestly have to say that this novel was not very satisfactory. The basic premise was quite interesting, but the overall execution seemed fairly amatureish. Most of the sci-fi touches in particular were pretty laughable. Wilson's "The Philosopher's Stone" was much better 
 BOOKLIST claims that "buried within every true baseball fan is a Nerd with a calculator and a scorecard" - a statement mildly amusing if not deeply offensive to 80-90% of the nation's dedicated baseball fans. There  is far, far more to this beautiful game than mere number-crunching. Try  poetry, drama, romance, myth, legend, simple competitive excitement. This  book seems to miss the other 80-plus percent of the game and those other  80-plus percent of the readers and fans. And even for those who would  rather sit in front of their computers than in the outfield bleachers, the  author's measure of hitting greatness is at best the most narrow possible  measure - the standard but highly unrevealing category of batting averages.  There is much ado about nothing here 
 I am enraged!!! With all the great bands out there whose music is unavailable on CD, and there are 3 CDs of drek unloaded by this wanna-be variety show loser pile o'poop on this website. There is no justice in the world. While great psych and progressive rarities, highly talented rock bands of the 70's and 80's, and great albums of recent vintage that are sadly out of print languish in dank record company vaults, you can get not one, not two, but three CDs filled with the tackiest, most meaningless, crap ever released by a record label?!?!?!? AAaaaaarrrrrrrgggggghhhhhhhhhh!!!!! I cannot think of one group I'd rather NOT listen to more than these guys. They even LOOK boring. But this music is too bad to be boring, and they have sentenced themselves to endless purgatory by releasing what has to the most tasteless, weirdest and vilest version of Chuck Berry song ever with Hail Hail.....and that one of the "members" calls herself Taffy should tell anyone all they need to know without removing that shiny silver disc from it's plastic tray. To anyone who may find themselves in possession of a Starland Vocal Band disc, do everyone who may be in earshot a favor, leave it wrapped in it's shrink, toss into a garage can and run away. You'll thank yourself in the morning. -10 stars. Truly wretched!!! 
 I purchased this item last May, and although at first I was thrilled to have an automatic litter box, I soon realized that it was very noisy, difficult to clean (container holder is flimsy, gaps between holder and box mean litter spills out the side & underneath. To cut down on the mess, I purchased the tent to keep the litter inside.  Very bad idea!  Tent is flimsy, ripped upon assembly & makes it extremely difficult to empty box.  It seemed I was spending as much time maintaining this box as I was a regular litter box.  I was just about to order replacement cartridges (which don't really snap shut, by the way, when you go to take them out) when I decided to see what else is out there in the world of automatic litterboxes.  I purchased a Purrforma jumbo box, and, so far, it is wonderful.  It is sturdy, has a huge hood that you just lift off, is so quiet that it doesn't need a sleep timer like the littermaid one.  It is well thought out and I would urge anyone to spend the extra dollars to get it, it's a small price to pay for your sanity 
 I have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio CDs from the library. I was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. He sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in "w" - it drives me mad. He reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on.   I am a big fan of audio CDs because I can listen to the stories while doing other things - I'm not tied down to the couch. I have listened to many narrators - Jim Dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. Charles Frazier may be a "brilliant" author, and should stick with writing - period! Leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life 
 Surprisingly sleaze and Chauvinism by female Director Heckerling! She duplicated it in Chevy Chase vehicle National Lampoon's European Vacation too! Many child actors got their start here, but the thing that cracked me up,  as I saw it when it came out (unfortu- nately) was the dialog of my fav band, Cheap Trick: Ticket scalper "...The magntism of Robin Zander and the  charisma of Rick Nielsen...and what about the tunes, 'I Want You To Want Me, The Dream Police...nan-nan-nah, 'You're momma's alright, your daddy's alright, they just seem a little weird, Surrender, surrender...", before he's  interrupted. If that isn't somebody's idea of 'Surrender', they've stumbled  onto this review by mistake 
 About the only thing this album is worth is the inclusion of the original mixes of Boyz N Tha Hood and Dope Man. They aren't that drastically different than the versions that appeared on Eazy-Duz-It and Straight Outta Compton. There is also the lame clean version of 8-Ball (NOT the original song, but a clean, radio version, which is only interesting in that it was on the D.O.C's "It's Funky Enough". This hodge-podge was thrown together by Macola more-or-less to make some money off of NWA, whose future at that point was up in the air because Ice Cube was off at college. The songs came from the "Boyz" 12", the "Panic Zone" 12" and were rounded out by D.O.C.'s Fila Fresh Crew and the song "Scream" by Rappinstine, which was later replaced by "A Bitch Iz A Bitch" when Ruthless got the rights back to this album in 1989. (That song was originally on the Express Yourself 12" and is now a bonus track on "Straight Outta Compton" as well).  This is interesting more or less for historical purposes, but there's nothing on really that's all that important. Aside from the original mixes of "Boyz" and "Dope Man", this is for die-hards only. The rest is 2nd rate typical early/mid 80's generic rap, which gives no indication of what would follow. 
 I believe in the every growing rate of sophistication in our country and I'm sure with books like this we can take our government more seriousl 
 Poor Ms. Furtado can't seem to come close to her "Whoa, Nelly" CD.  I found this CD to be mostly boring, and do not recommend it 
 I was very disappointed to discover that this book had a homosexual character. This is absolutely inappropriate for a young adult book, and unless a parent has read the reviews that mention it, said parent would have no clue as it sure isn't mentioned anywhere on the blurb in the book.  I usually am more aware of what my daughter is reading, but this time this particular book slipped under my radar.  She told me that it had a reference to a gay character, which I took to mean just a passing reference, but when I read the book, it was treated more seriously than I thought, even going so far as to have the two girls kiss.  It is inexcusable, both on Ms Pierce's part and on Scholastic's.  No matter what the author's personal beliefs, it is irresponsible to have this type of content without a warning to parents. I believe that as a parent, I'm the one responsible for what my children see and do, but it sure helps to have some type of information so I can make an informed decision.  Anise Hollingshea 
 I thought this book would be more representative of the sensationalist reporting the media has been shoving down the throats of Americans for the last few years.  Instead, this book essentially says there is not enough of this over-sensationalized baloney, and it begs that the media produce more in the name of our founding fathers.  If you dare to go there, check this out from the library.  This drivel is not worth your hard earned money 
 I found this book to be poorly written and repetitive.  Needed some more peer/editorial reviews before going to market.  Could not even get past the first 3 chapters 
 if you like guitar virtuoses and great solos don't buy this album I hate it.  You must try beehive live its great and a lot of jams in i 
 This book does not go beyond  a superficial description of the interiors of the bistros.  The writers completely ignore the food and there is not one description of a dish one may expect at any of these establishments.    It is of no value to anyone requiring guidance to select  an authentic Parisian bistro 
 You too can play this at home.  In order to do this you will have to have your favorite alcoholic beverage handy.  You are going to need it to get through this book.    Start when you read and take careful count.    Every time a character engages in a perfectly self evident conversation with another character take a drink.  An example of this would be: The Americans didn't think we could take Pearl Harbor we proved them wrong  Or reversely  We didn't think the Japs could take Pearl Harbor we thought wrong     Every time one character makes a really bad joke and everyone in general vicinity laughs take another.  For instance a character named Dole is introduced just so later on characters can say "Dole will be on the dole by god"  (hahaha was this kind of humor every funny?  Harry buy some more jokes for god's sake)  Every time a male character has sex with a female character take another drink  Every time a female character has sex with a male character take another drink  Every time the fishermen from Japan reminds us that he can't really speak English all that well take another drink.    Every time someone American of Japanese remarks how unnourished the American P.O.W are take another drink.    Overall-I would go on but were I to continue you would likely die of alcohol poisoning and I don't want that.  Harry please get your stuff together, you were a great writer at one point what happened?   The book is not awful, just completely and utterly predictable  
 This was a wishy washy attempt at the truth. The facts are there in parts and pieces, but it was not really put together well. Some of the choices of material are questionable as being truly valuable to the topic. This DVD had an agenda and is not unbiased, and I think it failed at it's overall agenda. There is more than enough information pre-9/11 and post-9/11 to put together something more worthy and accurate than this DVD has attempted to do. If this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond, we are truly in trouble. The truth is out there, and I think this DVD tripped over them and kept walking without looking down and gathering all the facts together. There were plenty of important facts and things said worth listening to on this DVD, but this DVD is maybe worth a glance, but not a long hard look. 
 After reading this book, I would like to make three points about it:  1.) First of all, DON'T MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST DEAN KOONTZ BOOK.  This is the second book of the so-called Christopher Snow trilogy.  Read the first book in the trilogy first -- FEAR NOTHING.  The first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book.  2.) Second, please be aware that Koontz has yet to write the third book in the Christopher Snow trilogy.  This is a real shame, because SEIZE THE NIGHT ends on a cliffhanger of sorts.  Koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday, under the title RIDE THE STORM.  But since it's been over eight years since Koontz has written a Snow novel, I wouldn't expect this book anytime soon.    3.) Third, I must admit I didn't really care for this book at all, and I say that as a Koontz fan.  Lots of padding -- the action doesn't really start until page 250.  Koontz wastes a LOT of space repeating things he originally wrote in FEAR NOTHING.   I found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts.  The plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel, killer monkeys, alternate realities, serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Even the characters in the book don't seem to take any of it seriously.  All the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic.  I was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book.  It was just too silly for my tastes.  Koontz is a great writer, but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable, fast-paced plot.  Instead of this book, I would therefore recommend WATCHERS, INTENSITY, ODD THOMAS or VELOCITY.  
 My book club selected this, and I will admit it should generate lively discussion, if only because some of us will hate it, and some will like it.  Personally, the new-agey spiritual narrative nauseated me.  This lady whips out her personal altar at the drop of a hat; she is "stunned" by personal revelation to such an extent I wonder that emergency rooms around the lake weren't on high alert for her presence; she finds signs in things most normal people wouldn't even notice.  While she writes about a spiritual journey,and personal transformation, ultimately, this is a story about a frustrated housewife who is figuring out how to get on with the rest of her life and needs a slew of new-age speak to get there 
 This book, while offering some good guidelines for general fitness, does not have adaquate, specific, workout plans to address the various areas of fitness. Any book by Stew Smith, especially Maximum Fitness, or The Boot Camp Workout does a better job without all the high-and-mighty "I am a trained professional so just do as I tell you" attitude that these authors show. This book is written by several different people and as such. lacks continuity and a definitive workout plan. Alot of it comes across as the various authors' opinions. Do yourself a favor and buy Stew Smith's books instead 
 One of those books which is more fun and rewarding to discuss than to read 
 there was this girl--maybe a freshman in high school--who seemed to possess all that indispensible boy-girl scoop?  You know, like where the noses went when you kissed and stuff like that.  But once you got a little older, that same know-it-all girl was just an embarassment because she knew very little--but her confidence in what she did know fooled us all.  The point is this author is similar.  She has a big fan base, is able to sell her books as trade paperbacks--which at [...] is a big investment for most readers--and once you've read around a little bit you realize this is the most lightweight stuff and really not worth it.  Her female lead is supposed to be zany but in reality is mostly flaky.  The male lead is a little more complex but not by much.  There are the standard charming, slightly wacky oldsters to add a little wit to the mix and her hook for this book--oooh! Ghosts with a desire to unite couples through really lame stunts!  There are many MUCH better written series romance books available and at this price you could buy TWO solid reads that were written by authors who had committment and pride in their work 
 This title is billed as the Sixth Edition, and reflects the coming and going of co-authors.  It is too bad that the editor had so little influence. Sections of this book that stick to their cartographic knitting are excellent.  Historical information is very intersting.  Basic explanations, such as the evolution of ellipsoids is very well done. Some  of the writing is so bad it could have been extracted from a sophmore term  paper, sprinkled with such inept phrases as "such as",  "similarly", "however" and "in fact". The  most glaring deficiency is in the area of computer technology.  Either this  material has not been updated since some earlier edition, or the author(s)  are very uncomfortable with the subject matter.   As examples: "Most  common procedures used by cartographers have been translated into software  programs written in special computer languages such as FORTRAN and C."  "Today's well-rounded cartographer is routinely involved with these  'canned' (prewritten) mapping programs..." "The professionsal  cartographer should, therefor, have a working knowledge of at least one  computer language."   We are regaled with three pages of detailed  obselescent material on computer structure, but only 23 lines of overview  on current instrument technology.   There is a whole chapter on fonts and  lettering, but no algorithm for conversion from Lat-Long to UTM. The  central meridians for the UTM zones are not provided, nor is the DoD  lettering scheme. One of the responsibilities of a text book is to arrange  the subject matter in a structure where it can be easily referenced.  This  book reads like a series of articles of varying quality published under one  cover, with overlap resolution left as an exercise for the reader 
 The premise of this book is marvelous and refreshing. Francine Prose believes in close textural analysis alla the New Critics, is horrified by the twin curses of best sellerdom, speed reading and speed writing, thinks creative writing courses are a crock (good for you old girl! about time somebody exposed that racket), and holds with the Greeks that while good writing cannot be taught, it can be learned by emulation of the greats. At long last, I thought, a corrective to all that bad fiction being written today and an antidote to all that book club drivel being fobbed off on unsuspecting readers as great literature. Could this be the book that finally delivers us from the scourge of `hysterical realism' (Rushdie, Pynchon, DeLillo, Franzen, Foster Wallace, Zadie Smith)? It is clear I had high hopes for this book. But I figured anyone who questioned the legitimacy of graduate English studies deserves our respect.  The book had received glowing reviews. But there is so much hype in the publishing industry I rarely purchase a book based on reviews, especially at today's prices. I reserve the book with my library system, and buy it only if it passes the smell test. I waited weeks for "Reading Like a Writer," and while I'd like to report that it was worth the wait, I cannot. After a slogging through three chapters, my heart sank. Despite her love of good writing, Francine Prose's approach to the subject is plodding, humdrum and idiosyncratic. She begins with individual words, then methodically proceeds to sentences and paragraphs in the fashion of a writer of college textbooks. Francine Prose is that curious phenomenon, an accomplished writer of fiction who cannot write interesting prose for sour apples. As you would expect of any disciple of the New Critics, her analyses of great writers are always spot on; but that is not the challenge of a book like this, which is to write ABOUT inspired prose IN inspired prose. A curious irony: here is an author who loves eloquent writing, but who writes about it in only serviceable textbook prose. (Frank Leavis she is not.)  There's a good deal of redundancy in this book. What aspiring writer needs to be told how exquisite the final paragraph of Joyce's "The Dead" is? In contrast, her bibliography of great writers is remarkable chiefly for its eccentricity. I can't pretend to have read all of the titles on her list, and I refuse to dismiss books on the ground that I've never heard of them; but a few of them I do know, and know well. For example, F. Scott Fitzgerald's "Tender Is the Night" is NOT a successful novel, not even close. Don't take my word for it: Ernest Hemingway complained that the book was a thinly-disguised biography of Fitzgerald's rich friends (the Murphys). At the risk of sounding caustically proscriptive, I found Thomas Pynchon's "Gravity's Rainbow" unreadable*. And is "The Perfect Spy" really John Le Carre's best novel? Hardly. It may be a 'literary' success in the conventional sense (it preserves all the Aristotelian unities), but it has none of the cold war drama, lyricism and descriptive poetry of the George Smiley novels. I'm afraid the definitive book on the art of fiction has yet to be written. (And to be fair to Francine Prose, maybe it never will be.)   * For more on the self-conscious zaniness of `hysterical realism' see "The Smallness of the 'Big' Novel: Human, All Too Inhuman" By James Wood, The New Republic, 7/24/2000; and Tell Me How Does It Feel: US novelists must now abandon social and theoretical glitter, says James Wood, The Guardia 
 "Othello" is a play that will show you how unredeemable human beings can be.  It'll make you question everyone, along with his or her motives and beliefs.  It also shows you how men lusted after women in the late 16th century, but how women could not lust after men.  The double standard was put to the test, and, as always, women lose this battle.  Women may sell themselves as whores, and are ridiculed for it, but the men who use their services are overlooked.  This is a foul play and I think Shakespeare held women without regard. Othello was a despicable man who had little self-esteem I do not recommend 
 or don't be confused by the 'group offer' like I was...this is not THE Art of War...the end didn't justify the means!  waste of money!   First time in 5 years I have been totally, unequivocally disappointed in Amazon and their 'tie in' up sell, 'you'll like this as much as [Fred]' feature.. 
 I am amazed at the positive reviews I have read about this book. Unfortunately, I took their advice and bought it.  The book tries to follow the approach of teaching by example by developing compiler/interpreter components and utilities in C++. Unfortunately, the book reads more like a computer program printout, and rapidly becomes too boring to follow.  There is very little theoretical background to the concepts behind creating compilers and interpreters. Attemping to learn from the C++ code will rapidly confirm that the code is of very poor quality, and seems to be a bodged conversion from C rather than a native C++ development.  Avoid this book at all costs. It is especially dangerous for C++ novices as following the code will teach bad practices and lead you to believe that C++ is just C with classes. It is useless for experienced C++ programmers who wish to learn about compiler/interpreter programming techniques 
 DeMille has done a rotten job with this book.  Aspects of the plot(which isn't too bad) are never resolved.  If you must read this badly written book, wait until it goes on sale. 
 The first thing I did when I got this book was to look up what the author had to say about the Moynihan Report (thinking that based on the subject of the book the author would have many interesting criticisms).  Alas, all that existed was a few sentence dismissal.  After that I couldn't take the book very seriously and just jumped around to various things that I found interesting.  Some things were interesting, others were foolish.  
 these people who give this soundtrack 5 stars are sick in the head you cant be serious this is pure junk they act like this is classic music this stuff is tras 
 I admit that this was a light read.  I found the premise very interesting, and I didn't want to put the book down.  While there were some small places in this book where the writing was very good, much of it wasn't.  As well, I found some grammatical errors that irritated me.  Finally, I didn't like the main character, and not because she was a prostitute, but because her personality was very weak, flakey, and passive aggressive.  I found her very one dimensional.  
 Like other reviewers have mentioned this book is poorly edited, poorly written, and clearly a simple attempt to cash in on the 3E-3.5E switch.  Do not buy this book if you like the Realms. It is full of pointless rules, poor art, and useless content.  One of my largest pet peeves about this book has to do with the art in the beginning. It has characters of different races and ethnicities labeled incorrectly. Someone should tell the editors at WoTC that there is more to editing than grammar and spelling.   
 I was hoping there would be some new info in this book, but there was none. ZIP!!! I still find it interesting that after running a stop sign and killing an innocent driver, that she still has NO comments. None of her friends think it was "a big deal" - that they all just "moved on."  Moved where? In the State of Washington she would be charged with vehicular homicide. It's a serious charge here. I can't help but wonder had it been Hilary Clinton, what the thoughts would be. Lots of reference to her "sorority sisters" - which was annoying. But in a way it helped me to understand exactly where she came from and why she is the way she is today. Don't buy this book 
 This book attempts to defend globalization by providing counter arguments to each of the human rights groups and environmentalist's standard attacks against globalization.  The author generally makes the argument that globalization may, on the surface, appear to the Western/first world mind, that it is damaging the environment and enslaving the natives, but the author points out, considering how little they had before, it's an improvement... an improvement which will cycle back around and, with each subsequent cycle, a higher standard of living will be realized.  Some of the author's arguments go something like this: "Before these people had no jobs, now they are making 35 cents an hour, I'd say that's an improvement". [MY COMMENT: And the multinational corporations are more than happy to take advantage of this "improvement"]  "Maybe they work 16 hours a day, even children do, but what do they want... everybody has to start somewhere." [MY COMMENT: And the multinational corporations are more than happy to exploit the hell out of these people while they "get their start"]  "Sure... maybe they dump tons of toxins in the streams and lakes but that's what the U.S. did in the 19th century and look at how powerful this country eventually became." [MY COMMENT: And the multinational corporations are more than happy to save a fortune by not properly disposing of toxic manufacturing byproducts]  The author argues that, in time, globalization will lift 3rd world countries out of their poverty since these 3rd world countries will be taking the inevitable incremental steps towards eventual economic prosperity.  He argues essentially that any prosperity is better than none, prosperity breeds more prosperity, the natives become educated, and eventually will advance their economy to a greatly improved situation, one in which exploitation is not tolerated ie. laws are passed against it. Of course this ridiculous fantasyland argument ignores the simple fact that there are billions of people in the 3rd world, all desperate and ripe for exploitation.  Once one 3rd world country or region makes any demands of the multinational corporations, they've just lost their dirt wage jobs as the multinational corporation will move on to another 3rd world country (as there are plenty to choose from). I'm certainly not against Globalism and free trade but it must be done in a humane and fair way.  I believe this can be acheived AND the multinationals can still make a huge profit.  For example, let's say my company sets up a factory in Bangladesh to make widgets.  I'd first research Bangladesh and determine what is considered a respectable wage, a wage in which a person can easily live on (maybe even supporting his/her family).  Naturally this wage would be nowhere near Western standards, but it doesn't have to in order to be a fair/respectable wage for said country.  Maybe on the order of $1.10/hour (that's a lot in Bangladesh and would afford a fairly comfortable living, by Bangladesh standards).  I'd also setup a free health care clinic for my workers and maybe even a school for their children (all can be acheived for very very little in U.S. dollars).  Finally, I'd make pains to meet basic environmental standards.  Setting up my factory with the above standards would still be a fraction what it would cost me in the USA.  Shipping the goods to the USA still wouldn't hurt my bottom line that much.  In the end, I'd make out like a bandit and I could sleep nights knowing that I was truly elevating the lives of my workers in Bangladesh.  Bhagwati's model fits beutifully with what I have outlined, ie. the CORRECT way to do globalization.  The above scenario is nothing I came up with, as it is actually done by a handful of smaller companies that have chosen to outsource their production to a 3rd world country; but kudos to them because they are doing it the proper way.  The problem is that the vast majority of the giant multinational corporations which outsource to the 3rd world are in a "race to the bottom" in terms of wages and environmental "standards".  They couldn't care less about the local environment nor the working conditions of their slaves ie. "workers".  It's about quarterly profits, meeting Wall Street's forecasts, profit, more profit, and as much profit as humanly possible.  
 I bought the bottles and when I used them all the milk came out and get all the baby we 
 Bev Harris, Black Box Voting: Ballot Tampering in the Twenty-First Century (Plan Nine Publishing, 2003)  The first thing that needs said about Black Box Voting is that Bev Harris has some things to say that people certainly need to hear. And since the release of this book, things certainly haven't gotten better; electronic voting machines of the type Harris talks about in this book continue to proliferate, and politicians continue to use the system to their own ends. (Anyone shocked by the recent Rolling Stone article about the theft of the 2004 election simply wasn't paying attention; those of us in Ohio were well aware of Ken Blackwell's underhanded tactics throughout 2004.) There's a lot that the average American can learn from this book. However, it has one massive flaw that will keep it from ever being effective: its presentation of those facts.  Technical books, as a rule, should not be written by non-technical people. Harris makes some mistakes that are especially confusing given that she does seem to know, sometimes, what she's talking about; for example, she explicitly defines the term open-source as it relates to software, and the definition is correct, but every other time she uses it in the manuscript, it's misused (open-source software, for those of you who don't know, is software whose source code is generally available, and is usually built and maintained by a community of developers, most, if not all, of whom are unpaid; Harris mostly uses the term to refer to Diebold software that was left on a server accidentally, was never meant to be available to the public, and has never been built or maintained by anyone but Diebold employees and Diebold-maintained consultants). She also mistakenly uses the terms PCMCIA card and memory card interchangeably despite noting in at least one place that a PCMCIA card can also be a modem. I've never seen a modem with its own memory before.  Aside from that, there's the issue of Harris' prose style. Nonfiction writing, be it boring or readable, always maintains at least some minimum standard of professionalism. Harris is quick to throw professionalism to the wind too often here, and as a result comes off sporadically as the schoolyard bully chanting nah-nah-nee-foo-foo at teachers while across the street from the school.   Both of these shortcomings hamstring what would otherwise be a very important, valuable contribution to the world of the political expose. I hope there is eventually a second edition, one that has been attacked by an overzealous editor. That book, if it is ever brought to light, could well change the face of American politics. As it is, it's far too easy to write it off as the ravings of a crank. * 
 This book fascinates me because it was challenged by the NAACP in 1945 for its quiet exclusionary racism 
 While the author heaps truckloads of eulogies about "honor, integrity and deep moral convictions" on a man whom Gen. Douglas MacArthur should have hanged as a traitor, the fact is, it was Truman's flagrant disregard for the U.S. Constitution that gave him the "fortitude" to support the invasion of a foreign nation. The 1st Amendment, as we all know, clearly states, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion..."  While everyone is at liberty to endorse and support whatever religious cause or organization they choose, our government is supposed to remain neutral on such matters.  As was the case with Harry "atomic bomb" Truman, left wingers always refer to the first amendment when it serves their purpose to subvert our institutions but always flagrantly violate it when it is convenient for them to do so.  To refer to Harry Truman, who was directly responsible for the systematic slaughter of American soldiers during the Korean War, the Massacre at Hiroshima, the betrayal of China to his Communist friends, the communising of Europe, as a man motivated by deep moral conviction, humanitarianism, etc, is enough to make anyone puke 
 Wow, the headband on this skull cap is cutting off my  circulation!  It is way too tight for casual wear.  Also,  the fabric on top is almost as thin as panty-hose, and  your hair will poke through if you have a buzz-cut like me.    If you're not an athlete, then don't buy this skull cap.   It's meant primarily for bald football players to wear under their helmets 
 I ONLY READ THIS BOOK B/C I HAD TO FOR ONE OF MY MANY ENGLISH COURSES, AND IT WAS EXTREMLEY BORING! MAYBE B/C I JUST IM NOT ATTRACTED TO BOOKS ABOUT POLITICS, AND IN THIS CASE FASCHISM.I'LL GIVE LEWIS THE CREDIT FOR PREDICTING WHATS ALREADY SEEMING TO HAPPEN IN 2006 U.S.A, BUT THIS BOOK IS PRETTY DANG BORIN'...SORR 
 I've been a They Might Be Giants fan for several years and I am about to become a teacher, so I have been perusing many children's books lately and decided to check out Bed Bed Bed.  I listened to the book with the CD and the thing that stuck out at me the most about this book was the pacing. "Impossible" is the longest song, but all its lyrics are crammed into two spreads. While listening, I found myself becoming bored looking at those pages so long. At that point, the book just seemed like a decorated lyrics page.  "Happy Doesn't Have to Have an Ending", though only 3 spreads (including the title page), was much better paced because of its fast tempo.  "Idlewild"'s three spreads were perfect, since it was a short song with few words.  However, "Bed Bed Bed" was a whopping 11 spreads long, even though its time length was just a bit shorter than "Impossible". I know it's the title song and should probably have more emphasis, but in this case, it meant that I had to flip through one line pages so quickly that I didn't even have time to glimpse at the pictures if I wanted to keep up with the song! I would have much rather had more images of the shape-shifting imaginary creatures in "Impossible" than individual pictures of kids doing things like brushing their teeth and sitting around.  I got this book thinking that it would potentially make a unique addition for a listening center in my classroom, but if I had such a hard time keeping up with the book, I imagine my students would be even more frustrated.  If only a few changes were made, this book would be much better, but for now, if I want a visual representation of They Might Be Giant's kid songs, I'll stick to Here Come the ABC's. 
 I fell in love with their song "Experimental Film," and since this was TMBG's first CD, and had such great reviews, I bought it without listening to it.  While I acknowledge their creativity, I just can't get into any of the music on this CD.  I'm not saying don't buy this CD, as obviously many people really like it.  Just give it a listen before you buy so you know what you're getting 
 I just found one of these while climbing the stairs down at the track today.  I brought it home and looked on the net for some info about it and found these reviews.  When I read that people are losing this thing all the time, I could believe it!  LOL I'll enjoy it until it falls off and somebody else will inherit it. : 
 Once again "Dr." Churchill (he of course could never actually submit himself to the discipline and hard work necessary for a doctorate} steps forward to spew forth his usual set of lies and distortions calculated to promote his extreme and anti-American ideological agenda.  Hitler was right, and Churchill knows it:  the bigger the lie and the more often it is repeated the more believable it becomes.  In Churchill's case the lie that is implicit in his every word and contention is that America is a place of injustice, racism, and greed.  Of course, what Churchill cannot provide is a reasoned account of the human past that makes meaningful comparisons between America and other mass societies.  So if Churchill were actually a scholar and met his responsibility to place American history in context by referencing other cultures what other societies would he decide have a better humanitarian record? India, surely not, they still have unofficial untouchables there, and a hundred and fifty years ago they burnt widows alive.  Russia, not worth discussing.  China, yeah right.  The British empire?  Native American societies?  Well, almost without exception they were warrior cultures in which men killed and stole from other Indians (or as in the case of mesoamerica ripped the bleeding hearts out of living adults and children) and that practiced slavery - not the idea most of us have of a just society.  No, Ward, America is not a place of injustice, racism, and greed, though of course as in all societies those elements are present.  America is the place where popular sovereignty was  implemented for the first time in the human experience, the place that in its two hundred years of history has steadily become more democratic, inclusive, and just, the nation that created the United Nations and that torpedoed Europe's hopes of reestablishing colonialism after World War II, the country that was instrumental in defeating fascism, the country that faced down the geniunely evil Soviet Communism (60 million unnecessary dead between 1917 and 1953)while spreading Western enlightenment ideas like natural rights and women's empowerment throughout the world, and the place that two to three billion people elsewhere would dearly love to live (gallup poll in Mexico showed that 46% of its people, for instance, wish to live in the United States).  Were Indians displaced?  yes.  Did Indians die off from new and unfamiliar diseases brought to the Western Hemisphere by Europeans and Africans?  Yes, but it is a fact that all of human history is a litany of stronger cultures overwhelming and frequently destroying weaker cultures.  Indeed, human social and technological advancement has been held by some to be a function of that process.  But of course, Ward Churchill is not interested in discussing this truth, just making points.  The other side of this book is the fact that it is written by a man who has been judged by an objective panel of his peers as a thief and a liar, and who have in detail demolished the factual basis for virtually all of Churchill's assertions (go see online the report of the faculty review committee of the University of Colorado).  Inevitably there will be those so dissatisfied with their own life and reality that they will find in Churchill's work reenforcement for the righteousness of their own alienation.  For the rest of us, Churchill's chief contribution is that he illustrates just how farcical  and bizarre academia can be. It would be risible if it were not so tragic. Garbage, true, but interesting garbage that sadly speaks to our time and place 
 I'd have to say this is pretty tedious stuff. I searched and searched in vain for some spark of greatness, but it simply isn't there. Many of the comments from other reviewers about the twists and turns of the plot, and the depth of Eco's knowledge are probably accurate. However these alone do not make great writing.   If I am honest I'd have to say that this is fairly badly written. It is barely coherent in places and, at the end, I am not entirely sure what the point of the novel was. Unless the point was to peer inside the mindset of a provincial Italian from a few centuries ago. However is that kind of subject matter worth an entire novel?  As noted much of the fanfare seems to surround Eco's evident knowledge base, but this has not been put to good use in this attempt. The character seems very cartoonish at times, and the style of writing (jumping from past to present amongst other things) is clunky.  If this were not attached to a great name I reckon we'd see many more negative comments and, indeed, it is so bad I doubt it would have been considered worthy of publishing 
 I was so disappointed in this book. I found it very hard to believe that Jonathan Kellerman actually wrote this book. I found it downright corny the way Alex Delaware was playing ace detective and kept just happening to be at the right place at the right time. The book seemed to have no "story" to it, as his always do. I got very bored reading one and a half pages of descriptions of what people were wearing, how their hair looked and on and on. I always enjoyed Kellerman's breif descriptions of people and places, but once again, this became downright corny.  I'm glad this was not my first Kellerman book, as I probably wouldn't try another one. I'm a dedicated reader of his and hope that this was just a fluke. Everyone's entitled to one bad book. Hope that was his first and last 
 Mr. Patterson: Please demonstrate more discretion in selecting ghost writers for your pulp fiction publishing machine.  Ms. Paetro: Don't quit your day job.  If you are looking for character development, descriptive scenes, engaging voice and style, believable conflict, romantic or who-done-it suspense, balanced point of view, entertaining pace, and (or) suspension of disbelief, this is not a book deserving of your time or money.  If your idea of pacing is 146 chapters spread across 400 pages, or if the lame pet dog character foil trick works for you, be sure to buy this book at Amazon's used book prices 
 So this is a country album? Let me see here, the first song sounds like a song they released a few years ago about Little Miss Honky Tonk. Then the 5th song sounds like every other ballad they have ever released. This is pathetic just like their careers. Singing about boot-scootin, beer drinking just cutting a shine ya'll. Don't ever call these guys old school. Old school is Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson etc.. How much more of this garbage are people going to buy? There is nothing that even comes close to being original here. They also started the, "honky tonkin" revolution with their first album which shot the legends of country right in the heart. Put them in jail, take away their right to record POP music and make them listen to Bill Monroe or Hank Williams for a few months 
 Maguire is a fine writer but is way out of his league narrating.  His voice and inflection are downright  disturbing.  At times his reading takes on a monotonic, robotic tone that sounds like Robby the Robot!  I hope there is another edition ot there because I don't think I can make it through listening to him. And I do listen to audio books all the time!   bo 
 Suitable for making your car windows rattle.  Will flash you back to the mid 90's with funky bass breaks.  A few heart pounders that are fun if you are flying.    Not as heavy as DJ Irene or Bad Boy Bill, not even close to the mastery of Aprhodite. DJ Icey has done better with essential mixes although I'd skip his Disco Rodeo the release party was a BOMB!  
 Atheists have a lower divorce rate than born again christians but I guess thats just a fluke hu, Ann. They must be bad people somehow. People like Ann can't be christians because they shame one person for having an affair and then forgive another that is an alcoholic because he's a republican. She speaks to people who want to believe so bad they don't care that she doesn't have a christian bone in her body. True christians don't defame, judge or claime superiority. She doesn't have any idea of what being Jesus-like is. Oh and intelligent design is not science. Science is how Religion is why- They are too different questions 
 "Crime and the American Dream" is a retread of the same old "Blame America First" argument that prevails in academia. No country on the planet has opportunities for upward mobility as those that exist in the USA. Envy, the desire for shortcuts and a "something for nothing" sense of entitlement did not originate in 1776. We have redefined poverty such that expensive sneakers, cell phones, and large screen TV's are seen as necessities. Want to see poverty that might actually drive people to crime, then visit Manila, Mexico City. or Bogota. Our worst slums would be luxury for millions 
 Sean Hannity's rise to fame proves that an ignorant illiterate can rise well beyond the level of incompetence in this country, especially when their audience consists of like-minded organ banks.  Hannity is stupid, hypocritical and loud.  His sole redeeming quality is as a mechanism for carbon-oxygen exchange.  Hannity is well-coiffed, well dressed  and well short of thorazine on his overhyped comedy duo called the Hannity and Combs report.  This bozo is so uptight he must wear a chastity belt 2 sizes too small.  Get a real job, you poser 
 People too often use the word "suck" to describe something they dislike. To me, this shows a lack of expertise in utilizing much better modern day English language descriptors. I hound individuals to come up with more colorful examples, especially my teenage kids who love to insert "suck" in every descriptive passage.   But today I'm going to risk ridicule and use the term to outline my feelings about David Hosp's book, The Betrayed. Yes, it sucked. In fact, "suck" is the most appropriate transitive verb I can attach to this worthless paper-bound contraption. Not only is the plot completely transparent and mundane, but the characters are cardboard cutouts of movie stars (think Mel Gibson and Danny Glover in the "Lethal Weapon" series and you'll be right on the mark) and the author's prose is laughable (more on that in a moment).   The plot: A woman from a financially affluent family is found murdered in her home. Two detectives are called in to solve the case, Darius Train (i.e., Danny Glover) and Jack Cassian (i.e., Mel Gibson toned down a few notches). The dead woman's sister, Sydney Chapin, becomes an investigative force, trying to track down the last few hours of her sister's life, only to become entangled with high-powered politicians, old family history, a deadly private eye, and an emotional attachment to Detective Cassian. And that's about all there is. If you've read any murder mysteries or watched any movie thrillers involving government higher-ups, you already know the ending to this lame novel.   Suckiness of plot aside, sometimes an author can pull novels along simply by utilizing flowing narrative verse or lively storytelling. This is called "prose" (something Mr. Hosp needs much help with). Myself having battled with this problem, I can easily relate to items that should never have made it into this bulky book (419 pages).   Mr. Hosp's use of passive voice is consistently irritating and makes the entire story fall flat as a result (example, `As he walked...' instead of `He walked...' etc.). The other HUGE prose issue is the author's use of "eyes" to describe every emotional state his characters feel. Page 298: `Train drew his eyebrows up noncommittally (Ed. -- Whatever the hell that means!), and Venable's gaze settled on him like a heavy burden. He held the stare, returning its intensity without aggression as they sat in silence for a long moment, neither one of them backing down....' This languorous style of writing is evident on almost every page, making the story read much longer than it needed to.   So this is definitely one to bypass, or perhaps use as toilet paper -- the sucking sound of the flush will match this book perfectly.  (Side note: I wonder how in the world this novel ever got published! I've read better stories by 8th and 9th graders. I also question the current customer reviews here at Amazon.com. Could some -- or most -- of these reviews be from friends of Mr. Hosp or indirectly affiliated with the book or its author somehow? 
 The only great thing about "The Great Fire" is its name.  This is one of those books that as you read it, you find yourself lost in thoughts about the morning commute, the long ago expired and still unpaid decal on your front windshield, about the dog, that you forgot to feed and you now know it repaid you by doing its business on the one spot of the carpet, which you fiercely guarded and hoped to protect before the weekend party with your boss and his pricy wife who for some time now has been...but then you collect your thoughts and try again to refocus your attention on this story of post war Japan and the Australian soldier who fell in love with a teenager, or was the chap British...and the she, the bosses wife, who strangely winked at you during the last Christmas party and you felt like choking...he must have been Australian since in the end he decided to stay with the girl in Australia...but now you know that the spot in the carpet would forever remain brownish with its if not putrid then at least nagging reminder of the day you forgot to feed the damn dog because the book you were tying to read...but who really cares whether the Australian and the teenager remained faithful to each other, after all the world really changed since 1947...and so you hope that the next paycheck would be enough for you to make a call to `Stanley Steamer' and have them fix the memory of your immoral transgression...But back to the book! If you love British style novels of the kind where old ladies and younger chaps (with names like Bertram and Aldred) get together to have some tea, then in their spare time write long romantic letters, and from time to time remind each other of the horrid world war 2, this is the book for you. If you are like me, meaning you have so much on your mind that it'd take a much stronger novel to keep your attention pinned to its pages, then I highly recommend you withhold the urge to read this one.   - by Simon Cleveland 
 What a dissapointment this book was.  Lawrence Block's Matther Scudder novels are some of the best I've read.  I can only wonder what happened.  Perhaps these were early entries into the literary world, but after reading  one Burgler book I wouldn't go out of my way to pick up another.  But he  has enough other things out there...I'd give Block's other characters a  read before turning off and tuning out 
 I agree with many of the reviews on this book. This guy 'Butz' should concerntrate on his area of expertise, which is engineering science NOT HISTORY! I think that if you are going to write a book, at least know what you are talking about. I don't understand how he could possibly be a professor at a university... 
 Was very dissapponted with this magazine.  They go unread and get thrown out.  Just waiting for our subscription to run out. It is really for older kids and of very little interest to younger kids 
 We bought this bedrail for a vacation home and thought it was great at first.  I realized I didn't like it sticking out so far from the bed when it was folded down, but could live with it.  The second weekend we used it, my 2 year old and his cousin, also 2, were climbing into the bed by stepping on the bedrail because it stuck out so far, and the side popped out of position, never to go back in.  As far as I am concerned, this product needs to be rethought by the manufacturer.  There should be some way to fix it when it pops out.  Definitely would not reccommend it.  To make matters worse, Babies R Us would not return it becuase we no longer had a reciept 
 I bought this game about a week ago. I had not purchased the prequil (sp?) to this game and did not know what to expect.  I began playing the game and immediately got bored about 30-45 minutes later. I have no played the game since. Here's why: The graphics, to me, are ridiculously annoying. It makes the game feel so unrealistic. The graphics are a step lower than "NBA Street" and even more unrealistic. The real problem is that there is just nothing to do. You enter tournements and they all feel the same. The little side missions are laughable, and I feel like turning off my Ps2 and smashing the controller on my head repetitively everytime I play one of them.  I can go on and on about why I hated this game. But I won't. The bottom line is that I strongly urge you not to waste your money. The cover and appearance of the game appealed to me and made me want to buy the game...but don't let that happen to you 
 The neuroses and insecurities displayed by the Bridget Jones character were charming when she was lonely and single in the first movie.  Now that she is involved in a loving relationship, these same characteristics make her seem controlling, desperate, and sad.  It is much harder to like Bridget in this movie or to feel sympathy for or identify with her.  And her one-dimensional friends from the first movie are downright annoying in this sequel.  They seem to exist solely to focus their attention on Bridget, and they prove over and over again in this film that they don't even have her best interests at heart.  If you were a fan of the first, you may want to steer clear of this one.  Or at least go in with tempered expectations 
 Unless you REALLY like the song and are an avid Madonna collector, pass on the single for Sorry. The original is great, but it's already on the album, so track 1 is almost worthless. Track 2 and 3 are good, but it goes downhill from there. Track 6 is horrible. I'm listening to it now, and its not a dance mix.  If you want a good single, turn to Hung Up. And if you can find an inexpensive copy of Sorry, give it a try, but don't waste your money 
 Dear God in Heaven . What a dreary little effort this is and what a disappointment after A Simple Plan . GReat idea for a very short story. Bad idea for a novel . In the end  ( if you can finish the tome ) you'll be rooting for the plant to do its darnest and quickly  
 The pants were really nice, but they were too large for my son.  I requested an exchange (same style & color) in size medium.  To date, I have NOT received the exchange.  Could you please look into this for me.  Thanks, Bonnie Cutle 
 I bought this because I didn't want to buy a cd to replace my well-worn album.  Entertainment! is by far their best album; this is a lame reworking of the songs on that (mostly) with some cuts from their other albums as well. Maybe it's because I grew up on the originals, but I think this cd sucks.  However, it's still ten times better than most stuff out there, so I gave it 3 stars.  The melodica is missing is some spots, the guitars sound less jagged, and the drums have lost a lot of zing, particularly on what we all want.  So, if you don't have any gang of four, get this, then get entertainment 
 The range of story and poetry selections is so limited, the materials bore students to death. The issues the texts are obsessed with--morbid existential guilt, death of a spouse or a parent ala Joyce, O'Connor, Cather, etc.,--no longer have the spell-binding effect they once had on the adult sensibility. We now live in an age where more dramatic problems occur. There has got to be some good literature that covers issues of our day, such as mass murder, rape, school-shootings, hysteria, incest, money problems, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, religious intolerance, etc. This textbook is totally out of touch with the current realities of our lives in the 21st century. 
 Title says it all.  I enjoyed the 1st-3rd book in series.  Forth book sort of dragged.  By the middle of this book I had to make a decision...keep going with an endless supply of boring pages and books ahead or throw in the towel.  Let's face it, life's too short.  If you want a thousand pages of satisfaction pick up the unabridged version of "The Stand".  I'm afraid this doesn't do it.    Think about it another way do you want to read over 5000 pages of a series that has mixed reviews from like minded fantasy readers?  Cheer 
 I have been reading this book aloud to fifth graders in a rural area, and I don't get it! I am very uncomfortable with the enthusiasm with which the book embraces violence as a staple of black family life. There is a chapter about a bully who does a "Maytag wash," scrubbing his smaller victims with snow and then flinging them against a chain link fence - apparently meant to be funny, but my audience of ten-year-olds just looked puzzled. In another chapter, the mother approaches naughty brother Byron with matches, Vaseline and bandages, intent upon burning his fingers as punishment. Fortunately, sister Joetta blows out the matches - also meant to be funny, I guess, but it is difficult for me to see the humor in child abuse. I might concede that this book is a valuable illustration of a particular time in history, but the Birmingham experience is overshadowed by the portrayal of African Americans as stupid and scary . . . not the lesson I had hoped for. 
 This review is for the Spanish edition ONLY which I recently purchased (ISBN:8498160162, publisher: Linkgua).  Note, that this is an ABRIDGED EDITION (edici√≥n abreviada) and is not true to the original text, this is evident commencing with the first sentence of the book. The reader will get the general idea of the novel, but will not read the words as written be the author.  I submit here an example of the above-mentioned sentence:  ABRIDGED EDITION (ISBN 8498160162): A fines de octubre, don Santiago de los Santos, conocido vulgarmente con el nombre de Capit√°n Tiago, daba una cena, que era el tema de todas las conversaciones en Binondo, en los dem√°s arrabales y hasta dentro de la ciudad.  ORIGINAL TEXT: A fines de octubre, don Santiago de los Santos, conocido popularmente bajo el nombre de Capit√°n Tiago, daba una cena, que, sin embargo de haberlo anunciado aquella tarde tan s√≥lo, contra su costumbre, era ya el tema de todas las conversaciones en Binondo, en otros arrabales y hasta en Intramuros.  This editing is consistent throughout every paragraph in the book.   If you just want a good read, then this edition will suffice. It is an excellent novel. However, if you are an admirer of the Spanish language, please get your hands on the original version.  
 The timing in this story is achingly slow, compared to many of today's novels...the language is not particularly metaphorical or even colorful, although the sentences are short.  But lacking dialogue it remains dull, dull and I am unable to visualize the characters - more description is needed, and frankly, if it wasn't for previous success he may not have been published.  I feel you have to be an anglophile to appreciate this book 
 I'm glad a previous reviewer enjoyed this book and the previous one, but I did not.  I too am a great fan of this series, but the last two books seemed flat to me--not very engaging.  I certainly will continue to read Haney's books about Lieutenant Bak because when they are good(which they usually are) they are very very good 
 I'm a big Mellencamp fan and this album fails to deliver.  Mellencamp's pedigree would leave one to assume he will not release substandard material, but frankly John's lyrics on this album sound like he's never written a song before in his life, "...I'm an American.....from the Midwest" feels like he was forced at gunpoint to write this lyric. And many more. The album succeeds only in its consistent starkness, but is in no way the first to arrive to the funeral... The reason why this album fails so miserably is because it's a Mellencamp album and I've come to expect more from him and I'm surprised he let this one slip through the cracks in the record company. So sad.  Bernie, Calgar 
     While I applaud Ms. Lawrence for educating fans on the gross injustices within the Hendrix family and for having a commendable understanding of Janie Hendrix's psychological make up that is lost even on many who are within her orbit, there are some very serious credibility problems here.       While even the idle Hendrix fan knows Jimi was born in King County Hospital, (Now Harbor View) Lawrence states he was born at the home of a family friend.(Ouch) Jimi is quoted allegedly verbatum throughout the book but from some alledged tapes of interviews that no one has seen or heard and that Lawrence conveniently plans on destroying so 'no one can profit from them'.Meanwhile cigarette packs (yes, cigarette packs) and necklaces are being sold via ebay or to private collectors allegedly having belonged to Hendrix ,siting Ms. Lawrence as the previous owner and source of authenticity.      At one point she aledgedly quotes Hendrix as saying:  "The LSD passed around San Francisco was a fabulous discovery for me, I'd taken acid in London but...."        Aside from Jimi's use of the word 'fabulous' being at best incredulous, the fact that Hendrix had already tried LSD in New York in 1996 before going to England and subsequently Monterey is common knowledge among afficianados and again makes all of these alledged direct quotes questionable. Those of you who have listened to and read the hundreds of hours of interviews available through collectors, official releases and press clippings will also find some of the wording of these alledged quotes that the book, and the credibility of it's author are based on, extremely suspect. At one point Ms. Lawrence even offers an aledged quote from Hendrix's mother who passed away in 1958:  "Jimi baby" she told her son "I have to escape this"     While quotes like this can illicit an emotional response   from the average reader,they are clearly  fictional. Throughout the book people close to Jimi are referenced but very sparsely quoted, if at all. I shared the recount of Jimi's trip to Berkeley as a small child (Pg.5) with Jimi's aunt Delores and she laughed openly and wondered aloud where people come up with these stories. This from a woman who was actually there and involved in planning said trip. While making a reference to Ernestine Benson and misstakenly referring to her husband Cornel  as "Bill" , Lawrence again allegedly quotes Hendrix in lieu of an actual interview with the Benson's who are both still living and have incredible first hand insights having lived with the Hendrix's.     Lawrence's assertion that Hendrix committed suicide simply because his journal was left out is no less ridiculous than Jimi's adopted stepsister Janie's claim that Jimi didn't OD.  Lawrence then stops just short of gleefully giving herself credit for Monika's suicide, but the jist is clear. This book is more than a bit narcissistic with Lawrence lauding herself as much as she does her subject. While proclaiming herself to be a close confident of Hendrix' the general consensus is that she wasn't around that much, if people even know who she is at all.    For a much more well researched and credible look into Jimi's life read Electric Gypsy or even more so , the new book Room Full Of Mirrors by Charles Cross. The Man, The Magic, The Truth, while very dramatic, is rife with glaring inaccuracies and is for the most part a novel about the author and her subject, not a biography or a reliable historical record. Unless these alledged tapes that are widely quoted throughout the entire book are made available, their legitimacy and the legitimacy of the book will forever be questioned.

 This book is a good source for someone who has never been involved in strength training, regardless of age. Those individuals aged fifty or older who have not previously participated in this type activity will find adequate information within these pages.   However, for those who are already engaged in some type of strength training and seeking new information, will find nothing additional from this book. 
 A mix of the softest chessyest mushy reggae from the 80s. Don't even bother... 
  This would be a minor basilica in the architecture of the American novel, except for one small problem.   Marilyn Monroe may have been a creation of an industry and a confused, naive destitute woman, but the supporting cast are no works of fiction. They were, and some-Miller, Dougherty, others-still are (as of Christmas 2004!) living humans, not fictional entities to be used as the author would have. Norma Jeane Mortenson, who was Marilyn Monroe in every way at the end, and Joe DiMaggio, Frank SInatra, and all the players in this penultimate drama-under the pseudonyms (Bucky, et al) or their real names (Whitey Snyder) were real humans and deserve to be treated as such. And Joyce Carol Oates is, however great a novelist, not fit to judge them.    If the story had replaced every single name with a fictionalized one, including those of the central being herself, I would have had more respect for Oates. However, as one of the younger people on the planet who belong to an exclusive club-I met the real Marilyn Monroe, talked with her, shook her hand, smelled her perfume (supposedly she wore Chanel #5, but I've never smelled anything like she did:wonderful!)  in New York when I was fourteen-I would like to speak for all of us, from her husbands and lovers to her adoring fans to those like myself who _weren't_ fans until we met her.    She deserves better; so do we! 
 I had bought these for my boy thinking they had a fly front much like the mens versions I wear. They are my son's least favorite underwear mearly cause he has to pull the front of them down in order to use the bath room. He's only 6 and when I had trained him I tought him to use the fly on the front of his underwear. In my personal thoughts are that men's/boy's underwear has a fly in the front for need use, unlike that for women and girls whom don't require it 
 I've been a subscriber to this for over 10 years and I've loved getting this, but it has undergone changes recently and NOT for the better. Specifically, I hate what they've done to the graphical design inside. Whereas they used to employ several different styles when it came to things like fonts and artwork for whatever subject was written about, now they've adopted a uniform style where nearly EVERYTHING looks the same. It looked better BEFORE. The writing isn't as witty or sharp (have longtime staff departed?), and there are "filler" pieces in the form of moronic sidebars and boxes - useless attempts at humor that simply don't work. The strength of the magazine continues to come from the critics, especially the movie and dvd section. Sadly, typically, when changes like this occur they almost never revert back so it looks like I'm going to have to consider letting my sub expire 'cos I don't let my mailbox fill with crap like this 
 Generally on Amazon.com, the average rating of an album does not accurately indicate its quality - that is, the albums are usually highly overrated. This is probably due to the voluntary nature of the reviews and the fact that the fans of an artist are far more likely to review their albums and give them high scores than a casual music listener giving them the score they deserve. As a result of this, generally, albums that have an average score of 4.5 - 5 stars are usually excellent albums. Ones with a score of 4 are generally good and 3.5 indicates a pretty average album. Average scores any lower than 3.5 stars generally indicate a pretty poor album. As I mentioned before, due to the high proportion of fans reviewing albums, the average score rarely falls below 3 stars. It takes a pretty horrendous album, like Limp Bizkit's Results May Vary, to get a score of even 2.5. In fact, I didn't even think that it was possible for an album to get less than 2.5 - that is, until I saw this pile of feces.  Now to put this average score of 2 into context - this means that the proportion of "hataz" reviewing this album is even more than the proportion of fans reviewing it. Out of all the terrible albums I have viewed, I have never seen this happen before. Not even to bands as terrible as Limp Bizkit or even An*l C*nt. This obviously indicates a decline in fan numbers and, hopefully, the end of Chingy's 15 minutes of fame 
 Th French Diet is an enjoyable read and does contain a few molecules of truth. Unfortunately, the French Diet is misleading in that it does not tell the whole story of why the French people have lower rates of heart disease, and are less overweight and obese than Americans. The book is "politically correct" in that the author does not explain that, for the most part, the French reject the lipid hypothesis, which is the belief that saturated fat and cholesterol cause heart disease. Montignac over-emphasizes the role of olive oil in the French diet. Although the French do consume (and produce) large quantities of olive oil, they also consume large quantities of butter, cream, full-fat yogurt, raw-milk cheese, and duck fat. These foods are all high in saturated fat, contradicting the authors claim that the French consume primarily monounsaturated fats. The author also neglects to mention the ugly fact that the French smoke more than Americans and the potential impact this has on caloric intake.  
 I bought this book because David Sedaris recommended it at the last reading I attended.  The stories are all on the "dark" side and they do not appeal to me.  Admittedly, I prefer something much more light hearted, so others may love this book 
 I was looking for Mary Higgins Clark and came up upon this Mary Jane Clark book and thought I'ld give it a try.  What a mistake! I found the book unbelievably trite and unoriginal.  The story features quite a few girls in one small town who all have eating disorders and cut themselves. After meeting the rest of the characters in the town, I wanted to cut my own wrists!  The protagonist was entirely one dimensional. The parents of the teen who was first kidnapped were pathetically weak rendering the whole relationship with the daughter impossibly plodding and unrealistic. The woman one of the kidnap victims babysits for is so boring and selfish that I found myself rooting for the husband to leave her! The author writes as if she is trying to tell us how much she knows about the news business without making it interesting or integrating it into the story therefore sounding altogether preachy without an ounce of vitality. The red herrings were obvious, the ending unsatisfying and the book was altogether an unpleasant read. I would definetely not recommend this book 
 It's terribly boring. period. This DVD makes me fall asleep very easily. Too many interviews and the video quality is really bad 
 I first was a rent STAGE FAN, owning the original cast album and addictly seeing the play.  I then got this soundtrack, which leaves out 3/4 of the good songs.  I mean really: Angel does not even sing contact, and there is NNNOOO song "christmas bells".  Rosario Dawson sucks and should play britney spears, not Mimi.  I gave the original 5 stars and this one. OMG. Mimi should be EDGY not GLITZY. I feel bad that Daphne Rubin Vega had to watch her awesome part be ruined by Rosario Dawson's "valley girl" voice.  As for the original cast, especially Wilson Jermaine, their voices almost matured too much.So in the movie recording, Angel does not sound sweet anymore. If you buy the original cast recording you'll end up marrying the recording and worshipping it.  If you buy this recording it will etiher end up in the garbage or in the fireplace.   If you burn it-LAUGH 
 Was not impressed.  Narrow scoped, personal reflections, applications limited.  I also read the male companion book Wild at heart and was also not impressed 
 I seldomly fail to complete a novel of intrigue. I tried to remain patient  hoping that something would develop that captured my imagination but  nothing did.  I put the book back on the bookshelf without completing it 
 The index in the version I have is completely inaccurate.  What's more, to obtain errata you're required to enter a code on the publisher's website.  This code is not stamped on the book but is on the packaging which I unfortunately threw away before I noticed the index was completely inaccurate.    Save yourself the headache and get a different version 
 I am in fact the "yuppie scum" that many of the reviewers have such disdain for (why, only they know).  In any event, I, unhappy in my present career, was looking for a book that would inspire me to make a change.  Don't be deceived, this is not a self-help book.  The stories of the individuals in the book are half-baked, uninspiring and in certain instances go unresolved.  There are no useful insights or "gems" to be taken and used in our personal lives.  The writing by Po (or editing by his publisher) is disjointed and confusing.  I could only get through about three-quarters of this drivel before putting it down 
 I have never read anything by Katha Pollitt that suggests even remotely that she thinks for herself.  This book is no exception.   I'm definitely a progressive, politically. But for once it would be nice to see Katha Pollitt take a position that isn't precisely on the leftist party line.    The fact that she doesn't suggests very strongly that her essays are all produced ex post facto:  First she makes sure she knows what the party line is -- no problem, given her The Nation. milieu.  Then she comes up with an intellectual-sounding justification for the position.  Mega-yawn 
 This is the kind of work that causes mental illness. A young, impressionable reader will turn to this author with the expectation of discovering what reality is, only to be misled into a corrupt concept of the author's personal, mystical "reality." A nightmare.  Authors like this should be held legally liable for the damages they inflict.   If you prefer your reality clear, honest and concrete, consult such works as Vitzthum's "Materialism."  
 think  about it, the movie was ok, but was there a point to make this movie? it was better off on tv. listen if u liked it, get it, but im staying with my thoughts of it and my thought said boring!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Whenever you want find something from the book, chances are you can't find it. Moreover, some chapter go to too details while others not enough. Would not recommend to buy if you do want learn Verilog 
 I picked this up based on the reviews here and prior to shooting with the camera. About half of this book contains beginning photography type information. I don't believe the owners of this camera are beginning photographers, and if they are there are better resources than this book. I also found the Nikon D200 user manual to be far more accessible and detailed and considerably more portable than this book. This book is written at too high a level to be useful in the field (and it's too big). It doesn't get deep enough into the menus, providing just a small paragraph overview. When you need to know how to quickly access menus, or discern what the menus allow you to do, the available options, etc., this book fails.  I put this directly to the test. I demo'ed the camera for a day. I bought this book one week prior to shooting with the camera. I read the book and I brought it with me the day I shot with the camera. The camera shop also gave me the Nikon manual (right out of the box) to take along. After several tries, I gave up trying to use this book to get anything done and relied entirely on the Nikon D200 manual. It was much quicker, far more productive and smaller.  If you're considering buying the D200, this book provides a decent overview, but it is not an acceptable field guide, nor is it an acceptable replacement for the actual manual 
 This is the worst book in a long time I've tried to read and get a story out of it.  Ms. Steele rambles on for chapter after chapter---and not much of anything happens!!!  It's just plain BORING!  About 1/3 through, the book went into the trash.  After reading Nora Roberts' books, this book is abominable.  It's back to Roberts for me 
 I had to read Annie John for my English class and I can say that it is probablly one of the worst books I have read yet.  Not only are the characters difficult to relate to, but the book is extremely dull and written as a comeing of age story. Basically, the book starts out with Annie, the protagonist a girl growing up in Antigua remembering how much her mother loved her when she was a young girl. Then, in the next few chapters, Annie describes herself as a 12 year old girl going to school and having an overpowering love for her friend Gwen.  She has behavior problems and does some things that her mother seems shamed about and she further distances from her mother. The next couple chapters, she is an akward 15 yr. old in classes with older girls who are more developed then she is as she puts it and she dislikes this.  At this time, her thoughts that her mother doesn't like her have escalated into her hating her mother and her thinking that her mother returns these same feelings.  She doesn't love Gwen anymore and feels lonely.  Finally, when she is 17 she leaves home and goes to train to become a nurse and oddly actually will miss her mother even though throughout the book (for the most part) she has shown strong resentment and hatred towards her mother....Anyway, this book was so extremelly horrible and I hope you don't ever read it. If you decide to read it or are forced to I pity you, because this book is trash and I don't see why anyone would publish it...BIG MISTAKE on their part.  
 I should have read the other review more closely. This is a good blanket for HOT summer nights! I believe it is too light for cold winter nights. I expected more for over $50. If I didn't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw! The color and texture are nice 
 What is up with this director desire to do overlapping and panning camera shots? I mean if you going to use it a few times, as pointless as it is...no problem but for every scene? C'mon now...aint we getting a little carried away here. I was dizzy after the first 5 minutes and still manage to watch the whole movie which is a feat that i challenge anyone here to take. You would most likely turn the movie off within 10 minutes and burst out profanities in the process.     The only reason i watch the whole thing not because i wanted to know about this sick killer's multiple personality defense interview but the person who was giving the interview, the ultra hot Brittany Daniel. We went gaga over her role as the devious temptress in Dawson's Creek but as a 70's chick doing the interview....OMG! It almost seems like she was enjoying the fantasy about this guy based on her expression and body movements. She was dress to kill with that 70's disco outfit. The movie scenes was accurate to the times which is a plus.  Still it was a badly directed movie with horried camera work and the dialog was bad too(accurate or not) that even the lovely Brittany cannnot save. Not recommended even if your a fan of the Hillside Strangler. And if you are...seek help!    
 Buy the 2nd edition this is a 2 book rip off with no CD.  The 2nd edition is the whole book with the BSD CD. This is not even 1/2 of what the 2nd edition was. And you can get the 2nd edition for $5.00 today!!  If you order DO NOT ORDER FROM CAMIN BOOK, I have been waiting 32 days on them. They do not answer e-mail and they have my cash, another thing is they are out of the USA, i.e. Camin Ilands so you can't do anything about the rip off. 
 They take batteries but don't last 15 minutes.  They have an ac spot for and adapter but where do you plug a undercounter light in under the counter.  Hate them 
 I ordered this book thinking I was getting the Bb edition, but it is really the C-edition.  And because it is not stated under the return policy as "wrong item shipped" I will be charged for the shipping to return it.  Make sure to look at the cover page of any book before buying it because it will not always tell you in the information section of the item 
 Ignore the unique cover, clever song idea( there is 30) which represent a comic book. Ignore all that. It simply is not good. What is this? I dont even know how to describe this music. It's not even songs, but more a bunch of really short experimental, non-sensequel, inerworkings of annoyance. They will start off with a riff as if they are going on to a song, but its only a tease, until they stop and go slow, to say," get on with it!!!!!!!!" Add a bunch of zany sound effects, not to mention the recurring anoyance of a high pitched voice ringing out, sci-fi clips and completly hoarse vocals that are screams, and sounds,that add up,to one of the most pointless albums ever put out 
 I purchased this item thinking it would be great for my 5 yr old's room.  He has a 19 inch TV/VCR/DVD combo that will not fit into the space that was designed to hold a "20 inch" TV.  If you have a modern TV with speakers on the side it will not fit!!!!!  I purchased the item directly from STEP2 and they do not want to refund my shipping fees or pay for me to return the item!!!!  
 Here is another self-help book that didn't need to be written. The useful information could be summerized in a phamplet, if so much - the cover would be sufficient. Why this writing style is so popular is beyond my comprehension (maybe because people like me keep picking them up...AHHH!!!). The use of filler "stories" are quite uneccessary if the author has something unique or interesting to say, but in most of these books it is just a rehash of the same basic information. If this is the first of this type of book you are reading you may find some of it interesting and useful, but that is being generous, but, if you have read any other self-help book remotely similar, don't even waste your time 
 Well written and easy to follow directions to make these fun fabric balls.  It takes reading the instructions carefully and completely and going step by step and you'll love what you can do 
 I can never forgive Mary Calhoun for her book _Audubon Cat_.  This book is a glorification of a cat while it hunts birds.  As a bird watcher I was highly offended, and as a father I found it very awkward trying to explain to my child what the owl was going to do to the cat it caught 
 This is a literal translation without any soul. Olivelle doesn't have the heart at the right place to translate mystical writings of the Upanishads. He should stick to Jesuit material 
 I realize that I'm supposed to think "Empire" is brilliant, because it's Gore Vidal, but it is a major bore.  Nothing actually happens; its just 400+ pages of dialogue.  A well-written conventional history of the period would be more enjoyable and more informative.  This is a total snooze-fest 
 I waited for this book to come out in paperback and pre-ordered.  I am a fan of WHITE TEETH, and, although AUTOGRAPH MAN was boring, I had high hopes for ON BEAUTY.  Sadly, this writer should stick to what she knows -- a visiting professorship doesn't make her an authority on campus life in U.S., New England, or what American kids say and do. The assumptions and voices given to her characters are distracting in their outsiderish author's depiction, and I found this to really get in the way of her stoytelling--especially her stabs at Boston and southern accents.  Her British characters (especially Howard and V) are well drawn and speak naturally--reminiscent of WHITE TEETH.  They are believable.  Her Americans are laughably off-base and seem like charicatures of how an arrogant Brit might imagine them, especially Levi and Carl.  The character Zora (modeled on the precocious author herself?) is not likeable at all.  The story of Jerome and his pursuit of religion is choppy and not well developed. He slides in and out of the story. The  Furthermore, her story line about campus politics is lackluster.  Another reviewer references Kingsley Amis's LUCKY JIM.  I recommend Richard Russo's excellent STRAIGHT MAN for anyone interested in the liberal arts dept / tenure / backstabbing /cheating plots 
 When you find yourself double-checking the bookjacket to see if the author you have enjoyed in the past could really have written this, it is not a good sign.  I can't even get into the book. I have read Catherine Coulter before, and while she isn't my favorite romance novelist, I have had only enjoyable experiences thus far.  That ended when I picked up this book from the library.   The dialogue is awful. There is no flow, they just randomly say things out of their mouths. There is no context for it either, no reason given for anything they say. And since what they say is so unbelievably corny, trite, or odd, you really need some kind of frame to put it in for it to have any meaning. I gather from the reviews that this contains characters from her other books, so maybe the context is there.  The whole conversation about discipline in the beginning pages also has no context. I found myself trying to picture this and trying to figure out what in the heck she really meant by discipline. Did it mean what I think it meant? Or something else? It wasn't super clear.  The man's character gives you nothing to work with. He's a womanizer and yet, he spills out a story about avenging his housemaid's demise.  Then he immediately blurts out "Why did I say that?" Why indeed? When he is questioning it, I know I'm in trouble.    And what is up with the whole "big girl" repetition? First, a big girl in my mind is someone with larger proportions--not necessarily someone tall. The "big girl" is gorgeous, but we have no idea why because the descriptions he pants about her don't describe anything. Just picture a goddess. There ya go. Got it?  Good.    Unfortunately I'm not going to make it to the whole "point" of this book, something about a treasure. I cannot, simply cannot get past these pages.  
 As an American with shoddy French skills who has been living in the Il de France for the past six months, I found this book incredibly superficial at best and whiny and self-indulgent at worst.  First of all, to call this book a love story is ridiculous.  Frederic has less presence in the book than her pedigreed dog (or was THAT the "love story"?). From what I read, poor old Frederic seemed no more than a ticket to stay in France, rent free, because she had nothing better to do. And let me see, what were her insights?  That French is difficult?  That French people like meat?  Wow, great journalism, there.  One day in France is all you need to figure that out.  As far as her assessments on the psychology of French women (they're threatened, which explains their lack of friendliness towards her), what self-serving balderdash is that?  Let me propose a few alternate theories:  A) threatened and rude women come in every nationality; B) maybe they weren't talking to her because it's difficult to communicate with someone with lousy French skills; C) Maybe they just didn't like HER. For the life of me, I don't understand the positive reviews of this book.  But maybe in an age of CNN, MTV and people who travel no further than to the other side of their living room to search for their lost remote control, this is what qualifies for insightful journalism/entertainment. Now, Ms. Turnbull might attribute my negativity towards her book to some sort of jealousy since I have had none of the advantages she had while living here.  I pay rent.  I knew no-one when I got here.  I was forced to communicate without the convenience of a fluent boyfriend to translate for me.  I had to make friends based on personality, wit and mime skills.  But I'd like to suggest that if she'd had some of those "disadvantages" (and a little depth) her book might have been less annoying, more interesting and worth the short time spent reading it 
 WORST BOOK EVER....no joke. I have never written a review but feel it is my duty to do so to warn u of this terrible book 
 Longtime fans of Scott O'Dell's classic Island of the Blue Dolphins, do yourself a favor and avoid this lackluster sequel.  Island of the Blue Dolphins was one of my favorite books as a kid.  I must've read it at least a dozen times.  Somehow, I didn't find out that it had a sequel until years later.  Intrigued by the idea of a sequel to Island, which kind of ends on a cliffhanger, I read Zia.  I was interested in seeing how Scott O'Dell would handle what happens to Karana when she is finally rescued off the island after being stranded for 18 years.  As you probably know, Island of the Blue Dolphins was based on a true story, but the facts are few about the real Lost Woman.  So how would the talented writer Scott O'Dell concoct what happens to Karana?  The result, Zia, is terribly disappointing.  For starters, fans of Karana won't have much to read about.  At least half of the book deals with her niece and nephew trying to go to the island to rescue her.  The story is told completely from the niece's point of view.  We never get to hear what Karana herself thought about experiencing a new land and being reunited with people after so many years, and the sadness she must have faced at finding that her tribe was gone.  We learn almost nothing about what happened to Karana's father and sister, just that her sister's children have ended up orphans in a missionary.  And sadly, there's nothing interesting about Karana's niece Zia and her brother.  They merely serve as plot devices to stretch this paper-thin story out over 100 pages or so.  I now appreciate the "cliffhanger" ending of Island of the Blue Dolphins in its perfect simplicity.  It is better to leave the story when Karana leaves the island, and let it be.  Your own imagination about what it was like for Karana to live at a missionary where no one spoke her language and there was no trace of her tribe left is better than the depressing depiction of her life in Zia.  I wish I could erase Zia from my mind.  Zia truly is a sequel that should not have been written 
 Helpful pop culture analogies to help you decide whether Sword of Shannara is worth your hard-earned money:  The Beatles is to the Monkees as Lord of the Rings is to Sword of Shannara  Pearl Jam is to The Calling as Lord of the Rings is to Sword of Shannara  U2 is to Coldplay as Lord of the Rings is to Sword of Shannara  Guiness is to Natty Light as Lord of the Rings is to Sword of Shannara  Steak is to ground dog meat as Lord of the Rings is to Sword of Shannara  Grand Theft Auto is to 187 Ride or Die as Lord of the Rings is to Sword of Shannara  Sonic the Hedgehog is to Crash Bandicoot as Lord of the Rings is to Sword of Shannara  Final Fantasy is to Legend of Dragoon as Lord of the Rings is to Sword of Shannara  Basically: a pale, unfulfilling and ultimately insulting imitation - the fact that Brooks was lazy and evil enough to copy key characters and plot points from Tolkien verbatim is just icing on a cruddy cruddy cake.  Don't buy this book 
 This book was a required text, otherwise I never would have read it.  The book is full of inconstancies, bad literary technique, and it takes to many pages to cover not enough material.  The authors personal prejudices are obvious.  There are better books on teamwork available 
 I also purchased this product & was extremely disappointed when I found out it did NOT work.  Like the 1st reviewer wrote, it basically is a mini-fan that moves BUT it does NOT cool the car down at all!  There was absolutely NO difference in the temperature of my car after I installed it!  DON'T waste your money 
 I bought this pump because it had the medela name and I thought it was reliable. I was wrong. This is the worst pump in the world. Everything the other poster said is true. This is the worst breastpump. I would NOT recommend this breastpump to anyone 
 $15 just doesn't cut it for 2 episodes of this show and ZERO extra features.  I'm not sure who they are marketing this set for, but I can think of no reason why anyone would buy this. It offers nothing that you can't see in repeats on Cartoon Network 
 Good if you've already familiar with Control Systems.  It skips some parts as detailing in Mathematical Foundation and goes straight to the subject that you want to know. Comes with a CD with a very handy Mathlab program to solve Transfer Functions,etc. However, you have to download the Appendixes from the internet, because contrary to what it says, there are no appendixes on the included CD, only the Mathlab program. But it is a good book for post-graduate students and engineers 
 I'm sure that this review isn't unique.  Spin rotates the same ten bands on its cover, not to mention the ridiculous articles written within. By the time they get done describing the 'euro-punk-indie-pop artist that just slammed them in the face on their way to the train station with their jazzed up sound' I've completely forgotten the point of thier article.  They must have the greatest time just sitting around finding how many contradictory adjectives they can tag onto useless music and still manage to say nothing. They sound like cyber-nerds who need to get out a little more and stop getting thier info from mtv.com. I'm sure that i've learned more about what thier editors do in the office on any given day than anything remotely close to music while reading spin.  Next time you see it on the stands, I suggest you spin in another direction 
 Like Hayek's Road to Serfdom, this book was written during the Secon World War when Keynes was busy crafting the post war peace. It is infused with the 1930s' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the Communist version more than the Nazi/Fascist version. Keynes is indisputably the 2oth century's most important economist but why does Schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position #2? I put it down to the same reason as Marx' Theory of Alienation gained such sway. As there was little else to salvage from Marx' writings, they hit on that to make him apear relevant. Marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that Schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that Schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history. I see little relevant in his work which I feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction. Unlike Gary Becker and other recipients of the Nobel Prize, Schumpeter tackles big issues. But the big issues shrug him off. Nothing here to ponder over 
 I purchased this item to record LPs into my computer thru the input on this device.  It sounded worse than recording through the mono microphone input that was built into my laptop.  Had same experience with LOUD right out of the box too - startled me out of my skin!  Mine didn't come with any disk although the box mentions software.  Then again, I bought this from an Amazon 'partner' from Amazon.  Spend your money wisely and get an iMic.  I'm going to 
 I have always enjoyed Johansen's books but they are getting pretty predictable with the female protagonist and the male protagonist at odds with each other, building into an obsession and her finally succumbing to his charms. Its the same story with her other female protagonists as well. Other than a little different type of killer, these stories are as redundant as a Victoria Holt gothic novel and I gave those up many years ago for the same reason 
 This is a product of the lazy, latter-day Leonard who knows he's a great writer who can just sit back and let it flow. The onetime master of concision now takes a hundred-odd pages just to set things up.  Even his ear for dialogue has started to fade on him. Now everybody like, y'know, talks like, uhh, some kinda boob, get what I'm sayin'? The line of self-parody is lying a little too close in these pages.  He still has a hand with the quirky minor characters, though they can't carry an entire 350-page plus novel. But this one did make it clear to me why Leonard is so popular with the pomo crowd: his characters inhabit an utterly amoral universe, one with no values or standards whatsoever. Here, e.g., the protagonist is that well-known figure drawn from life, the friendly, easygoing loan shark. In your traditional crime novel--Chandler or either MacDonald can serve as examples--the action occurs against a hard-edged moral framework that is at least given lip service. Now I won't demand that every piece of fiction act as a morality play. But this was a case where I finished the thing, and kind of enjoyed the ride, but didn't like myself for it. In Leonard's recent novels, all that matters is who gets to take home the candy. And when you get right down to it, that just ain't enough. 
 I'm a little hesitant to write a review of this book as a male reader that does not gush with positive statements about it being an affirmation of the hardships women face (same would go if I were reviewing The Fear of Flying or A Room of One's Own, both of which are far superior to this outing, although of different genres), but I'll go ahead and write one anyways. Nafisi's account of her life and those of her female students during the past few troubling decades in Tehran didn't provide all of the insight that many have used to champion this work. Nor has she really provided any insights into the works that she uses nor many links between the relevance of these specific works with her students. I know I may get lambasted for saying so, but the memoir and literary criticism does not mesh together well and at no point do we get some semblance of true cohesion. Instead, we get pockets of reflections that come out slightly forced or too general. The layers of interpretation for a character such as Humbert is simplified to either he's a villian or a misunderstood villian, neither of which deals with many of the nuances Nabakov has included. You would expect more from someone who teaches these works if she wants to actually flesh out some of these ideas and the relevance and impact upon her students. The strongest parts of the text lie with her description of university life and the political complexities that emerge surrounding being a literature teacher educated in the West who comes back to Iran to teach. I think one of my problems was the way which the book is marketed as a celebration of sorts of the way literature is important within any context, yet the novel devolves into a simple description of the life of one brave English professor who stands up to the conservative regime and its attempts to curb access to certain books in the country. On a more stylistic level, I was slightly annoyed that the students she describes in the text, as much as she loves and cares for each of them and does try to differentiate them, actually become a massive blob without much indivuality. I had many problems picturing them and the way that they are different from one another. Her husband is also described more as a shadow than anythign else, even though he does play an important role, although a subtle one in many scenes. I think I expected a lot from this novel that I couldn't get from picking up a newspaper and I didn't get much beyond that. 
   I'm afraid I have to agree with the other previously happy Memorex users in noting that Memorex quality/success rate has gone downhill.  I was skeptical when I read the other reviews and I stuck with Memorex, but I have seen the light now. For a year I was very successful with the DVD+R Memorex disks.  In the 25 pack spindles I would buy, they would all work....so in Aug '04 I bought 2 25 packs at Circuit City (a mistake?).   That appears to have been a waste of money.  I just tried to burn a copy of something and I ended up trashing 4 disks in a row.  I was  convincing myself it was my hardware or program or something else.  Then I remembered someone had given me a blank Sony DVD-R disk, so I thought what the heck, let me try that one.    Into the SONY drive it went and it copied without a hitch.   That was the final straw for my Memorex loyalty.  Out of a pack of 25, I have about 10 left, but have had to trash 6 of the 15 I used. Not a good success ratio.  Bye Memorex 
 Okay, I'm going to go against the grain here and say that Suttree really isn't all that good.  Maybe it's fine literature -- although personally I don't think so; I think literature should engage and tell a story that the reader can feel part of, absorbed into with a pathos for its characters, good or bad.  Here we get only snatches of that.  *At times* we feel akin to Suttree.  For example the prison segment is good; there is a sense of purpose and pace here absent from the rest of the book; but on the whole Suttree is a rambling and confusing mess.  Why struggle so much with a book?  It's not that the ideas are so incredibly complex -- sure, at times it's sublime -- but it has a purposefully disconnected storyline.  The reader is meant to feel in the dark and only slowly pick up on the context and setting of the scenes.  The relationship between Suttree and Harrogate is great, but there needs to be more of it -- I feel like saying "yeah, yeah, yeah, just bring me back to the friendship between those two and give us more development of Suttree's mysterious past."  If you want to read this, you have been warned.  You will probably be bored and frustrated a good deal of the time.  Page after page of how someone shaves or combs their hair sound interesting?  If you think it's worth it "in the name of literature", then that's up to you.    Note: I have read Blood Meridian and thought it was an excellent book: definitely go read that one first.  And I read A Child of God, which was also great.  I was hoping to become more of a Cormac McCarthy fan reading this one, but I think I've gotten to the point where I'd rather read the back of my shampoo bottle or peruse my way through a stack of disclaimer forms.  McCarthy is a master of the language, no doubt.  But in order to make us read the book he ought to at least make it interesting 
 Seems to be just another ideologically based treatise and not serious economics. Although everyone that thinks has some degree of plotical bias, this piece appears to be more written to provide talking points for the far Left. Disappointing. 
 This is supposed to be a good book, a life changing book, but its a hard read. A hard read. I find it boring myself. 
 I was happy come across a book by Chatwin and another title that seemed to make sense to me. But - disapointment followed. This book is full of name dropping and references so obscure to a time and age that is really only talking to the gilded ex-pats of yore that were sitting in their chestnut studies in the colonised counties and it doesn;t go much beyond that. I think the basis for better is there in, say, the chapter "the Morality of Things" but published as it is, it is still unformed. The same goes for the Nomad chapters. Basically, these works were left unpublished for a reason. They should have stayed that way. Bruce has died and we should just appreciate his words from his own hand. I suggest you stick with the real Bruce 
 Jerry, si estas leyendo esto: Creo que todos estamos de acuerdo en decir que eres un cantante excepcional. Te queremos mucho!!!  Pero queremos que vuelvas a cantar salsa, como la del tiempo de "Cuenta Conmigo", "Cara de Nino", y "Magia"...  No te dejes influenciar por la musica que esta de moda hoy, el reggaeton no te va!!! No me malinterpretes: hasta tu disco "Vuela muy alto" me encanto, pero creo que ahora es tiempo de volver a la musica que mejor te queda. Seguire escuchando tus discos de salsa anteriores hasta que vuelvas a sacar uno nuevo.  Vamos, por favor, te lo rogamos!!! Te quiere tu fan DJ LOLA, desde Montreal, Canada 
 I wanted to like this book and I certainly agree with its premise. But this is essentially a puffed-up essay and I must respectfully disagree with earlier reviews suggesting that its coverage of Oil-for-Food is detailed or incisive 
 The only paragraphs worth reading are the once Heller got from other books, I'd suggest you'd read those if you want to know about the Tsangpo's history. Otherwise this book is a story written by a man who has little to no self-knowledge, but seems to know what Lindgren (the expedition leader) thinks and feels. Heller criticizes others but doesn't have the gut to look at his own actions. 
 This book deals with a very important and timely topic.  The Cold War had a major impact on academia, and Price is to be applauded for undertaking such an extensive archival research project to document how these dynamics were manifest in anthropology.  His greatest weakness, however, is an uncritical acceptance of the egalitarian rhetoric of the  Soviet Union and the US Communist Party as signifying a genuine committment to humanitarianism and equality.   This grossly inaccurate assumption underlies Price's key theme in the book:  that the FBI and other security agencies in the United States (aka the bad guys) persecuted leftists and communists (aka the good guys) solely as a means to maintain existing race and class hierarchies in the United States.  Anyone with a passing familiarity with the violence and aggression of communist party politics in the 1930s, or the history of the Soviet Union (including its genocidal approach to ethnic minorities within its own borders) should realize this is quite a crock.  Price is certainly not alone in his myopia in this area:  his assumptions reiterate many cherised illusions of the Left.  While these shortcomings may have been forgivable in the past when knowledge about the Soviet Union was more uncertain, any contemporary scholar who ignores the overhwelming array of evidence and testimonials that have emerged from Soviet archives since the end of the Cold War renders himself and his work largely irrelevant to contemporary academic debates in this area.  In that sense, Price's work fits in well with earlier anthropological activists, such as those who militantly defended the Rosenbergs as innocent victims of anti-Semitism and US Cold War hysteria.  Soviet archives have shown, of course, that the Rosenbergs were quite guilty and their defenders in academia were willingly duped by the barrage of Soviet propaganda released on their behalf.   Price continues to reiterate the same theme in his work, never once considering that a peek in the Soviet archives might offer interesting revisions to his assumptions.  Did the KGB maintain files on Franz Boas, Margaret Mead and Gene Weltfish?   This book would make a much greater and more lasting contribution to Cold War scholarship if the author had even a token awareness of the Soviet side of things.  Unfortunately, like so  many leftists, he is more intent on using FOIA to bash the United States rather than to undertake a serious analysis of the way anthropology became suspended (or distorted) between rival superpowers during the Cold War.  For an insightful and disturbing account of how these dynamics have influenced other social sciences,  see Harvy Klehr and John Haynes recent book "In Denial:  Historians, Communism and Espionage."  It is much more enlightening than Price's work 
 Jack Nicholson in this shameless attempt at comedy plays a dog trainer of all professions who gets involved with an oprea singer who is caught up in the underworld of crime. Critcally embarssing to Nicohlson's carrer but jack has done much better to cover this mistake. A minor film with good talent gone to waste, a film way below par considering the re-teaming of director Bob Rafelson & Nicholson from "FIVE EASY PIECES&quot 
 Mammoth is a quick and easy read, perhaps working as simple weekend entertainment.  As a pulp sf/action novel, it has a lot in common with Michael Crichton novels.  For many, that would suffice, but I found Mammoth to be disappointing.  There is very little hard science here:  the physics and philosophy of time travel are completely lacking, for example, supplanted by Rubik's cube hand-waving magic.  Paleontology is discussed at a level that might be expected from a children's museum; part of the story (that part that contains most of the paleontological information) is, in fact, written literally at that level.  But most disappointing is Varley taking consistently wimpy stances on the paradoxes of time travel, the corrupting influence of big business, science vs religion, and especially the rights (or not) of animals.  Mammoth provided a very good framework for Varley to take a stand on these issues, but he takes the middle ground, placating in every instance.  
 I usually give books the benefit of the doubt and stick with them even if I don't like the first few chapters.  I think I made it to page 30 on this one before I took it back to the library (so glad I didn't spend $ on this book!).    I just couldn't stand the name dropping and superficial characters.  Their lifestyle is just foreign to me and not something that appeals to me.  Maybe the book would have surprised me but I expect it followed a predictable formula.  Guess I'll never know but I really don't feel like I missed anything very special.  "Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman" or "The Good Wife Strikes Back" by Elizabeth Buchan are books of the same concept (I assume) and quite enjoyable.  Stick with them instead.   
 I used to wonder how a crack former FBI agent and organized crime specialist like Bill Roemer could write glowing reviews praising the accuracy of Jay Robert Nash's sensationalist works. Then I ran across War of the Godfathers. What a novel idea--to write a novel using real people as characters. If this is any example, however, the late Mr. Roemer displayed little talent in creative fiction and the plot, revolving around a fictional gang war over Las Vegas between the Bonanno Family and the Chicago Outfit, is totally absurd. War of the Godfathers is way over the top and the nearest thing to restraint is Roemer's untypically immodest disguise of himself as a pseudonymous character. It's not especially well written and on top of everything else, the publisher didn't make it abundantly clear that this was a work of fiction. A large number of folks have been taken in by it, with fictional events such as the murder of Moe Dalitz even being reported as fact in several so-called "true crime" books. I don't understand the point of it to this day 
 I expected so much more from Terry.  This book was too boring for words!  Don't waste your money.  She is too talented to put something like this out there.  
 This book was written in 1981 and, unfortunately, it hasn't aged well.  It is loaded with unfulfilled sky-is-falling, doom-and-gloom predictions that look pretty silly in retrospect. I have great respect for Foster's other books, but this one is in desperate need of a rewrite -- with a lot less agitprop and a lot more spirituality 
 Not the Beachboys and definitely not Phychedelic. Sorry, but if I could have given this zero stars I would have. The Partridge Family are by far a more credible band 
 Intrigued by the relative frequency of citation of this book in the new "web 2.0" universe, I was disappointed to find only a sequence of factoids on social experiments and little in the way of analysis.  From the very beginning of the book the reader is invited to agree with the central thesis (that a crowd of independent individuals does better than a smaller elite group) and it very much feels like evidence is carefully selected to reinforce the author's argument.  The book could have been twice as thin without losing much of its substance.  I would qualify it as a light business read, entertaining but not quite convincing if you're not part of the choir 
 This product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit.  What it doesn't say is that you really get a workout.  No matter what incline it is in, it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil.  If you want a strenuous workout, then this unit is for you.  If you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface, then this is NOT the unit for you 
 This is my first Ludlum book and it is sure to be my last.  The plot is preposterous because of Ludlum's limited understanding of economics and history.  Once you realize that, all interest in the story falls away.  It starts off plausible enough...and the blurbs on the jacket imply some "weapon" more powerful than a mere 270 million dollars!  Hitler gained power because of the alignment of a number of situations that made the ground fertile for his brand of megalomania.  Some spoiled, rich American brat and his fortune would hardly make a difference to the currents of history.  I know that this is only supposed to be a work of fiction, and it is all in good fun, but the plot-concept needs to be much more believable to hold my interest.  If you don't need logic in your fiction, it's interesting enough as a cloak and dagger story, but it falls far short in the historical (and economic) fiction department 
 While this book had some good ideas, I thought his advise to men to sleep around after a break up was very irresponsible. He admits that many men will be prone to use sex at this time in an addictive way, to numb their feelings, so why encourage them to do so? Even worse, what about the feelings of the women that these men will be USING for their "healing" sex?? nobody deserves to be used that way 
 I thought the narrator was terrible. She is under the impression that people in upstate New York have southern accents.  Or maybe she never figured out where the story takes place. It must be the mint juleps that confused her. You'd think there would be an editor or coach that would notice this discrepancy, but I guess if nobody could be bothered to edit the author's work, they certainly couldn't worry about the narrator's accents 
  The Million Dollar Baby was a bummer. I mean if like long dry stories that may put you to sleep then read this book. The only story that is filled with action and will keep you on the edge of your seats is the short story Million Dollar Baby. The only reason why that is good because it's just like the movie and the movie is great.   The Monkey Look, Black Jew , Rope Burns etc. are about 25-30 pages a peace and they don't keep you into the book as others.The Movie is the only Millin Dollar Baby anything i would waste my time on.   
 Dr. Rieux, the main character of the novel, moves throughout the book in a detached surreal hopeless manner.  He goes thru the motions of "doing his job" while death surrounds him from a wide spread and accelerating plague.  I find Jose Saramago's "Blindess" to be a far superior book to The Plague.  Similar theme and concept but more descriptive and moving.  The Plague was clinical in its approach - almost bloodless.  I found this highly acclaimed book to be very difficult to re-read, often having to re-read many pages over and over.  I would pass on this book 
 I knew these were inexpensive CD cases, but I can't even open one without it breaking into two pieces.. 
 Why doesn't Solomon write about all the lies that lead up to American involvment in WWI and WWII?Why start in 1965?Americans were being lied into wars long before 1965.You could make an argument that except for the Revolution we have been lied unto every war we have been in 
 Morris Lamb dies suddenly of what appears to be plant poisoning: his plants.  When his house is sold to an Episcopalian priest and her deaf dog companion starts to have seizures, Holly Winter, dog writer and lover, starts to investigate.  I have enjoyed this series that takes place in Cambridge, Ma. I'm definitely a dog person and these are definitely dog lovers books, filled with all kinds of tips and tidbits on dog companions.  I was extremely disappointed in this one, however.  The writing is choppy.  The characters that haven't already been introduced in previous books are underdeveloped.  Conant often seems to babble. I didn't really understand how her opening statements about aliens and ufo's had anything to do with dogs.  The Dog Lover's Mysteries have been a favorite of mine so I'm going to give it another chance and read the next one, but I wish someone had told me earlier not to waste my time on this one.   
 I'm not a literary reviewer or a writer, I'm just a third year Sociology student at the University of Windsor who is being forced to take a statistics course...and forced to use this text. It's bad enough that I have to take the course but, to go and dump on me, probably THE most difficult book in the world to read, is just too much.  The definitions are uncomprehensible, the examples are useless and the explanations are so overly worded you can't even make out what the point is!  On top of all that, the chapters aren't in any type of sensible order and as if all this wasn't enough....the darn thing costs well over $90 (for a book I will never use again!). In sum, the worst possible choice for a statistics course text and a complete waste of money!! 
 I hate this album because it is not of the sinister type of music I like. This album is a fool's work that has no purpose. Why would anyone in the 21st century listen to this? Let's go over the songs.  1. "Not Too Late" 0/10 I hate this song to no end! When I listened to this song, I was like, "Shut up, lady!"  2. Rosie's Lullaby" 0/10 That's the stupidest song ever heard. What the hell are these songs about anyway?  When I listened to this album, I have discovered that this was not the music I wanted. If you want music, then look for the great works by Nox Arcana, and pay no attention to this Nora Jones fool. Stay clear of this Cd, or risk scor 
 I bought this book solely to build the adirondack chair which I recently finished.  Lots of Cut List info makes buying the lumber easy. However, once into a project the pictures/illustrations and descriptions of precise placement of key parts leaves much to be desired. I have built several other chairs from different plans and based on this experience, I sadly cannot recommend this book 
 Until now, I enjoyed John Maxwell's books, but this one is just one big yawn.  Same stuff you read in his other books, which are much better.  
 after owning a number of thermos' and other insulated bottles, this is the best at maintaining temperature and the easiest to break!  parts are available thru zojirushi web site but with shipping and cost of gasket and liner ($3.90 and $8.60, respectively), cheaper to get another carafe.  after buying 5 total during the past year, i'm down to my last one.  thats it, going to another manufacturer.  I did prechill the carafe before filling with ice-water and ice.  i put a cup of cold water in the bottle after a prechill of an hour.  Followed carefully with ice.  Upon putting the 1st cube in the bottle, the glass liner loudly shattered.  I have never seen liners break so easily.  I did notice on the last bottle i have left, before using it, the glass liner was rather loose in the carafe.  i took it apart, and hand tightened everything.  so far okay. this is the last carafe i'll buy that is zorirushi made 
 I read this book because I liked The Ice Storm. I read this book because of the descriptions of what the book was about and the 5 star remarks of various reviewers. I thought, wow... another "Rules of Attraction" something funny, cynical, and stories of passive, troubled youth growing up in the 80's. I thought it was going to be a good read. I was wrong. Wrong. I judged a book because of its descriptions but I should be weary next time. I've never read a book about slackers and 20 somethings so boring in my entire life. Drugs, sex, music, parties, psycho hospitals... those topics should be interesting, fun, sentimental, or whatever to read about. But Moody just bored me and in the end this book should be forgotten. It was highly disappointing and the characters are not worthy. Bret Easton Ellis can at least pull off dispicable and hateful characters that are fun to read about but the dispicable characters in this book I didn't even care for. I just wanted to finish it and get done with it. Just like the characters in this book too stupid to be named, this book is too stupid to be remembered.   
 and it holds up just as well today. in the past few years, the market has been flooded with wrestling-themed albums, mostly containing 30 seconds of generic entrance music stretched out 3 or 4 minutes to create a "song". at least these are "real" songs, which is about the best you can say for them. of the originals, the only keepers are jimmy harts suprisingly catchy "rick springfield" and the absurd yet moronically toe tapping "capt lou's history of music". as for the covers, hearing nikolai volkoff sing cara mia is worth a snicker or two, but not more than that, and mean gene singing at all is embarrassing (although not as bad as his "rock & roll hoochie koo" off the wrestling album II, barely). all the wrestlers chip in on "land of 1000 dances", although i cant quite remember if the original boasted the lyrics "i'm gonna rap you with my cane, you pencil neck geek" or "i'm gonna crush you with my avalanche". the in between song patter between okerland, mcmahon, & ventura is for the most part stilted and unfunny. please, i abhor you, spend your hard earned money on something a little better 
 I found this book to give some false information and mix up the stories. the dates and names are wrong..needless to say i was dissapointed 
 This book was loaned to me by an acquaintance who borrowed the book from the library and thought I'd like it because I'm from SF and I'm edgy. Whatever.  Okay so Beth Lisick is cooler than you. And she's gonna pound that into you over and over again so you KNOW it. She was cool just out of diapers. She "hung out" with her babysitter who was a hippie! Her parents were so "square" that they were cool! (Hey, it's hip to be square, remember?)  And she has an astounding memory. She can remember-at age 4--that it was on a Thursday that something in particular happened. Right.  She's so cool that she was a track star AND homecoming queen, er, princess...but it didn't matter to her, because she's so cool, you see. So she wore an ugly dress because she was too cool to care. Right.  She's so effin cool that when she works with some nuns at a charity auction and they aren't paying attention and she COULD get away with stealing a lot of loose cash that's around she only takes the $40 that she needs and no more and still feels some guilt. Now that's cool, right?  She's so cool she never had to borrow a penny from her wealthy folks. But her dad helped her buy a house. But it was in the "bad" part of Berkeley--really close to Oakland--so she's still cool, see? And there were, get this, DRUG DEALERS on her block! And they knew her name! And it was all just so effin COOL!  Every time she mentions that she spent big bucks on her yuppy life style she apologizes for it, to be sure you know she's not just some kind of a sell-out or something.  Oh yeah, and she's a name dropper. And her brother made a name for himself in advertising and is rich.  And her lifestyle is cooler than yours because she chose to live on temp jobs and be "poor" and arty.  Does everyone see that she's an ARTIST and will never just be normal or want to be? See? See? See? She even thought she might be a LESBIAN!!!! Now if that's not counter-culture what is? Wow.  Good grief. People I've known who are like Lisick are the worst kind of poseurs.   Oh yeah, and she's a MOM, but she's a COOL mom whose baby isn't yuppified because he's snotty (and she wipes his snot off with her hair at one point! Isn't that COOL?) and dirty and dressed all funky and weird. So you know she's an artist.  Please. Spare me this.. 
 Having played chamber music as a seriour amateur most of my life, I recognized with a smile some of the anecdotes which the author recounts of his musical evenings.  This is 5% of the book. The rest is overblown pretentious musings on the nature and value of amateurism with a watch-me-go display of unpersuasive humility and academic erudition about other irrelevancies.  If you've played, you know the few charming parts already.  If you don't, this book is largely filler 
 Fiona Mountain had a good idea for a mystery with Bloodline, but she ruined it with her ham-fisted way of telling a story.  She seems never to have heard that the cardinal rule of good writing is "Show, don't tell", but repeatedly hits the reader over the head with the points she wants to make.  She insists on calling attention to the parallels between Natasha's life and the mystery she's investigating, as if she (the author) were afraid a reader wouldn't be clever enough to notice them on her own.  For example, in describing a scene that takes place in a garden, she says, "The exposed and tangled roots of the weeds were pale through the covering of dark soil", and then feels compelled to add, "The analogy of roots being ripped up wasn't lost on her."  Trust me, if you make it to page 262 (where this passage appears), the analogy wouldn't be lost on you either, even without the authorial intervention.      In my review of Mountain's previous book (Pale as the Dead), I commended her for not letting her research get in the way.  Unfortunately, that isn't the case with this book.  Too often, reading it felt like reading the author's research notes.  She even has one character -- an elderly woman who isn't an academic -- say that, in a conversation which took place many years ago, another character "quoted J. Hooper Harvey's Heritage of Britain".  I find it hard to believe that the character would have remembered not only the title of the book, but also the author's full name, right down to the "J. Hooper".  Sounds to me more like the author, fresh from the library, speaking.   The Natasha Blake mysteries are a bit like Sarah Stewart Taylor's Sweeney St. George mysteries (O' Artful Death, etc.), in that both series are about a young woman with an unusual job that causes her to get involved in solving mysteries from a different angle.   If that concept sounds intriguing to you, I would recommend that you spend some time with Sweeney St. George.  After reading Bloodline, I can't say the same for Natasha Blake.  
 wow. i bought into Jessica Simpson's "music" because I was brainwashed  by her glossy image, and "cool" life from watching her act ditzy on MTV...anyway, i purchased this sucky cd and i was 13 at the time, so i tore it open, threw it in my cd player, and was in instant popstar heaven, but as i approached my 15th birthday, i started to realize this music was bad ...REAL BAD. first of all the singing (if thats what you want to call it) is abysmal! just(try)to listen to her breathy, exasperated voice. she has to put her whole BEING into pushing the strained croaks out of her mouth. hand waving, and neck jerking obviously helps ease the process. the cd sucks. i only like In this Skin, and Everyday i See Yoou, but whenever i take out this cd, it's not for a listen, it's for a great laugh fest with my sister about the hellish sound of her voice. jessica is talentless on this (and all her cd's) and i am about to sell this disc to someone stupid enough to buy it. if i were you i would avoid this like my life depended on it, and buy some good music. try some michael jackson why don't ya. THAT'S MUSIC. not this sh* 
 It is rare for me to feel almost completely negative about a publication. If this is your first survival book and you are looking to learn the basics of survival then I feel this is not the book.  Honestly if I had not been so busy I would have returned the book.   It is clear that Mr. McPherson is experienced but one has to translate that experience in a well written, well illustrated, manner in order to convey that experience to the unfledged.  The  horrible and I mean horrible black and white photos and the writing which too often assumes that one knows the definitions of may of the terms used in providing an explanation makes for a quick turn-off to the novice. In fairness this book might be great for someone who has some experience.  However, in this day and age of DVDs and well illustrated colored photos and diagrams this book sorely fails to make learning easy for the novice.  For me, this book was a terrible first purchase.  I wish I could trade this book in for a DVD by Mr. Pherson, perhaps in that media he could convey his experience well. 
 If you are completely new to digital photography there are better books than this one, if you are experienced or even a pro, there are many better books than this one and if you are looking for pretty nudes there are tons of better books than this one.   Seems to me the nude photography tilte was just a way to sell more books, as there is not too much info in the book related to that, other than the most basic stuff. The images are not that good either, not too many different models, poor lighting, ugly poses in many of them.. it all seems like it was done in a hurry.  If you are an absolute beginner in the field of nude photography the "maybe" this might have some info for you, as a starting point I guess, but that's about it.  Not recomended at all 
 although its a great idea, the CDROM is absolutely useless as a photo reference. this goes for figure drawing and other uses of the figure. the closeups are grainy at best and the navigation nothing more that a novelty  without high resolution.  the tutorial has some merit for just beginning,  but not really useful beyond a very short introduction. i am embarassed to  admit that i was lured into buying this book 
 I actually found the early part of the book dealing with the nuclear weapon okay -- not great like Cussler's books. Just okay. But there appeared to be a major change in style, going from a poor Cussler writing style to completely boring and pathetic. But I also had some sympathy for the American tycoon whose son had been killed by terrorists -- and he was the "bad guy" -- so I lost interest in finishing the book.  
 My first Grisham novel, and it reminded me of why I seldom read fiction.  The plot has numerous barely-believable twists, the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility.  Said lawyer then drives from Memphis to New Orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion.  Absurd!  No attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing!  The "storybook ending"just prior to the boarding of the FBI Director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy.  Also, I highly doubt that the FBI Director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases.  Thankfully, I paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago.  Given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level (and I have no children), it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall.  First Grisham = LAST Grisham 
 The author thinks his four years in college demonstrate some important sociological truths. They don't. His book is boring in style, boring in substance. Can't imagine how he got into Harvard 
 I enjoyed Covey's 7-habits work, and bought this to add to my collection of leadership books. This is one of the most heavy handed, preachy books that I have encoutered. Give me a break! After vomiting, I threw it out. Save your money and try these instead:  Leadership Challenge 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership Good to Great First Break all the Rules 
 Sternberg's fills this book with a little too many personal anecdotes (i.e., with himself as central figure) to feel comfortable with the objectivity of his scholarship. The title should be Attributes of Successful People, but it does not seem to be about intelligence, nor does the author seem to have a consistent meaning for the term intelligence. At times he expands his generally valid complaints about intelligence tests to include acheivement and all other tests, despite the fact that they presumably measure acheived knowledge and not ability or potential to learn. There is little to explain why he settled on just his three types of intelligence (analytical, creative, and practical) and at times, he seems to be implicitly accept some of Gardner's, such as spatial intelligence 
 It is interesting that the reviews of this book are quite bipolar. Most reviewers seem to love it; others hate it.  It is also interesting that people find the positive reviews much more helpful than the negative ones. Who is kidding whom?  In fact the book is awful and I would give negative stars if I could.  Saying that an author is courageous in bucking politically correct sentiment and implying that that sentiment somehow blocks "true science" is a cheap defense.  This book may buck a common concensus.  But it is nonsense and courageous only in the sense that the author loves to attract attention, even in the form of the disgust of other scientists.  Rushton's "scientific research" in volves a wonderful array of adhoc definitions and types of "proof" carefully twisted to serve his purposes. They are a disgraceful parody of scientific method.  some examples  1/ inventiveness?  the earliest development of farming, civilization, paper, large scale construction, writing etc. were actually in the Middle East-among people who don't fit the race classification at all. Europeans were quite late to achieve civilization and they learned it by and large from the Middle East. -  2/ the notions of R and K selection are so badly abused that Rushton actually uses them backward. Relatively steady (typically tropical) environments not northern ones are the ones that produce populations making few babies and investing heavily in them. They are not the ones that make many offspring and take little care. That tends to happen in areas of the world where lethal crises (such as freezing) regularly intervene, making heavy investment in children a questionable strategy.The proof? Two of the most highly K-selected species in the world, People and Gorillas come from the tropics.   3/body design: large breasts and buttocks are ways to store body fat (which all women store more than men) without it putting it under the skin where it acts as an insulator.  In short it is an adaptation to hot climates where getting rid of body heat is essential.  In colder climates people need the fat as insulation and therefore spread it over their bodies.  Besides the assumption that these,particularly big breasts, are sexy is an American fetish not shared by most populations nor by most Africans.  Over all body fat, tending to signify fertility is a more common basis for evaluation.  fertility: In fact there is very little if any evidence that natural fecundity (the biological basis of fertility) varies by biological group except as a consequence of disease, malnutrition or significant breastfeeding. Fertility depends largely on how one makes us of that fecundity. The most fecund and fertile population on record is among some groups of white North Americans who work to maximize their reproduction.    Breast feeding is perhaps the most significant "investment" that a parent can make in a child.  Moreover, significant breast feeding is well-established as being a powerful contraceptive.  European populations led the way in eliminating breastfeeding.  African populations continued to breastfeed until they were taught by whites that it was "uncivilized"  or even tricked, as by Nestle, to stop.  IQ--just a wee bit of controversity about what it means and how to measure it.  One thing is clear.  Purposely (or even naively giving people tests irrelevant to their lives and even the language they speak or the degree of their education.  can generate any "results" one wants.  Such methods have been used to estblish an "average IQ" of 70 for subsaharan Africa.  Such an IQ implies that most Africans are retarded to the point of being dysfunctionat; that societies could not survive and could certainly not produce  rich artistic and religious lives.  Anyone with any experience or even reading about Africa knows how silly this is.    violence:  given slavery and world conquest and mass destruction which people have actually been violent?  Given slavery, it is virtually certain that black women have been raped by whites than the other way around.  Race related IQ--how do Native Americans on reservations, known to be genetically derived from "very smart" Asians do on IQ tests?  How did Ashkenazi Jews, a loosely defined genetic group but hardly a race--unless you suddenly argue that whites aren't monolithic after all, (Jews haven't always been considered white)--went from doing so badly on IQ tests as to be considered unfit for American citizen ship to doing so well that they are one group of "whites" who compete successfully with privileged Asians. How do we explain the fact that the same biological groups do poorly or well depending on their status in the society in which they reside.  the problems can't be in the genes, they have to be in the tests or in the social conditions in which they live.  early age at menarchy.  Age at menarche is heavily dependent on the accumulation of body fat by young women.  Menarchy is not reached until the body has stored enough fat to support a preganancy.  In fact age at menarche is HIGH in cultures (most)where fatness is hard to achieve.  It has declined everywhere (for example in Europe and the United States in the last century and a half  It is a nutritional variable, not a racial one.  Crime rates: are we talking only about storefront crime or white collar crime.  Murder is clearly a function of the availability of guns than of color  race: what do we do with the fact that there are several different dark skinned groups in the world.  Black Melanesians and Australians are more closely related to whites than they are to Africans.  What race is that?  What about the fact most people are intermediate in color which shows a clear latitudinal gradient.  What of the fact that many African groups have narrow noses and short limbs, and that the shape of ones nose or lips or even the sickle cell trait don't correlate with color.   I could go on and on.  Anyone who thinks that this is a good book better become familiar with some of the realities of human biology and history..  I will be very happy to debate any of this with anyone, any convenient time 
 They don't look as nice as the photo, they look rather cheesy. Retraction mechanism works reasonably well if you're careful with it. Sound quality is average. I'm keeping mine as a backup set only 
 As Star Wars kits go, it's better than most. Ertl should have spent more time on the molds and getting the details right.   The kit, while having very few parts, is not a novice kit. It has fit issues and badly Ôªømis-aligned parts. The upper and lower fuselages do not mate well and the solar panels do not align well with the hull. The solar panels tend to cant to the rear, not setting in line with the fuse.  It's a case of both of the parts, the solar panels and the fuselage being out of alinement. Much work is needed to get the solar panels to aline with the hull and the mounting pylons.  One bright spot is the well defined, engraved panel lines and the small details. The upper hatch and cockpit glass is the clearest of the Star Wars kits I have built.   It's better than the X-Wing and other fighters and is as good in the detail department as the AT-AT. Having not built the rare Tie Fighter kit, I cannot say how it rate against it.  Once the fit problems are dealt with, and a good paint job is applied, it makes a good display, but it requires some modeling experience to get it to look as it should. The stand is not sturdy enough for the weight of the model. I suggest a clear plastic rod and a wooden base 
 After reading such good reviews, I decided to buy the CD.  Only to discover it is not my kind of music.  This is like a kindergarten kind of music.  
 The carver style of governance is a tad idealistic and perhaps overly optimistic.  I have read everything Dr Carver has written concerning this field and enjoy this material at an academic level.  But when it comes to  operationalizing this model in boardrooms I've seen it fail time and time  again.  Not to say that the model is flawed because in fact the model is  normative and conceptually complete.  However it doesn't capture that  element of reality from which, in my experience, the model requires -  practicality and real-world application.  Dr Carver's notion that Boards  can do without Finance and Audit Committees is very naive.  Most  consultants from the chartered accountant genre are saying the complete  opposite.  In fact most government policy initiatives are moving toward  more control of financial affairs of organizations for boards from charts  of accounts to fiscal policy.  So I don't think the elimination of Finance  and Audit Committees is realistic nor is it a terribly bright suggestion.   I guess my only crticism is that the carver model is far to idealistic and  philosophical for a practical application in the form Dr Carver suggests.   Sorry but a hybrid model of traditional Board governance and the carver  model may work given the commitment required from directors to  follow-though on everything suggested in that system of governance 
 First of all, lets get this out the way, I'm not giving this album one star, I'm giving Ron White one star. I love this album, but only because its the first thing I ever saw or heard him do. He uses the same exact material that he used for "They Call Me Tater Salad", "Truckstop Comedy", "The Blue Collar Comedy Tour", and "The Blue Collar Comedy Tour Rides Again." On a comedy central presents show he did the same material. The first time I heard the words "Take off the hat!" come from Ron's mouth I was in tears, but now I've heard it so much I'm sick of it. Carlin, Pryor, and even Foxworthy have different material for televison specials. Please Ron, get new stuff. 
 The first year or so, the characters made me think being 13 would really be this simple and fun. Reality set in pretty fast, however. Ann Martin lightly tiptoes around subjects like disabilites, absentee parents, and divorce. As a child of divorce from the age of five on, I found the butter-smooth TV-sitcom resolutions of (I think) two characters' parental break-ups downright insulting, even at my young age at the time.   Ms. Martin, you are doing girls no favors with this one-dimensional cotton-candy fantasy teenage world, written only for cold hard cash. How many are there now, 500+? Speaking of which,  my mother bought a second copy of the first 1986 printing of BSC #1 and still has it sealed in plastic like a mint-condition comic book. Maybe in 40 or so years, or after Ms. Martin kicks the bucket, whatever comes first, it'll be worth a little $$ for us. Just food for thought. 
 The title of this one says it all...an ordinary white boy has what passes for marginal adventures of a disaffected youth in upstate New York...unfortunately, for Clarke Richard Russo rules this roost...and as result he is treading on heretofore explored territory and Clarke's prose and narrative are vanilla in comparison 
 I picked up this book expecting a fresh approach and analysis of Dr. King apart from the obligatory images we're force-fed each new year.  Instead, I was disappointed to find that Eric Dyson made heavy use of speculation with the intent to scandalize more than to inform and enlighten.  One such example includes Dyson conveying the idea that Dr. King may have engaged in orgies with many different women along with his right-hand man Ralph Abernathy.  He then goes on to infer that there was talk of King and Abernathy engaging in sexual acts with each other!  The author had no commentary to either support or dispel this "theory" making Dyson's retelling of the alleged incident totally irresponsible and even libelous.  He just dropped the information, true or untrue, in the readers lap to do with as the reader pleased.  To that end, it is my opinion that Dyson's intent in writing this book was in no way honorable or truth-seeking, rather it was a means to convey his baseless ideas to anyone who would listen.  I'm reminded of something my grandmother and mother would always say to me, "an empty wagon makes the loudest noise." Eric Dyson makes a lot of noise in this book but totally lacks substance.  This was an expensive tabloid 
 Reading this book was hard work,and pretty irritating to get through. It is written by an Englishman and is strictly for English audiences. Practically every page contains slang, colloquialisms and references to people, places, and things that have no meaning to Americans at all. The writing style is also confusing, going back and forth with the subject at hand so you constantly have to go back to figure out who said what about who when etc. NOT a pleasant read. I am a great Peter Green fan so I muddled through. The author is obviously not a musician either,  not very insightful commentary on music or musicians. Lots of anecdotal hero worship, which according to Peter's history and interviews is exactly what he does not want.  Hard to believe this is the authorised biography 
 I found this book rather dull perhaps because I generally dislike  "period" mysteries. A few clever paragraphs to be sure, but in  between these were alot of somewhat stereotypical characterizations and  forgettable dialogue. Those who enjoy period pieces and all their  assumptions and artificiality may like this novel but I did not 
 I received this coffeemaker for Christmas.  After two months of use, it quit working. I contacted Hamilton Beach and they sent me something to clean my coffeemaker.  It still did not work so I contacted Hamilton Beach again.  Now I have to cut off my appliance cord and send it back to them along with $6 to get a new cord.  Since it wasn't my fault, why should it cost me anything to get my coffeemaker restored.  Stay away from Hamilton Beach products 
 George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino have got to be two of the worst actors of all time. It's sheer agony to watch these nerds pretend to be macho tough guys.  This whole flick is akin to getting a gift-wrapped package wrapped in the fanciest wrapping paper... Problem is, as is often the case with Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, ain't nothin' inside the package. Get it? These guys like the worst movies and have managed to become the makers of some of the worst movies ever. The word shallow comes to mind. There is nothing there, and I doubt that there ever will be.  However, having said that, I must give credit where credit is due: Juliette Lewis, the talented Juliette Lewis, is terrific as usual. Good to see Harvey Keitel do his thing, same goes for Fred Williamson, the rarely seen Michael Parks (this guy, by the way made some terrific country-type records back in the 60's--and we wish he'd do more. He's up there with Merle Haggard  in my humble opinion) and, last but not least, the beautiful Salma Hayek  is also in this, although she hardly does enough. She still had the curves back then.   In addition to the above, we could have done without all the obvious and crappy CGI effects at the end. The stuff just doesn't work; never did.  By the way, the documentary FULL -TILT BOOGIE is way better than the main feature. 
 Fundamentalist Christians use the Bible as their "Encyclopedia".  They have open minds to new ways of looking at things, as long as the proposal is accompanied by a contextual look at relevant scripture.  I can't speak for anyone else's religion, and neither should the author.  It's significant this was published in September 2001.. 
 "Leaving Reality Behind.." is a myopic and biased account of a subject that just isn't that interesting.  Unless you were one of the eToys.com employees or one of the 'cutting-edge European artists' of etoy, the 'Toywar' was quite simply a non-event for the rest of the planet.  In essence, the authors (who clearly are sided and likely involved with the etoy camp) are trying to dress up a relatively trivial legal dispute over a domain name that is now about three years old.  Why is this interesting??  Throw another 'yet-another-dotcom-story' on the pile 
 This isn't a very good text, especially for anyone new to the field. The quality of some of the diagrams/figures is third rate (to say the least). There are frequent mistakes in derivations and equations.   Nicholas, Research Fellow (Physics 
 A Royal Waste of Time is another character sketch on "how to do" Worship.  Although, highly insightful on Corporate Worship, Dawn misses the mark on true Biblical Worship.  She is blur of many authors today who are trying to "fix" Worship instead of doing Worship - just another slant on how to create a corporate worship environment 
 No thrills and a pointless plot marr what could have been a pretty decent story.  The whole thing is based on who wants to kill Darby and why. And that is where it falls apart. The FBI or CIA could have easily investigated faster and easier then she could, and what is the point of trying to kill her?  To bury what is already out in the open? The FBI, CIA and White House all had a copy. What are they trying to silence? Nothing at all. Perhaps if it were just for revenge the plot might not have collapsed on itself 
 Almost unbelievably bad, except I saw the remake of 'Shaft,' which should have been a forewarning.  This is like a comic book for filmgoers.  No, not a graphic novel adapted to the screen.  More like a comic book for kids, that you'd be embarassed to own at any age.  Doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack, a travesty to the nth degree.    
 I bought two Clarisonic brushes - one as a gift and one for myself.  Although the product works well, unfortunately, both brushes were defective.  The trouble started occurring about two months after using.  One brush started out with two speed settings, but eventually only functioned at the low setting.  The other brush started turning on by itself and eventually could not be recharged!  My experience with the customer service has been terrible.  They would not replace my brush for me even though the product was still under warranty.  Be careful if you are going to travel abroad.  The warranty on the brush is nulled if you use the brush in a power outlet other than 110v!  
 This album was a disappointment. I was looking forward to Muddy's covers of "Caldoinia" and "Kansas City" but it wasnt what I thought itd be. Dont get me wrong, Muddy himself was fine, but he gets  overshadowed by the musical collaborators. There is an overuse of harmonica  and organ, and the annoying presence of ACCORDIAN! Accordians and Waters do  not mix. This over-instrumentalization leaves the album sounding lame and  folky and not bluesy. If you're looking for Muddy's later work, try  "Blues Sky", with Muddy working with Johnny Winter and his back  to basics production 
 Deaver's skill at weaving a crafty and intriguing suspense story is sound.  He has the bare bones of the work down to a science, and when it comes to most of his tales, the bones themselves are strong, hearty, and glistening white.  In this case, however, those bones have virtually no muscle.  This tale is about Tate Collier, his ex, Bett, and their kidnapped child, Megan.  The villian for this tale, a slick-tongued psychiatrist named Aaron Matthews, is a man of such skill that he can talk virtually anyone into anything, a talent that rivals that of our protagonist, Tate, a lawyer who once wielded the same verbal weapons in the courtroom.  As I said, the story itself has some intriguing twists and turns, as all suspense tales should, and it offers up satisfying obstacles and the usual mysteries, but they fall flat for a number of reasons.  1.  When the crux of your tale lies on creating characters of uncanny persuasive abilities, the heart of your novel must lie within the dialogue those characters utilize.  In this case, neither Matthews or Collier ever speak convincingly enough, in my opinion, to warrant their being labelled as men who "speak in tongues."  And although a lot of interpretation must be allowed for the written medium, it still doesn't seem like Matthews' talent for conniving others is as plausible as the novel would like it to be.  2.  The book falls prey to a pretty major pitfall for literature of this type, and that is over-elaborate explanations for key motives and behavoirs.  We even get treated to a cliched moment of having the bad guy reveal his whole plot to the good guys before actually going through with the plot.  3.  Implausibility.  There are some areas of the book that are downright laughable, aside from the already mentioned superhuman talent at persuasiveness some of the characters possess.  4.  My biggest pet peeve: Deaver cannot write dialogue for teenagers.  In an attempt at creating authenticity, Deaver peppers their dialogue with an abundance of "like"s and "way lame"s so that they sound like rejects from some B-grade rip-off of a Dazed and Confused remake.  I understand that kids still occasionally talk like this, but Deaver's use of these trite bits of characterization is so liberal it becomes intrusive and annoying and ludicrous.  If you want to try Deaver, check out The Devil's Teardrop or the Bone Collector.  This is not worth the effort 
 This is hardly a "big book" of customer service; it's more like a cheesy, small book of stupidity. The "games" are described inaccurately with words such as "active, fun, high energy" (to paraphrase), when in fact the "games" are word searches, fill in the blanks, and other single user, paper and pencil, kindergarden level time wasters. The teacher or trainer is supposed to use certain pages for "overheads," whatever those are. I'm guessing this book is so old (and therefore so out of date) that overheads were something in use prior to the invention of the computer. Finally, the drawings are as immature and poorly rendered as the lack of thought, lack of creativity, and lack of usefulness that is characteristic of this entire book. I returned it, and regret that I have to pay return shipping charges; I am that dissatisfied with this purchase. If you really want a great CS book, get "Secret Service" by John DiJulius (founder of John Roberts Hair). That book is everything this book purports to be, and more. John is intelligent, observant, a great communicator, and he doesn't treat the trainer or the learner like a grammar school class. His book is 5 stars; this book is less than zero 
 In linguistics, grammatical "experts" are referred to as prescriptivists--those who say that there is a right way and a wrong way to use a language.  Query, however, what is the point of a language--to communicate an idea between people.  So long as you can meet this objective, a linguist would say you have met your goal.  Saying, as Ms. O'Conner does, that you shouldn't talk to certain people due to their grammatical choices only reinforces an elitist attitude which is almost religious in nature where grammatical prophets are deemed heretics and outcast from the elite just as quickly.  Instead, we should appreciate the differences among people, see the beauty in the differences in language, try not to offend others with our language, and appreciate the beautiful miracle that is language.  To do otherwise is to miss out on the wonder of spontaneous order that is language 
 This book 4 Days in Eternity, by Wayne Marentette was OK at best. I highly recommend Psychic Gifts by Tiffany Snow ISBN number 0972962301, if you are seeking a book with "Substance" that goes much deeper. 4 Days seemed like an eternity when I was reading it, drags on 
 This battery does not fit the camera I purchased. The camera comes with a battery, so why did you try to sell me another one, one that does not fit, no less? I have returned the battery but have not heard back from you on the return. It has been two weeks 
 We begin with a spark of consciousness, an instinctual  incentive to use our brain for survival. But before we've learned much of anything, we're already 'here'. Our consciousness isn't a result of  a required amount of computational power, its  there first. We know this intuitively, because we feel/know it first-hand  in ourselves, and make the fair assumption that other humans have this in common with us. (It's not that far of a leap in faith to assume a quality of self-awareness in animals, who have little if any discernable computational ability.) Somewhere along the line, some 'scientists'  forgot this, and theorized that when a machine got smart enough it would be more than a machine. This  has nothing to do with self-awareness any form we actually know it. Computers have been 'out-thinking' people in many ways for quite while, (mostly as a matter of simply being able to 'turn' to the correct 'page' of their theoretically unlimited 'memory' a billion times faster than we can), and yet they are still just machines. Getting them another billion times 'smarter' won't really change a thing, except, perhaps, for a more perfect illusion.  
 Nature enthusiast Gary Ferguson takes us on his extensive backpacking experiences through Yellowstone National Park. He introduces us to the people he meets and his companions, notes the spectacular wildlife and visages that he encounters, discusses some of the ecological issues facing Yellowstone, and gives us a look into the nuts and bolts of making decisions when hiking through the wild.  The Good and the Bad: I enjoyed some of this book, but generally I found more to complain about than to praise. This book, while lacking in major faults, just seemed to have no spark of its own that would make reading it a requirement. I felt as if I'd heard each environmental discussion before, read similar descriptions of the park in other books, and was frankly skeptically annoyed at Ferguson's claims that encountering a moose bore spiritual meaning, one proof of which was the mystical departure of a cold after seeing a moose.      Ferguson displays an impressive knowledge of the species that he encounters, and I appreciated his willingness to note the wildlife, and to share interesting tidbits of information about everything from wildflowers to otters. For me, these areas were where the book was most successful.      But the overall tone gave me the impression that Ferguson perceives a world in which nature can only be truly understood by those in a special club who are willing to pay homage to the spirit of the land. Ferguson's desire to read meaning into ordinary encounters just rubbed me the wrong way, I suppose, and even now I'm struggling to put my finger on exactly what bothered me so much.  
 Decent good guys but what drunk wrote the story.  How did the Zhentarim get dragged into a story that some many holes in it.   The book should be called the Realm book that no story written just for the money potential.   Realms fans are sadly ripped off by this Harpers series wannabee 
 After the success of 8 mile, it was obvious that hollywood would make a clone to cash in. The movie certainly looks very cheap, nothing spectacular, not even in the shootings.  The story is predictable 50 cents' mother is killed when he is young, he gets tough, kind of wanting to avenge his mom, becomes a gangster, then a better gangster because his mentor gangster is good at this gangster-job.  Predictably, 50 goes to jail, remembers his lost dream of being a rapper, though it was never clear that he wanted to be a rapper. of course he must fight his former crime buddies because no one can "retire" from crime, as we know from countless mafia movies.  In the movie as in real life, 50 cent IS a speech impaired rapper, he just mumbles through his songs. This is addressed in the movie, and for fans this brings value to the film, we see 50 struggling with his own lack of clarity.  There is a strange side-story in the movie that is not persued and does not add anything, which is sad, because it had real potential. In the movie, 50s mom is killed and until the end we don't know who did it, but it turns out that the two main suspects might also be 50s dad, and in the end it looks like his dad killed his mom, and there could have been some nice struggle in the possible dads over all this. In fact in connection with this side plot we have the movie's one ray of light: Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaie, who plays Majestic, the afformentioned good at gangsterism gangster. He is a superb actor, outclassing anything in the movie (including "Bana" played by the excellent actor from Hustle and Flow). If he was white he would be hailed as the next young Brando, he's that good. Sadly, trapped in this aweful movie he has to give terrible lines. His subtle struggle, not knowing if he is 50s dad, is drowned out, because one does not look for good acting a movie like this. I first noticed this actor in The Bourne Identity (the matt damon one), where he has a small role, but steals every scene he is in. I found the ending the worst part, because as 50 finally makes it onto stage, the winner, the hero, stepping into the limelight, he falls totally flat. just a muscle bound guy with no expression, and oddly no pressence, inspite of his bulked up, schwarzenegger body. Perhaps this total lack of pressence is part of his appeal. Eric B. and rakim, where are you?  So if you love 50, you might get something out of this, otherwise stay away, if you are forced to watch it, keep an eye on majestic.  
 I am a Patterson fan, and was looking forward to reading this book. However, this was the grossest book I've ever set eyes on. I found myself skipping whole sections because of the revolting battle images described by the author(s). I'm not a wimp, I see a lot of really gross stuff at work (I'm a nurse), but this was just so over the top that I couldn't finish it. Might be a good tool for those on a diet tho.. 
 I sent for this CD twice but never got one that had anything on it.  You must have had a bad batch because I finally asked for a refund. I love this group and would have enjoyed hearing them 
 I bought this for my dad's birthday.  He is a fisherman.  This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen.  Not entertaining, not funny, not interesting, not even a fishing movie.  I bought it based on several reviews I read.  This is the first time I've been led astray on Amazon.  The "5 Stars" rating must be a review by people with a financial interest in this waste of digital energy 
 Having recently read The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory and The Birth of Venus by by Sarah Dunant, I was very much disappointed in this novel by Jeanne Kalogridis.  It does not match the complexity of plot, character or style found in the other two works of historical fiction about women; its badly written, graphic love scenes diminish it even more 
 Anyone who's read this book, or is considering doing so, should consider what has come to light about Judith Miller's reporting in the build-up to the Iraq war (simply do a search on google for "Judith Miller" - see, in particular, the articles in Slate). Miller was regularly writing front page columns for the New York Times which contained sensational claims (now known to be wildly inaccurate) about Iraq's possession - or efforts to obtain - WMDs. One telling detail to the quality of Miller's reporting can be gleaned from her concession in May of 2003 that the now-discredited Ahmed Chalabi provided most of the scoops (aka lies) for her front page stories on WMDs.   Based on the sheer extent of errors in her pre-war reporting, I think readers of Miller's work need to utilize a heightened degree of skepticism when assessing her claims. 
 SKYSCRAPER is in one word, awful.  Anna Nicole Smith wouldn't know how to act, and once you've seen her watermelons once, they're not all that attractive.  The two love scenes with the wimpy background songs are some of the worst ever put on celluloid.  The acting is all around atrocious, especially Charles Hubere in the role of Fairfax, the Shakespeare spouting rastaman.  When Anna spouts off to her cop husband, that she wants a baby, you just wanna stick a binkie in her mouth, but not one as big as hers or she'd gag. Which is just what one must do to survive this horrifying cinematic waste 
 I am giving this one star because Brandon Lee is in it (may he rest in peace) and the martial arts skills he displays are exceptional-not because the movie is in any way deserving of it. Forget the cheesy dialogue and the overload of testosterone that pervades this disaster. The hideous scene where the tatooed Yakuza guy hacks off the head of the blonde woman with a Samauri sword while copulating her from behind goes beyong the boundaries of poor taste into pure evil. It is so disturbing that it will haunt you forever. A sadistic, sick, unnecessary scene that actually made me physically ill. I can't believe the scriptwriter would even concieve of such a scenario. It is beyond awful and completely demeaning towards women.  As for those not bothered by that scene, I can only weep at how desensitized towards sexual violence our society has become 
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
 The first half hour of this 90 minute movie is actually quite good.  In fact, it is enthralling and has an interesting twist in that we don't know the real fact behind whether a young woman was violated by her boyfriend while unconscious.  According to the rumor (the rumor being a school experiment conducted by three roommates) she was, however, but we the audience don't know that.  However, the young woman is quick to think she has been raped.  Why there is no attempt at a physical exam, is unexplained, especially since the young woman involved has the reputation of being a professional virgin, however it turns out she isn't, so that's why the movie lasts longer than 30 minutes.  Fortunately, we're not dealing with unwanted pregnancies, either, so this doesn't turn into a soap opera.  However, we do have the dreamboat "hero" who dreams up the rumor about her being raped, and who exhibits unlikeable traits throughout. But that's true of the three leads - the roommates are all unlikeable, being insufferably full of themselves.  The last half of the film, 'dreamboat' takes the turn as lead character, and it's his story we're following, whereas his female roommate had the first half of the film, and basically it's her introduction to the audience of all the characters. Turns out 'dreamboat' and the young woman victim have a history together; which means issues they have to work out, and everyone else (in a way, the entire student body and its faculty and local law enforcement) is sucked into their story and mutual thirst for truth, though the characters don't have the same truth in mind - it's about vengeance; not justice.  And vengeance when it's not the comic book variety, isn't fun for an audience, it's just distasteful.  In other words, the man and woman should have been shut up together in a room so they could have worked it out for themselves, and left the rest of us alone.  So from a brilliant first half-hour - and btw how does the roommate penniless art student have the dollars for all that tech equipment? - we degenerate into a constantly weaving pattern of lies and deceptions that seems more pointless than clever.  There is merely too much story, so it becomes ridiculous.  A basically good premise is ruined.  If you are a fan of any of the stars involved, it might be worth viewing, if only once, but the film as a whole will probably leave a vile taste in your mouth.  Perhaps that's the ultimate message on a film about the dangers of spreading GOSSIP, or in this case deliberate lies, is that what goes around comes around, and also it will leave you feeling sick to your stomach.  I almost recommend you watch the first 30-45 min then quit midway, but anyone will watch all the way thru at least once, just to be sure where this is headed 
 While I appreciate the author's attempt to write an entertaining Christian novel, and while the theme of the novel is very relevant, it was apparent to me fairly early on what direction the story line was going.  I kept waiting for it to take a truly unexpected turn, and it never did.  Also, I think a better job could have been done of portraying the inner struggles of the main character 
 The previous reviews and the author and the conference suggested such mundane, goody-goody uses that it was all I could do to stay awake. Anyone who bothers to give any effort at making this world a better place to live, has to know that death-control is a major loser. Keeping more people alive just makes for more miserable, angry people.   Birth control is where the money should go. If you question that, try reading Constant Battles 
    All this is iis a bunch of 1:00 long songs that are all crap. They should have put This Might Be A Wiki or at least Boss of Me on here. But, unfortunately, it's a FLOP! FLOP! FLOP! Useless noise!      LOCAL CRAZY MONKE 
 MINUS 5 stars-save your money Vague. Covers mostly recumbent racing of decades gone by (who cares)-coverage of so called "modern" recumbents is little. Most brands covered have gone by the wayside.  So called "Homebuilder's" section elaborates on the obvious with a few small dark pics. Very few pics in the book and the ones in there are small, dark and black & white. The color pics in the center of the book, of course, cover racing 
 just stick down the adhesive and slide the plastic part over it! your problems are solved! WRONG! i followed the directions 100% and within one day, water had gotten under the guard and loosened the adhesive. super strong adhesive only works if water doesn't get near it, and this product does not prevent water from getting next the adhesive tape. i had to caulk around the entire bottom of the guard to ensure it wouldn't come unstuck again and the product still doesn't work. save your money and don't buy this! 
 I'm not a cosmologist, but Stephen Hawking's Universe was so simply written it is essentially condescending.  The language is akin to the level one would read in a newspaper.  Moreover, the pictures are second rate pre-contact lense Hubble knock-offs (despite being published in 1997), and the book has very little to do with Stephen Hawking.  Sure, he wrote the foreward and did some editing, but it lacks the wit and wonder of a Hawking work.  Naming the book after him and putting his picture on the front is misleading.  I AM a chemist, and despite this, Filkin's descriptions of Chemical discoveries left even me guessing because he was attempting to dumb-down ideas that aren't dumb-downable, and didn't include diagrams which would be helpful for anyone trying to understand the concepts (like neutrino capturing or particle acceleration).  If you want to learn some cosmology, read "A Brief History of Time" or "A Short History of the Universe".  These are simply written but informative works that won't leave you waiting for substance 
 I find that most reviewers have based their evaluation on their agreement or disagreement with the ideas of the author. Although I liked many of his ideas, this book was very poorly written and contained very little new thinking, so I give it the rating it deserves.   Fanon doesn't state his idea and then support it, he just rambles on and beats around the bush and it's up to the reader to figure out what he's trying to say exactly. The result is that he uses a great many words to say very little. This makes for a very frustrating read.  The ideas he presents are not original either. Most of them can be found in Gandhi's "Hind Swaraj" (it's easy to download free English translations of this work off the internet and I stronlgy recommend reading it; plus it's much shorter than Fanon's book). Considering that "Hind Swaraj" was written almost 50 years earlier than "The Wretched of the Earth", the ideas Fanon presents were already old by the time he wrote the book!  Although Gandhi advocated non-violence while Fanon believes violence is inevitable in anti-colonial struggle, there isn't much that Fanon says that Gandhi hadn't already discussed. For instance, Fanon is often credited for predicting (or warning about) the fact that the intellectual and political elite of newly independent countries may simply replace the foreign oppressor. Gandhi had already warned his people about that, when he said that the leaders who overthrow colonialism by violence will also govern by violence. The example if India, which is one of the few colonies that gained independence by non-violence and which is one of the few that has been and remains democratic, proves that Gandhi's predictions were better than Fanon's since Gandhi also knew that violence was not inevitable in the fight for independence and that non-violence was the best way to avoid a simple substitution of the opressor.  In other words, if you want to read well-writen work and interesting ideas about anti-colonialism, don't waste your time with Fanon, read Gandhi instead.. 
 My phone broke after a month or so.  After spending 30 minutes on the phone during which time t-mobile continually wanted to blame me (did you put it in fluorescent light, did you put it in the sun, did you drop it, did you put it in your pocket and bend it, did you put it in your pocket and bump into something, did you drop it, did you break it, did you do something bad to it) they finally relented and agreed to send a new one with the oft repeated comment that if they determined that the phone was damaged then they would charge me untold sums of money.  The most amusing part of the conversation went like this:  would you like UPS ground which will take 10 days or UPS 3 day which will cost $15?  When I responded that the ground would be fine she said "OK, that will be $9.95".  I had to laugh at their arrogance.  
 I remember when this came out and as a guitar player myself, I was highly intrigued with the names involved on this project. My initial impression of April Lawton was to hang up my guitar and forget the whole thing (she is/was a damn good guitar player). Afterwords I realized that this album is quite an embarrasment. Their next release, the more acoustic In April Came the Dawning of the Red Suns is a MUCH better effort. 
 This book reads like stereo instructions!  In fact, it contradicts itself more often stereo instructions.  Many terms are used but not defined.  Basically, if you are a student, it's impossible 
 2 stars 	After reading Barras' explanation and description and interpretation of what life has been like for her concerning the concept, structure and realization of a father figure in her life and in the life of her daughter I conclude that 1/3 of the book is reporting on painful emotional feelings and psychological confusion; 1/3 reporting on research that is usual and available and interpreted in a prevailing view that homes without "fathers" produce dysfunctional children and adults, although, more than half the homes in America do not have a resident-male performing the role of father and 1/3 of the book is pure puff, pure market exploitation.  Yet, I also concluded that I will buy the book for my daughters but I will glue my review and interpretation of the book, in detail, to the inside cover. 	I will use this book and "Becoming Dad" by Leonard Pitts, Jr. as text for classes in cultural anthropology because these discussions of "fatherlessness" are so culturally based.  But even more, they indicate clearly the cultural differences between what a "father" was suppose to be in the 40s and 50s in comparison to what a father is suppose to be today. 	What is a father?  That depends.  That depends upon the region of the world, the environment and the era.  That clearly makes it a psychological cultural-construct. 	The data on "Daddy" in the home (i.e. an active role) is clear that it depends on the cultural and economic development of the males in a population. 	So the socio-economic factors point to political punts and blocks.  In other words, the American government has supported the development of white manhood, and the subsequent development of white fatherhood and with the employment of women even that effort is slipping. 	This book and others like it can be a lethal weapon, a hurtful instrument, for women who are vulnerably disconnected in a dreamy, fanciful reality. 	All 35-year olds who read the book should read the very last line of the book, first, realize Barras is now 50, then read the book with that in mind.  That is, realize that this psychological-cultural painful phenomenon is called, "growing up." . . . . I HAVE A BONE TO PICK WITH BARRAS: 	"The only thing I can hear clearly is the fatherless song.  I sing it sorrowfully, achingly, the way Billie Holiday sang `Strange Fruit.'" (pg. 34) 	Thousands of black people (& about 200 white sympathizers) were tortured, beaten, mutilated and burned, then hung from trees all over the South because (some) white people hated and was allowed to hate and Barras compares that with her childhood fantasy of a father and her mother's abrupt lack of sensitivity, which we all will grow out of eventually because we will realize the fancifulness of it all but torture and murder and rape are real.  Somehow, I don't think these are the same thing or even similar in the essence of living human, do you 
 Two Federal Marshals are dispatched to a remote island housing a mental institution for the criminally insane to look for a missing patient named Solando.  Throw in a Hurricane that traps the Marshalls on the island, a lot of strange behavior, and you have the premise for Shutter Island.  The book does not live up to the expectations Dennis Lehane's readers expect from him (although looking at the other reviews I could be dead wrong about that).  There are glimmers of Lehane's talents, but the book feels like a rushed screen play.  There is action, there is mystery, there are menacing situation, but it is all very glossy and superficial.  The reader will also probably solve the mystery by page 150.  It is not all grim however.  The book does flow nicely, reads easily and the last 25 pages were very powerful emotionally.  I did enjoy the book, but would expect something like this from James Patterson (this would be an achievement for him) but not from a fresh talent like Dennis Lehane 
 The others in the series were great, and I really looked forward to A Breath of Snow and Ashes. It read like it was all Gabaldon's discarded notes for the previous installment.  I felt really cheated to have spent my time and money on this book.  
 I ordered two sets of BraBABY Bra Washing Holders.  When they arrived, there was no statement/invoice/receipt inside the box.  I used them today to wash three bras.  It was tricky to get the straps in the ball.  When the washing machine was on, I can hear the balls bouncing around in it.  When the wash was finished, and the bra straps were sticking out of the balls.  My bras have some satin on the edge.  The satin were all scratched up, probably from all that bouncing around.  I am very disappointed 
 I already knew that Michael Savage was a draft dodger since I always check the New Hampshire Chickenhawk Database. From some reason they do not have his birthday. According to the official "Name Authority" from the Library of Congress database, his real name is Michael A. Weiner and he was born March 31, 1942. But why is he a hypocrit regarding American soldiers like me?  Dr. Weiner/Savage does the usual butter-me-up, like on page 104. He talks about former Hollywood actors who served in WWII, "True American heroes yes...They, unlike the empty suits of today, fought shoulder-to-shoulder alongside America's finest young boys. The farmers, the steelworkers, the taxi drivers. The people who made this country great." The only problem here is that he is describing MY family and not his.  His image of former soldiers is extremely negative and very offensive to me. In describing a veteran expressing his true feelings about war "war is awful..he never wanted to fight, he didn't believe in fighting although he wore the uniform [what do you mean Weiner?] and yes he was a hero and has many medals even though he naver actually fought." This isn't even the pot calling the kettle black. "Their anti-war comments both undermine our troops' morale and encourage our enemies by creating a picture of a divided front." Weiner also states, "[t]he ill-informed comments of these camera-craving, ex-military types in the attempt to prop-up a sagging self-esteem, do extensive damage to the war on terror and our military." Keep that second comment in mind, but who is the guy with the self-esteem problem? He doesn't have any "fake" medals so who is he to criticize a person who actually served?  If anybody is harming our troops it is Weiner/Savage. On page 88 he actually tells us it is okay for al-Qaida to kill our soldiers. Really. "If you were a leader or an intellectual in the Muslim world and you saw the debauchery promulgated by the West...and saw your young people gravitating toward the filth pumped over your airwaves, what would you do? Frankly you would support al-Qaida or any organization [like al-Qaida in Iraq or the Taliban in Afghanistan?] that would want to stop that flood of pollution from entering your country." Thanks for clearing up why it is okay for these guys to kill our soldiers. And here I thought they just hated our freedoms.   There are other problems with this book. On page 108 he decries the "intense use of drugs." Yeah, like Limbaugh's abuse of Oxycontin that he forgot to mention. Most diturbing to me is his use of words such as "sheeple," which is word coined by racist Aryan Nations members. Why he would use a favorite word of anti-Semites, seeing as how Weiner/Savage is a Jew, as well as a word used extensively by Timothy McVey is quite strange. He also uses dismissive language like "leg-crossers," (page 85)which I assume is a substitute for "bitch." And, finally, for all of you steelworkers, taxi drivers, etc., who are his fans: this guy thinks you're dumb. All you need to do is read page 106 to see what he thinks about opinions of non-college graduates.  As one last snipe on this guy, I just love that photo of him (all photos are of him) in the book, under the line "my ship has come in." That is one big yacht he is at the helm of. To his question of where to steer his yacht, how about towards the Gulf and to join the fight? I did ny combat, now you do yours. 
 I've just finished reading "Wild Child" and am quite disappointed.  It's not as well written as I'd anticipated from reading other reviews, and although I see myself as a romantic, her story was too saccharine even for my tastes.   I will withhold my personal thoughts as to the validity of her account, not having known any of the parties involved, but it would seem odd that a brilliant, chivalrous, needy, tortured alcoholic could be as one sided as he is portrayed in this book.  I'm more likely to recommend Patricia Kennealy- Morrison's memoir to those interested in learning more about Jim Morrison.  It was infinately more readable and leaves the reader with more insight into who Jim Morrison really was.  
 I loved the first 'Jack Frost'.  However, the sequal is not worth seeing unless you can see it on cable and every other channel on your television is blocked out and your DVD and VCR players are both broke 
 The original Julie and Romeo was delightful. This book was utter nonsense.  A great disapointment. Finished reading it only to find out if it might get better as you went along. It Didn't 
 I thought it was me until I read several other reviews of Predator.  Ms. Cornwell can do so much better than this disjointed mess.  If she's going to continue the Scarpetta series, she needs to get back on track, creating characters that we care about.  I finished this book as quickly as possible just to get it behind me.  What a disappointment 
 I wanted a monitor for digital photography that was a little better than the bottom end offerings.  I decided on the Viewsonic.  When I received it there was a permanent green pixel right in the middle of the display, and a 3/8" light banding strip at the top.  Amazon was VERY helpful with the return process, even covering the return shipping.  It seems that bad pixels in new monitors can be considered 'normal', but right in the center is unacceptable.  I have seen this monitor in operation, and as long as there are no pixel problems, it looks great 
 Here we have Schaeffer again, but this time without a hidden agenda, but with overt nakedness. The fundamentalist has come out. Schaeffer exposes his visions, how society should be, with all puritan, Christian-only principles. If you have seen the film Escape from L.A. (1996) with Kurt Russell, and how the society, under a puritan  / calvinist president is depicted, then beware and know that the forces towards this dictatorship are at work. Read this book to discover the agenda of the Christian right, and why you should not only not vote Republican, but oppose the Republicans. Let's hope Bush will not listen to much to the Christian lobby, which unfortunately already  represent a strong part of the Republican party.  Because after reading A Christian Manifesto by Francis Schaeffer you will know what to expect - and fear as a nightmare 
 How to describe The Fray? Well, they're a piano-pop group, so I ought to compare them to other piano-pop artists. Let's see. Think Coldplay without the atmospherics, Mae without the blissful melodies, Ben Folds Five without the wit and swagger. Essentially, remove any elements of other piano-driven groups that make them remotely enjoyable, and you have The Fray.  There's so little here to describe that this album is nearly impossible to review. Song after song of lyrics so generic that every teenager in the country will believe they were written just for them, piano parts that meander aimlessly, and vocals pitched a quarter tone flat. Don't be mislead by the claim that there are one or two great songs on here - the singles are indistinguishable from the rest of the album. It's mind-boggling that a band can manage to display so little personality over the course of 45 minutes. The piano is not a gimmick, but neither does it actually establish any command over these monotonous skeletons of songs.  The record isn't unlistenable so much as it is pointless. Coldplay and Keane often compensate for subpar songwriting by achieving voluminous sounds. The Fray can't even manage that, insisting on remaining timid and gentle, but with closed facelessness, not profound vulnerability. And that  album title. Probably the worst name for a record since "Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water. 
 The book was great, but this version of the audiobook leaves so much out.  I prefer the unabridged versions 
 This attempt to make organic chemistry lab bearable by using humor and "dumbing" everything down is a complete failure.  The text is full of incomplete sentences, making it hard to read.  An outrageous portion of the manual is filled with "humor", from sentences like "No matter how much I've screamed and shouted at people not to list only one number, they almost always do" to "When your head stops hurting, reread this section".  While this makes it less like the "dry" scientific texts other reviewers seem to hate so much, it makes for a lot of wasted reading.  If you took out all of the humor and meaningless phrases (like "Let's try it!" or "This is so simple, it confounds everone.") the text would probably only be 15 pages.  Personally, when I read a lab manual, I want the method to be explained clearly and concisely, so my time isn't wasted and I understand the material.  Zubrick, "You Lose! 
 Being a day late and a dollar short, I finally decided to buy this book despite the poor reviews.  I could not get past the introduction by Lestat (Anne) saying how stupid we all are for "not getting" his/her previous book".  She/he failed to explain what exactly it was that we were supposed to get, to my satisfaction anyway. AND the religious aspect of it all...... well I will keep my own council on that issue.   My theory regarding Anne's later efforts is (please do not take offence Ms. Rice) that Anne lost her edge after her beloved husband died.  Could it be that he had some part (a large one)in her previous novels?  The beautiful prose is gone from her writing and I think as her writing deteriorated, her ego grew.   All I can say is - Anne, stop writing, retire, open a doll hospital or be a spokesperson for charity. Kick back, bake cookies enjoy your life, just please do not torture us with any more writing.   
 Setzer and his band are sizzlin' hot, and he is my favorite swing band leader, however no matter how many times I try to listen to this cd, I just can't bring myself to like it.  It is just too darn hokey, cheezy, commercial, and corny.  In the Mood is full of energy, and could have been great without the "DJ MIX" club beat intro, and I find the rapping offensive racially.  It sounds as though they are making fun of the rap genere, and mocking the race.  Setzer's vocals never sounded better and hsi guitar playing is great, and band is smokin.  The sonsg americano sucks, and the production value in nill, zero, nana, it's WAY overproduced.  Buy hsi new live 2 cd set instead.. 
  This book is neither about Aristotle nor General Motors.  Do not be fooled into believing it is in any way an application of Aristotelian ethics in modern business; it is not.  Morris consistently contradicts Aristotle throughout the book.    An example is Morris' proselytizing conclusion that leadership requires humility.  To make his point Morris quotes ancient Hasidic verse and the Tao Te Ching to establish that we are all worms.  Nobility, Morris suggests, is lowness.  Did Aristotle ever say this? No.  Could Aristotelian writing lead us to these conclusions?  No again.  Is Taoism consistent with Aristotelian reason and logic?  No, no, no.  Is Hasidic verse? Definitely not.  So what is going on?  Did Morris forget to read Aristotle?  Aristotle understood Man as a rational being with happiness as the moral purpose of his life.  Morris does not.  This book does not.  Morris peppers his book with quotes at the furious rate of no less than one or two per page.  He quotes every thing from fortune cookies to Einstein.  Ironically with all this mad quoting he never once, ever, (I checked) quotes Aristotle - never.     This book could better be titled, "If an irrational populist ran a non-profit organization."     The prefaces of basic economic texts usually contain better discussions of the practical intersection of business and philosophy. 
 Awful. People say this is THE album for the "lower-West-Side-trendy-martini-party" but it is NOT!! If you play this at your party people will leave. I also find it disgusting and offensive that they use the Buddha as a marketing tool to sell this compilation of drabby garbage that isn't worthy of being played at a yoga session for autistic chimpanzees. Too bad 1 is the least amount of stars I can give 
 Readers will save themselves much unrewarding labor by disregarding both "Precision and soul" and, I daresay, the highly-touted "Man Without Qualities," reading instead his first work "Young  Torless" and the stories collected under "Five Women."   Musil's derivative philosophical and psychological preoccupations invite  inevitable comparisons with Nietzsche and Freud, both of whose work is  vastly more durable and fruitful.  Despite the powerfully bracing, if not  occasionally repellent, astringency of his style, Musil's work subsequent  to "Five Women" falls considerably short of the enormous and  difficult ambitions which preoccupied his maturity; and, what's more, such  a gaping failure of world-historical pretension tends to pollute enjoyments  one might otherwise have had in reading it.  Read something by one whose  enormous abilities are truly equal to ungodly ambitions -- read Proust 
 [This review refers to the CD-ROM "version"]  I ordered this CD because Amazon has it listed as an alternate version of PLATO: COMPLETE WORKS, edited by John M. Cooper.  Well, this is definitely false advertising.  This CD merely contains the Benjamin Jowett translations.  For those of you who don't know who Benjamin Jowett is, he was a very prominent British scholar who is largely said to be responsible for rendering Plato's works into an English classic.  While his translations are certainly important historical documents, they suffer from the fact that they were produced in the middle of the 19th century.  Yes, that's right: the 19th century.  The translations in the Cooper edition, on the other hand, are all very accurate and up-to-date.  I highly recommend the print edition of PLATO: COMPLETE WORKS (Ed. Cooper), but this CD bears no resemblance to it.  If you have ever casually surfed the internet looking for the works of Plato, you have probably had the "pleasure" of reading a Jowett translation.  All of his translations can be found for free on the internet.  In assembling this CD, someone merely copied these translations into a word file, converted it into a PDF, and shoved it on a CD.  Trust me: you can do the work yourself and save yourself twenty bucks.  
 I did not finish the book (I got about 70% of the way through before I realized I could not bear to read one more page).  Maybe the remaining part of the book would have been better, but I doubt it.  This is the first time I can ever remember not even having even the slightest interesting in finishing a book.  The characters were flat and plot went nowhere.  Please - there are million of books out there.  Spare yourself, and find something else to read. Anything. 
 It's not that Jane Moore can't write - it's just she's assumes you, the reader, hasn't read very much. And that you are probably fairly thick too. Thus the reader is nudged along from one limp scene to another with painful condescension, the whole dreary chick lit package sprinkled with yesterday's tabloid newspaper puns. "Love At First Site" is about as frothy as the lint from your tumble drier. 
 This book, above all others, reveals the breakdown of classical (libertarian) liberalism into the statist liberalism of today.  Although the first part of the work, being a refutation of Edmund Burke's silly  nonsense, is stellar, and is well worth reading.  Regardless, the second  part, the chapter on "Ways and Means" in particular, is composed  of the most despicable, anti-liberty doctrines that one can find.  What  Paine basically proposed was a late 18th century form of the welfare state,  replete with progressive taxation, subsidies for child birth, and other  fine statist amenities.  Thus, as all of these things are, in his words, to  be claimed as rights, the title of this book comes to mean nothing  whatsoever.  It is indeed sad that Thomas Paine has gained such an enduring  legacy as a friend to liberty.  In truth, he is actually one of its worst  enemies, as he combines a just zeal for resistance to oppression,  revolution, and reason, he sabotages his entire political philosophy 
 When I heard these songs I felt that there was something missing for me. True, I am not a die-hard fan. It's a shame that Rickie Lee never had the opportunity to cut a jazz duet with Chet Baker.  Or a pop duet with Bob Dylan. Their vocal styles would have mixed to perfection! However, all is not lost... hopefully she still has an opportunity to join her vocal skills with the talents of William Hung. You go girl 
 The sound is not innovative - it's pretentious.  The sound is not new - it's been done before, and done better.  I gave this disc many spins, hoping that my ears would start appreciating what other reviewers have said, but it just didn't happen.  I found it totally undigestable, and if this is what is supposed to be the new direction of music, then I'll stick with the old.  Do yourself a favor, don't buy the cd based on all the glowing reviews here...listen to it first.  I wish I would have listened to it before I bought it - now I'm going to sell my copy on Amazon...and there aren't very many cds I sell due to disliking them.  
 As much we can say it's eccentric, unfortunately it apparently seems that Mr. Thomson never read any film encyclopedia, lexicon, biographical dictionary or any other kind of reference book or work of lexicography. This is only some kind of his personal film guide, in fashion of Leonard Maltin, but unlike Maltin, he's totally subjective, unconcentrated, and he speaks about films in a way we can speak on street, but notin a book who claims to be some kind of reference book. If he honestly admitted it's not dictionary nor encyclopedic work, and if he didn't titled book in such uneblievably over-estimated way, everything would be OK. He can fail greatly (i.e. Pasolini's article) but he can also be totally right (i.e. Rivette's article). But this is not a dictionary, nor biographical. It's a personal guide through some films, written in journalistic style, without any connection with real "biographical dictionary" works 
 ...then you'll see how easy it is to give good customer service. I noticed most of the reviewers are managers and Human Resource trainers, not the people actually on the front line. Just try getting screamed at, cursed at, things hurled at you, and called all kinds of different names from an irate customer. Also try wading through the asinine company policies that tie your hands and keep you from helping the customer the way they deserve. Along with a lower than you can live off salary, and you have the average customer service rep and what we have to deal with every day.  This book misses the mark in so many ways. It caters to people living in a dream world and have high enough positions that they dont have to deal with the public. But I'm sure they think this book's ideas are "neat-o 
 Originally published in 1952, The Courage to Be by Paul Tillich is a compilation of the Terry Lectures delivered by the author in the same year. Tillich is a well known mid-twentieth century German-American liberal theologian. The following comments pertain to the 2000 re-release by Yale University Press  The lectures discuss the issue of courage and, are largely a response to some of the bleak existentialist philosophy prevalent at the time. I found the aspects of the text discussing existentialism to be the most interesting.  To the appropriate liberal academic audience in the early 1950's these lectures might have sounded majestic.  Tillich weaves a broad story touching on a range of philosophical, political, historic and scientific themes.  Fifty years later it feels dated and superficial; some of the themes e.g. existentialism, Freudism and Marxism are now somewhat pass√© and may be of limited interest to many modern readers.  This is not to say that the work is without value, I find that Tillich is always effective at conveying the majesty of God. Tillich was by all accounts a capable intellect, however, his ability as a communicator is limited; his use of language while occasionally poetic is often wordy and vacuous, while his argumentation can be sublime, it is frequently speculative and specious.  The Courage to Be is probably only of interest to Tillich fans.   
 Lisa Endlich, formerly a trader with Goldman Sachs, has written a book on Goldman Sachs' history and corporate culture.  As a former employee, she, like every other former employee writing about her employer, must have been torn between loyalty to her old employee, and wanting to write a truly dispassionate history.  One or the other must give.  The one truly interesting tidbit in this book was that Goldman, the founder, refused to support the British during World War One, as did John Pierpont Morgan and almost all others, out of loyalty to his German roots.  Goldman Sachs was and is undoubtedly an extremely interesting and extremely accomplished partnership and now company; this book however, is little more than a summary of discussions held around water coolers.  If you're interviewing for a job with GS, already have a job with GS, or merely looking for a good bibliography of this history of various Wall Street firms, this book is definitely worth reading, otherwise I do not know what purpose reading this book would serve you 
 "Compassionate Conservatism" by Olasky is a manifesto for a "bread-and-circus" ideology that grows more transparent by the day. Not surprisingly, it is heavy on rhetoric and light on substance.  The alliterative title is catchy, but "Bible-and-Business Conservatism" is more descriptive 
 The first half of this book was on basic computer graphics. The second half wasn't much more than a rewrite of Microsofts DirectX documentation. There were only a few pages of shader techniques that I found useful 
 Not to say there aren't some good dance tracks on here, they just aren't living up to today's standards. I think it's at the point where I need to stop buying mix CDs buy some of my favorite New York City DJs. These guys, including Rauhofer, Vasquez, etc...broke new ground back in the 90s with their progressive house music and mixes...but at this point, there's nothing "progressive" about it because it still sounds the same as it did nearly ten years ago! It's all blending into one big mish mosh of indistinguishable beats! This is the new millennium, and I really wish these guys would fine tune their sound to keep up with it. There's so much different stuff going on at this point. Just take a look at this track listing and you'll see proof that times have changed-there are NO major named artists on this CD featuring exclusive Rauhofer mixes, plus, we're even being given recycled tracks by Club 69, Cevin Fisher, etc.   If you like instrumental tribal still, you'll probably feel this groove. Vocal lovers avoid, because there are few vocals on here.    Tracks:  CD1  1. killing me...nick & Danny Chatelain (6:30) (slow paced, deep electronics voice, yawn) 2. Hoes in this house (george morel & armand pena groove mix)...ron carroll (5:38) (a remake of classic 90s bitch track by Toni Ski. Another Yawn) 3. New Love...FC Nond (6:09) (hard tribal with a few diva vocals oohing, aahing and yeahing) 4. Sixteen Years (plaza crew mix)...camorina (4:44) (great diva vocal-funky bass, has potential, but doesn't go anywhere) 5. I like old school (synchronized emotions remix)...miguel Picasso (5:22) (put me to sleep now-weak instrumental) 6. 8 letters (martijn ten velden & mark knights mix)...holmes ives (6:54) (female vocal, no punch) 7. I remember (solar groovy mix)...Niki B & Christian EFFE (6:15) (more hard tribal beats and deep male vocal speak) 8. Reconstruction: 2...Julian Poker (5:20) (tribal instrumental. Sleep enducing) 9. Love Is a Drug (Lance Jordan Beat mix)...Rosko (6:35) (Recent Billboard #1 dance track that's hard to find on CD-tribal, spoken male vocal) 10. Tanque Beats...Delgado (3:24) (instrumental tribal beats) 11. free your body...decibel (8:35) (slow paced hard tribal with a few male vocal samples in the middle. Repetitive and monotonous) 12. This is the Sound...Pedro Diaz (4:09) (tribal, male vocal speaking every now and then. This is the sound...of 1999)  CD2  1. I Look Good (hector Fonseca mix)...Club 69  (6:21) (not much different than any previous mix of this track) 2. People...DJ Bruno (5:04) (instrumental, pretty cool electro vibe) 3. Sex Secret (peter rauhofer reconstruction)...2 Raum Wohnung (7:04) (clunky but funky alternative vocal track) 4.

Sunday trip...danny freakazoid (5:02) (more instrumental electrovibes) 6. first time (hector fonseca mix)...offer nissim (6:03) (another hot vocal track from Offer Nissim) 7. easy ride (dub)...tresca (4:17) (pulsing bass, but just doesn't go anywhere) 8. beta boy...trente moeller (5:18) (funky house, reminds me of a Green Velvet track) 9. love you some more (peter rauhofer reconstruction)...cevin fisher (7:59) (typical funky rauhofer sound, male vocal) 10. voyager...john tejada (3:45) (more Green Velvet-esque instrumental) 11. tooting warrior...mike Monday (4:59) (bouncy, upbeat instrumental) 12. believe in me (peter rauhofer reconstruction)...peter rauhofer (5:36) (That nightmare "you've gotta believe" sample that's been haunting us for over a decade. WHY??? Ending his disc with this sample is a clear sign that he's not looking ahead.... 
 I agree with the previous reviewer. Buying, attaching, and using this microphone is a waste of time and effort. Save your money and get a good microphone, unless you want your sound track to sound like someone mumbling into a tin can 
 I expected better from these authors.  They, however, left me very disappointed. I thought I'd get some basic and practical advice.  What I got was stroking and dreams topped off with a push for philanthropy from the earnings they don't tell you how to make.  I resent that Hansen and Allen made a dime off me for purchasing this book.  I should have read the reviews BEFORE I purchased. I would have saved myself time and money. Anyone what a free used copy?  Never mind.  It's not worth the postage 
 BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER, the textbook currently used in my Introduction to Management class, does not effectively convey the important fundamentals of business management.  The book is structured around eight 'roles' of an effective manager, and each role is further broken down into a number of competencies that are functions of that particular role.  While I appreciate the effort to organize a relatively broad subject, I do not feel that the book is necessarily easy to follow.  The reading is constantly being interrupted by assessments and applications for each competency, and while meant well, they are usually skipped over in an attempted to finish the reading and they seem to me to be a large waste of paper.  Furthermore, BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER stresses models and theories of management that I find useless without the necessary fundamentals of management, which are not adequately presented in the textbook.  Some of the models and theories have merit and should be discussed more in depth, but in a more advanced level of business management.  And while BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER is the official textbook for my management class, I have relied heavily on a different textbook for my information, and only the eve of a test do I bother to look over BECOMING A MASTER MANAGER, I do not recommend this textbook for an introductory class at all 
 At one time George Barna and his ilk told us that the wave of the future was that all churches would have to become "seeker sensitive" and culturally relevant in order to survive in the next millennium, they helped drive a revolution that has virtually wiped out the traditional church model in evangelicalism. Now that the mega-church seeker-sensitive model they once supported so vociferously is proving to be a failure, increasingly rejected by the very culture it strove so hard to please, they are pushing "house churches" as the next wave of the future, a movement which if it succeeds will help to destroy many of America's struggling fellowships to replace them with a rudderless, leaderless, "do whatever seems good in your own eyes" conglomeration of extended bible studies.  Why is that?  Barna lives straddling two worlds. He is a modern American evangelical and a pollster and his ecclesiology is driven by these two facets of his life. Many assume that the theology of modern American evangelicals has been primarily influenced by the long term effects of revivalism in the 19th century, but what they fail to take into consideration was that the theology of 19th century revivalists like Charles Finney was actually molded in the crucible of American culture with all of its assumptions. For instance, if we want to know what shaped Finney's assumptions regarding salvation all we have to look to is the psyche of the American society of the time; it's not surprising therefore to hear him speak of saving souls in the same way that the average American would speak of how one should farm or successfully run a business: "the connection between the right use of means for a revival, and a revival, is as philosophically sure as between the right use of means to raise grain, and a crop of wheat." We tend to think of the "corporate" or "consumer" model of the church as a 20th century invention, but it really is a creation of the 19th. What the church came to value in the 19th century were the same things the culture valued - success - and a success that could be categorized and most importantly quantified. If we have an increase in the number of consumers of our product, we are doing well, if not then we are failing and either our marketing or perhaps even the product itself need to change in order to make them more appealing.   As a Pollster, Barna is even more sensitive than the average evangelical to the importance of popularity. In large measure, modern American evangelicalism has been shaped by men like Barna, with an eye to being as popular and appealing as possible. However, the church that they have created is failing on two fronts. The first failure is somewhat ironic.The very drive to make the church as popular as possible has also made it as shallow, transient, and as disposable as any modern American plastic consumer product. The fact that 88%* of the youth raised in these churches will abandon the faith by their first year of college, is a reflection that the product itself has little impact or value. It has also made for churches that are, in large measure, indistinguishable from the pop culture they are trying to mimic. Not surprisingly the abomination of the worldly old-pop-culture church that Barna and his co-laborers helped to birth now repulses them and they are increasingly rejecting it. A lot of "emergents" also fall into this category. Above all, they are beginning to recognize that the seeker church has become an obsolete product now only frequented, by and large, by the people who grew up using it and are consequently "brand loyal" (newsflash - the only people who really demand "seeker sensitive" worship aren't seekers, they are the Christian boomers and gen-Xers who have frequented these churches for years - this is their "traditional comfort zone").   So, what do you do now that the "seeker" model churches are failing to do what they were created to do, attract new consumers, or even to keep the children of the old consumers? Well if quantifiable success continues to be our aim, we don't have much other choice but to change the product. The "house church model" is simply an appeal to what they think consumers in this generation want.  The sad thing is that the biblical model for a church will never be an option for them. They simply don't feel it will "succeed" according to the polls, and with the Finney's of the 19th century all they really trust are human means and methods. If you can't plot it on a poll, it doesn't exist. The idea that God might actually bless a simple, apostolic, model for his church, and bring people to faith through it, and cause it to thrive - even under persecution - doesn't even register with them. And because such a church model doesn't support growth beyond say the 200 member mark, it doesn't fit the modern consumer criterion for success. They are all about reaching everyone in the culture and as a result they are always failing.   Were they to realize that the work of the church involves the ingathering and building up of the elect, that the church in every age is made up of a faithful remnant, that the church is supposed to be as profoundly different from the culture as light is to darkness, and that the direction of scripture alone really is sufficient for the task of building the church, things might change profoundly. As it is, men like Barna are setting themselves up for a continuous cycle of failure that will only do greater and greater harm to the body of Christ, especially as their methods become more and more desperate and unscriptural.  If anyone were to ask me what the church needs most about now is not Barna's newest "revolution" its a REFORMATION that returns us to the simple, biblical, church of the Scripture, regardless of what the culture thinks of those churches.  But hey that's just the way the totally uncool and unhip Pastor of a "can't possibly work" church sees it.  * A recent SBC poll indicated that 88% of the youth raised in evangelical churches stop attending church by the first year of college 
 Zoe Heller tells the story of three obessions. The first is the desperately lonely spinster, Barbara Covett, who longs for companionship. The second is the bourgeois bohemian, Sheba Hart, who goes into teaching because she wants to be loved,and because she lives in our time, confuses love with sex, and the third is the author herself who seems to believe that only a terrible person could say terrible things about other people, especially children. Barbara, Heller's brilliantly drawn protagonist, sees through all the "care and share" rubbish put out by the striving headmaster and her moronic colleagues. She knows whereof she speaks when she sums up the barbarous behaviour of the kids, but the author won't let that stand, so she turns this magnificent misanthrope into a monster. The "battle axe" is made out to be exactly that, a battle axe, whose predatory lesbianism distracts the reader from her hard earned insights. By turning her into a disturbed stalker, readers will not gain from what she no doubt actually was, namely, a strict, disciplined teacher who knew that being nice is not a viable strategy for dealing with today's benighted youth. If readers were asked to deal with this instead of the author's witches brew of sexual repression, something really scary would be revealed, namely the fact that it is the adults who have to change and not the kids, and the "battle axe" provides us our only hope 
 There are a couple of good songs on here. I love the song Sunday Morning. But then they went and put crappy songs like "Hey Baby" and "Hella Good" on it, and it just went to hell. Plus all of their most overrated songs, which I just am not a big fan of. No Doubt was awesome up until Return Of Saturn, and Gwen's solo career just sucks horribly. 
 The problem with this book is more fundamental than a misleading title or a missed analogy with Martin Fowler's Refactoring book. The author completely misunderstands and misrepresents the practice of refactoring. Developers do not "stop" to refactor because their original design was wrong; quite the contrary, refactoring is an integral and ongoing part of Agile development. There is no "stopping" and the act of refactoring does not extend the development timeline. "Prefactoring" is nothing more than traditional, up-front design. The author attempts to co-opt terms that have a specific meaning, much like Humpty Dumpty in Through the Looking-Glass, when he tells Alice, "When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean, neither more nor less."   The book is worse than useless; if it were merely useless, it would convey no information. Instead, it actually misleads readers with inaccurate information. Consider the comments of reviewer ueberhund, who writes refactoring "is the act of re-writing and re-working code until it reaches a state of perfection. Since perfection is never achieved, the work of refactoring goes on for ever." Also note the comments of reviewer Thomas Duff, who writes, "Prefactoring is making sure good design techniques are practiced up front to help avoid having to refactor as much later." These comments illustrate that many software professionals thoroughly misunderstand the basic concepts of adaptive or Agile development. A book like this one exacerbates that problem.   The software industry is currently in a time of change, when adaptive methods are being more widely adopted and integrated with the best practices of information technology organizations. It is the worst possible time for misinformation like this, because it muddies the waters just when people need to understand accurately the risks and potential value of various approaches to software development. 
 Another reviewer has stated that Mark often.It's good songs.Small package.Bring home some milk ok?It gets out stains too 
 It sucks big time!!!!!!! Alot of this was experienced in my ears those first few months in Hell...I mean Florida. The first song I heard from this was "Today", and I thought it was good the first time I heard it as it was only a 30 second snipet that I heard, but then when I heard the entire song it was depressing, and then there was "Disarm" which I hated from day one, and the same with "Cherub Rock". I just felt like I shouldn't have even bought this at this particular time in my life, but I guess I was trying to give them the benefit of the doubt. However, with one song barely tolerable which is "Mayonaise" I'm ready to dismiss this as one of the worst of the 90's 
 Unfortunatelly, until now I did not received my cd! I guess what happened? Thanks, Octavi 
 Warner must have fell asleep at the wheel with its DVD reissue of Charlie Chaplin's "Monsieur Verdoux." The "remastered" print is dark, murky and virtually unwatchable. In fact, it's a strain on the eyes! The additional star is given only for the extras -- especially the excellent "Chaplin Today" documentary. This DVD should be taken off the market until Warner gets its act together. 
 As many other reviewers have stated, this is a huge let-down if you enjoyed the tart, sharply-observed film version of "Election", which made a star of Reese Witherspoon as Tracy Flick. The filmmakers clearly used this novel as merely a launchpad for their own, better story and vastly more sophisticated ideas and dialog.  The Tom Perotta novel is a short (very short) and weakly structured work, that meanders from character to character, often in short "soundbites". Clearly, Mr. Perotta has a sour, cynical view of high school, which he depicts as a place of constant sexual activity, not merely between students but between faculty and faculty, and faculty and student. This is not my own experience, and I am deeply disturbed if he has actually documented this in his own life. If male teachers prey on 15-year old girls like this, then it is a powerful argument that public schools should not allow males instructors to teach girls AT ALL under any circumstances.  Certainly, if I were a parent of such a young girl and was remotely aware that male teachers and PRINCIPALS were constantly leching at my daughter and her friends, making comments about their bodies and their sexuality, I would be moved to action. Fortunately, I think this is mostly Mr. Perotta's personal fantasy, and that only a small minority of sick individuals do this sort of thing -- but what does that say about him, and his own attractions?  Every character in "Election" is having some kind of dubious affair -- cheating on pregnant wives, cheating with best friend's spouses, teachers having sex with underage students, a young lesbian girl who has an affair with another girl whereupon that girl goes on to have an affair with the lesbian's brother, etc. Curiously the high school portrayed fictionally here is lacking in the kind of innocent, nerdy, dorky kids that I remember from high school -- everyone is an aggressive, sexually active exploiter of others. Every adult is cheating on their spouse, or leering at an underage teen. This is a horribly cynical, dreary view of life OR of high school, whether symbolic or not and it is entirely lacking in wit or humor.  There are so many comments from older men about teenage girls, that I seriously worry about Mr. Perotta's personal mindset. Is this his point? If so, then the book is seriously missing the clever political overview of the film, which wisely eliminates the adult affairs of the characters and much of the overall smarminess.  Often I turn to the original novel that a film is based on to gain clarity and more details about the story. This is one of the rare exceptions to the rule that "the book is always better than the film". In this case, the book is glaringly worse. The film's scriptwriter deserves a lot of kudos for making a sparkling and witty movie out of this dreck 
 First warning: if you saw the trailer, some of the best bits are there.  The opening, a parody of Saw with Dr. Phil and Shaq, is the funniest bit - and probably one of the funniest things Zucker's done in years.  From there, the film is a little light on laughs.  Parodies are mostly of Saw, War of the Worlds, the Grudge, and the Village.  SM4s greatest asset is the casting.  Leslie Nielson has a great moment as the bumbling president and Craig Bierko is almost more convincing as Tom Cruise than the real Tom Cruise is.  Kudos are also in order for Chris Elliot as the Village Idiot (Isn't it obvious?).  It's stated on the disc that Zucker has rules for spoofing.  Unfortunately, the rules are probalby a little dusty, as the formula is getting old, and most of the gags are too dated, obvious, or knee deep in vulgarity.  If the franchise is to continue (and as long as Hollywood keeps churning out horror movies of the week, it will), then there needs to be a better formula.  SM4 is funny, just a little bit too low on the laughs for repeat viewings.  Rent it 
 This carseat is hard to install with the booster still attached.  The fabric is very cheap, and it melted in the dryer.  I wash my carseats after every roadtrip, and it didn't even last one roadtrip before melting.  It ripped the day that I got it trying to adjust the straps.  I was very disappointed in this carseat.  I would not purchase it again.  I loved my previous carseats being the Alpha Omega, and a Graco.  If you are looking for something cheap this is the product. There are other products out there that are in the same price range that would be better manufactured.  Try those ones first.  This is an awful carseat. 
 This is not what I expected or wanted.  The book is written for business senarios with very few suggestions of a personal nature.  The description of the book does not indicate that it is mainly for business use 
 I looked at many LCD TV mounts up to $200 and found that this model offered what I wanted at a substancialy less price. The mount was easy to install and the instructions were well written. The mount lined up to the mounting holes on my LCD TV and the unit does everthing the expesive models claimed 
 This book is a waste of time and money.  It is written in large type with a lot of empty space on the pages.  I was hoping to learn new parenting strategies to use with my 20-month old son, and didn't read anything that I hadn't heard before.  The bottom line is that there is really no substance to this book at all.  Each chapter is literally 1-2 pages long 
 teenage vegans and vegetarians aren't stupid people. if i had read this befor i had gone vegan, i probably wouldn't have... there are so many other great books out there with better information. try anne marie colbin's "food and healing.&quot 
 Tremendous service,,,,,,,,,,excellent!  Thanks.  N. Whit 
 As a proud vet of the Feminist frontlines 1968-1976, I could hardly wait to read her newest book. Her classic book Rubyfruit Jungle was a gem. As THE "coming out" book of it's time I share the sentiment of millions who feel it will always be sacred. However,I was shocked and totally disappointed with Rita Mae Brown's attempt at writing her own story. The person she reveals to us in Rita Will is beyond ego strong. She is ruthlessly self-absorbed and many times cruel.  Everyone (else) is wrong, or less than, or not as smart or not as significant as Rita according to Rita (with the one exception-- her cat.)  The book Rita Will reveals Rita as a sad and shallow person, with high marks only for narcissism.  Best to avoid this book and re-read Rubyfruit Jungle instead. You'll continue to have a positive impression of Ms. Brown if you do 
 Some good scholarship here.  But continuing the war metaphor, this book wins the battle (defending God's goodness) but losing the war (jettisoning God's attributes). A terrible disappointment. Read John Frame's *No Other God* (2001) or Millard Erickson or Bruce Ware (or C.S. Lewis years before the fact!) on the deep problems with Boyd's Open Theism 
 I was intrigued by "The Replaement Killers." After seeing "The Professional" I became interested in the premise of a hit man with a heart. That the movie chose not to take this route was the first of many disappointments. It turns out that the hit man isn't really a professional at all. Instead he is killing in order to save his family. The first two killings went flawlessly, but when he is assigned to kill a child rather than criminals he can not bring himself to do it. That too is an interesting premise, albeit a much more familiar one, and it raises a separate set of questions: Why did he get involved with the crime-boss? If he has only killed two people how did his skill become so remarkable?      However, I must admit that I rented this because I felt a little blood-thirsty tonight and by the end it was definately quenched. It's just a shame that it didn't answer some very important questions. It did EARN its one star, I was moderately entertained but I felt two stars was too generous 
 There's not anything theological about this book at all. In fact, it's not about God, Jesus Christ, Christianity or any other religion. This is nothing more than a hate-mongering diatribe on why blacks should hate whites (and a poorly-written one at that). Here are just a few choice excerpts:  1. "[W]hiteness is the symbol of the Anti-christ."  2. "The goal of black theology is the destruction of everything white, so that blacks can be liberated from alien gods."  3. "The black experience is the feeling one has when attacking the enemy of black humanity by throwing a Molotov cocktail into a white-owned building and watching it go up in flames. We know, of course, that getting rid of evil takes something more than burning down buildings, but one must start somewhere."  4. "Black theology seeks to analyze the satanic nature of whiteness and by doing so prepare all nonwhites for revolutionary action."  5. "We have reached our limit of tolerance, and if it means death with dignity or life with humiliation we will choose the former. And if that is the choice, we will take some honkies with us."  6. "To be black is to be committed to destroying everything this country loves and adores."  Why anyone, regardless of race, creed, color or even religion would buy this rubbish is beyond me. It's nothing more than hate-as-theology 
 When I first got the book I thought it was basic Tagalog, but it wasn't. This book is for people that know some Tagalog. It was very hard to use for learning the language. Not a good book for beginners 
 Of course, the pompousness of SunnO))) was over-bearing with their undertones and rumbling sounds. Boris' raw and upbeat beauty was completely consumed by Sunn O)))'s need to make "music" that makes the listener "listen to music in a different way."   When Boris and Sunn O))) got together to make "Altar" is was the biggest mistake that they could have done. Some of the songs were like listening to Sunn O))) songs and the remaining was like listening to Boris songs with feedback and the sound of toilets flushing behind them.  This album is a waste of time...there is no emotion or feeling involved. Go out and get a Sunn O))) album or a Boris album...not this.. 
  I enjoyed the Forward to the book. The, albeit, brief reference to 'elegance' being a package - the importance of a great walk and pleasant voice being a given. After the 'Forward' I found the book progressively downhill. Sure, there was the usual worthwhile guidance - the quintessential little black dress, simplicity- less is more and choose quality over quantity - but hardly groundbreaking for anyone with more than a cursory knowledge of fashion. Much of the text stressed silly, outdated and/or erroneous rules- don't wear black in the morning, don't wear bright coloured shoes except in the evening, choose neutral handbags in black and brown (much prefer Kimora's ideas in 'Fabulosity' she suggests choosing handbags in cherry, emerald or orange -let's face it, way more colorful and interesting), women over 21 look better in one piece swimsuits-(surely this is a matter of abdominal firmness- a 40 year old can look stunning in a bikini an overweight 16yr old not so). It went on to refer to Queen Elizabeth as a style icon. As I read the book, I kept seeing glimpses of a girlfriend. She's 40, well groomed, always wears expensive quality clothes but frankly it's all deathly dull - there is no individuality, no surprise in her dress, seems aging- it fits her partner is decades older.  'A Guide To Elegance' focuses on rigidity in fashion (heavy on do's and dont's)which has hopefully been surpassed by CREATIVITY. Interesting, youthful dressing is pleasing at any age and gives vibrancy and youth- my brother in law's mum,70 wore a colorful folk skirt and matching bright shoes to Christmas lunch and looked wonderful. Many readers have commented on compliments when implementing the book but when you give thought and time to your wardrobe, coordinating pieces and ensuring all is clean and fresh, shoes polished etc, hair and make up well done, a great walk and smile and then... irrespective of any supposed 'fashion' book you will indeed be stunning and elegant.            
 Posewitz, though well meaning, sets back our understanding of ethical hunting by confusing "difficulty of taking" an animal with ethics.  He further does not seem to know that "fair chase" is a term created by the Boone & Crockett Club to describe their tournament rules for entering animals into their record books, much like golfing's rule that mechanized golf carts cannot be used by contestants.  In spite of this, no one seriously suggests that it is unethical for recreational golfers to use golf carts, however.  Ethical hunting is hunting that is:  (1) Safe, (2) Conserves game populations for future generations, and (3) Respects the choices and rights of other hunters within the same boundaries.  Whether I hunt with my bare hands, walking miles to get to the game, or select some easier way has nothing to do with ethics.  Posewitz is entitled to hunt as he wishes, but he should not try to impose his views on others 
 A rather spirited debate among reviewers for a book that is rather boring. What did we learn from The Juice? 1. Steroids are bad. This is a revelation? 2. Players such as Giambi and Bonds used steroids. In case you are the one person who has not seen the 176 specials about steroids on ESPN, this could help.   Other than this, the book really revealed nothing new. And the big story is from a source that is anonymous? What are we talking about, baseball's version of deep throat? You have to do better than this.   It was long, drawn and no real "meat" to it. More hype than anything. And I got sucked in with the advertising. Canseco's book was interesting. Great stories and easy to read. At least he gave me something.   I have to agree with some of the critics. Mr. Carroll did a  disservice to his readers by including the nutritional stuff with steroids. Most people I know use a lot of this and it is fine.  It would be like the president says all drugs are bad - cocaine, heroin and cough medicine. Silly example because we all know that cough medicine is not harmful assuming someone does nothing stupid like drink the whole bottle but it does illustrate the point. He was wrong and should have done his homework or avoided the subject altogether since he seems to known pretty much nothing about it.  Anyway, I like Mr. Carroll but this is subpar. Guess that's why it's not selling really well 
 Having read all of Sedaris's books, I think it's fair to say that this is easily his weakest. I suppose it should be expected since it was written before the others, but if you read the reviews on the book you'd think it was world class literature. The only stories I enjoyed in it are "My Manuscript" and "Glen's Homophobia Newsletter Vol.3, No. 2." The essays "Diary of a Smoker" and "Santaland Diaries" are good as well. Ultimately his essays are still better than his stories which accounts for their making up all his other books. The stories are agonizingly over-the-top; that style work well on tv shows like Strangers with Candy but is painful in print. Do yourself a favor and skip this for one of his other MUCH better books (i.e. Me Talk Pretty One Day or Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim) 
 Context: I've been developing software for 12 years (C++, Java, JavaScript, PERL and more).  I've been using .Net (VB) for 2 years and C# for about 1 year.  Another guy I know from work bought this book. He seemed to like it because of the short descriptions for each of the recipes.   That is exactly why I don't like the book.    Okay, short descriptions would be okay, except many of them don't even provide example code or completely explain the solution.  I'm looking at recipe "1.14. Manage the Global Assembly Cache" right now and there is nothing about the winnt\assembly directory in there.  Why not?  Instead the author only explains gacutil /i and /u.  Okay, but what does that do?  How is it significant?  Why do I want or not want my assembly in the gac?    Recipe "1.8. Create and Manage Strong-Named Key Pairs" is the same thing.  He tells me how to use the sn.exe tool, but he does not tell me anything more about why or how.  Very weak.  But the ones that really kill me are the ones where the author has a chance to really describe the thing using a code example, but then fails to do so.  For example, "Recipe 1.4. Create and Use a Code Library" begs to have some sample code, but none is provided.  "1.3 Create and use a code module" was the same thing.    The section titles promise so much, the text delivers so little 
 This product works well for me (I have a very small one-level house) but getting the HEPA filters that go with it is harder than finding that needle in the haystack. You used to be able to get them at most retail stores--now, Euro-Pro won't even supply them to the vacuum specialty companies.  I've made tons of calls and all they've done is echo my complaints.  The ONLY way I was able to find them, besides on this site, was through Euro-Pro itself.  They try to get you to sign up for their "filters for life" program first on their site, which is a ripoff.  If you just order their filters, they don't give you an 800 number to call--I found one in an old filter box--they want you to do it all over the web.  Why?  Because they're in India, at least the "customer service" people are.  While waiting on my filters to arrive, I borrowed another model Shark vacuum from someone, and I couldn't even get to the air filter to clean it--the instructions say it should just pop out--ha, ha.  Clearly, Euro-Pro doesn't want you to keep their products for a long time, which is why they stop making the parts easy to get after a few years.  I have only had my vacuum for three years, not thirty.  It should be easier to get filters than this.  Much, much, much easier. I spent a minimum of eight hours trying to get these filters over a few weeks. Next time, I'm buying a Bissell 
 Well, the fact that I'm writing a review about this book, while it's sitting open on my desk next to my computer, open and not being read, might be some evidence of how I'm enjoying this book. This book just goes on and on in complex an unclear language about a subject which shouldn't be so difficult. This book is not clear or easy to understand at all. Every sentence is awkward and followed by a footnote, and the masses of footnotes together take up half of EACH page (!), making this work look like a research project for a PhD publication. I have the casebook in this series, and sometimes it seems reading the cases alone will bring more clarity. And it turns to be true! This book might be good if you're advanted-contracts and want to know every little detail, or as an advanced reference later on, to look something up like in an encyclopedia. Some concepts, which should be pretty clear just get too in-depth coverage in this book. It's too complex for a first-year student. Sometimes it starts describing the different views out there, and then there's a jumble in your head as to what the law really is. I wish the author used his own knowledge and fluid language more than footnoted ideas from other authors. 
 I give this 2.5 stars, and that's mostly because 1. the gimmick/idea that ties together the "whys" of Dracula is interesting and 2. Gerard Butler has amazing screen presence.  The story: Baddies go to steal a hidden treasure (thinking valuable item). This item has been encased and entombed by Van Helsing (yeah, that Van Helsing), the guardian of this particular treasure. As you can guess, it's not jewels or the Holy Grail. It does have to do with blood: Dracula. Baddies get killed/turned. Dracula, who has some kind of psychic connection to Van  Helsing's daughter, Mary(estranged from Papa and living in New Orleans pre-Katrina), goes seeking the woman of his dreams. Nothing really interesting or spooky happens. Yes, folks get bitten. Yes, some get killed. Yes, nice guy goes to save Mary from a toothy fate. Sirens do their ho-hum thing to nice guy hero. Dracula has showdown with Mary. And...well...not giving the ending away.  Ultimately, we get a new (to me, anyway) spin on the tale when we find out how Dracula was created, and why silver and sunlight and crucifixes and holy water are feared and hated objects to Vampiredom. It's a somewhat elegant answer, but it can't satisfy for a lackluster preamble to the revelation.  Justine Waddell doesn't do much with her role. Christopher Plummer is rather wasted. Jonny Lee Miller has a few cute lines, but is kind of disposable, if likable. Omar  Epps didnt' get a chance to do anything worth watching. (He's much better on HOUSE, where he gets some real characterization and infinitely better dialogue.)  So, there's really only ONE reason to watch this film: Gerard Butler.  Now, putting aside for the moment that it's truly bizarre to have Dracula speak in a Scottish accent--fetching, but odd--one can overcome this oddity by the sheer personal magnetism of the man. He makes clunky lines shine through overwhelming emotive power, some real acting chops, and the physical presence to carry off the role. Oh, if they'd only put better lines into his mouth, and not just sharp canines! Only at the end does he really get to speak and emote and burn. It's lovely to watch, for however briefly. A genuinely excellent choice for Dracula, except that Scottish accent. Weird.  If you're a Butlerian Crushgirl--by all means, rent or buy this. The moments with Mr. Butler are worth the price. When he sniffs Mary, it's the kind of fully-dressed erotic moment that puts all the nude scenes in cinema to shame, and it proves that when you have people with intensity and charisma and screen "itness", an expression, a breathy phrase, these are more sensual than a million displays of nakedness and groaning.  If you're not a G.B. fan, or a serious Jonny Lee or Plummer or whomever else in the film fan, skip it. It's just not very good movie-making. All it's got in the end is the cool historical twist and Gerry Butler. For some of you, that may be enough.   Mir 
   This book is anything but a source of information on REAL magick....Bonewits (whose name is appropriate)....claims to be a Druid AND a Wiccan....Although wicca has taken a lot from druidism, They are not the same... and you can`t be both. Mr. Bonewits is nothing more than a hippie/ yuppie environmentalist...ie, a college puke, who, like nicholls, and gar gomm, invented Neo-paganism as a new movement just to put themselves at the forefront of it....If you go to this mans website, you will see that he will do, or say, or SELL anything to make a buck. Beware!   True druids will know this to be true 
 This is the most boring book I've read in the series! I've read all her books and I couldn't wait to finish this one. I can't believe I finished it in the first place! It has no plot and you can tell who did it very early in the storyline (if you want to call it a storyline). I wouldn't waste money buying this one. Get it from your library! The rumors about this one being ghostwritten have got to be true. I can't imagine Braun writing like this! 
 Obviously these guys have invested heavily into the North Mississippi hill country blues of R.L., Junior Kimbrough et al, via the Fat Possum catalog. Although it is mildly entertaining, why spend your filthy lucre on the imitation stuff when you can have the real deal? Search out the real innovators of this sound, they've been doing it a lot longer (and better) with more soul and authenticity than the boys from Akron. 
 As a daily rider of the New York subway system, I find it dynamic and exciting piece of living history.  This book, however, was not.  It is a plodding academic treatment that focuses more on politics than the actual system.  The pictures were too few.  The maps were poorly realized and uninformative.  As the system is still in place largely as it was decades ago, I would have liked references to the current line and station names instead of trying to guess or sit there with my own maps (something you can't do if reading while riding the subway).  The subway system represents both a technological marvel and an instrument of great social change.  Where is that book 
 I had expected this text to be a collection of teaching ideas and suggestions for students preparing to teach language arts in school. There are some useful ideas for educational majors. There is also a ton of unuseful, uninsightful and personal ramblings of an apparent devout feminist who obliviously would more comfortable wrting about societies ills with men in charge, instead of useful educational ideas. Writer Christensen should write social commentaries, instead of professing to write useful text, when she can spew extreme left wing ideas. This should have been a book for a sociology class, not an education class 
 Usually I like fantasy, comic fantasy, parodies of all sorts etc... but I simply was not able to move beyond first ten pages -and believe me, I tried! After all those good reviews...  being not able to read even half a book - this almost does not happen to me (usually I feel obliged to author to read more, before passing judgement). BORING 
 I was waiting to get into ths book...then I realized I was halfway thru it.  I always stick with Berg...you never know when you'll get hooked.  But this one did not have it...I was relieved when it ended 
 I suspect folks read the Cliff Janeway series because they enjoy peeking into the fascinating world of Book Dealing.  Or because they enjoy learning more about books & the publishing industry.  Or because they enjoy Cliff Janeway's dry, self-depricating humor.  Alas, this book doesn't deliver on any of these expectations.    Good characters and a couple of strong opening chapters show what the author can do ... but then it's as if Dunning starts piling so much fat on the bones that he loses sight of the skeleton.  (Perhaps he is being paid by the word or page?)  Plot lines fizzle and disappear, interesting characters are abandoned or disintegrate into stereotype, logical inconsistencies become increasingly glaring, and long passages of history or pseudo-history are substituted for plot.  This book promises to be an engaging romp of a story about finding a lost trove of precious books.  Alas, the trove fails to engage the reader's interest (Dunning never gives us any reason to care whether they are found or not), and the pursuit is almost an afterthought.  This book promises a wonderful (albeit fictional) "reveal" in which Richard Burton, the famous British explorer, effects the course of the Civil War.  But the "reveal", when it comes, is improbable, uninteresting, anachronistic, and tedius.  The opening chapters contain fascinating insight into the world of rare book collecting.  But before you can blink we find ourselves relocated to the Land of Melodrama, where bad guys don't need a reason to be bad, romantic relationships are convenient rather than logical, and good guys indulge in fantasies of exacting bloody revenge (but never actually do).    In short, I suspect people who enjoy this series will find little in this outing of what attracted them to this series in the first place.  I, for one, will have to think twice before giving this author another try.    
 Lisey's Story is the newest in a series of boring books by Stephen King. Very sad considering Mr. King used to be one of my favorite authors. I hate to say this, but it seems since Mr. King got hit by that van, his writing has gone downhill. Liseys's Story got alot of good reviews and I thought maybe the old, page turning Stephen King was back. Not so. I was lucky to get through about 50 pages of this book and called it quits. I was being put to sleep. 
 Unfortunately, it has been made abundantly clear that Tommy Nothing Fancy never had FAS, never died, indeed, never existed.  Also, Nasdijj's mother was not pimped out, was not a drunk, and was not Navajo.  It seems that Nasdijj's life, as chronicled here, simply didn't happen.  This book is seemingly full of poignancy, beautiful prose, and maybe even "agonizingly lucid" passages, but it is also apparently devoid of truth.   
  How the Other Half Lives was written over a century ago as an expose' of the appalling living conditions in the tenements of New York City. The author speaks with a crusader's zeal and with so much detail that the reader can visualize these tenements, these streets, and these people as if they were living today. This is a grim and moving portrayal of the lives of the men, the women and the children that inhabit these loathsome neighborhoods of New York City in the late 1800s.  He so graphically describes the filth, the sunless and airless rooms, the crowding, and the starvation that these places palpably exist for the reader and bring a chill to any heart.  Riis has a genuine concern for the tenement situation and understands these people's plight. His pictures are touching and meant to vividly show their misery. He, for the most part, blames the money-hungry landlords for these crowded conditions: "How shall the love of God be understood by those who have been nurtured in sight only of the greed of man." (p. 266). He laments that the tenement is three quarters responsible for the misery of the poor. Then, after his extensive discourse, he offers three concrete cures for these dreadful conditions, something that many authors forget when they are enlightening readers.  Riis states his purpose for writing this book himself on page 297 when he says, "If this book shall have borne ever so feeble a hand in garnering a harvest of justice, it has served its purpose." The author apparently succeeded with his purpose, because in the flyleaf of this book the publisher tells us: "This book helped bring about new revisions in the housing codes of the major U. S. cities." How does this book relate to adult education? By moving chronologically from the founding of America to the slums of NYC in the 1800s, are we to understand that education took a back seat to the accumulation of money during those hundred years? Certainly Riis posits that education is one of the solutions to this problem while at the same time implying that wealth accumulation and the lack of education has been the cause of this problem.  "Thus the whole matter resolves itself once more into a question of education, all the more urgent because these people are poor, miserably poor almost to a man." (p. 147). He does not forget that this "education" is not only for the poor people, but also for the wealthy landlords. "Clearly, it is a matter of education on the part of the landlord no less than the tenant." (p. 270). Riis' almost missionary language exhorts us to never allow greed to override a compassion for humanity.  "It is a fight in which eternal vigilance is truly the price of liberty and the preservation of society." (p. 233). The relation of this book to the other units of study in this course could be explained as an example of how low mankind can descend if education is not considered one of the major cornerstones of a society. Although this book was exhaustive in its detail, it was easy to read while at the same time enlightening. I found myself enjoying the ranting tone and the fascinating lists of neighborhoods and the labels that Riis used for the different races. In a sense it reads like a Ginsberg poem; constantly hitting the reader with melodious lists of places and people from another era. Read these geographic names out loud and feel their rhythm: Jewtown, Bandit's Roost, Double Alley, The Bowery, The Bloody Sixth Ward, The Fourth, Fifth and Tenth Wards,  Blindman's Alley, The Bend, The Battery, Little Italy, The French Quarter, Hell's Kitchen, The West Side, Bottle Alley, Frog Hollow, Poverty Gap, Murderer's Alley, Gotham Court, The Old Brewery, Old Africa, Potter's Field, Blackwell's Island Asylum, Rogues' Gallery, Penitentiary Row, Chinatown. The list goes on. To someone reared in rural America, this chant sounds like a song about another country.   Riis also has something to say about all the races of people that live in the tenements of New York City:  Chinaman (he can't be taught), (Chinese (coolie--laundry business), Polish Jew (coops himself up in his den with his thermometer at boiling), Russian Jew, Jew (money is their God), Bohemian (poor, but thrifty), Blacks (like to gamble, but they are clean), Greek, Hebrews (tailors, all of them), Dutchman, Irish (like to drink and have expensive funerals), German (order loving), Swiss, Pasquales, Russian, Italian (a born gambler; lighthearted and gay), Swamp Angel (thieves), Street Arabs (army of homeless boys), Tramps and Toughs (the world owes them a living),and the Celtics. I was enthralled by the street lingo and the colloquialisms and Riis' comments about every race.  I noticed one interesting similarity between the late 1800s and the present day. Riis says that the gap between the social classes is widening everyday. I hear people talking about the growing differences between the rich and the poor often these days. Does every generation think that is happening in their time?  Not only should this book be used by people researching New York City`s tenements, but it should also be read by everyone seeking a blueprint for social change. It is a reminder to show us how hopeless the human circumstances can become when man's greed overrides his concern for human dignity.     
 Beware of these juvenile moron fanatic western so-called researcher reviewers etc who are incapable of anything remotely called as reality or truth or mind or intellect or refinement. Their pathologically sick megalomania and perverted lack of culture refinement or anything more than body hungerness, philistinism and vulgar slavery of animality under hypocrisy of humanitaies or humanity or intellect or research - debares them from appreciating or finding or learning or studying or bringing any reality whatsoever. Not only that they then blame others for their traits.    What does this mean? This means that Dr.White or such little reviewer supporter lack the zeal refinement will mind intellect or spirit to even appreciate or understand TANTRA or reality or TRUTH or anything that is beyond philistinism or body. Yet their megalomania prevents them from admiting this. They reduce everything to materialistic barbarous addicted attachemnt.   Not only that they are so much fanatic that they lack the mind to even appreciate or understand constructive criticism of their faults. Not only that they are so much hypocritic that they blame other for their traits. CLASSIC CASE OF POT CALLING THE KETTLE BLACK! Those who lack mind talk of protocols of critical mind. Those who react fanatically to criticism want  appreciation of criticism lol. What a joke?!   Research? The reality wherein TRUTH has been handed out from GURU TO SISYA as practical tradition where people live their traditions rather than writing it. How much right it is to ignore these people under the illusion megalomania and fanatism of  non-existant 'humanitarian mind' or illusory 'critical-mind' ? How right it is to lament your juvenille hallucination interpretations which are not at all in accordance either with history or living tradition or reality or truth or even scriptures as TRUTH and lament anybody critcising it as unable to appreciate it or lacking critique mind or humanitarian discipline. Aren't such utterance themselves proof of WESTERN or RESEARCHERS or so-called REVIWERS, ignorance of reality, lack of mind, lack of critique mind that can even appreciate protocol of humanitarian discipline, lack of intellect or spirit or heart or will to understand the real scriptures or interpretations or traditions, or lack of mind to appreciate criticism or understand it?    The reality where words change meaning in 50 years! Where words can be interpreted in different way?! How right it is to trust words when reality was handed down not in words but in initiation in real practise?!!!    In short these writers and reviewers are in fact fanatic political vandalistic vendata barbarous boors who in totality reprsent the WEST and its juvenille intellect under the hallucination of 'RESEARCH' 'INTELLECTUAL' etc, who seriously lack any spirit to go beyond juvnille intellect, who lack any mind whatsoever to understand or work in GURU-SISYA TRADITION, who lack the reality and will to actually travel the path or study it and who are lazy enough to actually travel or 'study' it.    In fact such researchers and reviewers always make '10%-baked' not even 'half-baked' attempts to harp on these 'ULTIMATE TRUTHS' for strenghtening their egoes popularity and money. They lack the will and work required to actually live or 'study' the tradition or reality and find the truth OR STUDY and make '10%-baked' attempts to gain money name fame or satisfy their perverted egoes and slavery of 'juvenille addiction to words'.   BEWARE OF THESE ORGANISED clandestine ATTEMPTS OF CHURCH AND CHRISTIANS to DEGRADE DEFAME and DERAIL  ANYTHING 'HINDU' OR 'REAL'! BEWARE OF THESE surreptitious ATTEMPTS OF REDUCING ANYTHING 'HUMAN' OR 'SPIRITUAL' to the levels of 'animality' and 'philistinism' and BODY! BEWARE OF THESE ATTEMPTS of reducing anything GOLD or diamond to ashes or graphite. BEWARE OF these attempts to reducing the godly to trival.    That is not to say that body fluids or sexual things were not used etc but there was total sciene of it and it was definately not the 'philistine' or 'non-spiritual' and had great clear science meaning and still has. IT IS DEFINATELY not the WAY it is UNDERSTOOD or PORTRAYED.  UNFORTUNATELY ALL WESTERN RESEARCHERS LACK THE STUDY AND WILL TO STUDY these things and are incapable to even UNDERTAKE or UNDERSTAND IT because of their lack of brain heart and soul for the same.    What these means is? We have a person who tastes sugar. Then we have fools like White who write about taste of sugar without actually tasting it. And then there are morons like 'a reader' of 'beware of other reviwers' who would like us to trust WHITE as authority on the taste of sugar rather than the direct experience or those who have experienced? GOT IT? And again these morons fanatic barbarous philistine inhuman boor animal morons would blame others for their traits!    Moreover they would like to divide INDIANS or PEOPLE through their 'DIVIDE and RULE' POLITICS under the hallucination of 'scholarism' 'intellectualism' etc...    [... 
   I've read 8 books by Nancy Kress but after this one I'm not sure I'll read more.  This book degrades into military fiction, and leaves out the development of characters so they are nothing but shells.  This book is sorely unrealistic leaving the story unbelievable.  I can't explain too much without giving away the story, but basically, the Furs who are supposed to be a very intelligent race are not smart enough to use ceramics and know nothing about quarantines.  I thought the setup for this series was interesting but I think Kress is concentrating on a prolific career instead of worrying about plausibility.  Let's hope the next series is not about war with aliens 
 I didn't really care for this toy and felt it wasn't really represented properly in its description.  My grandaughter found it boring 
 Wow, I was expecting a fun, light read, and in the first chapter already had to skim over a couple of paragraphs relating to "mishaps" that happen to animals in Zippy's life. Well, I thought, next chapter will be better. NOT. The next chapter included a graphic scene of chickens being slaughtered by shovels! Every chapter so far has had something very disturbing about animals in it! If you are sensitive to these things, I would not recommend the book. I'm not sure I'm going to finish it at this rate. Granted, I AM super-sensitive to any animal suffering, but this is really overload. I'm halfway through and so far this is the list: The aforementioned chicken slaughter, a neighbor stealing her cat and starving it in the basement, another neighbor looking to poison her cat, dog-sitting for friends and losing the dog and not worrying about it that much and finding him dead days later, her father going out with a shotgun to kill the dogs who massacred Zippy's pet chicken, joking about a neighbor enjoying "puppy stew", keeping her two dogs penned up, torturing a raccoon by holding in front of 30 braying hounds.... I mean, does that seem like a lot to you??? For a light-hearted "tender" memoir???? Jeez louise! I can't sleep at night from this book 
 When I began reading this book, I expected to read a story about a young girl growing up with an extended chinese/hawaiian family.  Although this book is filled with Hawaiian and Chinese family tradition, it is merely a collection unlinked childhood memories.  Each chapter is a mini-story within itself and is not related to other chapters.  I was disappointed that the plot was not developed 
 I have bought this book hoping to write a secure web page but I could get more advice search the microsoft web page than the book. Not recommended if you r writing for the web 
 [star rating above is for DVD only (gave them an extra * just for releasing the title); movie itself = *****] I've waited 7 years for this Sidney Lumet masterpiece to appear on DVD. The transfer here is non-anamorphic, non-progressive 1.66:1. Cruddy. 12 total chapter stops for a 2-hour film.  my review of the new "Burn!" DVD asks consumers to please send Sony/Columbia/Tristar/MGM a clear message by not purchasing that disc. In this case - as we've all waited so long just to have a widescreen transfer of "TFK" appear on disc - it's up to you. With the advent of the year 2006 I'll be seeking a special edition of "The Fugitive Kind" (and other MIA Lumet gems such as "The Hill", "The Offence", "The Anderson Tapes" ...) for DVD release by a studio which treats classic films with the respect, archival care, detail attention and extras they deserve 
 "Bishop" Spong has turned out another "masterpiece." However, why not be honest and title the book, "Why I hate the Bible and Christians in general." I'm not entirely sure why Spong insists on calling himself a Christian but I do have a theory. Books by so-called Christians sell more then books by atheists. So why not write a book condemning all of Christianity all the while still calling yourself a Christian. Face it books sell that are believed to be by a "Christian author." Not to mention he gets a fat salary from the Anglican "Church."  Spong denies every single traditional doctrine of Christianity. He not only believes that homosexuality is not a sin but he actually believes that it is a virtue. If you are really interested in learning how to hate Christianity then this is the book for you. If morality to you is only that which suits your purposes and what you find convenient then Spong is your man. If you really want to know about what the bible actually says and who Jesus Christ really was then read the bible and consider something worthwhile to help guide you through a decent understanding of the Christian faith, like C.S. Lewis's "Mere Christianity" or Peter Kreeft's "Catholic Christianity." For those who want even a more basic understanding of the Christian Faith try Lee Strobel's "A case for Christ." It is evident that Spong has a deep seated hatred toward Christianity and Christians in general and his book does not even do the cause of liberal theology any good. 1 star because there is no minus 1000. 
 The author of this work was what drew me to this title.  Peter Blauner wrote The Intruder and I absolutely loved that book.  This book however leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  The characters are not drawn out very well and the story drags on forever.  Many of the players in this book are not needed and just prolong the agony of the reading.  The end, although exciting, could have been better.  All in all this a book that I have to say would be better if skipped 
 Product was shipped immediately and arrived in excellent condition.  It was not too difficult to put together.  As to the product itself, it is not too sturdy and will not hold up to regular rigorous use.  The biggest problem with it (that has been noted by other reviewers) is that the cloth bag slides around on the chrome and will not stay in place.  To get the bag to stay in place, I had to sew Velcro on it and then glue Velcro on the chrome sides.  If I had seen this in a store, I would not have purchased it.   
 I bought this as a gift for my nephew because I loved the book as a chid and vaguely remembered a wonderful treehouse in the movie.  I'm very glad I screened it first.  The female characters are practically subhuman in intelligence and the story presentation is slow, boring, and illogical.  I'm not very PC with old movies, but the sexism and animal abuse in this movie are way past my limits.  Choose one of the other Disney re-releases instead.  There are plenty of good ones to choose over this dog 
  I found Russell S. Bonds'   "Stealing the General" to be a great disappointment.  Upon receiving the book, I eagerly checked the index for references to my ancestor, Ovid Wellford "James" Smith.  Then to my chagrin, I found that the author went  to great lengths to portray Ovid as an interloper undeserving of the Medal of Honor!  Unfortunately, since not a lot is known about  this young man, who volunteered  to be a soldier at the age of 16 and at age 17 volunteered for the Andrews Raid, the author resorted to conjecture and derogatory statements.  Ovid and fellow  raider, Samuel Llewellyn, were referred to as "wayward would-be raiders".  They WERE raiders, of course.  They WERE NOT "wayword" , but had followed orders and joined a Confederate  artillary unit when it became necessary.    The author notes that Ovid was "missing" from the 1888 Reunion of the Andrews Raiders.  That would have been a good place to inform the reader that Ovid died twenty years earlier.  Instead, Mr. Bonds begins a new attack; this time on the young man's father, whom he describes as so "seemingly untroubled by his son's lack of involvement in the operation" that he "actively lobbied  the War Department for his son to receive the Medal of Honor." The truth is, The Reverend Samuel Smith wrote ONE letter asking that his son be put on " the same footing" as the other men.  Samuel Smith was a highly respected ordained Baptist minister who was revered by  his fellow citizens in  Parkersburg, West Virginia.  He would not have asked for something his son did not deserve.    The author was so intent on convincing his readers that Ovid was not deserving of the Medal, that he didn't  bother to mention that this "young pup" (his words) spent several months in Swims jail in Chattanooga, as did the other raiders.  This may have led to his death at the age of 23, but that is only conjecture.  Conjecture, over time, can come to be believed as fact.  That is something that troubles me about this book:; an abundance of conjecture.  It may make the narrative more exciting, but  then the reader has to try to sort out the fact from the fiction. In this book, Bonds has done a hatchet job on Ovid Smith's reputation as an Andrews Raider. In the early 1900's all of the Medal of Honor awards were reviewed, including Ovid Smith's . Ovid was found to be worthy of his Medal. And that's a fact!  When I read something that I know is not true, I find myself doubting the accuracy of the entire book. And sadly, that is how it is with this book.  If you are interested in the Andrews Raid, buy  "The General and The Texas" by Stan Cohen and James G. Bogle.  Colonel Bogle is the ultimate authority  on the subject of the Andrews Raid.         
 As a book that holds itself out to be a handbook as well as a guide to the subject of maps and compasses, it fell woefully short in instruction on either.    1) There was virtually no mention of terrain features.  One of the most important things to understand on a topo map are the terrain features and how you can use them and the map alone to navigate a parcel of land if you know your terrain features well enough.  This is a must for any book of land navigation.  2) Section, re-section and modified resection.  While modified resection was briefly mentioned, the first two were not. These three methods of positioning must be understood to successfully find a particular position on the map.  3. The lensatic compass, while an old model, is still utilized because it is one of the most well designed models ever built.  Why was it not mentioned in the section on compasses?  4. The section on maps had no reference to the Military Grid Reference System.   Those were the primary complains, but there was nothing of notable value, either. 
 Grossly over-priced and useless - Sony's $10 headphones sounded just as good.  The headphone fit in the ear s uncomfortable at best 
 LOL! Some people cant be serious these days. The lyrics on every track are straight garbage. So he failed BAD lyric wise. Production wise, some of the beats are pretty good, but a beat doesnt make a song good! Nor does it make horrible lyrics good!! So I think some tracks where he gets deep are worth the try J-Kwon, but the game aint for you. I think this album is garbage 
 This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.  "True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.  There is no plot.  No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.  The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.  "Message in a Bottle" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.  You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed. 
 I found this book to repetitive.  It just keeps going on and on, on how bad Web feels about the death of his 7 team mates.  Also, it has harsh racist descriptions on some characters that don't really add to the story at all.  It just adds to the stereotype of how life is in Annacostia, Washington DC.  One such description is that of the black grandmother of the missing kid.  She is described as a big black woman about the sides of a small car with big breast and lives in a house full of rat excrements. I don't recommend this book at all, but if you are a narrow minded white male, who thinks that he is at the top of the hill looking down on the rest, this book is for you 
 Even if one is sympathetic to Groothuis's broad concern, one can't help but be disappointed with this text. This book is a bad regurgitation of other bad and reductive non-readings of `pomo'. Groothuis depends way too highly on secondary (and sometimes tertiary) sources. It escapes me how a former reviewer could call this work `scholarly.' I suppose if one considers Logic 101 tinged with the usual fundamentalist `defender of the Faith' rhetoric and aura (which hovers over every page), then this could be called `scholarly.'   The big problem I found is that even when Groothuis offers defensible criticisms, his alternatives end up being just as problematic as the positions he criticizes. For all his advocacy for a correspondence theory of truth, his tone betrays a penchant for certainty and formal coherence. He falls into the problem of the relation between thought and `reality,' representation to presentation, the role of language, and so forth. No doubt God comes to save the day with all these problems, yet on the very justificatory terms Groothuis advocates for, God escapes the measure of correspondence and becomes its condition of possibility. In other words, God becomes a structural metaphysical function which `saves' Groothuis's truth from the skeptic. The problem, however, is that Groothuis wants truth to be absolute, universal, and accessible to all, yet he is dependent on a moment (i.e. faith) which, by definition, retains a trace of contingency or `objective' undecidability.    Groothuis's more ethical concerns are where I am more sympathetic, but again, here his polemics and non-reading of the people he criticizes drowned out whatever constructive points he offers. Groothuis practices the same type of irresponsible reflection that some of the `pomo' Evangelical's do: uncriticality. Here, philosophy and reflection - whether Modern or postmodern - becomes a means to simply confirm and justify a complacent status quo, rather than challenging and transforming the status quo. The challenge presented in this book is for a nostalgic return to the good old days of Christendom.   Jesus did not come to `save' our metaphysical systems, but to redeem us and this world. That redemption is not contingent upon accurate representations as Groothuis seems to think. It is madness to the Greek (i.e. the logician) and a stumbling block to the Legalist (i.e. moralistic hypocrites). The task is not to make the faith less crazy or more socially repressive. As James tells us, the measure of `true' faith - and here I will grant a type of reference - is that we `attend to the widow and orphan.' Kerygma without service is dead, a worse lie than any humanism. Perhaps if we began `proving' our faith, that is, manifesting its truth in radical service and justice - we could actually demonstrate the truth to which we testify. I guess it is much easier to `defend the faith' with bad arguments which only convince the already convinced, than to `live the faith': serve the people no one gives a hoot about. After all, in the latter case one cannot fancy oneself a hero in quite the same way.    
 Eric Johnson is as talented a guitar player as God ever put on this earth. His chords and notes are so clean, it defies belief. You wonder out loud how someone could master an instrument as well as he does. Growing up in Austin, I have had the chance to see him numerous times, and my opinion of him has not changed in 20 years, he can't sing! I am sorry, but Eric has always had this desire to be a pop star. So many people in Austin just cringe at concerts when he stops rocking, so that he can sing one of his sappy lyrics. It is a waste. Now don't jump on me! I love the guy! But I wish he would stick to playing guitar and quit the singing. The guy just has so much talent 
 I've got a LITE-ON DVDRW SOHW-1673S burner (Revision JS02) in my fast G4 Mac running OS X Tiger and burning with Toast Titanium 7. Although my burner is nominally 16X-capable, it only burns at about 6X in my setup, probably due to the slow (ATA 33) bus it's on.    I've used a number of different brands of 8X and 16X disks, both +R and -R, and have had a verification failure rate of less than 2% -- so few, in fact, that I often don't bother verifying video DVD's anymore when burning TDK or Maxell discs. (I always verify data DVD's, since errors in those are not ignorable.) But with Memorex, I've gotten about 20% failures, including a couple of aborted burns! In one case, the disc had a blank band between two burned ones!    The Memorex discs I'm referring to have Manufacturer ID "CMC MAG, AM3". According to videohelp.com, these are sold under at least 7 different brand names. The reviews there are rather mixed, which is not IMHO good enough!    I have not, BTW, have had any problems with the Memorex DVD+R discs I've tried. But I stopped using them because one of my players won't recognize the +R format 
 YOU MUST APPRECIATE THE FRENCH FILM.I CAN'T REMEMBER MUCH OF THE MOVIE AND WILL BE PASSING IT ON TO SOMEONE WHO LOVES THE STYLE.THANK 
 First of all, 1 hour worth of workouts is not sufficient for 20 bucks.  Second of all, I missed the section that explained the requirement of a workout bench and dumbells to do most everything in the video so that was a pain.  Also, regardless of the fact that one girl does a beginners version of the excercises, it is still moderately difficult 
 I got 2 of these for my husband and son for their crossword madness...and they both thought this was just 'cheating' and refuse to use them!  Oh well 
 Gee, it was until I watched this movie when I became able to understand why some reviewers get so angry at some movies or novels. I had never seen characters as stupid, immature and obnoxious as the ones from this product. I've been open minded to several movies -you can see it in my reviews- but this one was too much, and this time I do agree with all reviewers who have disliked this product for the same reason I just mentioned. Do you think we are exaggerating? Check just two small pieces:   -In one scene, a girl and her dad found a town buried by an earthquake. She insisted on hearing some music from the ground, so his dad went to search to look for people to help, but then she asked her dad why he went when there's nobody, and keept bothering all along. Did she have X-rays to see underground? Anyway, this perfectly rich-spoiled-brat would definitively win -if existed- the Jerk Nobel prize and graduate with top honors from PhD jerk studies from Harvard. -In another scene, the California's governor's top assistant gets her couple throwing a fir over the phone and calling her repeatedly about why they don't have children (or else, I don't care) while the earthquakes eat California and Washington.  The movie starts with a big array of people acting up and demanding attention for themselves while caring nothing whatsoever about other people's problems, no matter there's an emergency state. The classical monsters like vampires, dragons, demons and the like are nothing compared with the stuff you see in this movie. Later on, as anybody can image, everybody is asking forgiveness and telling how much they actually loved each other, over and over all along the movie. I like emotions in movies for sure, but this was plain disgusting to me..specially for 3 hours! But if this is the type of scenes you like, you'll get tons of it in here! And you'll rank it 5 starts! As for me, I really thank the ones who invented the DVDs which allow speeding movies up so I don't need to put up with so much baloney as I would with the old VHS. Today we can see only what we want from a movie. Well, let's pass to the interesting parts.   This movie seems to be a reply to the current anti-fear-mongering wave I've noticed lately. This wave is led by Conservative (or the like) people. The top example could be Michael Crichton's (creator of Jurassic Park, ER, Rising Sun, Sphere, etc) latest novel "State of Fear" and his web site where he displays a big deal of arguments and critics against all the media that keep the whole world under constant fear about everything. But this movie shows the government risking millions of people in order to avoid general panic. So, the government initially rejects the fear-mongers who predict huge catastrophes. This is interesting but it's still a movie and what I've read from Michael Crichton and others is likely to be real. At least the movie writers seem to have done some decent research. Moreover they did well in presenting all predictions and solutions in the movie as speculations. It was actually interesting hearing the scientific arguments of Dr. Hill who sees the problems and solutions. That may have been good hard science fiction.   Unfortunately these interesting aspects were far from the movie's core, which was emotions and more wild emotions with lots of people caring and caring....no matter they oppose actual solutions...all the time. You'll see that some people get to be evacuated and then the president (so charmingly caring) wants to let them go back home immediately but Dr. Hill has to convince him to wait ridiculous 24 hrs to make things sure. This was too off real world as well.  Regarding the special effects, some people didn't like them but I did. If this is what you're looking for I strongly advise you to speed the movie all the time without action scenes, which in fact are not many. You can tell this was made for TV in several scenes. Some people thought that it was too long as a movie, but once again, it all depends on what you like. If you like emotions and special effects, this shouldn't matter to you, other wise keep away from wasting your time with this thing 
 This book reads as though it was written by the staff from the television show, "The View".  Jez... 
 I am from Australia and received these in the post and promptly returned them to Amazon. Is a complete season of Baywatch really Baywatch when the seasons are labeled incorrectly, the music and theme song have been changed and episodes are missing? I don't think so.  Not only have the distributors done fans no favours but Amazon have incorrectly labeled the cast. On the Amazon website as part of advertising for Season 1 they have incorrectly labeled it. If you go by the cast that Amazon have put on, you would think that it WAS the real original Season 1, when we know it is not.  The release in the UK, which is out now and the upcoming release in Australia on March 14th is the real deal. Season 1 is the real season 1 and all subsequent seasons are correct. There are NO episodes missing and the original music and theme song are intact. Might wanna try those regions to buy the real deal.  AARO 
 This book is about as bad as it gets.  Whether you support evolution or disagree with it, you won't find anything in this book that suggests an intelligent analysis of the controversey.  The author has been caught in several instances of plagarism.  His best defense of this book would be that he stole it from someone else 
 There wasn't enough input from primary sources in this book - interviews with, and direct quotes from, family and friends - to make it antyhing resembling a definitive biography.  The details that were provided came off sounding more like heresay than fact, and there was more pop psychology in this than seemed appropriate.  The author came across as extremely knowledgeable about Grant's movies, but then got some key details wrong (as noted in detail by other reviewers) but the rest of it seemed like it was written from the outside looking in, which undermined the credibility of the book.  The photo on the front was the best part 
 This particular edition of LP Cuba will do you little good in the year 2005 and it's not necessarily all LP's fault as Cuba undergoes a metamorphosis every other day or so.  So, go with another guide for more up to date information on currency and prices in general as well as legal casas.  And specifically for the Hotel Lido: whomever wrote up the little ditty about how only the brave should stay there does a great disservice to that hotel.    Finally, it would be nice if the author could actually stop blaming the US for 2 seconds and perhaps hold Castro accountable for something other than nothing 
 This book was assigned text in a college class of mine.  I didn't get half way through it before I told the prof Id rather drop the class than finish reading the book.  He asked me to write a paper on my problem with the book's ideas.  The prof agreed with my concerns and the book was dropped, thought the bookstore already ordered them.  The prof took the heat and refused to assign the book the next semester.  I looked for my paper but could not find it.  Without spending a lot of time reconstructing it, let me say this book was not what it could have been.  One could write a useful book on perception vs. reality of silicone breast implants, or on the legal reasons behind labels warning ladder users that the hard ground the ladder was set on yesterday may have thawed and make for an unsafe foundation today.  To my recollection, it did not rail against idiot-proofing the world... though its point that a simple yellow line seems insufficient to keep people off the train tracks at the train station, yet works well for its purpose, is well taken.  The book seems to lean to - lets build the cheapest nuke plant possible, and with the money saved, the standard of living will increase, offsetting the inevitable disaster that will result from our risk taking, but at least our emergency response teams will be more resilient for having cleaned up the mess.  And how can you put a value on this increased preparedness?  (Letting alone the shift from corporate costs (prevention) to the government (clean-up.)  Yes, that is this book to me in a nut shell.  To conclude from a study of adding safety features to nuke plants, that the enemy is "counterproductive safety measures" (P.140), and not bloated, inefficient government, is unexplainable.  The author makes many statements using odd logic (often takes the position of the opposing side to 'straw-man' extremes), like this from page 25, "Poisons are an integral part of nature.  So is chemical warfare among plants, animals and insects.  To ban carcinogenic substances, therefore, is to ban life."  I am no biochemist, but is there another creature in nature that can create non-biodegradable carcinogens on anything like the scale of human beings?  If not, then perhaps this is why humans were given brains.  So we can perceive how dangerous we can be if left only to a motive of warfare, or of profit.  A true search for safety should properly factor in the unrecallableness of genetic experiments gone awry.  To this concern, the author simply uses the 'it hasn't happened yet' rebuttal (P.40)  Disregarding that 'killer bees' were a only breeding experiment, think of the possibilities of cauliflower virus markers in an un-natural host species?  Why does the media concern itself with the possible viral transmute bird flu, and ignore it when we do it intentionally to the vegetables we eat?  I would suppose the author would praise the mere spot checking of beef for mad cow disease, as do I.  But to defend the risks being taken with, the genetic engineering of food crops?  Regulation is the only safe method, and it is not being done.  But then again, the soybean crop has not been wiped out by a heretofore cauliflower virus - yet 
 The movie "Extreme Ops" which opened to lukewarm reviews and even more lukewarm box office really should carry a government health warning with it. It is so mind numbingly incoherent and lackluster that one can feel your brain cells being depleted one by one after each comic strip moment.  Let me take that back because to equate comic strips with this piece of drivel is a disservice to comic strips. This movie has no plot and no characterization. The point appears to be to display some "amazing" stunt work but the effect is spoiled by an over usage of truly obvious computer generated effect work that would not look out of place on your home play station.  The plot, and I use the term loosely, concerns a group of commercial filmmakers who travel the world in attempts to catch stunts on film. They have been hired by a Japanese businessman to catch shots of a skier racing ahead of an avalanche (the reason why is never really given) so this ragtag group heads for Austria. Why they made the decision to film the shot in the Alps instead of the perfectly good Rocky Mountains is similarly never explained, except that it allows them to come into contact with a sneering Serbian war criminal fresh from faking his own death.  Understandably the sneering villain is none to happy to be sharing his mountain hideaway with an obnoxious group of teenagers. He, like the theater audience, seems to find them just as annoying as we do, but whereas we have the liberty of tuning them out or, even more sensibly, walking out in the middle of the movie, he takes a more homicidal approach and decides to do away with them.  I usually try to find some good points in a movie I review so it is somewhat balanced, however it is hard with this flick to find something positive to say, I guess one could point out that the girls are good looking and the scenery is equally pretty - does that count?  Do yourself a favor and give this a miss. I would also recommend that you pass it by when you see it on DVD shelves. There is absolutely no redeeming feature to this dull, dumb movie 
 Literary critic should have titled this little guide `What to Read and Why,' seeing as he devotes only a few paragraphs to why reading might be valuable. That said, Bloom is a terrifyingly accomplished reader, but he isn't much of a thinker or a critic in the way Benjamin or Derrida were. Bloom's incessant propensity to judge all literature from the `how is this compared to Shakespeare' lens is foolish and lacking in any insight. At times his criticism seems almost amateurish and rushed. He doesn't seem to be a very good reader of Hemingway, for instance. At the outset of a review of `Hills Like White Elephants,' Bloom writes that "Hemingway's personal mystique-his bravura poses as warrior, big-game hunter, bullfighter, and boxer-is irrelevant to `Hills Like White Elephants' as its male protagonist's insistence that `You know that I love you'" (47). Yet later in Bloom's review, he writes [on `The Snows of Kilimanjaro']: The irony is at Hemingway's expense, insofar as Harry prophesies the Hemingway who, nineteen days shor of his sixty-second birthday, turned a double-barreled shotgun on himself" (49). Bloom seems to have reversed tactics here. Never the less, Bloom is an undeniably great reader of poetry; in this volume he tells you all about his personal favorites: Stevens, Whitman, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, etc. Kind of fun, but far from great criticism.  
 I cannot comment on the product itself because apparently it is not available for sale although it is listed as such.  Availability of the item is so intrinsically tied to its value to a customer that it is inappropriate to exclude comments related to such.  Although I ordered the item on December 10th as a Christmas present, it has yet to ship, no reason is given, and now the estimated delivery date is Feb 14-21-  great product, right 
 Maybe this book would have been better if the illustrations were better & the colors weren't so off.  Our toddler was not interested in this book at all & I could see why.  This was not one of Wood's best books- try The Big Hungry Bear or King Bidgood's in the Bathtub.  But if you're interested in a book similar to Quick as a Cricket and one SO much better, get A Dragon in a Wagon, by Lynley Dodd

 This is a lousy "Greatest Hits" compilation.  It fails to include the #1 I Just Wanted You Know, #3 Your Love Is A Miracle, among other top 5-10 hits meaning you'll still have to go through and buy the rest of the albums to truely have "the greatest hits".  All together, Id say its missing about 6 tracks needed to be a true "Greatest Hits".  It does include a couple of new songs and one is pretty good which is the only reason I can give this album two stars instead of one 
 ..and they are apparently buying this joke of a book. How this book managed to get 4 stars is a mystery unless you look at the other items viewed with it such as "voodoo kits" and other sensationalized , glossy rip offs playing on the fear and awe the Vodou religion brings with it to the uneducated gawker.   Dr. Snake is a joke and so is this book, but it has the kewl, slick little cover and the cute little "voodoo" doll so people look past the fact that all the info can be found (and better explained) online as well as all the spells" he has apparently ripped off as well. Here to hoping that eventually people will look past the books cover and see it for what it really is...glossy toilet paper.  
 While this was nowhere near as bad as IMPOSSIBLE, this was just boring and very repetitive.  And the end - the storm - wasn't that in Bittersweet?  A storm on a yacht and the hero comes to claim the heroine??  I have read Danielle Steel for half my life now.....named my daughter after her....but I long for the day when I can say "She's BACK! 
 After consuming everything Hillerman has written, and learning something new about Native American culture from each book, and after Hillerman's squib on the Dust jacket, my expectations were set so far above what this trite book delivered that even two stars seems kind... As a 1/8 Arapaho [& 1/8 Blackfoot] i had hoped to learn something about their life.  The characterizations were also paper thin, including both the male and female protagonists... and the denouement was telegraphed for miles... ergo, even as a mystery/suspense novel, this one flunked 
 there are a lot of negative comments I've read on silver, and the more I see of her works, the more I understand them.  This isn't real occultism.  I'm sure these spells work well enough, but if that's all anyone practicing this stuff cares about, then you're not really a witch, just some meddler in the arts who dosen't really understand any of this.  Silver's books can be good up to a point, but there are those of us (occultists) who have studied many, many long, extremly painful years in the sacred energies, and these spells can be dangerous.  They're real, and they're dabbling in the energies without really knowing what you're doing.  Silver dosen't take the thought or time to explain true occultism in her books, but I don't think that's really her fault.  Sometimes, I actually think she believes she's a real witch, and I'm sure her "followers" do to.  Take my advice, if you really want to practice magick, then read something else.  DON'T STOP READING THESE BOOKS, if you don't want to, but you do need to read other books by other authors to get many veiws on occultism anyway, so I suggest reading some books by ALEISTER CROWLEY, or some sort of well-known, famous occultist, and see if you don't change your mind about Silver.  If you don't, that's fine, at least you've looked around a little bit more, and if you do, that's good too (you probably will) 
 I have previously enjoyed all of Suzanne Brockmann's books but this one is a departure from her usual interesting fiction. I have struggled to finish it but it is so tedious with stupid situations and circumstances, I really hate it. What a yawner and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they like to be bored and frustrated 
 This novel starts out okay, but rapidly deteriorates into a maudlin melodrama of cardboard characters.  After I began reading this, I thought it seemed very formulaic compared to other Ludlum novels.  My biggest problems with the book can be put into two basic categories:  One - The man with no name who is too dangerous to let go.  This theme is well done with Jason Bourne, but far too commonplace here. Several times I felt that if the main character was this well trained, he never would have pursued his course of action.  Two - The reasonable female.  The girl is far too willing to accept really bad things here.  No convincing is needed - just imply cloak and dagger and the girl falls in line.  I started out liking the book - but ended up hating it 
 I was pleased to see this book at our local bookstore, but decided to check it out of our library first. Boy, am I glad I did! Many of the recipes include Worcestershire sauce. Students, especially those who are new to vegetarianism, may simply trust this book and may not know that Worcestershire sauce contains anchovies -- meat! Also, some canned mushroom soups have a beef base, which the author also neglects to mention. Just a note at the start -- or even just a concerted effort to specify *vegetarian*  Worcestershire sauce would have made all the difference. However, these flaws are so big as to keep me from purchasing this book -- for myself, for any friends, or for the collection of the library in which I work 
 So, after 86 years, the Red Sox finally break through.  And, for this special, long-awaited moment, does the once-august Boston Globe take the time to lovingly, painstakingly put together a keepsake for its maniacly devoted fans?  No.  Instead it puts out a complete and utter piece of dreck.  Someone at the Globe or publisher Triumph Books - perhaps the entire team charged with assembling this gaffe - ought to be fired.  Shame on you.    This book simply was not edited, fact-checked, reviewed, verified or even given the simplest 'once over.' Even a quick read-through should have caused even the most junior editor at the Globe/Triumph to ask that the presses be stopped.   Reviewer Arthur Weeks has compiled a great list and it gives you an idea of just how egregious these errors are - missing box scores, earned runs in shutouts, St. Louis scoring four runs in the ninth inning of a game they lost 6 - 2.  You can't make this stuff up.  Here's a couple of more:  - On pages 26 - 27, two pictures claim to show Larry Walker (p. 26) and Jeff Suppan (p. 27) making baserunning blunders.  In fact, both pictures are of Walker - different angles, but it's clearly Number 33 in both shots (and Suppan was wearing a warm-up jacket as I recall).  - On page 86, they bollix up the name of the very guy who coined the term 'Curse of the Bambino': the Globe's own Dan Shaughnessy, who here becomes Dan Shaugnessy.  Furthermore, the box scores are of the variety that appeared in your small, local paper circa 1969.  They've got about 25% of the content of a box score that appears today in USA Today and most other corners of the statistics-crazed world of baseball.  These box scores offer the reader next to no insight on the game.  One other metric to give you an idea of how thin the gruel is: the marketing blurb provided on these pages (no doubt provided by Triumph) says the book is filled with 'hundreds of color photos.'  The book, in fact, has exactly 79 photos. And I'm being lenient here by including the front and back cover images and one page that contains six 1.75" x 3" photo head shots of various players.    In short: pathetic.   It's a crying shame.  I urge all Red Sox fans to avoid this book.    I want my money back. 
 I bought this product to replace one that had broken that I really liked. I had to return this product THREE times because it does NOT (as it says in the description) come with the perfect pour carafe which is what I wanted since the standard carafe drips EVERYWHERE. On the third time of returning it, I asked why they kept sending me the wrong carafe and they said that the perfect pour was discontinued in this size. I then mentioned to Amazon that they might want to remove that part of the description, but they have not 
 I recently decided to become vegetarian, so I got this book to read. I was very disapointed. I think this book provides good information about nutrional and meals, yet is written in a boring, scientific way. This book may appeal more to parents of vegetarians and vegans and adult vegetarians, than to teenagers. This book contains a lot of recipies, and some of them sound good, but most of them are far more complex than a teenager would be willing to cook. I would reccomend this book to parents of teenage vegetarians, but there are better books written for the teens themself. This book also has so many negative quotes including a whole page of someone making fun of vegetarian food and rambling about how they hate tofu. I don't think these are nessecary in a book for vegetarians, there is enough of that without reading about it. However, if you seriously want to research about being a vegetarian this book won't hurt, it is just a dissapointment 
 Thank goodness this book is finally obsolete.  It thrills me to know that this worm will no longer cash on the misery of the fans of the team he claims to root for.  Did Mr. Shaughnessy disappear in a puff of smoke when the final out the World Series was recorded 
 This book is good if you want to take years fixing your dogs problems and avoid every problem until then.  I personally can't avoid every 'unperfect' dog until then.  It goes over desentization (not rocket science) but doesn't give any good answers to what to do when your dog is having issues.  I'm not a fan of the 'just run the other direction' theory.  It's not good if you want to actually address your problem and avoids the topic of when it's puppy-ness or real aggression concerns 
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 Don't waste your time on this drivel.  This writer has unjustly thrived over the years consistently raking up false malicious muck on the Fabs. True Beatles scholars know Giuliano for what he is - he was despised by George Harrison and I'm sure Paul feels the same way.  
 I purchased this product partially on the recommendation of consumer reports.  Looking back, I would have gone further and NOT bought it.  The iPOD interface is poor at best and the speaker setup via the front menu/remote usage is difficul

 As a general practitioner, I don't recommend this book for professionals who want to improve in advanced knowledge in physiology. It is a STARTER book on the theme, for medical students only, not for practicising doctors.  I've got frustrated 
 Being a fan of such authors as J.R.R. Tolkien, H.G. Wells, and C.S. Lewis, I figured I'd try and broaden my horizons by reading a book about the American West, a sort of historical fiction that might be entertaining. I did some research and Cormac McCarthy seemed to be the author to start with.  He got very good reviews (from this site and professional critics).  I find it amazing that he received such great reviews... this book failed to impress me in the slightest bit.  The book seemed to fly away from the plot for a while and suddenly, unexpectedly return to it.  I have never read a book like that before.  After completing this book I had found out more about the life of a prostitute than I ever wanted to know and also I received a free lesson in swearing.  I understand that it was custom in the West to swear, and dealings with prostitutes was common, but I think McCarthy went over the top.  This made it uninteresting and redundant.  Then there was the fact that he rarely used punctuation other than periods, question marks, and exclamation marks.  I did not see a single quotation mark and the word "and" was excessevely overused due to the exclusion of commas.  Dialogue was at times hard to follow and seemingly run-on sentences were monotonous.  After reading this book I also felt ignorant being uneducated in the Spanish language.  Much of the dialogue I could not understand in the least bit.  There were entire conversations written exclusively in Spanish at times when it seemed relevant.  I felt like I missed a lot of important information in the story. I did find that at time McCarthy did use some beautifully crafted language but the formerly mentioned factors left a very bad impression on me.  I don't suppose I'll ever read a book by Cormac McCarthy again 
 Because I like faster music with a beat that makes me tap a foot, I only liked the cut "Lucky To Know You."  "Seeing Through You" is all right, too.  Perhaps Reynolds will independently release a CD of his own with more songs like "Lucky To Know You."

 I stopped reading Ludlum stories years ago, as I found his books to be so similar to each other as to make them boring.  I also had to deal with a regular feeling of deja vu... didn't I read this passage before, or, this setting or person seems familiar. Those issues did not creep into my reading of this book with great frequency, most likely because I kept thinking, "There is NO way he'll get out of this" or "That would never happen."  I realize that reading a good novel, and especially a "spy" novel requires a fair amount of suspension of belief.  However, this one passed those limits 
 I was very disappointed with the images produced by this camera. I had hoped the ultra-wide photos (which was my main reason for going with this camera) also would be ultra sharp, but instead they tended to be soft. The camera has a lag time of about 1/10th of a second, so it's more of a point, shoot and wait camera.   The V705 may be okay for posting internet images or enlarging to small prints, but don't expect the sharpness typical of better quality cameras. In my opinion, the camera squeezes too much out of a JPEG photo by way of compression and shooting TIF files just isn't practical.  I demand better image quality from my cameras and, when zooming in, I like to see detail. I certainly don't like everything going soft.   
 I  did not completely read the book because I became so exasperated with the book and the author that I quit. The author's continuous praise for a certain software product and his severe criticism of other software used by the author makes one wonder about the relationship between the author and the commercial owner of the praised software. The author even alluded to the non-praised software as possibly being available in a pirated edition. Conversely, the author cautions the reader about copyright law when discussing the praised software. The author is very enamored with himself, and it detracts from the book. The book is unnecessarily verbose and poorly edited.  I was very disappointed, as I was looking for a *how-to-do-it book,* and this book is not suitable for that purpose. Of more concern is the cost of the book's recommended products, which are necessary in order to follow the author. The software products used by the author are commercial and range in cost from less than $100 to a lot more than $100. The reader will spend several hundred dollars on commercial software and other products (Microsoft DDK) if the reader gets the items discussed and recommended by the author. I don't dispute the quality of the products, just the cost of them in addition to the price of the book. There are some errors. For example, the author says Microsoft DDK is free, and yet it has cost about $100 for several years. It would be very expensive to buy the author's suggested products in order to follow the author while reading the book. A CD with source code is included, but without the software its value is diminished. I am sure others will have better experiences, but I cannot recommend the book.

 This is a 12-page promotional piece for Kouzes' and Posner's books and Leadership Practices Inventory, a 30-item questionnaire about leadership, written in the breathy style of business-school literature.  A true non-value.  If you are interested in their work, buy The leadership Challenge (Jossey-Bass, 1997), which has the same editorial tone but at least says something 
 Anyone giving a four star review to this is kidding themselves. Its a total dog's breakfast. I'm a Dylan fanatic. I love all but the bottom two or three albums of his catalogue, which I consider Planet Waves to be among. The song-writing is half-baked: the lyrics aren't profound, they're cobbled hurrily together. The Band just aren't tight. They're not playing together. Each song is like a drunken person stumbling: you keep thinking they're going to fall over, and they try really hard to hold themselves together but it doesn't really work. That's the truth about Planet Waves, like no-one else here'll tell you.  doesn't do justice to the album's enduring track Forever Young 
 I really love the genre of memoire, and I do read a lot of them.  This book, however, failed to meet its mark with my on several accounts.  I felt that her spiral into addiction was really self indulgant at times, and that it just led to nothing for the book.  I think, really, this would be a much better short story than a book.  Her beautiful, yet redundant writing, about how long her addiction lasted, the brothals she served, her views about it, really made me wonder what the author wanted the reader to carry away from this.  I think that is the really self indulgant bulk of the story.  Maybe if there were more of a resolution at the end, it would make up for all of the beautiful gore she presents the reader.  I doubt it though.  Frankly, I'd have liked to know more about her loving family that really helped her and stood by her throught all her trials.  I think a memoire from their point of view would be more productive.  I felt mostly sickened by this sad account of herion addiction and sprial and love affair with prostitution.    If this would keep a person from trying herione, then it's worth that.  But as a well rounded, quality memoire, there are so many better than this that have more to offer. 
 The publisher should be convinced that the automatic spell checker should not be so heavily relied upon.  The cover art is an expression of how an armchair graphic artist can be innovative with Photoshop.  If a book of such high esteem be put out for public enrichment its presentation should not be so insincere

 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 I have always liked R. Kelly's music.  When he produced "Trapped in the Closet", I thought it was a joke.  This is one of the stupidest, corniest, and blandest song I heard. 
 I wish I hadn't bought this book. It's a reminder for me to not judge a book by its flashy/attractive cover. The book is overwhelming and not as organized as I would have liked. I wish that it would say how long each activity takes and, far more importantly, difficulty/skill/recommended age levels. It really is taking too much time going through the book and having to reject so many of the activities because they are clearly not age-appropriate for my young children. This book is really geared for older children 
 In Hollywood films, kids are mean. They tell their siblings to drop-dead, roll their eyes at dumb-old-dad, barf all over the floor and run away, and always seem to have a snarky come-back for every situation. They are cynical, jaded, suspicious, and  totally lacking in innocence; they represent the worst aspects of adulthood.  In my opinion, films like this are like extended sit-coms - although most sit-coms are better written. My family was quite stunned by how nasty everyone was; there wasn't a kind moment anywhere except in the last 5 minutes, when syrupy-violins prompt us to recall how much they really "love eachother". If you want to see a film where kids act and talk like real kids, try to get your hands on a British film called "Melody", made in the early 1970's. It'll knock your socks off. 
 Someone should actually read this book before reviewing it. Like Bill Gates, Popcorn is as wrong as she is right. Visionary? I'll tell you who the visionary is: Ted Nelson, not Faith. Cocooning? It never actually  happened as Popcorn describes it 
 Richard is a funny guy. He never can overcome his SCIENTISM and naturalistic reductionism. I wish I could talk to him to help him out (if I were doctor). He needs (1) therapy and (2) to THINK a little more... Dawkins like to use straw-man arguments and does NOT know anything about Christian Theology. I'm truly Sorry for him when he embarases himself with poor representation of something he know nothing about (when talks about religious matters, or even science).  I have also read his article "Science is not a religion" (which is not very good article), and apparently FOR HIM science is a religion...  Usually religious experience involve (a) awareness of the Transcendent and (b) total commitment to It. Dawkins' Transcendant is "THE GREAT SCIENTISM". :D and of course he is commited to it. Not the science, but scientism... Otherwise why would he go around with his naturalistic dogmatism?  
 When I first learned about this book, I was more than excited that someone had finally written book about high school hockey. I had already read the great accounts of high school sports in Friday Night Lights, and In These Girls, Hope Is A Muscle. Thirty pages into the book, I was more than impressed with the author's beautiful descriptions of Methuen, hockey, and his growing up in this area of New England.  Suddenly, things began to change, as I was now embedded in the author's autobiography of his past hockey and athletic exploits! He makes a very clear statement in the beginning that he doesn't want to be back in his high school years, but simply remember them. Oh, he does remember everthing and anything, and certainly lets the reader know of his dauntless exploits. Who really cares how many goals he scored on a frozen pond playing against a bunch of kids, or popping in nine goals in a pickup game with a senior group pretty much out of shape, or being one of the three stars in the annual JV intersquad scrimmage! Give me a break.   Atkinson managed to work his way into his old high school with the pretense of collecting background for his book. What he did was to live vicariously through this new Ranger team and maybe better his own team record of 5-15-1. He committed the inexcusable error of a writer; allowing your own life to intermingle and become part of what you were trying to write about.  As for the team, too bad Atkinson created an almost Neanderthal mentality and impression of these boys. The naive reader might think this is what hockey is all about, but what a terrible injustice to a group of athletes. As for the coaches, between the locker room expletives, bench outbursts during games, and the pre-game talks about "mating sperm whales" with your female goalie standing in the doorway, I feel this is a reasonable estimate of inappropiate juvenile behavior and thinking with some of the Methuen coaching staff.   At the end, as I struggled to finish his "memoirs," I had to laugh at his mention that he didn't feel quite the same and welcomed going back to Methuen High School after his year. They were probably happy he was finally gone. Typical of "volunteer" coaches or staff, their impression of what they are doing and accomplishing is usually far from reality. The author may have felt he was imparting "words of wisdom," and valuable pieces of experience to members of the team, but Mr. Bobb you really missed the target here. A sixteen, seventeen year-old boy barely hears the words of his parents, much less his teachers, and certainly nothing from a 42 year-old "want-to-be."  If you know anything about high school sports, and/or hockey, save yourself from this self-indulging book. Oh, by the way, why can I be so critical? I have just finished my 34th season coaching high school hockey, ninety-percent of it as a head varsity coach. Along with this, twenty-five years as a head varsity coach in two female sports, and thirty-six years as a high school classroom teacher have all allowed me to see just about everything. In my career, the players and teams of the past are in the books. Next season, all the pages start to be written again. 
 I purchased this vcr/dvd based on the fact that it wasn't the most expensive one and it wasn't the cheapest either.  As soon as I took it out of the box I was unhappy.  It is a featherweight.  It does not play any of my VHS tapes that I had previously taped on my old VCR.  The tracking is off and you can't fix it manually.  I dislike the remote - the control buttons for which unit you are controlling are hard to find - buried in the middle of the all the buttons.  There is no volume control or easily identifiable tracking buttons on the remote. The stop button is also the rewind button, and it kept doing the opposite of what I was trying to make it do.  The channel changing number buttons are small and not easy to use because of their low position on the remote.  Overall I was quite unhappy with my purchase and am taking it back to the store 
 This was the first book I had ever read by this author, and I can sincerely state I will not read another.  The way the characters described what the others were doing in conversation was ridiculous. No one - and no one, speaks that way. It made the story feel rushed and stilted, and I am sad to say, much of the humor was lost on me. Something funny being told to you is not as funny as witnessing it. I felt the situations would have been much humorous if she described what was happening instead of having her characters describe it in their dialogues. I found it offensive that the women were protrayed by the men as being silly (something that made me wonder what it was exactly the men saw in them other then the prospect of having sex with them), and the abuse situations Ms. Coulter touched on, then so neatly wrapped up with two of the characters being so heroic was disgusting. She should have never touched on such deep subjects and solved them with MORE physical violence. The conclusion to this still very real problem rubbed me completely the wrong way. If she was trying to make a social statement on the issue - she failed....miserably. Reading this book was an utter loss of time. Don't bother 
 Ms Gunst is not bad as a storyteller and this book might have made a good novel. But after talking to some people she 'interviewed' and hearing how she twisted their words, I don't think it is worth very much as a work of history 
 Okay, I'm a sucker for a good sob story that pulls at the heartstrings. Unfortunately, this didn't do it. I own many of the Chicken Soup books and this one in particular had the potential for hitting the zenith of Chicken-Soup-ish-ness. But the stories seemed fake, not particularly heartwarming, and contrived. 
 Somone those who really planning about this business category can not get a ace help from this book. This book don't mention about real business set up steps with local government and state who belonged.  It can't be a bonus  to someone like you who is a beginner for the business of this. If your  need a tips for the business relationships between human, you can buy it  without wastage of money. If not, it can be a little loss 
 I really wish this book did not have so many grammatical errors because I believe people need to simplify their life, but this book insults the reader's intelligence.  If a well-respected author like Jack Trout is going to attach his name to a piece of writing he should make sure it is readable.  In addition, this book seems to be choppy in its central theme.  I do not remember the authors addressing the idea of simplicity throughout the whole book.  The central concept was lost somewhere among Jack Trout's tirades to the business professional. 
 This book isn't worth the money.  I bought it for my daughter who told me it was worthless.  I was upset at her attitude but then read it myself.  Sadly she was correct, if a bit ungrateful 
 I am an experienced computer user, and I bought this primarily on my previous experince with Symantec products, which had been good.  My experience with this product was unfortunately, very poor.  First - the product claims to be able to clone your boot partition, but this failed repeatedly, creating cloned partitions which were not bootable.    Second - Tech support failed to provide an answer for days while I eventually figured out myself that I needed to use the bootable media to make a clone of my system disk - something the windows application was happy to try and fail at without warning.  Even when I attempted to provide this information to tech support so they could answer similar questions for others, they didn't get what I was saying and sent me another form letter response detailing how to make a copy (instructions which failed of course).  Third - On another occasion, even using the bootable media, I got the error "1517" when attempting to clone by boot partition.  Searching the web revealed others having this problem, and Symantec tech support full of bogus solutions for it.  Fourth - no support for USB/Firewire drives with the bootable media.  On the plus side - it did resize partitions I asked it to without trouble (I give it one extra star for something working) 
 shocking but true. i'm a die-hard matrix fan who has read every book written on the movies. journey did have its merit -- being the only matrix book to take on the symbolic significance of explaining why the humans can talk on cell phones, but need a hard line to exit the matrix. nevertheless, something remains missing from this book: the author's pride.   dr challiyil isnt taking any profit from this book, deflecting all funds to his charitable foundation. good for him. but that is no excuse for such a piss-poor presentation as rampant misspellings, irregularities in the spacing and several contradictions of the plot.  it is as if he said: i'm a nobel winner. there's a big matrix audience. if i spend all of two weeks writing a pseudo book i'll make some money for my cause and do some good. who cares if it's accurate or presentable? i'll have fun and that's that.   the book reads like a long blog.  welcome to the desert of the spell-check 
 I don't own this model (super taper II), but another one I bought from Sears.  The one I have is JUNK: (1)  very heavy (2)  super noisy and vibrate like hell (3)  jam very easily, have to clean all the time DURING hair cut  I stay away from this manufacturer !!!  
 Excellent book, especially for a first time dog owner.. 
 I read Cameron Crowe's book a couple years ago, and it is head-and-shoulders above this.  What Charlotte essentially does in this "personal" biography is string together a long series of celebrity interviews into one barely coherent narrative.  One gets the distinct impression it was far more important for Charlotte to "get to know" these interview subjects than it was for her to write this book.  What makes me think that?  Perhaps it's the photos of Charlotte and several of her interviewees sprinkled throughout this book.  On the whole, "personal" seems to be shorthand for "lazy. 
 This book is full of lies, written by people who have no idea what they are talking about. I would recomend that they actually visit this country before they speak about it 
 I am a fan of Tanya Huff and the series of books with HEnry and Victoria.  But this one is not it.  While Henry is there he is such a minor character. The main character is Tony Foster a homosexual street kid who tanya should have left on the street.  I was totally bored and read the book through because I was hoping it would get better, then i was happy when it was over.  The plot idea was great, but it was not developed well and left me wanting for something more.  I was expecting Henry to be a major player like he was with Victoria, but no, he is relegated to Tony's homosexual vampire lover who helps Tony out.   Disappointing. Dull.  I won't read the rest of this series, The Tony Foster series. Hey, Tanya, how about a series of Henry Fitzroy, I would read that 
 I owned Samsung T809 months ago and I was very frustrated because the bluetooth doesn't work well, sometimes it has connection (bluetooth) but most of the time it doesn't work.  Yeah! it's a good looking cellphone but not a friendly user one. 
 I have owned this camera for ~6 months and have finally deciced to replace it. I bought this camera to replace another Nikon CoolPix that was stolen from my house. But this one does not have a view finder to begin with and is way more complicated to use. I have always liked Nikon cameras but the S9 just doesn't make it. I can not use it outside because I can not see the LCD screen. Sorry Nikon but you blew it on this camera!! So I replaced it with a Canon PowerShot A710. What a difference in ease of use and... it has a view finder. also my 1G memory card from rhe Nikon fots in the new Canon. 
 This book is a major disappointment from beginning to end. It starts out promisingly enough with a vampire convocation to be held under Jean Claude's auspices and a mysterious vampire ballet production company scheduled to appear. That's where it ends. From there it descends into a series of fairly poorly written sex scenes as Anita, presumably controlled by the "ardeur" hops from bed to bed, as well as floor couch and any other object that happens to be handy. There are some teasers along the way - a Master Vampire and his mermaid wife make a start at some sort of power play, the human and were servants of another Master Vampire enter and exit, etc. - but nothing ever comes of any of them. In the final chapter there is a power play by the vampire leader of the   ballet company but it is all squashed into one short final chapter and pretty well left hanging.  I did not buy this book - for which I am grateful. Even at paperback prices, it is not worth the money. If you must read it, see if the library has a copy 
 Matheson has written three great novels, "The Incredible Shrinking Man," "I Am Legend" and "Hell House" and countless first-rate short stories. I count myself as one of his biggest fans.   His recent output, however, including "7 Steps to Midnight," "Now You See It" and this book, "Hunted Past Reason," is dismal. While his storytelling gift remains undimmed his writing--well, it's as if he's forgotten how. I can't believe that "Hunted Past Reason" would have made it past the slush pile if his name weren't attached to it.  All the negative critiques of "Hunted Past Reason" posted here are valid and I won't repeat them, except to emphasize just how unbelievably offensive and howlingly amateurish the rape/sodomy scene is. (You really have to read it yourself to believe it; in its way, it's an outrageous camp classic. I would quote from the book itself but I'm afraid it wouldn't pass the censors.)  But I must give a few mechanical illustrations of Matheson's recent decline, a few examples of his newly-developed awkwardness, particularly, and especially, when trying to convey the inner workings of his characters' minds (it's as if he's forgotten the value of conveying his characters' thoughts with simple italics):  "To hell with it, he told himself. He'd keep going as long as he could. What am I, a wimp? he challenged himself. Undoubtedly, he thought, but I'm going to fight it."  "Dont! a voice cried in his brain."  "Oh, shut up! he commanded himself."  "Oh, shut up, he told himself."  "Oh, shut up! he ordered himself angrily."  "His brain reacted with unexpected irritation."  "Just keep going, will you, Hansen? he suggested. Yes, by all means, he replied politely to himself."  "All right, think, he thought; think, you moron."  "Well, for Christ's sake, make up your mind! he ordered himself."  "...his brain screamed."  Such inexcusable, creative-writing-101 stylistics are on nearly every page.  The emporor is not only not wearing any clothes, his wagging his naked hips. Mr. Matheson, how could you? What's happened 
 This book may provide some info to the totally ignorant snapper, but any decent amateur already knows these things. Moreover many concepts are not even clearly explained, and all the photos are rarely linked to the text. The useful info could have been enclosed in 20 pages booklet! As an outstanding example of superficiality, 90% of featured photos are digital, and no consideration is due to the choice of film (while portraiture often requires medium and large format films)

 Even with the questionable veracity, I enjoyed Frey's first book, A Million Little Pieces, since it stayed true to an addict's experience.  Leonard, on the other hand, came off as pure fantasy, with very little substance.  Even the description of Frey's struggle was too contrived to be believable.  It was not even interesting as fiction. 
 As usual some italians never miss a chance to complain and bash about things they either don't have or don't understand. Clearly the author has been living in the stone age far too long. What does he mean with "How many people have actually ever bought an airline ticket over the internet?". Probably every single person I know! Or "How many people have actually ever sent data over the internet?". Practically the entire US population! His observations are not only shallow and over analyzed, most of them are just not accurate. Further, he fails to capture the true underlying issues embedded in the American way of life. The social and cultural issues that are ripping this country apart. A very poor analysis of non-issues that are, for the most part, just a result of his ignorance. His arrogance. Money NOT well spent I must say. P.S. I am an Italian living in the US 
 I have not heard the entire album, but three songs that have gotten a lot of airplay in metro-NYC: Charlie last name wilson, I can do magic, and Don't say a word. From what I gather this is a R. Kelly produced and written album. Let's begin with "Charlie, last name wilson". Is this a song or a calling card? I guess R. Kellys' got plenty in the bank because this is tune won't get any future covers!! " I Can do Magic" is just plain tragic bereft of melody and I've heard better lyrical structure on Seasame Street Tunes. As for "Don't say a word" there is a section with the phrase "word,word,word". Somebody definitely stole the melody to this one.  As for the production, it seems that for the most part a producer in what's currently called R&B has been reduced to a person who can adequatley operate a keyboard based sequencer. Lastly I am certain that if you listen to bulk of R. KELLYS' songwriting from his first radio hit (Honey Love) to the present Charlie Wilson, and Ronald Isley garbage, you too will agree that the title of his next big hit should be "I Believe I Can Write A Song"

 Wow. Good thing I didn't buy this book.  Looking at all these reviews there seems to be two catagories of people who rate this book.  The normal people catagory and the bling bling people who cash in on this book only to recommend their own books. And when you look at their profiles and see what books they have reviewed it's very little. It's obvious people want to cash in the name of the books ("Men are from Mars....)  One reviewer talks about his sex drive being improved then recommends his own book.  Seriously, shut up.  We live in a society where sex sells and the idea of if you want to be beautiful you have to get this book.  Don't be fooled. This book is BS and you will feel bad because another diet didn't work.  There are better diet books out there. John Gray is just trying to cash in in the weight loss craze just like Dr. Phil.  AND if you truly want to lose weight and need discipline weight watchers is great. If you are reading this you are a smart consumer don't invest in this poser, wanna be diet book. 
 This is one of the most boring books I have ever read 
 If you are looking for a good movie to buy for your child, pass on this one. This movie has so many drug references, i can't even begin to explain.(trust me, I just so happen to have taken acid before) This is a movie that NEVER should have been directed toward children.        If you want your child to be drug free when he/she grows up, do not buy this 
 I'm shocked to see that these books are still selling today.  I had this exact book when I was little, and my mother brought the old copy to me cause she thought my daughter might like to have it.  I don't think I'm going to bother giving it to her.  I was frightened by this book when I was little.  Mother Goose looks more like a wicked witch, stealing a baby, on the cover.  There are tons of nursery rhymes, but most of them are very obscure, some only a couple lines long.  And maybe I am reading too much into them, but a lot of them seem full of sexual innuendo and possible drug references.  One titled "Robin and Richard" seems the most questionable, about two grown men staying in bed until 10 o'clock.  I'm not prejudiced at all, but this seems like a very strange rhyme for children to be reading.  Everything about this book is disturbing to me.  
 I'm usually a Clark's fan, and own several pairs, but for some reason these shoes are not as "true to fit" as Amazon claims. I could not get my size 9 feet into this 9 1/2 sized shoe. It's possible that I received a defective product, but you may want to consider this before making your size selection, or check other shoe sites for similar comments. Good Luck 
  . . . and more nonsense.  Like I've stated in previous reviews, the only reason I read any of this c**p is because as a professional Christian educator and theologian, questions about stuff like this come up far more often than I would like -- and I've gotta have my ammo ready.  Here we go again:  Dispensational pre-millinalism, which is the theology presented in the book as "authentic" Christianity, was invented out of whole cloth in the mid 19th century.  This is not the faith of the Apostles.  This is not the faith of the Early Church (East or West).  This is not the faith of the Reformers.  Luther and Calvin would have rejected this.  This is not the faith of the Great Awakening.  Wesley and Whitfield would have rejected this.  Even in Protestantism, this represents a minority "out there" viewpoint.  A non-Christian who picks up one of these books and believes that it represents mainstream Christianity will be grossly deceived.  This is not honest theology; this is not honest biblical interpretation; and the writing is horrible to boot 
 The country music crowd built the Chicks up, then they went to England and showed their true side.  As a result country music lovers, true to their country, turned on the Chicks; so now the Chicks say that their music isn't country.  I say that their music isn't music but it just noise 
 I have read this book, because I am interested in the history of modern windmills, however I find it to be very disappointing for many reason. First of all, this book lacks structure and coherence. It is a collection of notes on 'windmills' that are not coherently structured. The book does not follow a chronological order, and there is no logical transition betwen the different sections of a chapter, or the various chapters. Secondly, several chapters of the book are off topic. For example, in one chapter Asmus describres the social atmosphere of a biker's gathering, with details about the origins of the biker movement... that is fine, except for the fact that the only reference to windmill the chapter makes, is to mention that the famous biker's bar where bikers in south california have met for decades is located near a wind farm. Thirdly, the book is not very informative about windmills.  Peter Asmus has a few facts about windmills scattedred throughtout the numerous chapters of the book. After having completed the book I acquired lots of factual information on a variety of topics BUT windmills. Overall this book is poor and I do not recommend it 
 The most sensational claim Evans makes is that Aristotle Onassis indirectly paid for RFK's murder.His 'proof' is shockingly inadequate.  Central to Evans's thesis are entries in Sirhan's notebooks which purportedly connected Aristotle Onassis to the assassin. Evans alleges Sirhan's notebooks make reference to Alexander Onassis's girlfriend Fiona, whom his father detested, and Stavros Niarchos, his shipping rival, whom he also hated.   However, Evans's juxtaposition of names to prove Sirhan wrote about killing Onassis's enemies is misleading. Sirhan had placed the name FIONA in a list of racehorse names - Fiona, Jet-Spec, Kings Abbey and Prince Khaled. The Arabic script consists of one sentence "He should be killed" (not "They should be killed" as Evans alleges) and does not refer to either Niarkos or Fiona.   The diary entry "Niarkos" remains unexplained, as do many other entries in Sirhan's notebooks, but there is no indication it refers to anyone on a Sirhan 'Death List'. The words in Sirhan's notebooks were the result of simple stream-of-consciousness ramblings he learned from Rosicrucian literature as ways to improve his life. The notebooks are filled with names of people Sirhan knew - Bert Altfillisch, Peggy Osterkamp and Gwen Gum for example, and people he didn't know like Garner Ted Armstrong. The entries which refer to $100,000 were simply Sirhan's obsessions about wealth and appear a number of times in the notebooks.   Also central to Evans's thesis was the implication that Sirhan had spent a three month period before the assassination being trained by terrorists or undergoing hypnotic indoctrination. Evans was wrong in stating Sirhan's movements were unaccounted for, or "a blanket of white fog" as he put it. Sirhan's movements in the months prior to the assassination leave no unaccountable period when the assassin could have spent a considerable amount of time being "hypnotically indoctrinated." In the year preceding the assassination Sirhan was seen frequently in the Hi-Life bar in Pasadena by waitress Marilyn Hunt.He was also seen in Shap's Bar during this period. In July 1967 Sirhan filed a disability complaint for workmen's compensation. Between July and September 1967 Sirhan's mother and brother Munir said Sirhan went often to the Pasadena library.Library records confirm he borrowed books during the so-called 'white fog' period. Sirhan's mother said her son `..stayed at home for over a year (sic) with no job'(October 1966 to September 1967). Sirhan, by his mother's account, often drove her to work during the time he was unemployed. On 9th September 1967 Sirhan began work at John Weidner's health food store.Weidner reported no long periods of absence up to the time Sirhan left his employ in March 1968. So how did Sirhan `emerge(ed) from this `white fog' in March 1968, (and) joined the (Rosicrucians)' as Evans states? (Author's note: Sirhan actually joined the Rosicrucians in June 1966.) And, as I point out in my review of Evans' book in Crime Magazine, (http://crimemagazine.com/05/robertkennedy,0508-5.htm ), Sirhan's movements in the three month period before the assassination leave no time unaccounted for.  Dominick Dunne is wrong - this book will not change history 
 The actors spend too much time just staring at each other without speaking. The story is too unbelievable too. It was a waste of my money to buy it. 
 A couple of the pieces were okay, but the CD is not worth the money.  And PF himself is not worth the $$$ to see.  He has gotten too big for his britches over the years and has turned his back on his following.  
 There is a prophet on the earth today as there has been in other dispensations and Walsch hasn't taken the time to meet him. The scriptures have all the information we need and if anyone put in as much effort as they do into reading this unenlightened book into reading the truth, they would be much happier then this book could get you 
 I knew I was in trouble with FOUR BROTHERS when I saw that Josh Howard (of SPORTS NIGHT fame) was scowling hard, trying to be a tough Detroit cop. Not believable for a nanosecond. And then it got worse when Marky Mark said, "Why don't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee?"  The rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clich√Ø¬ø¬Ωd rhythm. Almost every scene in this thing is a howler. And watching it, I remembered I hadn't forgiven Tyrese Gibson for the travesty that was 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS. Still, Tyrese is better than Garrett Hedlund, who looks like he's a refugee from THE OUTSIDERS.  But the movie's not a total wash; after all, it's got a GREAT soundtrack 
 I can't fathom why anyone would enjoy this album. The lyrics must have come out of a Dadaist poetry circle, and (most of) the guitar work is completely without personality.  What is the criterion of a good rock album? By any standards it must be a joy to play it. 6teen Stone misses the mark by such dimensions one must assume it was intentional. But it doesn't so much incite anger than it does disdain for Bush's attempts to emulate Nirvana. Where Nirvana has clearly enunciated guitar riffs and minimalist, evocative lyrics, Bush has dull, throbbing guitar drones that project nothing to the listener but a kind of malaise-inspired anger.  There's not much more to say about 6teen Stone. I could tell you about the embarrassment of listening to the lyrics on songs like "Swim": Thinning ice / 14 Hairdryers / Swimming to you / Flame on earth desire." Or the artistic suicide of the last track, "X-Girlfriend", a song composed of a little guitar-wailing and a non-stop chorus that's about six words long.  That's about all I can tell you. Mostly I figure I've done enough warning to let you make your own choice. If you do attempt this though, you ought to be told the little good news that there is: there are about 5 minutes of good music are contained on the album, split between "Machinehead" and "Glycerine." The first is an energetic, well-constructed song about control (you might have seen the music video for it about 11 years ago on Total Request Live), the second a serenade featuring over-dubbed guitars, a trembling cello, and a surprisingly coherent Rossdale. They hold the album; about as well as a couple of floor joists can hold a crumbling building. 
 Obviously Amazon thinks that it's customers can read but not do math! This is the most inane offer yet!!

 The author advances that cities either thrive or die based on three variables: 1) their sacredness; 2) their safety; and 3) commerce.  Sacredness seems like a very questionable driver of a city's success.  Is Jerusalem or Mecca ever likely to be a more successful city than Dallas or Seattle?  Unlikely.  Also, safety does not seem like a differentiating variable but more like a necessity for a city.  It is like saying you need to speak English to be a successful student at Harvard.  You need a lot more than that.  So, does a city need a lot more than to be safe to become a successful city.  Finally, the third variable, commerce, is self-evident and appears the only valid one out of the three mentioned variables.    The present and future of a city most probably depend on a number of variables not well detailed by the author including:   1) Fiscal condition, or does a city has a healthy and growing tax revenue base that can suffice to cover its related cost of delivering public services and running city government?   2) Quality of municipal services including transportation, and most importantly education.  For a city to thrive, it needs to deliver very strong secondary and post secondary educational services.  3) An innovative business and cultural environment.  Is the city a nest of creativity resulting in a high rate of innovation within commerce, but also the arts, and other domain?  Does the city develop other related competitive edges associated with specialized network of professionals?  New York benefits a great deal from the huge human capital concentrated in "Wall Street."  San Francisco and San Jose benefit greatly from being within close reach of both Silicon Valley and venture capitalists  4) A strategic location.  Is the city located at a gateway of domestic or international trading routes?  Is it located near a coast, an airport, and a major harbor so it is quickly accessible from around the World?   5) A strategic virtual location.  How connected is the city?  Does its information infrastructure measure up to other World-class cities?   6) Economic demographics of its residents.  What is the educational level and per capita income of its residents?  What is the level of homeownership? Business ownership?   Obviously, many of these variables are interconnected.  And, many are associated with what the author calls commerce.  However, he did not drill down on many of these related variables.  Even though such variables would allow you to truly differentiate in a statistically meaningful and analytically insightful way between cities.    Meanwhile, the author offers just vague platitude devoid of much insight on the subject.  The model he proposes based on his three variables explains a bit about distant history, but much less about the future.   This book was especially disappointing given that the same author has written one of the most original and insightful books I have read.  Indeed, back in 1994 he wrote an excellent book called "Tribes" that does an excellent job of differentiating the culture and behavior of many of the World's most interesting clans or ethnic groups.  He also maps out what such cultural and behavioral features entail in terms of the present and future success of these different demographic clans (clustered by either religion, race, or nationality).  Thus, the author was able to deliver much insight about the various clans of the human race.  Unfortunately, he delivered nearly none regarding cities.  Thus, I strongly recommend you skip "The City" and read "Tribes" instead.              
 This is NOT a high-end luxury towel by Grand Patrician and is not ultra in ANY way. Even if they were firsts, they are second rate. Mine started to self-destruct after the first wash, and never had the absorbency of a wet dish rag.  Am disappointed Amazon would carry this product, which would be a bad deal at half the price. Next time I will look for more reviews 
 Although the CD covers a lot of Beethoven's music, the piano player in the first seven tracks is horrible.  He or she keeps hitting the wrong notes.  The tempo of the music overall is too fast and for some reason, they stopped "Ode to Joy" right in the middle. If you want a CD that features excellent musicians and Beethoven's music played the way it should be, don't buy this CD. Invest in the soundtrack from the movie, "Immortal Beloved" 
 My setup should have been super simple. (It was super simple for my old Airport Extreme) Mac G4 Desktop without an internal Airport card and an Airport Express. My simple goal was to send iTunes to my stereo via an Airport Express.  After five hours of trying to get it working myself, I called AppleCare. After an hour on the phone with AppleCare, we finally got my Extreme to link up with my Express. We had to do three hard resets on my Express. We had to temporarily hardwire the Express to the Extreme with an Ethernet cable. Moreover, we had to manually copy and paste the Airport ID number from one unit to the other. This procedure was NOT in the owner's manual or in Apple's online self help! I have been using Macs at home for 21 years and this is the biggest headache that I have ever experienced in the world of Apple Macintosh.  I think that the PC Guy on the Apple commercials got the last laugh on this one. 
 Barbara Caruso is a very minor Broadway actress.  A book of this caliber deserves the best.  The publisher should have stopped pinching pennies and hired Marian Seldes, a true Broadway star 
 The title speaks for itself.  I don't know how or why I was drawn to this magazine when I was 14. This magazine should be called J-4tweens. Ah. The title is very annoying. Like Twist, I only get this magazine when I'm really really desperate for something to read. I sure as hell wouldn't want my 12 year old daughter to wear mascara. If you have a tween and you want her to grow to become a pimpstress, get this. The only entertaining aspect of this magazine is the embarassing moments kinds of things (but of course). Other than that, no. They feature pretty bland fashion. All in all, this magazine is JUST like Twist. Therefore, the age reccomendation is just 11 & 12, but you're better off getting GL for even more years worth of goodness (10-15 yrs.) because no, it's NOT cool to steal your sister's damn boyfriend for pete's sake 
 This is the OLD tape....meaning that there isn't a crease in the back so that you can "crack" it open and take off the protective covering so that you can stick it onto something and actually lable it!!  It is very frustrating.  Very.  The newer version of the tape, of course, has this feature.  Be carefu 
  There is something about "Fountainhead" that irritated and disappointed  me, so I would stop reading and come back to it again. At some point, I just gave up thinking about the philosophical aspect of the novel  and tried to enjoy it as a piece of literature. What can I say? I  understand with my mind the ideas about the purpose of human  beings to be free and follow their own unique way in pursuit of happiness  and full realization of their talents and abilities. I also find very attractive the idea of always being true to yourself and  to your trade no matter what and to never compromise your principles and never betray yourself. Yes, I  understand that completely but the main character, Howard Roark, who supposed to be a hero  and an ideal Man left me indifferent. Well, he is not a human being, really,  more like Titan (Prometheus would come to mind), but he is cold as ice. He  does not care about anybody or at least he is doing a very good job in  hiding the human emotions. The love story in the novel is repulsive and sickening. The female character, Dominique, looks like a cold frigid doll that is not able to feel love unless it goes together  with hate and domination. Why do they have to be so unhappy and make me, the reader so miserable?    The only character who I think is  very interesting, Gail Waynad - the  man who was able to learn everything he knew by himself with no help from  outside whatsoever, the man who named his beloved yacht "I Do" because he  does rule places and has a right to say so.   2.5/5  
 A friend recommended this book to me when I became pregnant.  I really cannot recommend anybody to buy this book if you want to get a realistic idea of what pregnancy is going to be.  If you follow her advice to not work out anymore and eat for two, yes, you will indeed outgrow your husbands cloths.  That was actually the end of reading for me 
 I honestly do not understand what all the hype is about.  I forced myself to read this book because all I had ever heard was how it was one of the best and most influential pieces of modern literature, but eight hours a day of manual labor would be a less tiresome task then trudging through this pile of rubbish. In all honesty, the plot is entertaining, if you can find it.  I am sure the Cliffs Notes of the LOTR are interesting and entertaining, but why anyone would want to torture themselves reading this collection is beyond me.   I read one chapter a night until I was done, and that was too grueling a task.  I constantly found my mind wondering and having to reread every page because it could not hold my attention.   You don't have to believe the hype.  This collection of books is really, really terrible and boring, and I wouldn't wish the task of reading in on my worst enemy 
 I am a HUGE Samiam fan.  Last of all my friends to pay any attention to this band in years.  Thought Astray was just so-so, with a few great songs and a lot of filler. Had a feeling that that was going to be their final record, and that it would probably be a smart move to quit while ahead.  This new record is horrible.  Recording is rough too.  Jason's voice is long gone.  Save yourself the money and buy any older record.  They are all amazing 
 I have just finished this lengthy and mundane tome. 564 pages of this author's ponderous personal philosophy,  gratuitous sexual dysfunction, constant and maddeningly self ingratiating referrals to classical music and composers, discussions on all the authors that ever walked the earth, and when finished with all the above, a good little story that could have been written with one third the pages.  As if all this were not enough, Styron pulls out every lengthy, obsolete, and arcane word that he can find with which to propel his story along. (One can imagine him, loaded with whiskey--which he freely admits to being his greatest source of inspiration--pouring over every dictionary and thesauras written in an attempt to impress the reader, or, at least the liberal East Coast intelligensia.)The end effect for the reader is a constant slowing of momentum of the narrative, in order to look up a new and confusing word every five minutes. (One does, however, come to learn what "simulacrum" means; he uses the word some 15 or more times throughout this laborious read.)  I will not go into the story, save to mention the three major plot lines: that it is one of about 10,000 treatments of the after effects of concentration camps; a love story about a deeply scarred woman, having endured life in one of the camps, and a mentally deranged man; and a young Southern writer coming to grips with culture shock in Brooklyn--this being Styron, or Stingo, as he endearingly calls himself in the story. In one of the more compelling passages in the book he realizes that he no longer wants to live in the South and turns back to the squalid and sewer like life of New York. Being from the South, and after having slogged through this tedious read, I only wish that he had been belched into the Northeast sooner.       
 I knew I was in trouble with FOUR BROTHERS when I saw that Josh Howard (of SPORTS NIGHT fame) was scowling hard, trying to be a tough Detroit cop. Not believable for a nanosecond. And then it got worse when Marky Mark said, "Why don't you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee?"  The rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and clich√Ø¬ø¬Ωd rhythm. Almost every scene in this thing is a howler. And watching it, I remembered I hadn't forgiven Tyrese Gibson for the travesty that was 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS. Still, Tyrese is better than Garrett Hedlund, who looks like he's a refugee from THE OUTSIDERS.  But the movie's not a total wash; after all, it's got a GREAT soundtrack 
 I was so excited to get this item after reading the other reviews.  I was impressed when I did receive it, the quality is very good and it works great.  I followed the directions exactly for getting my two cats used to this new box.  However, ater two weeks of trying, they just refuse to use it and have found a corner to use instead....uggghhhh!!!!!  I think it is just to small inside and they are not overly large cats nor are they timid in any way.  Lots of money for something that should be more accomadating.  So, very disappointed that this did not work for me.  I hope you consider my experience before buying one.  
 A good story with strong characters lures the reader's imagination, inspires excitement and anticipation of what happens next.  This is not one of those stories.  It's not a bad book by any means.  Shining moments appear.  However, Taita is a character hard with which to sympathize.  All the other characters are as translucent as the page held up to a strong light, and the heaped action reaches a point of banality in its lack of specificity.  Did I mention it's predictable?  You should have expected that.  Pick up a Clavell or Jennings instead.  This is Soap Opera history 
 I generally like David Sedaris; in fact he's one of my favorites. But when his stories veer off into the death of children, almost gratuitously, I can't see the humor. This is, please note, the first book of his that I haven't enjoyed. But it's got a couple of gruesome episodes that jarred the joy out of me 
 I agree with the Kishand review above.  Good music (I wouldn't necessarily say great), but the ability (or lack thereof) to use on my ipod is infuriating.  I sent an email to artist@christopherlawrence.com and their response was that CL didn't know about this and the record label put the protection software on.  They also stated that they had some workaround for this, but I haven't received it yet to verify that.  In any case, I encourage people to steer clear of this cd until they can come up with a more user friendly version 
 Most of the items in this book were not specifically focused on deals for seniors. I got the feeling that the same contents could have several different covers and be marketed to other niches. In addition, so many of the free things were "free catalogs" or "free recipes"...anyone can get that information off of the Internet without buying a book 
 It is writen in a very "fancy" way. it is difficult to read. And I did not found it useful. 
 This movie was as one of the most disappointing in its genre, far less interesting than Pulp Fiction and even below the level of Reservoir Dogs. It is said that in the violent late Middle Ages street shows were  often staged in European cities where fake blood flowed like water, heads fell off and stomachs erupted sausages to simulate intestines  during an evisceration delighting  the crowd. It seems that in the violent final decade of the twentieth century we had come  full circle from Barbara Tuchman's gripping account of the  awful fourteenth century.  Despite the abundant gore if the film had been  better handled it could have been quite good. There are  glimpses of its failed potential at different  points. For instance the scene  towards the end where the prison governor's head is impaled on a broomstick and carried around by the revolting inmates seems to be a direct  copy of an actual event at the  Bastille during the days of the early French revolution. In sum, as a special kind of disgusting  art form it is interesting, as entertainment though Natural Born Killers sucks. I admit some  people will like it , no doubt the same crowd who would attend  public executions if they were available for viewing 
 How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction.  I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said. I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books.  At least the movies keep your interest 
 I read this book because it says it was a best seller, and the author is supposed to be one of the best at suspense.  With those expectations I was disappointed.  The author relies on gimmicks - like ultra short chapters to make it seem like you're reading faster.  Each chapter is 1 or 2 pages with at least one blank page between, so what looks like a 400 page books is really only a 250 page short novel.  One chapter is literally a cliff-hanger.  The plot's sort of a rehash of H.G. Wells' Island Of Dr. Moreau, borrowing a bit from X-Men comic books.  The mutants are all children who can fly, and they're severely persecuted by their keepers, so perhaps what makes the book appealing to other readers is the suspense derived from the endangered children angle, another cheap gimmick.    The villains are all one-dimensional stereotypes, blindly abandoning all their principles and humanity to profit off the children.  I could point out numerous flaws in style as well - but that's not the point; you could find flaws in better books too.  The point is the book is overrated for hack writing of less quality than many old pulp magazines I've read.  Even the love scenes are corny and seem like one of those cheap romance novels ("My arms were high and tight around his neck.  He pulled me against him and I felt him, all of him, against my thigh . . ."). The author also doesn't seem to understand the geography & terrain of the area he's writing about (for example, a small Sony TV won't receive Denver channels in Gunnison National Forrest, certainly not well enough to recognize faces in long shots as the author describes), and has some weird ideas of horror ("Chain link fence and concertina wire and guard dogs in the middle of the woods were scary enough, but to see the words "U.S. Government" attached to "Trespassers Will Be Shot" made me ill.").  Much more like this is topped off with a liberal dose of hypocrisy:  "The arrogance and amorality of the scientists working here affronted everything I believed in.  I wanted to find one of 'them' and strangle the person with my bare hands."   This is the last time I'll buy a book because it says "best seller."  If you want to read a well-written sci-fi suspense novel in which the protagonist is a child prodigy, I recommend The Fourth R by George O. Smith (ISBN 1557429332 - Also known as The Brain Machine, ISBN 0824014308) 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 Don't waste your money!  There are good books on this worthy subject but this one is very bad.  It's poorly written, pompous in tone, yet full of lame assumptions any college student could see beyond.  The few good ideas are not the author's own, though he rarely gives credit where credit is due.  It's as if it was written in one sitting, by a not very intelligent person who had done little reading on the subject and didn't have much respect for ideas.  I don't usually bother writing bad reviews but politically I'm on the same side as Sale on many of these issues and he makes an embarrassing, sophomoric mess of them 
 The only reason I gave this DVD set 2 stars, instead of the 5 that I would rate the show itself, is because there are absolutely NO extras on this DVD set.  No featurettes, no cast interviews, not even any episode commentaries.  While I appreciate the studios putting the season sets out in such a timely manner, I'd prefer they take a little longer and give us some fun extras to go along with the wonderful episodes 
 I found the characters to be mostly caricatures; there's no sense that any of them are actual human beings. As a result, there's no change -they're static, and whatever changes they supposedly go through feel completely unbelievable. And while much of the book focuses on how different classes don't truly see each other, Forster commits that same sin himself by ignoring the poorest family in the book, the Basts. Instead of making them seem real, he reduces them to mere plot devices.  In addition, Forster, a product of his time, is given to making sweeping pronouncements about the human race. Again, if he intended some irony here (as, for example, Jane Austen, who was so good at shading her prose with those kinds of hints), I'd think better of this book. Novels typically rely on either a solid plot (i.e., the stuff that's happening) or on solid characters (i.e., the stuff that happens in people's inner lives) or both to carry the reader through. I found neither here. At the very least I would like to feel the author's genuine love of language; I can forgive a bad book if it's exceptionally written. I didn't find that kind of prose here. You can skip a good third of the pages and lose nothing 
 I read this book in French. The quotes are my translation and the page refs are to the French edition. The book is quite short. It brings together the edited text of two talks Bourdieu gave on French TV in March 1996, and an article on the same topic from March 94. The topic is not really television, but rather the effect of TV on journalism. The foreword ends, p. 8: "...I hope [my analyses] will help supply tools or weapons to those who, in the image trade itself, are fighting in to prevent what could have been a formidable instrument for direct democracy from turning into an instrument of symbolic oppression."  If this sounds sensible to you, then read the book, you may appreciate it. Moreso if you also have a taste for comments on the French lit-TV scene. (In France, lit-TV at the time took some of the space occupied in the US by political talk shows. It's half disappeared since then.)  To me, however, the quote sounds Pollyanna. (You read it here first, "Bourdieu has his Pollyanna side".) With a large helping of na√Øvet√©, it could have been reality-based back when The Honeymooners was the talk of the town (ask you grandma). Or, more to the point, when Dan Rather first stepped into a TV station. The spirit of the whole book, unfortunately, is faithful to the sentence.   It's not that there is nothing to learn, here and there, from Bourdieu's remarks. It's that at best the pickings would simply fill a scrapbook. They define no particular social phenomenon and no particular aspect of the TV domain in modern society. The book *claims* to be about television, but this is television minus the money shots (aka ads), the soaps, the sports, the generic talk shows, the kids' programming -- TV minus everything but news and public affairs, TV reduced the part where "journalists" get paychecks. Furthermore, while, at the time Bourdieu was writing TV, had been the dominant news source in France for almost as long as it had been in the US, this dominant journalism is measured by the standard of print journalism (which then as now was slipping faster in France than in the US). The French have a word for this, pass√©isme, past-ism.  The meager theoretical contribution in the book (mostly near the end of the second talk, and in the appended article) concerns the "effets de champ" in journalism, what in America would probably be called systemic effects, and especially their extent (emprise) within the field. Dan Rather's end-of-career misfortune will teach you more, and with a better grounding in reality.  One star because this is definitely in the lower quintile of what one would expect from Bourdieu on television.  
 I am furious with this book. It's 300 pages of advertisement you have to pay for.  What it says is this: "Hey, the Quigong exercises by Chunyi Lin will heal the planet, but you'll have to buy our $250 self-study course to learn it." There are two exercises included in this "book", half-assedly explained. The rest is Chunyi's story and page after page of testimonials (yes - TESTIMONIALS! Like the cheesy ones on those webpages where people are desperately trying to sell you things). Ye Gads! Why did I buy it?  Bottom line: If you really want to learn this system, don't waste your money on this book - rather, get the self-study course from learningstrategies.com or attend one of his classes 
 What a mind-numbingly inept end chapter to a series that began with the greatest horror-comedy of all time, The Re-Animator.  Continuing in his deluded quest to claim the Re-Animator series for his own, and to convince us that he can direct, producer Brian Yuzna has managed the opposite.  Beyond Re-Animator merely confirms what was evident about the Yuzna-directed Bride of Re-Animator, that Yuzna knows nothing about directing actors and story.  As with Dagon, Yuzna seems to have secured financing from Spanish sources for this film.  Unfortunately, the problem is that they also tried to force in a mostly Spanish cast.  This is a story set in Massachusetts, for crying out loud -- why would the warden of the prison, the reporter coming to cover the story, the guards, and a good 90 per cent of the inmates all have Spanish accents?  It wouldn't be as howlingly horrible if these guys could act, but they can't.  Simon Andreu as Warden Brando and Elsa Pataky as love interest Laura Olney get the most screentime of anyone in the cast, but their acting is so bad, and their ADR-afflicted lines so glaringly off, that they manage to sink the film every time they open their mouths.  Yuzna seems to pick his leading ladies based on their willingness to take off their clothes (witness the gratuitous "nurse nipple" scene in this film, or Fabiana Udenio and Kathleen Kinmont in Bride of Re-Animator), and Pataky makes for one of the most unsympathetic love interests I can remember.  But even Pataky and Andreu pale in incompetence next to that blustery, seething mass of bad acting that is leading man Jason Barry.  Based on Yuzna's shoddy history with actors, one might be tempted to blame it on the director, but the fact is that in this film, Jason Barry is incapable of pulling off a single believable moment, basic elementary acting.  His every internal and external beat rings false, his dialogue delivery sounds like a cold reading, and even his basic body movements look like amateur theatre.  Most high-school students do better than this.  Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West, seasoned pro that he is, gamely plays along, but the script puts West's character so far off to the sideline in favour of the vomit-inducing Pataky-Andreu axis that Combs is unable to save this film.  On a strictly technical level, the cinematography looks good, the score is all right (though often too serious-minded for its own good), and the film doesn't look low-budget.  But when the "story" is such a mess and the actors so inept, no amount of slick lighting and camera moves can save a film.  Yuzna really should stick with producing, because on the Stuart Gordon-directed Dagon, at least there were some good moments.  But Beyond Re-Animator is beyond salvaging, possibly the worst film sequel I've ever seen, and way up there in the list of worst films I've ever subjected myself to 
 I am not sure if I should be disappointed with the book itself, or the fact that Dan Kennedy's students run around online giving all his products 5 star blindly.  This book is NOT written by Dan Kennedy. Dan Kennedy only wrote the first chapter, and from that point on, each chapter contains teaser content and a plug for a different guru.  This book has some nice overview of some examples, but it is not as good as the reviewers make it out to be. You will not get anything concrete out of it 
 A Dickens Christmas story is meant to be read in front of the fire with children gathered 'round. As configured in this particular ebook format you cannot do anything but sit in front of your screen and read ninety pages of nineteenth century prose. Not useful at all! This ebook would be far more usefull if, for example, you could copy or print it onto holiday paper. Since this story is in the public domain, blocking those options in this ebook is silly 
 First five chapters are on Dell's configurator "Choice board". This one is a total waste of time. Not technical, not re-invent the business. What is the audience here 
 The book touches upon certain investment subjects such as TA FA and news reaction in very limited detail which in my opinion could be a serious disadvantage to the newcomer with naive knowledge gained from the book. The book should of stuck to giving an overview of what is on offer on the Internet It should definately of included a chapter to the risks associated with investing online.  I think the reference made to Momentum investments is also not correct 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 Don't bother.  Characters are lifeless, plot is boring, can't believe her first book is a best seller.  Maybe it was just pure luck 
 This book has many characteristics that I really dislike to see in a textbook.    First, the authors flooded almost every page with extraneous information.  When you're learning this stuff, you want it to be explained simply and clearly - but the authors seem more intent on showing you how much they know about some topic, even when that information is tangenital and not very helpful.     They don't word things clearly.  They'll call the same thing by two different names - (i.e. "Pension Cost" and "Pension Expense") which needlessly adds to the confusion.  They'll discuss some topic for several pages without even writing down the basic, relevant journal entry.  One of the wordiest, most poorly written accounting books I have ever had the displeasure of studying from 
 Don't make the mistake i did by buying this copy of this classic ITALIAN movie.It's a complete disaster with faded colors and grainy images.I can't beleive they put this one on the market.You'll get to see the three sketches  all right, but the transfer is simply amateurish and insulting.No subtitles,not even the original ITALIAN track,no gallery of photos etc.This is the worst dvd i ever bought.Luckily for others,a new version was released in 2005 which has the proper treatment.I just hope that VISCONTI's last movie THE INNOCENT won't fall in this category when they released it someday.Let us pray for the preservation of LAURA ANTONELLI's beauty 
 And I am still awaiting all of the things Cumbey warns us about in this book to come to pass....  I had originally read the first edition of this book shortly after it was released, by advice of my then Baptist pastor.  I was getting hit up by him to read anti-New Age books, as well as from a "secular" friend to follow up on researching things closely related to The Aquarian Conspiracy.  I was also a fledgling 20-something Christian with a head full of ideas on how to save humanity and also heavily into the apocalypitcal scriptures.  To say the least I was young, dumb and full of heady ideas and general anger toward humanity, and I used my faith to buttress that belief.  I can safely say that I feel that I have grown IMMENSELY in my "faith" since then and have a definite Gnostic bent toward my belief in God.  I have basically shunned the Christian dogma and ethos in favor of a more personal view.  "Religion" is something that I refuse to practice.  This book and others like it are definitely kindling for my resistance to the Christian Apocalyptical anti-New Age movement inherent in many religious groups.  Speculative, ill-researched, and almost tabloid-ish, this book can be used as a meter for the brand of Christian paranoiac visions of "The End Times" which can turn a nice person who just wanted to go to church into a zealot.  It also uses the age-old problematic angle of the argumentative fallacies of "Appeal to Authority, Appeal to Belief, Appeal to Consequences of a Belief, Appeal to Fear, Appeal to Tradition, Misleading Vividness, and using a Biased Sample" which are found in many publications of this type.  Any argument that has all of these fallacies stacked against it is pretty unstable.  Cumbey makes all of these errors and more in this book and ignores evidential reasoning in favor of grand speculation.  To be frank, Constance Cumbey comes off as simply paranoid in this book and seems to wish to draw the reader into her world of highly charged conspiracy theories.  Being a practicing psychologist and a teacher of organizational behavior and leadership, I always warn my students that paranoia is self-perpetuating.  All things which look to be born of paranoia should be first scrutinized and tested logically and with good reasoning and also placed under a microscope before any decisions are made regarding its validity, and therefore pursuit.  As I mentioned previously, this book has inherent instabilities which lead one to not believe in the claims written within the pages.  Now, after trashing it, why did I give it 2 stars and not 1?  Well, it is basically because it does have some value.  Tsun Zu said "Know the terrain/know you're adversary."  This is a good way to get a balanced view of the subject of "New Age" watching.  The book does contain several references to claims, things, people, events and the like which can be used as ballast for the facts that actually stand up to scrutiny and reason.  And once again, we are all still waiting for all of these speculations to come to pass, Ms. Cumbey.  People have been predicting "The End Times" to be just around the corner ever since St. Peter walked the earth.  We still wait... 
 This is the other side of the coin to the attacks on contemporary government, finance and business contained in books like Korten: When Corporations Rule the Worldand the earlier Hawken: The Ecology of Commerce.   The purpose of Simon and his collaborators was to present a 'scorecard' on the progress of humanity against historical trends and to predict the level of our future health and prosperity (he specifically declines to become involved in predicting our happiness).   The basis of the book is that historical trends have always been the best guide to the long term future and, in the absence of any overwhelming evidence to the contrary (he doesn't find any) will continue to be the best guide to the future. It is crafted as a riposte to those who have seen storm waters ahead, who he refers to collectively (and unnecessarily derisively) as 'the doomsayers'.   The underlying message, which is only occasionally explicit, is that anywhere that there is a problem, we can rely on the market to fix it.  It contains five substantive Parts plus a Section on Thinking about the Future and a Conclusion - 58 chapters in all crammed with facts and figures. The substantive parts are:  	* 	Life, Death and Health 	* 	Standard of Living, Productivity and Poverty 	* 	Natural Resources 	* 	Agriculture, Food, Land and Water 	* 	Pollution and the Environment.  I think it was Samuel Smiles who proposed the mantra 'Every day, in every way, I grow better and better' and Simon and his colleagues have taken it up with a vengeance. Some of the conclusions are, of course unquestionable. Infant mortality in the developed countries has fallen dramatically, average standards of living - at least as measured by GDP - have risen, and so on. The picture is nowhere near as rosy in the Third World, but the authors choose not to focus on that, nor on the extent to which developed countries may have contributed to the problems of the third world in order to achieve the trends with which the authors are so pleased.  Others of their conclusions fall into the 'so what' category; chapters on alcohol consumption and the rate of murder and suicide don't really add much to either the argument or the readability of the book.   Other chapters are much more tendentious and are written on the basis that 'if you can't prove absolutely that there is a problem, and that that problem directly and adversely affects humans, then its not a problem'. Their conclusions are, to say the least, surprising and there is more than a whiff of what has been rudely described as the advocate's arts of never telling an untruth but relying on suppression of the truth and suggestions that lead in a false direction (suppressio veri et suggestio falsi). For example: species extinctions?: not happening, what's a species anyway and what does 'endangered' mean if anything  acid rain?: may actually be good for the crops  reserves of oil?: not a problem, never has been, never will be  nuclear waste?: a power station only produces a truck load of high level waste a year, in 100 years it will take 0.1 of an ounce to kill you and of course we can keep it safe. In any case, its better than coal, while solar or other renewal forms of energy are not economically viable (nothing about externalities, precious little about small matters like decommissioning, disasters touched on only for their direct cash cost)  ozone hole?: it may well have more to do with stratospheric temperature than with CFCs and there's no proof that it does any harm  The figures on which they rely would be more impressive if there were not a strong impression that they are selected to suit their case (something of which their opponents are of course also sometimes guilty). For example, dismissing the problem of pollution with a stack of figures about declining levels of pollution in US cities, there is no mention at all of the fact that part of this may be due to the wholesale export of polluting processes to other countries, such as Mexico.  On the basis of these, sometimes selective histories, they predict the long term future (with the saver that there may of course be short term variations). Based on Keynes' dictum that 'in the long term, we are all dead', this provides a reasonably safe platform for the contributors.  With a good deal of care and a bit of luck, we may prove the authors right. There is little doubt that we have the technology and the knowledge to be able to deal with the issues that face us globally - if we also have the wisdom and if we make a rapid enough start.   Whether the correct approach is, as the authors would suggest, one which focuses only on the direct verifiable and short term effects on humans and which relies totally on existing market mechanisms is a much more dubious question. Where we are dealing with large scale impacts on a global system, where cause and effect may be distant in time and space, a policy of sturdy denial until every last sceptic has finally admitted to have seen the 'smoking gun' seems an unnecessarily dangerous course to pursue.  It requires great dedication to read the whole of the book. On the other hand, because of the breadth of its range, it is a valuable source for scenario builders and others - provided that the facts and perspectives put forward in it are checked against other sources.  If you do believe that 'all is for the best' and that our current system of governance is ideal, this is unquestionably the book for you. It gives you a mountain of facts, figures, trend lines and assertions with which to confound your enemy 
 I guess for me this is another example of caveat emptor. I bought this largely based on the reviews here, and I was pretty disappointed. The surfing just wasn't that interesting - way way too much nose riding, and not much else. OK nose riding is fine, but there is a lot more about longboarding than hanging 5. The best parts of the movie are the beginning and end - where the shaper describes his work and goes out for an early morning session. Now THAT was great - he ripped, and it was great to see him really using the whole board and the whole wave. I wish the movie had just been about him 
 There are three significant problems with this book. "Made in Detroit," is poorly written. Clemens thinks, "went over like a led balloon," is a fine simile. It is not. But Clemens begs his readers to compare him to Baldwin, Hemmingway, and others, a desperate attempt for sophistication he is unlikely to ever gain. (2) Clemens' book is racist and anti-working class to the core. Clemens clearly adopted his fathers' hatred of unions, and formed his own uncritical take on racism, expecting readers to chuckle at his portrayal of African Americans as "moolies." (3) Clemens knows nearly nothing important about Detroit. He views the city through an inverted telescope, each lens juncture narrowing his already myopic view; racism, sexism, the meanest forms of conservative Catholicism, his unexamined views of exploitation and resistance, all merge to give him a key-hole view of, not the city, but himself, his trifling family relationships, and his trembling edicts about his wife-who, I know from experience, is all aflutter about his critics. There are good books about Detroit, like "Whose Detroit?" or "American Odyssey" by Conot (openly fictional, unlike Clemens' piece), or Ewens, "Corporate Power and Urban Crisis," or Mirel's "Rise and Fall of an Urban School System." Clemens work is, flatly, too small-minded to be taken seriously. Only the fact that racism sells could lead local reviewers, and the publisher, to push this book. For those who seek my longer review of Clemens book, google "Michigan Citizen , Made In Detroit." I am the San Diego State prof critiqued in a review below. 
 This is the first book by Shaara I have read. And, if his other works are like this, it is also the last.    On the cover, J. Persico is quoted as saying Shaara makes "literature read like history and history read like literature."  He goes on to claim that Shaara brings the war to "pulsating life."  I have even read a review that claimed this book was better than Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front.    I must have been reading a different book.  The first chapter, The Replacement, is a great short story.  After reading it, I had hight expectations for the book.  Unfortunately, it falls apart after that great beginning and it is a dull affair that completely lacks any sense of a coherent narrative from a literary point of view.  And, the history reads like an 8th grade textbook.   His narrative style is unable to give life to people that actually lived.  They are flatly presented and there is no sense of really caring about what happens to them.    After the dislocated short story of the first chapter, the book delves into a long-winded story of the flying aces, interspersed with summaries of historic events that do little more than ruin the flow of the story.  It frequently feels like the book is written for people who are unwilling to read a real history book.  Shaara doesn't even begin dealing with the trench warfare of the war until the 1918's, when the Americans arrive, focusing, as I noted before, primarily on the air war that occurred in the first years of the war. I should point out that the air war would be interesting reading in a book of its own.  Here, however, it seems more to reflect that the author did not deem the ground warfare fought by non-Americans worthy of a story. Or was too lazy to research the events enough to write about the ground war from the British or French perspective.   And, I have no particularly problem with him focusing on the American perspective on the war, but then why bother with writing anything prior to our entry?  I suppose a smaller book doesn't sell as well.  For those interested in historical fiction, I would recommend Bernard Cornwall's work.  And, perhaps, Shaara can learn a bit from him 
 Most of the information is very "theoritical" and "limited" -- author focus mainly on her own analysis of her mother and her relationship with her.  ...  In a nutshell, the message is that a dysfunctional mother'll pass her emotioanal issues to her daughter(s), and in turn, the daughter(s) may pass that onto her offspring(s).  ...   
 Bad paper, Old advice. Just plain awful and a waste of Money. 
 A novelist goes on a vacation to write a book,she gets raped by some town hicks..then it's on! I will admit this was a guilty pleasure. The acting was bad especially the autistic dude (Matthew)with the receding hairline comb-over do...I just wanted to slapp him silly!  I first saw this as a kid in the 80s by accident..just now figured out after all these years that they captured this woman for the Autistic dude! He was too scared,So they figure "Can't let it go to waste" and then "Choo-Choo.." it was time to run that "Train".  This movie is unnecessarily long,there isn't really THAT much dialogue, The Tripod never moves. there are scenes that don't contribute much. It's very dated in the visuals as well. Even though it is digitally remastered for DVD it still looks washed out and could've done another filter through for better quality.  The Raping scene..my god! is one to remember though! Very graphic..the screaming too..very disturbing.  The 2nd dude with the suspenders that raped her was  OVERACTING big time with that scene...it was VERY laughable.. in fact I had to rewind it and kept laughing at the scene. I still can't believe that the gas station guy REALLY thought she came back for HIM...in lust. Gosh what an idiot!!! He deserved what he got, they all did. I spit on them too.   
 Can't remember too much of this, but was convinced that at the live showing of this on the National geographic channel, that at the end of the show they were going to find something of great importance or something of that nature.  Nope, stayed up till two in the morning so they could discover another door.  No joke. There was other things inbetween the live shots of the mechanical thing going through the tiny tunnel to the next door, but it was late and I don't remember most of it.  Sorry 
 While this book has some good topics to be discussed with kids, it is more about "how to get the teacher to like you" and concentrates on rules that are outdated and a bit unrealistic.  I'm pretty disappointed 
 Some of the continuations of Andre Norton's worlds have been gems, and some of them have been disappointments.  Beast Master's Ark is the worst to date.  The original Beast Master was one of my favorite books, with Norton's classic complexity of phrase, her textured and troubled main character, and her believable yet alien world.  This sequel has simplistic language, startling to someone expecting Norton's turn of phrase, and no plot to speak of.  The story never generates tension, and there is no climax.  McConchie does a great job with characterization, but good characters are not enough.  There must be some story.  To add insult to injury, there are multiple typos, and some editing mistakes like tense switching that add to the general sense of a book that is not well written.  I am sorry that Andre Norton put her name to this one 
 I am currently entering my 3rd year of nursing, and of course, the school that i attend also requires the use of this hateful book.  I found it very difficult to use.  The only recommendation I have is, contact your instructors early enough and hope they help you to understand this demon 
 We purchased this blender at a local home improvement store, thinking the well-respected name, 600 watt motor, and glass pitcher would equal one heavy-duty machine.  It looks great!  But, it stopped working mid-way through the second batch of frozen drinks!  Didn't have it turned "ON," I was using the pulsing feature.  So, called the Customer Service number, and they said I could send it to them for repair or replacement in two weeks.  The reatiler was 10 minutes away, so returning it there was no big deal.  The second time around, the blender again stopped working during the second use.  I made the children some banana milkshakes, rinsed the pitcher out, to make some strawberry frozen drinks for us.  The darned thing stopped working again! Called Customer Service about it and they gave me the same story.  So, back to the home-store . . .   Take three . . . new machine . . . made one batch of our favourite frozen drinks again.  Poured two glasses and left the rest sitting in the pitcher for seconds.  When I came back for seconds, I wanted to tap the pulse feature to re-blend the drinks . . . but, the thing wouldn't work!!  Back on the phone to Customer Service.  They suggested I check their website and select another of their "fine blender line."  YEAH RIGHT!!!  They also said that "maybe you got a 'bad batch'."  A "bad batch" of blenders?   Several things can be learned here:  I enjoy frozen strawberry drinks too much, my local home improvement store has great customer service, and THIS BLENDER IS A PIECE OF JUNK!!! 
 Having a novel's narrator turn out to be the killer is a fairly common staple in the mystery and suspense genre.  When this plot device is done well, the reader is pleasantly shocked by the twist, not left wondering what the hell happened.  When the twist works best, the author hasn't actually lied to the reader, but carefully choosen his or her words to create false assumptions.  When the twist comes, the reader experiences a `light bulb moment', realizing they were duped, but that they should have seen it coming.    In Beach Road the ending doesn't make much sense, and the reader ends up feeling betrayed when the twist is revealed.   Beach Road features multiple first person narratives and includes a preface that warns the reader that some narrators may be lying.  My question to Mr. Patterson is:  If one of the characters lies to the reader for the first √Ø¬ø¬Ω of the novel, why do they start telling the truth near the end?  Why not lie all the way through(or tell the truth right from the beginning)?  I think it would have been much more interesting if the character's lies were exposed, not by their own confession, but through the observations of other characters.  Of course the unlikely twist is only one of the problems with this novel.   My other major gripe is that so much of it doesn't make sense.  For example, the elusive and ruthless drug dealer known only as Loco turns out to be a character that everyone in town knows.  Somehow Loco and the killer maintain a drug dealing operation in a small community without anyone knowing.  This is ridiculous.  Drug dealers need to be known and they need to be easy to find.  How else do people buy drugs from them?  It's ridiculous to think that they could become major drug dealers in this small community without anyone knowing, even with silly nicknames.    Second case in point: the killer dispatches a number of people with ruthless efficiency by putting bullets through their brains, yet inexplicably tries to kill the only person who knows their secret by shooting them at close range in the abdomen. They don't notice the absence of blood, and don't check to make sure the shot was fatal.  It doesn't make sense.  Patterson churns out novels faster than Nora Roberts these days and apparently isn't worried about quality.  Beach Road is fast paced but the gaps in logic and far fetched ending make this a Patterson novel to avoid. 
 Wouldnt buy from this bunch again. The product was given as a gift. My son took it home first week of January when their Christmas visit was over. Couldnt get the scribing process to work. Was told to contact the manufacturers to fix the problem which he did and they couldnt fix. Then he tried to return via Amazons instructions and after hassling with that was told only the original purchaser could return it and so he asks me to see about it. I am told when I contact antonline that its been to long (january 22nd) to return the merchandise. Most responsible companies extended their return deadlines for Christmas and some dont even have one. Wont do business with manufacturer or Antonline again. Having problems with other amazon merchant returns too and may stop using amazon all together except that I use their credit card alot. Guess that can be changed too 
 This book will be most useful for fundamentalists who wonder about the contradictions in the Bible if it is read literally 
 I thought this was an complete and utter prententious waste of time. I watch hundreds of videos a year & this is the only one I've had to fast forward through most of just to keep a glimmer of interest. It's not really about the history of Russia at all. In fact, it's not about much of anything. It's more of an exercise in cinema, a bad idea that should have been tossed aside. The cinematography & art direction was nice but other than that it was cinematic doodling 
 I love this movie so much, and have since I was young, yet I just can't give it a higher score than this. Sly is an irreverent cabbie, picked out of the crowd by good ole Dolly and her manager to become the next big thing at a local country club. What ensues is classic 80's camp with little more than guilty fun at the expense of good taste.  The greatest part of this film is the first real Sly song, "Drinkenstein," performed while wearing an outrageous get-up that is beyond the imagination. That song won the movie a much deserved Golden Raspberry as did Sly's brilliant acting performance. No extras to speak of, but who needs em. You'll probably be too drunk while watching this to care, but it'll give you time to practice your jock-itch walk! 
 Punk, like all great rock music, was a rebellion, in this case against the excesses of the late '60s and early '70s.  BUt somewhere along the way, it was unavoidable that bands would come along that loved the energy and honesty of punk and the very material they were rebelling against-- in the case of XTC, the lush pop and psychedelia of the late '60s.  But these influences were far receeded on their debut album, "White Music" is firmly lodged in the sounds of punk and new wave and is, more than anything else, an album of energy music.  The net result of this is that hte album is inevitably at odds with the strenghts of the band-- songwriters Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding would come later to excel at lush, detailed arrangement full of unerring pop hooks, textures and harmonies, but here, it's all very stripped back, ska and punk influenced pop.  Moulding's trademark slithering bass isn't quite in place yet, though he's already starting to find holes to fit himself in, he primarily forms a solid lockstep with drummer Terry Chambers.  Partridge's guitar, for his part, limits largely to angular punk and ska trends-- loud and aggressive, pushing the music along from the front, which leads Barry Andrews' buzzing organ sound to be largely the soloing voice in the band.  But with all this, the real weakness was singing voices too used to poor microphones of cheap clubs-- Partridge and Moulding both use an unnatural, clipped vocal style that seems more concerned with trying to annunciate than anything else, to the detrimant of the band's sound.  With all of this creating an unnatural tension on the album, it still manages to hit pretty frequently, helped no doubt by the fact that Partridge's songwriting was already top notch.  Standout "Statue of Liberty" best illustrates this-- hints of ska, gentle organ textures, and a funky bassline over which Partridge's clever story of unrequited love can be read out.  Nearly as notable are punky opener "Radios in Motion" (full of crackling punk energy), the loose-yet-detailed arrangement of early single "This is Pop?" (featuring the closest Partridge would ever come to snarling punk rebellion, even if it is laden with great pop hooks), and new wave gem "Atom Age", with just enough of a hint of Brian Wilson to pull it above the rest.  On the other hand, there's a lot of largely forgettable material-- Moulding's songwriting feels like it's not quite ready ("Set Myself on Fire") and his vocal is even more painfully forced than Partridge's ("Cross Wires"), and even Partridge has a couple duds ("Spinning Top").  Add to this an ill-conceived ska take on "All Along the Watchtower" that makes Partridge sound like a bad Hendrix imitator and you end up with a pretty mixed package.  The reissue adds quite a bit to the original-- remastered sound that has the net effect of making the record sound a bit more dated than it probably would at least provides clarity to the music and there's seven bonus tracks-- early singles and the "3D EP".  Most of this stuff is largely forgettable (Moulding's "Heatwave", Partridge's "Dance Band" and "Traffic Light Rock"), but early single "Science Friction" and its b-side "She's So Square" are pulsing full of nervous tension and energy and make a decent listen.  XTC would find enormous heights in the following decade, and I can't help but color my reviews of their early material based on the heights they'd eventually reach.  I have a sneaking suspicion that had I not heard what they'd be capable of in the future, I'd be inclined to give this a much higher rating, but compared to their later work, "White Music" sounds positively amateurish.  It's got its moments, but they'd go on to do a lot better 
 I got hooked on Tiesto about 5 years ago. Heard a live taping on the radio of him a couple of weeks ago and they said its from this album. Neverhteless, it wasn't but it was still tiesto though right? Well...the hits on this CD are about 5 years old. The build ups are terrible and I felt like the songs were redone about 10 times from other various artists. Stick with "Tiesto:Nyana" ...10130340345435 times better 
 I was torn between giving this book two or three stars.  I wanted to give it a positive review because it is obvious that the man did amazing research and he was very thorough.  In that sense, he did a great job. On the other hand, I disliked it because it was dry and because he projects too much of his own political anxiety and agenda onto the game.  I could have over-looked the dryness and given it a positive rating.  But I can't overlook the leftist politics that simply get in the way of what would have been a good history of a great game 
 Not only is this film not well produced, with relatively poor visuals and a less-than-quality soundtrack but it leaves one completely unsatisfied.  The violent scenes are unnecessary and provide little but visual uncomfortableness throughout the entire movie.  I was expecting something much more  based on prior reviews.   I found the film falling far short of where it  could have gone - disappointing and puzzling 
 I just purchased this product from a high-end, specialty gift shop for $6.00.  It was the exact same item 
 The addresses and phone numbers in this book are handy, but this is not the way to find an agent or publisher. Instead, visit the largest bookstore in your area and take a look at the books they sell that are in your genre. Look in the "Acknowledgments" section of each book and you are almost certain to find the names of the author's agent and the book's editor. Those are the agents and editors who are most likely to know about your subject and its chances of being published. Find those people using an online white pages or yellow pages site (anywho.com, dogpile.com, etc.) and give them a call. If they are receptive to your idea, send them a formal proposal.  I have to agree with those who have suggested that publication of a book like this by someone in the business smacks of exploitation. As one other reviewer noted, the author is an agent - call him up and see how receptive he is to you. You might as well try looking for Elvis in the supermarket. 
 This  is one extremely ponderous book to read.  The author makes several well intentioned points, only to get bogged down in his own research and wordiness.  Read it if you must....be sure you have lots of time to decipher it once you have 
 I was going to be open minded when reading this book. After reading the "student" part, knew that somethings were not right in this book. Any Christian book I have ever read quotes scriptures from the Holy Bible, this one did not. There was just enough truth to keep a Christian still reading. The bible says in the end times there will be false doctorine. This is a very good example. When I got to the back of the book, the teacher section, then the truth of the book came out. Anytime subjects like, "psychic," "magic," and "reincarnation," are talked about and viewed in a positive light,as was the case in the back of this book, then be very careful. If you know the Holy Bible, God's word, then you know that this is of the enemy, Satan. I am not a "holy roller" a "fanatic" I am a Christian that has a personal relationship with Jesus. Ask God what he thinks of this book and its content. How deceptive this book is, just like the enemy. It has just enough truth and then in the very back after you have read all of the things in it, the bomb is dropped and the real stuff comes through loud and clear, or not so clear to those who do not read and know The Bible themselves. Always read God's word, the Holy Bible for yourself. You need to know the truth so you will not be deceived by books and things such as these that are in this book. I really hope people read this and find the truth out for themselves.  Kell 
 Whilst I thought this had much useful information about nail nutrition and the disadvantages of artificial nails quite a large portion of it was devoted by the author to promoting his own system which then had to be purchased seperately. As this provided no information of any practical use I felt for the price the number of pages devoted to it was unreasonable 
 I was with HP for 15-20 years, needed MFP read all reviews here and decided that MFC-8860DN will be a good choice (other option was HP 3055).  It has everything I need - copier, network print, scan, fax.  Easy setup (I am in IT for 25+ years).  Everything was almost perfect.  The only complaint you need to keep in mind - IT EATS 1100 WATTS when starts printing - light could flash. It was OK, until I reached 1500 pages mark - it start printing small dots every ~3".  No problem - need to clean everything (per my experience and confirmed on Brother's web site).  Cleaned - it was the biggest mistake - all outputs were with tons of small dots all around the page.   Called Support 2 times.  After few hours of troubleshooting - they advised me to replace DRUM.  Hey - its only 1500 pages, nowhere close to promised 25000!  After I mentioned it, they offered me 75% discount on it.  What's about warranty?  Sorry.  I spoke to supervisor, he explained that Support in Philippines can't do it, the only option - to call USA office. I replaced DRUM.  Now counter shows around 2000 pages and I have same problem again. Hey, I heard this before - never say never.  Still as of today: I would NEVER, NEVER buy Brother printer/MFC again!!! 
 There were several flaws with this book.  1) I am an amateur artist and have read quite a bit about art, and I found the book to be dull. 2) More than 1/2 the book is about Francesca and Laura. They did not find the painting and the descriptions of their personal lives are not interesting. 3) It would make an interesting article but it doesn't have enough meat for a book. 4) The first and 2nd halves of the book were only tenuously related to each other. I kept waiting for something to happen but nothing did 
 This book states that it's better to die than survive a rape:  "Also far-reaching is the effect of the loss of chastity. Once given or taken or stolen it can never be regained. Even in a forced contact such as rape or incest, the injured one is greatly outraged. If she has not cooperated and contributed to the foul deed, she is of course in a more favorable position. There is no condemnation where there is no voluntary participation. It is better to die in defending one's virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle." (p.196)  How much more twisted can it get?  
 If you're made to buy this book you have every right to hate the professor that makes you do so. This book is a punishment! Not only is it very expensive, but it also offers information that it is not relevant to the real world at all.  There are some positive sides in this book after all. There are quick references on almost every page to make it easier to follow the chapter; there are good graphs the explanations to the graphs as well as the general argument do fit (more or less). There are also case studies, a fairly solid web page, and self-assessment questions that are helpful to get through with this material.  However, the style is unnecessarily pompous, filled with theories that make no or only very little sense; the information presented is way to shallow to really understand what the authors are getting at, yet miraculously they manage to fill the book with more than 500 pages with endless waffle. In some places, the author's even contradict themselves, which is the most impressive thing about this book.  Generally only two stars are awarded for this book, as it really is a waste of money and time, however if you have to read this insult for any intellectual mind, you will find some help to make nonsense into a science. Good luck to you! 
 I enjoyed the book but the author's errors occurred in areas that I'm very unforgiving of.  In one place he mistakes semi-automatic firearms for fully-automatic firearms.  Even if the author doesn't feel obligated to do much research for light fiction like this, the editor should have caught something so blatantly wrong.    I enjoyed some of the ridiculous characters that always show up in his books.  But, like Stephen King, I'm beginning to notice that he has certain characters that he uses again and again.  The hermit in the woods that knows everything.  State troopers are always perfect and dedicated but feds and city cops are dummies.  Throw in a scene that involves a complicated sexual position.  It just seems a bit lazy.  I know it's light fiction, but I like a bit more flesh to my beach reading.  I should mention that I didn't actually "read" this book, I listened to the unabridged audio version 
 I thought this book would deal only with the 2nd Iraq war but was mistaken.  About half this book described the history of Iraq.  The actual war coverage was broad and brief.  This book lacks much of the detail of previous Keegan books.  John Keegan has written many superb books in the past but this one was a disappointment 
 I was surprised to find this book not only still in print, but enthusiastically reviewed by so many who obviously take it seriously.  For those willing to do a little background research into Casteneda and his subject matter it will quickly become apparent that the events detailed in 'The Teachings' did not, and could not have occurred as described.  Space prevents me going into detail here, but I have a review on my website at:  http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/redcrow/CTOMBS/Articles/Castanedax.ht 
      We have had this monitor for 18 months and have zero problems hearing our son in his crib...and apparently our neighbors three houses down from us also have no problem hearing us.  We were outside today when our neighbor who also has a toddler just so happened to mention this to us.  So now we are looking to purchase a more secure monitor.      If you live out in the middle of no where or you don't mind other people listening to your everyday conversations this monitor is perfect for you 
 If your intent is to be a scholar of Shakespeare, you may enjoy this book.  However, if you enjoy the literature attributed to Mr. Shakespeare, spend your valuable time reading "his" works.  I was seduced into buying this book by a review that painted a rather incomplete picture of the true nature of the contents.  I have struggled thru 3 chapters of pedantry, as this group of scholars argue over minutiae like the context and validity of the phrase "precious instance". ("Nature is fine in love and where 'tis fine It sends some precious instance of itself after the thing it loves")  Go to the library, read from a few chapters and then make your decision on whether to buy this book or "As You Like It" 
 Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner's book on the art of changing minds and affecting opinions has an appealing pull. Written by a qualified professional in the field, the book is another output of the impressive Harvard Business School Press. The book advances the view that there are seven, what it calls, "layers" or "levers" that affect a change of opinion. These factors, whose titles all begin with `re' are: -Reason -Research -Resonance -Resistances -Real World Events -Resources And Rewards and -Representational Redescriptions   Gardner subsequently proceeds to elaborate on each of the factors within contexts such as an institution, among a population, up close or as relate's to one's own mind.   So far, so good, many would say; alas the reader is compelled to add `so what?' to the phrase. Changing Minds is indeed the work of a qualified professional, but the reader is neither provided evidence nor shown the techniques and history behind the author's conclusions. Furthermore, being the work of a researcher in an academic setting, readers should not expect practical instructions or employable techniques. Rather, Changing Minds concentrates on the mechanics and psychological hypothesis. In this manner, the book is very much a scholastic paper. Finally, there is scant evidence that the author employs his own teachings. Little proof, research or reason is offered here to be convincing or allay any of the readers' resistances. Similarly dismissed is the need for charts, sub-titles, illustrations, indented or highlighted points or synopses.   Furthermore, and more ominously, the author makes several practical mistakes in the way he reads or interprets the world rendering some of his data and experiences suspect. He claims that schools are agents of change and serve to instill different opinions in youngsters. Those are his opinions and not supported by any empirical data. He does not provide any supporting data either. In fact, the contrary is true. Schools are designed to breed uniformity and teach adherence, obedience and group activity. Barely a student will pass physics class were he to challenge a prevalent theory. A law student will probably find himself choosing a new major should he differ with prescribed laws. Similarly, imagine a student disagreeing with the outcome of World War II, an astrology student disputing the form of nova stars or, at an elementary level, a high school student butting heads with his classmates and instructors. Another error is the assumption that events have lead to fundamental change even in thought process of political leaders. Let me quote from the book. While Gardner cites the example of George W Bush following September 11, 2001, many scholars and historians have shown that far from changing his mind, the US president instead leveraged the event to more resolutely drive his pre-existing agenda. Much of what transpired following the events of the day were the accelerations of the American president and his officials' overt and covert ideas and strategies. Gardner terms the new Bush, a "multilateralist"! Uncomfortably, 132 sovereign countries and a lack of support from the United Nations would disagree. Moreover, despite such fierce opposition, Bush proceeded with his plans nonetheless. Further down the pages, the author condemns Stalin's pact with Hitler as "cronyism." He conveniently forgets or omits the allies' earlier pact with Hitler or the West's subsequent treaty with the "extremely paranoid" Stalin. In short, being a tenured academic Gardner himself seems most susceptible to institutional tunnel vision and in need of constructive cognitive dissonance.   Lacking the appeal of practicality, the burden of proof or applicable relevance set in actual events Changing Minds: The Art And Science Of Changing Our Own And Other People's Minds is solely of interest to researchers in need of alternate sources on the topic.  Gardner does not provide any empirical basis for his opinions, which also deviate from the title and stated scope of the book 
 The exercises in the book seem to be purposefully difficult.  Is this to discourage prospective copyeditors or so that Einsohn can show off her years of experience?  In order to be instructional, the explanations should fully cover the concepts that one will be tested on in the exercises.  Anyone who can read should be able to read the text and then successfully complete the exercises.  This is basic to good instructional design. Instead, in the exercises, Einsohn throws in the exceptions to the rules or tests on concepts only hinted at in the text.  Einsohn reminds me of the bad teachers we have all experienced at one time or another who get satisfaction from confusing students by talking around a subject instead of teaching the subject directly.  Success of students is not the goal of these teachers.  There are many finer points in copyediting, but there are sets of rules governing them all.  It should be a simple matter to present the rules and then test the student on those rules 
 Imagine no possessions?  Fine, then you get rid of your jewel encrusted luxury palaces.  Imagine no religion?  Fine, if religion's such a "crutch", then you forsake your million dollar drug habit.  Imagine no countries?  Fine, then you move from England or America to Africa or El Salvador.  The world will be as one?  Fine, then you act like an adult and don't abandon your wife and child when they need you the most.  John Lennon was a text book phony.  He was a grown-up with a child's brain who ordered the rest of us to live a life that he wouldn't.  Maybe if he didn't squander his days snorting cocaine through one hundred dollar bills he would have recognized how utterly ridiculous he sounded.....then and now.  The utopian dreams of the 60's are history, and they were destroyed by none other than Lennon himself-an unscrupulous fantasy peddler who selfishly preyed upon the optimism of a generation.  His blatant hypocrisy was so obnoxious that the very thought of his music makes my stomach turn.  Thank you very much.  -DW.  
 I'm going to save you some time and give away the only meaningful event in this book. Let me start by saying Idoru (which this is supposedly a "sequel" to) is a great book. This one, is not. Most of the characters are not very interesting or fleshed out (and the ones who are, like Laney, Yamazaki, and Rei are hardly in the book at all) and the plot is virtually nonexistant. Read Idoru and know that the only important thing that happens in this book is that Rei Toi (no longer with Rez) manages to finally manifest in the flesh using nanofax machines. Thousands of Lucky Dragon convenience stores install nanofax machines (machines that can fax actual objects using nano-assemblers) in their stores on the same night. Rei Toi hacks their system with some help from the Walled City and at the moment all the machines are supposed to be producing Lucky Dragon statues, instead thousands of naked Rei Tois pop out and run out the door! You have to read many hundreds of pages to get to this event (which isn't even what the story is about) and there is still no conclusion at the end. This should have been an 8-page short story bridge to the next (and hopefully much better) sequel. Don't waste your time. Read Idoru 
 I like her JP Beumont books but this book seems to think I have been acquainted with the characters in other books, which I have not. I never could get into the book because the characters were confusing so I quit 
 George A. Romero enters with yet another installment in his banal and grossly visual zombie flicks and hopefully this will be the last of them. Obviously there is an appreciative audience who enjoys watching partially decomposed bodies stomp around and grunt and eat body parts of the living because a lot of people write positively about this film.  For this viewer the 'parody' eludes.  LAND OF THE DEAD is simply a dark, grotesque, poorly written, hastily thrown together bit of treacle to make money off the folks who like this genre.  But how fine actors like Simon Baker, John Leguizamo, Dennis Hopper, Asia Argento, and Robert Joy agree to the casting agent's invitation to star in this film is a conundrum.  Grady Harp, December 0 
 This book seemed to me to be written by an author, or authors, who were afraid to take it one or two steps further.  The storyline was weak, the action weak, the thugs and "bad guys" not believeable at all and the leading characters just shadows of what they could have been. I love the Stephanie Plum series and tried really, really hard not to make a comparison.  Unfortunately, the authors made it impossible to separate Plum from Hot Stuff.  There were Plumisms scattered throughout the book and the characters were recycled from the Plum books.  I wonder why Janet and LeAnn even bothered with the book.  There was nothing hot about Hot Stuff at all 
 One good song on the entire album - South side with Gwen Stefani.  Rest of the songs have some sort of rap guy and not much if any Moby.  Waste of mone 
 Ms. Reichs has lost the recipe, or at least the focus and formula that has brought her success prior to Cross Bones. Although not nearly as bad as P. Cornwell's last two or three misfires, Reichs is way wide of her usual high mark here. In this offering, Temperance is out of character, out of both style and focus, and the story is just overly convoluted and circuitous; a yarn that meanders around heading every which way except toward a finished product. Even the writing is unfamiliar and not of the same voice Reichs has maintained in her many Brennan novels. Having finally given up on Cornwell, after many years, I'll hang in there for one more Temperance Brennan dig; everyone is entitled to one gong 
 A Star Is Born is a disturbing film for all the wrong reasons.  By failing to get the audience to sympathize with a movie star's tragic downfall, the film displays a schizophrenic quality. There is almost a breakdown in the relationship between the audience and what happens on screen.  This is in no part due to the performances by the lead actors; it's the nature of the material itself.  Perhaps if we were to see the James Mason character as a likeable star before failure and booze drain away his ambition and reason for living, the audience would understand what the Garland character sees in him and we could sympathize with both characters.  Instead, we see Garland's character despairing over a not very likeable washed-up drunk and we're left feeling as empty as the film itself 
 Your book, to me, conveys false conclusions:  if our country's forefathers/founders could overcome such biases in their media to create our country, then our current complaints of biased media are either unfounded or overblown since either 1)current media is less bias than in the past or 2)we will overcome the media bias as our forefathers did to do or create something as  positive as they did when they created our country.  1) The majority of our forefathers were directly or probably one generation away from the oppression, either political, religious, or social [class], which drove them here in the first place despite the difficult journey.  Their first-hand or recent knowledge of their oppression, and their reactions to it, trumped the old media's propaganda!  They knew too much first-hand to be hornswoggled by media, only newspapers and pamphlets then.  In essence, they KNEW what they would NOT stand for regardless of what the media stated, for they had LIVED it, barely, or parents had!  I would submit to you we would NOT have bought the administration's nor biased media's false assertions regarding Saddam had we had war on our soil in recent memory.  We would have ALL known what war was first-hand and would NOT have made this "decision" so readily or cavalierly.  2) How many of the colonists could read?  Yes, obviously, the founders could, but the average colonist had to depend on the educated founders, or that class of folks, to tell them the news and its ramifications, which were translated through the founders' own biases.  Today, folks get their "facts" from many "news" sources other than newspapers or the almost extinct pamphlet, i.e. tv, internet, books, etc. The selection of which source is often a result of their ideology, rather than in the past, when they took what was available as far as source.  I would submit the lack of recent knowledge of oppression or lack of freedoms, the lack of civic education - heck, ignorance, no knowledge of history, apathy, and trust, albeit, misplaced - contribute, in my opinion, to the increased harm the current biased media does to We, The People and OUR Country!  Let's face it, the majority of us are used to Walter Cronkite, NOT Bill O'Reilly, (of course, depending upon one's generation) and their inherent credibility or not. Which of these people is more credible, or stated another way, which of these people has been caught in lies or scandals?  So, NO, I do NOT agree with what I think are your false conclusions or dismissal of harm done by current biased media.  I believe the harm is immeasurable.  I believe it is MORE than unfortunate given it DIRECTLY lead to an invasion based on LIES.  ALL these years have passed since our country was founded, and the press, collectively, has NOT improved or evolved in a positive way with any depth, ergo, the ease the current press slipped into bias mode.  Rather, the media has digressed into lies and obfuscation.  To the degree they have committed these acts, the current media is TOTALLY complicit with the results - a war, which the majority feel we never should have embarked upon, just to mention one glaring example, AD NAUSEAM!  I am MORE than DISGUSTED over the media's active participation through their blatant bias in all the negative things which have happened to our country in the last five years!  I am just as DISGUSTED with ANY who would apologize for it, minimize it, or dismiss it.  ALL WE, THE PEOPLE, EVER WANT or DESERVE in this country is the pure FACTS, untarnished by the prism of bias! 
 I hated the baby bargains book but this one is WORSE. My pediatrician gave it a hands down and his only comment was "a few authors trying to make a buck." They obviously have no research in this book because they recommend products that are not even age appropriate. These authors have little credibility in my eyes and according to other reviewers, it seems the same. I was never a bargain shopper, really, I mean who is unless you have to be! But, if I was, I don't see this book as a bargain. 
 This is the American version of the greatest hits, which means its not as good. I suggest you get Singles of the 90's over this. I only gave this 2 stars cuz of "Life is a flower" and "C'est la vie", i really like those songs otherwise i would have given it a zero.  1. Life is a flower (10/10) the original version of "Whenever you're near me", released outside of America only. I love this version, it has pure euro-pop all over it but is a great song. the chorus rocks.  2. C'est la vie (8/10) Good song, not the best but still good.  3. Always have always will (7/10) Good song, sounds sorta like a christmas tune.   4. Lucky love (Acoustic version)(5/10) the original is the best. i dont like this version much.  5. Lucky love (Dance mix) (0/10) the song "Living in danger" is taken from this song. listen to the two and you'll see. i dont like this version either cuz its bland.  6. Beautiful life (remix) (0/10) Long and boring  I suggest you get singles of the 90's over this trash. dont even buy this 
 In my opinion the novel "House of Stairs is nice although it isn't realistic that an experiment like that could happen in reality. It is well structured and easy to understand. Furthermore it has a nice ending. But the credibility of the characters is as bad as the tension. So all in all it's a nice but also a very unrealistic novel 
 It was nice, but most of the others make me really sleepy.  They are really slow.  Not something you want to play in the car 
 The picture quality is very good. The delay in changing channels is not a big deal, usually you will have a satellite or cable box hooked up anyway to avoid the problem.  I've had this TV for 9 months now and generally very happy until 2 weeks ago.  For some reason the picture just cuts out after 10-20 minutes leaving only sound. If  you wait the picture can come back on by turning TV off and waiting, but then it goes off again in a few minutes.  Not happy with the service, still waiting for a call back.    I REALLY WISH I HAD SEEN THESE REVIEWS BEFOREHAND 
 It's not really going to give you a checklist of things that you want to make sure you do before you sign.  Instead it is a book that discusses in general a few things you might want to consider, but doesn't get into any one topic in depth, or even give you any real insider tips other than "hire a real estate attorney" or "hire a buyer broker."  By the time I finished reading the book I felt like I had just read an advertisement for real estate lawyers and real estate brokers.  The author doesn't teach you about the home buying process so much as he insist that you leave it up to the professionals.  There is even a chapter devoted to the right way to treat your broker!    I say skip this one or get it from your library if you really think you want to read it 
 Although I, like another reviewer here mentions, rely heavily on Amazon reviewers to guide me in my decision-making over mainly which movies to watch, reviews like the majority of ones presented here make me very skeptical about how much I should continue doing so.  Actually, I've started selecting the lowest ratings to look at first because I'm finding in many cases those are actually more in harmony with my thoughts after seeing a movie.  And this is definitely one of those cases.  The Amazon review as well as the far too few negative reviews presented here reflect totally my feelings about this movie, so I will not add more except to direct you to those.  
 How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction.  I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said. I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books.  At least the movies keep your interest 
 Normally, I do not find it appeasing to write reviews of books I own, but this one i felt rather vehement about. I received this book for a gift over the holidays.  Over father's day, I thought I would make the Lemon Meringue Pie recipe from this book for my father-in-law as a gift.  I started to make it, and realized that the recipe called for a mixture of ingredients it failed to tell me how to make.  Granted, I know a lot about baking and cooking  and at high altitudes (I am a chef and live at almost 8,000 ft), but still, when I am trying to follow a recipe that is incomplete it is impossible!!!  I gave up that recipe and just decided to go with a different recipe that I know is tried and true.  Furthermore, today (Aug. 11) I tried to make the Independence Pass Brownies, and once again was shocked to see how poorly written these recipes were.  Ms. Purdy should really take up a new profession, as I have found cookbook writing to not be her forte.  Not only in the brownie recipe she writes about how nice the brownies are, not too sweet (made with brown sugar) etc, but when she lists the ingredients, brown sugar is not mentioned, but white granulated sugar is. To ice my cake, the brownies need A LOT longer than she states in her book as the cooking time.  Needless to say, I will NOT be using this book again as I have found it to be as its title states truly a "pie in the sky" as all the recipes are just that. 
 I bought that last cd and it SUCKED! The singer sings monotone the whole entire time and doesn't have any variations of tone. The music isn't half bad, it isn't great, but it certainly isn't so good that i can ignore the lame-o singer. its just terrible terrible terrible. if you listen to anything that i say hear this: do not buy this album, you will regret it for all of eternity!  -steve (music master) 
 I got one word: RETARDED. It fits this album and also every one of the reviewers here, that gave this bs more than one star. 
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 In general, I don't think much of the manufacture of the scrubs that are sold for medical professionals.  I thought Dickies would be the best, but found they are mostly like the others.  After I received these, I ordered Dove Apparel, which are more expensive but thicker of material and sturdier of make 
 As a Sinatra fan, I can tell you that this does not represent his best output. I hate to be cynical but part of me wonders if this album was prompted by a desire to squeeze just a bit more cash out of some tired old numbers.  There was no point getting Sinatra to re-record a selection of favourites - he was too old and his voice had all but gone (let's face it).  So why not get him to croak a few lines and then fill in the gaps with some lesser stars and then market it as a duets album?  The instrumental arrangements and the band itself are great.  But the singing is at best uninteresting and at worst laughable.  The duet with Bono is a complete joke, the one with Barbara Streisand tedious and uninspiring.  In fact, just about the only one that is at all enjoyable is the duet of Summer Wind with Julio Iglesias.  No, this is not a good album and the third-rate quality of it is highlighted by the rumour that Sinatra pre-recorded his bits and the others filled in the gaps later. I find that very easy to believe.  There are so many good Sinatra albums and collections around, so why would you bother with this offering?  Go listen to him in his prime 
 It's possible to write an outstanding book about a board game.  It's called "Word Freak," by Stephan Fatsis, and it's a bizarre and engaging look into the world of competitive Scrabble.  "Monopoly: The Story Behind the World's Best-Selling Game" is not even in the same league as "Word Freak."  Most of the book actually is about Atlantic City, not Monopoly.  There are a couple of pages of the history of the game, along with some neat photos of original versions (a round board!), but after that, the book goes downhill.  The rest of the book is basically a discussion of the namesakes of the properties on the Monopoly board (which are all named after streets in Atlantic City).  There's plenty of historical photos of the city, but not much else in the way of Monopoly.  What I wanted to read about was the game.  The book briefly mentioned house rules, but I wanted much more on that.  How were the tokens decided on?  Why do the games no longer include the cannon and battleship tokens?  What about Monopoly tournaments?  I've even heard about *underwater* Monopoly tournaments, but there's no mention of them here.  How about strategies to win?  How about a listing of all the many, many variations of the game?    There's so much you could do with this book, but the author chose to take a different route.  He should have used a different title, too, because this book doesn't live up to the one he chose 
 Our family loves the first three "Home Alone" movies. But this fourth in the series is a dud. They keep the same character names as the first two movies, but they are totally different actors playing the parts. They should have just made up new characters.  Secondly, in this movie there is very little of the slapstick humor which made the first three so funny. In the first three, the boy set elaborate traps which the bad guys fell for. In this fourth movie, there are few traps set, and they are not original or that funny.  One other disappointing aspect of this fourth movie - in this movie the family is being broken apart by divorce. Although the divorce is not final yet, the husband has already moved in with his girlfriend and is getting engaged. Not the best for family values!  Overall, we were very disappointed with this movie, which provided few laughs. Stick with the first three if you want a movie to keep you laughing 
 it's a blank mini sd, nothing recognizes it.  I tried it on my laptop, a mini sd reader on my desktop, and on my pda; doesn't work.  it's either defective or just a blank case with nothing in it.  i'm trying to return it now.  such a waste of time 
 I am a stay-at-home mom looking for simple - yet unique - ways to say "thank you, congratulations, I'm sorry ..." to various people.  This book devotes much of its pages to business-related writing, which I no longer need.  While I have found a few nuggets of inspiration here and there, I am not particularly inspired by her suggestions of using, "I love it!" for a thank you note or "thinking of you" for a sympathy card.  I could probably have come up with those on my own 
 I thought this would be a great first book for my son since it is a "classic" and all, but the hardbook edition isn't all that fun for baby. Each page has something that the baby can see and touch i.e. he/she can actually "pat the bunny" and feel a sonft, furry bunny. Some pages are just too harsh, for example one page says baby can feel daddy's stubble or something like that, and there's a picture of a man shaving with a piece of sandpaper on his cheek! Needless to say, that page is too harsh for baby's soft skin and he didn't really like that. Other pages tell baby to put his/her finger inside a hole and do some other activities which are just bland. And the colors throughout the book are rather pale. Baby likes a lot of his other books with more mirrors and colors, and books that are soft so he can eat them 
 Blue Underground have done it again. They've dredged up old bootleg footage and are selling this as an "x-rated version." Quality is junk. I will never buy a Blue Undergound DVD and would warn others not to. The inserted footage is merely that inserted. I think the inserted footage came from a fifth generation bootleg VHS. This film is junk. I also am really shocked at amazon carrying porn, and also I think Blue Undergound are actually breaking the law because this film is sold in all 50 states. There are many communities, locales, areas and states where adult material is specifically prohibited by law. Even if this is 35 year old porn - it is still porn. It would be great to see Blue Underground busted for selling this smut -- because they have done a really rotten botched job and are outright liars in deceiving us 
 It must be fabulous, simply FABULOUS to have perfect children and be practically perfect in every way!!   Yo, Muff. You need to up the dose on that bitter pill and work on that condescending, superior attitude.  It's not quite oozing out of every pore yet.  Toodles now! I'm off to scrapbook, which is really just an extension of what our mothers and their mothers before them did in keeping a journaled photo album of our milestones.  A gift I treasure to this day.    
 This product was purchased as a Christmas gift and unfortunately did not work as advertised.  The projection light only was operational when touched - perhaps this was defective.  I have returned the product for a refund and am awaiting the refund.  
 I hoped I could leave the theatre, but I was hoping it would get better. Here let me put it this way: 3-D sucked Plot sucked Actors sucked Movie sucked PLEASE DON'T MAKE A SEQUEL!!! 
 When a historian deliberately sets out to idolize a conqueror, no matter how great, he or she has himself or herself to blame for being disbelieved.  I don't know any modern biographer of Alexander except William Tarn who took such a one-sided attitude to this man.  This book even claims that now an "accurate, balanced, and convincing" biographty is possible (implying you know which book meets this high standard).  I beg to differ.  It really bothers me when a historian refuses to face reality.  Though I am an admirer of the great king, I think Rogers's whole perspective is wrong.  He seems to think that Alexander did what he did in order to create a sort of commonwealth for all "sons of Zeus" - including the Persians, the Indians, etc. - all for their benefit.  Even worse, Rogers compares Alexander with Truman and Churchill, because Truman atomic bombed Japan and Churchill made a mistake in World War I which cost some innocent lives.  Leaving aside his comparison of Alexander with Mozart for the moment - he makes this comparison because Mozart also "disturbs our rest" - I don't see how a fair-minded person, let alone a historian, can say such things.  Had Japan not been atomic bombed, Japan would not have surrendered, and an invasion of mainland Japan had been estimated to cost a million GIs - dead - and who knows how many more Japanese lives?  As for Churchill, it is one thing to make a tactical error, but quite another to kill people as the aggressor.  It is clear that Rogers does not even care to look objective.  It is a wonder that he doesn't compare Alexander with George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Mother Theresa.  The assertion, which Rogers repeatedly makes, that Alexander was no Hitler or Stalin is, on the face of it, quite correct.  But it that saying much for the blood-soaked invader?  Hitler and Stalin are quite plainly the worst mass-murderers in all history.  So I'm not sure what Rogers is really aiming to prove here, except that no comparison is too extreme for him to support that particular viewpoint which he holds.  Clearly, Alexander's homosexuality is something Rogers is uncomfortable with.  So he adds this bombshell after all the rationalizing: "Yet the umambiguous evidence that sex was central to their [Alexander with Hephaeistion] relationship is conspicuously absent."  One needs to be a lawyer to parse this sentence, but I can think of no easier way for a historian to weasel out of this fact about Alexander than such a precise statement.  You want to know what is "unambiguous evidence," what "central" means, and above all what Rogers means by "sex."  Robin Lane Fox and Peter Green certainly believed Alexander's relationship with Hephaeistion was sexual.  Paul Cartledge also.  Indeed most reputable biographers admitted as much.  Tarn, for obvious reasons, did not.  But then I suppose no amount of evidence would seem "unambiguous" enough for Rogers - short of a baby!  Even then Rogers would doubt such a baby would prove anything, DNA testing not yet available then to establish paternity.  Can I blame Rogers?  It wasn't so long ago that a well-known public figure claimed he didn't have a sexual relationship (just "an inappropriate relationship") with his intern because, as it turned out, he had defined "sex" as full intercourse only.  I suppose there are some things two men can't do with each other no matter how hard they try (like making a baby).  I hope you have an idea by now the premises from which Rogers attempts to argue throughout this book.  The trouble with Alexander is that there are different ways to look at the facts, and the facts themselves are often hard to come by.  Rogers's claim to "accuracy, balance, and conviction" is not as simple as the "ABC" which these words happen to stand for, when it comes to so elusive a figure.  The very ancient nature of the saga is a problem, for we must rely on the veracity and the resources of the ancient historians, like Arrian, who themselves wrote long after the events.  But it does startle me when a writer takes an interpretation which differs so much from the ones I know from the biographies written by A. R. Burn, Lane Fox, Green, Paul Cartledge (the recent addition) and especially A. B. Bosworth - all highly reputable historians of Alexander and specialists of ancient Greece.  I may be wrong, but I smell something fishy about this book.    
 If this is your first Barbara Taylor Bradford book, you may never pick up another one.  I, on the other hand, like to give an author the three strikes rule, so won't hesitate to try something else, but it won't be very soon.  If you want to read one of her novels, do NOT start with this one like I did.  This is very boring--like snails serving as soap stars--not to mention slow and predictable.  I listened to the entire thing on cd, but think it was mostly because I liked Ms. O'Karma's narration--she has an appealingly smokey voice like Carolyn Jones from the Adams Family.  It still couldn't save this story with its endless self-serving "what-about-ME!" mantras and Valentine's overly moralistic attitude.  I'm the same way, and I bore myself!  You knew from page one where this story was going, and the dialog was as insufferable as the descriptions of everything from food and clothing to moths reproducing on peeling wallpaper.  "I was a war photographer and my mommy was mean to me" resounds every other page, yet she wants to get away from all of that.  Nothing's worse than a character or real person who brags, then turns around and screams "Look at me, look at me...How DARE you look at me?!"  
 This book is only for those who manage a BI project development. If you are not involved in this sector, don't buy it 
 I am so disappointed.  I remember doing this as a child with far superior results.  Why do they have to make toys so cheaply now.  I would gladly pay more for a toy that actually does what it says.  It does not spin fast enough to evenly distribute paint.  My daughter has not seemed to mind yet and is enjoying the toy but knowing how it should operate I am very disappointed.  
 i bought the book to make this incredible guitar birdhouse. when i gathered all the stuff and went to copy the pattern part was missing. i contacted sunset ,thye cant help me because that one was outsourced and not available, i was told it was left out intentionally to make me use my imagination/it was not a simple piece. it was the part where the keys and strings attach.i think i wasted my money. it was for a charity.   
 I usually read through one of Coulter's novel in a few days, exspecially her FBI/intrigue plots. I bought this as soon has it was released in paperback and still haven't finished it. The plot was slow and the main heroine a little too likable. Spoiler: Neighborhood teenagers diving on her body to protect her from bullets?! Talk about a work of fiction. No one expects a romance to be on our plane of reality, but in the same solar system would be nice 
 Regarding the intent of the American Idol competition, Simon Cowell has put it nicely and correctly on numerous occasions.  He constantly reminds, "This is a singing competition.  Not a dancing competition.  Not a beauty pageant.  Not an acting contest!"  Pretty correct if you ask me.  Along comes DREAM GIRLS and it seems high time that the Academy Awards heeded Cowell's astute advice in the reverse.  Someone at the Oscars needs to wake up and realize that the Academy Awards is not a singing competition.  Instead it's all about the acting and, arguably, DREAM GIRLS offers the definitive case in point.  To put it bluntly, Jennifer Hudson's acting performance was, for lack of a better description, hilarious.  The girl can't act and yet she toted away one of the preeminent Oscars of the year.  But don't take my word for it.  Virtually every serious movie critic, when considering DREAM GIRLS, noted what I have already stated.  They all agreed that Hudson's performance was amateurish at best and that she would, nonetheless, win because of her singing.  Think about it.  The movie was nominated for more awards than any other film and came away virtually empty-handed.  Now why is that?  Quite simply it's because the movie fell flat and considerably short of the movies that ultimately won.  Most honest critics, as well, were quick to note that, had things gone the way they should have, Eddie Murphy would have won and not Hudson.  Some have even been so bold as to note that Murphy's singing is nearly as good as Hudson's.  I heartily agree.  But, then, the Academy Awards continue their downhill slide toward being totally hilarious in their own right.  Anymore, movies seem to win more on the basis of PR and marketing campaigns than on actual merit.  And, as DREAM GIRLS and Hudson illustrate, sometimes it seems the Academy likes to promote a controversy as much as an actual success.  Watch this one if you want a good laugh.  Other than that don't waste the time or the money.  THE HORSEMAN 
 There was no indication prior to purchase that the ramp would need to be secured to another surface thru nails or bolts. My son saved up to buy this thinking he could use it on a sidewalk or road. He could not. It is too light to maintain any stability without being fastened to another surface 
 Here's a key to a "choosing" happiness: Go through life so vapidly that redecorating truly makes you happy. Here's the trick - get born rich. Born so rich that you can never conceive of happiness as being something other than a personal choice, as if unhappiness is caused by refusing to go on a shopping spree or jet to Paris. This book consists largely of (pink) quotations, listing the inanities of her friends and relatives amongst wisdom from Sartre and Gandhi. The rest, unintentionally sad and unintentionally funny platitudes that reveal a woman who lists her profession as "noted thinker" but has all the depth of a full-length mirror 
 Some exercises at the end of each chapter can be calculated with somewhat simpler formulas than the ones in the book. The organization of the book is acceptable but it does NOT give thorough explanations by "showing" with example calculations.  Therefore, ONLY FEW formulas are presented in the book. This book is not user friendly, especially for students 
 I watched Kramer vs. Kramer and came away laughing during most of the movie. I have never seen people take themselves so seriously, trapped in a land of esoteric garble.   Hoffman's character, Ted, needs to grow some balls, and learn how to make coffee, as he is over the age of 40. Streep's character needs to refill her Prozac script and start reading Sylvia Plath, maybe that would make her somewhat interesting.  Sex is out of the question with such a placid, dull woman: just go to the morgue, it would have more passionate hunks of humanity, and probably smarter, too.  The most hilarious line was in the coutroom when Streep's character said:   " Ted was unable to deal with my feelings and this lowered my self-esteem. I've worked very hard to be a whole human being. And I don't think I should be punished for that."  Woe is me! How is this idiotic woman being punished! Being forced to move from the Upper West side to the Upper East side or maybe the real punishment was switching from Espresso to Maxwell House coffee? Oh, The Humanity of it ALL!!!!  And the child doesn't need his parents: he needs six to ten years of special ed. 
 I share my bad experience with Seiko Monster and some say Im stirring up trouble. Hey, we're in a democracy when I last checked. Duh.  Yeah maybe I am spreading the word about my faulty Seiko Monster but that's the TRUTH and I want others to know that my Seiko Monster was defective. At least Im not a dumb fanatic Seiko Monster cultist who idolizes this watch with a candle-lit shrine, chants, and ritual. For crying out loud, it's just a watch, an inanimate spiritless object, that does not have feelings or civil rights! But it did hurt that I wasted $150 for this bad watch. I dont care about giving the watch a chance, regulating, breaking it in, etc. What happened to my Seiko Monster is that it stopped, which is not good, so I returned for an exchange. 
 This is a poor excuse for a thriller.  It lacked suspense, was too unbelievable, and wallowed in gut-churning violence.  The psychiatrist, Dr. Frank Clevenger, is given too much time and power by the police to help solve the hostage crisis, especially considering that psychopath Trevor Lucas has already mutilated one person and is likely to endanger the lives of the other people he has hostage (including a pregnant woman).  Clevenger is a hard person to sympathize with, what with his drug addiction and penchant for call girls (I also found it unbelievable that he could function very well while on heroin, and that no one-- not even police officers-- could recognize his condition).  Not only that, Clevenger's success in tracking down Lucas' brother relied too much on luck and coincidence, and the ending was too neat and tidy, especially given the intelligence and volatile nature of Lucas, and the depth and complexity of his problems.  Very unsatisfying thriller 
 The friends of and people know to Chicago Lt. Jacqueline "Jack" Daniels are being targeted for torture and murder by someone connected by the convicted "Gingerman" serial killer.    I really did enjoy Konrath's first two books.  But this one left me with a hangover.  I love the characters of Jack and her partner Herb, and the humor in the writing.  I did get tired of constant description of every item of clothing Jack was wearing and the label attached thereto.  I don't even mind dark and gruesome as long as there's a real purpose to it.  But this felt, to me, as though the author couldn't think of an original plot so he merely picked up on a theme and had a joyous time describing as many ways possible that one human being can torture themselves or another.  It is a quick read, it does have humor, it is absolutely not for those who don't like graphic violence.  I think it's time for me to go on the wagon where Konrath is concerned 
 I have to admit that my wife read this book first and said it was slow.  She didn't say how slow though.  But rather than take her word for it (why should I?  After all, she's my wife) I bothered to pick it up and read it.  How I wish I had listened to her and left it in the box of stuff for the rummage sale.  I cannot stand Baldacci's juvenile charactor dialog, but finish it I did though most of it I could have read through closed eyes and not missed anything.  I'll stick with my Nelson DeMille from here on if I want literary junk food 
 This is the perfect example of why black women and women in general are disrespected. Lil kim is teaching generations of women to be nasty as you can be and to disrespect yourself. Then to top all of this off she is still hanging on the coat tails of biggie, the ultra fantasy gangsta rapper. Queen latifah never had to talk like this to get her name out or to make good music. This is ridiculous! Kim would be better off in a porn movie than in the rap game. Please please please spare us and stop rapping 
 Everything I have to say has been said in the title, but let me chatter on for a bit.  While Bowie contributed to punk rock, he is not very good at it.  (He's far too intellectual, musical and pretty.)  The Sex Pistols were scary and musically challenged and THEY were good at it.  You needed a con artist like Johnny Rotten to pull this stuff off and it had to be done between 1979 and 1983, a time when music itself really needed to be trashed.  Bowie may have felt the need to trash it again, but he was lashing out more at his own commercialism than society in general.    He claims in his 50th birthday interview that he used Tin Machine as a refuge from the dehumanized, commercial experience of "Let's Dance" and "Never Let Me Down."  He wanted to hide inside a band.  He also likes The Pixies.  I'm sure The Pixies offer something, as Bono and others can't get enough of them either.  But I really don't like them and Tin Machine gives me the same kind of migranes.  A lot of yelling and noise and not a lot of melody.  For all of the raving about how innovative the Pixies were, I just keep hearing a lame mixture of the Talking Heads and The Sex Pistols.  I guess I don't have enough brain damage yet.  I need to remain in light.  Bowie is a politician too, and he has to keep all of his constituents happy.  Some of them might get violent, so we get "Tin Machine."  Since he combines great elegance with great crudeness, his audience includes me and people who like "Tin Machine."  To me, the crudeness only works when it is handled elegantly, which is not the case here.    The few times I listened to this cd, my thoughts were - he's toying anachronisticallly with real punk and IT'S NOT WORKING.  (It can work beautifully the other way around though, as evidenced in Public Image Ltd.'s "9," also released in 1989.  Why would I ever listen to "Tin Machine" when I can listen to "9," where punk, New Wave and pop music are combined to produce some of the best music I've heard?))  Fortunately, things got straightened out somewhat with "Earthling" and then there's high quality material on "Hours", "Heathen" and "Reality".  
 This should be called the "John Ford tiny collection", as most of his major films are not included. Even "John Ford the early years" would at least alert customers to the fact that this is only a small sampling of Ford's work.  Shame on Amazon for their collaboration in this matter, and for advertising the John Wayne/John Ford collection so closely that it is easy to mistake one for the other. 
 Like so many bad, bad movies, this book is a beautiful production.  It features slick, heavy paper; a million color pictures; attractive, readable typeface; witty contributors.  Its proportions seem just right for its weight.  But unless you just love grazing on hors d'oeuvres (and many do), you're likely to be disappointed by this beautiful but cynical exercise in marketing to the culturally insecure.  As somebody has already noted: No Iliad.  No Odyssey. No Aeschylus. No Euripides. No Boccaccio. No Chaucer. No Dante.  No Machiavelli. No Shakespeare. No Marlowe.   No Old or New Testament. No Q'uran. No Lao-tse, Confucius, Bhagavda-Gita (really short and really good). No Beowulf. No Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.  In fact, only 13 works from before 1700 make the cut - and lest you think fun is the criterion, one of them is John Lyly's Euphues long regarded as one of the most unreadable and, shall we say, "affected" works in English literature. You get John Lyly instead of John Milton.     On the other hand, you do get 69 titles of books that have appeared since 2000.  That's a lot of "classics" in record time.  How did they pick these?  And there's another 700 - out of 1001, if you can dig it, "you must read before you die" written in the 20th Century.  The 19th Century is well represented, I'll grant. Huck Finn is here - but not Twain's more complicated Letters from the Earth, The Mysterious Stranger, A Connecticut Yankee, or Pudd'nhead Wilson.    They also felt it necessary to fill out the list with a few short stories like Lovecraft's "The Mountains of Madness" and Gogol's "The Nose."  Great stories, but two actual books had to go to make room for them.  Books like The Red Badge of Courage, for example.    Or maybe The Red Badge got crowded out by Justine or American Psycho.  This is a book for people who like to read about books in snappy reviews, and look at color pictures of books. You'll find some titles worth pursuing, but you could do better, for starters, just by getting a list of Cliff's Notes titles and going on from there.   You can do that for free 
 I am so disappointed that it did not have any closed caption or subtitle for the deaf.  I had to return it 
 David Reynolds' primary thesis makes this an interesting and useful book on the events leading up to the Civil War, but in making it he frequently over-reaches and, worse, must stand charged with faulty thinking, logic and historical writing.    This key passage, at pages 8-9, is particularly troubling:  "My stand on some key issues is: (a) Brown was not insane; instead, he was a deeply religious, flawed, yet ultimately noble reformer; (b) the Pottawatomie affair was indeed a crime, but it was a war crime committed against proslavery settlers by a man who saw slavery as an unprovoked war of one race against another; and (c) neither Brown's provisional constitution nor the Harpers Ferry raid were wild-eyed, erratic schemes doomed to failure; instead, they reflect Brown's overconfidence in whites' ability to rise above racism and in blacks' willingness to rise up in armed insurrection against their masters."  Setting aside the possibility that deeply religious and flawed individuals also can be quite insane, it is disturbing that Reynolds seems to be strongly implying or hinting that a war crime somehow is more acceptable than an ordinary crime.   Surely in Bleeding Kansas, proslavery thugs were committing crimes and perhaps on the ground that they were defending their war against another race, but their crimes, war crimes or not, did not justify Brown's massacre at Pottawatomie. The fact that his goal or intent may have been in the name of a noble cause did not mitigate the nature of the offence.   I doubt that as a Professor at the Baruch College, Reynolds could find many of his colleagues who would write such a passage and I think they, in fact, might be outraged by this passage from the chapter on Pottawatomie:  "The Pottawatomie killings were not admirable or legally defensible. But they were explainable, given John Brown's makeup as it intersected with special conditions of time and place, and given long-term social tensions that led to these conditions." (p. 139). Readers seeing "explainable" following the citation of an atrocity are compelled to beware of the author's moral sensibilities. "Explaining" can often be an oxymoron for "justifying" or "mitigating".   Reynolds appears to be partial to a "cold-blooded killer" by understating, if not excusing, the immensity of his acts. Replace the words "John Brown's" in this sentence with "Adolph Hitler's" and "Pottawatomie killings" with "holocaust killings" and see how it would scan: "The holocaust killings were not admirable or legally defensible. But they were explainable, given Adolph Hitler's makeup as it intersected with special conditions of time and place, and given long-term social tensions that led to these conditions." If one can damn with feint praise, one can justify with feigned condemnation.  I'm sure that Reynolds' judgment is correct as to Brown's overconfidence in whites' ability to rise above racism and in blacks' willingness to rise up in armed insurrection.  Everything one reads about the era suggests that racism was the overwhelming attitude of whites both North and South, and that armed insurrection by blacks was a relative rarity.  The logic of the sentence, therefore is unsupported because it surely was precisely Brown's complete misreading (Reynolds calls it overconfidence) that made the raid, at least, wild-eyed, one definition of which means to be unrealistic. In common parlance, then, if someone engages in schemes, however, well-intentioned, that are out-of-touch with the way things are, we call them and their schemes wild-eyed.  Clearly, Brown rejected the non-violence of many abolitionists.  but the foregoing passages leave the reader with the very uncomfortable feeling that Reynolds is prepared to minimize heinous acts because they are committed in a righteous cause or because of the "makeup" of those who commit them and the circumstances of the time and place in which they are committed. There are few, if any, historical figures who at the same time may have been called "noble reformers" and "cold-blooded killers".  It just may be that the disturbing passages noted above reflect Reynolds'effort to demonstrate that Brown was such a unique figure and in doing so his book may skid perilously on the edge of a moral morass.   Other passges suggest the author's judgement may be highly flawed.  Example.  On page 210, after quoting a Brown statement made before George Stearn, Reynolds writes: "..the Stearnses son Carl, not yet three, remembered it as an adult."  This is not believable because it is implausible, yet Reyonolds seems to accept it, and, perhaps, uses such a memory as a source for the quotation, or at least so the reader is left to believe.  Example. On page 230, referring to Carlyle's work on Cromwell, Reynolds says Carlye "shrugged off [major blots on Cromwell's reputation]"as excusable measures for stern times".  Although apparently critical of such shrugging off, Reynolds seems to be guilty of the same sin with respect to Brown's reputation.   Example. At the beginning of Chapter 17,Reynolds launches into what he styles a "countefactual" historical analysis; that is, an informed guess as to how things might have been if Brown hadn't lived or hadn't done what he did.  He calls this useful. A careful reader, and I suspect better historians, would call such exercises something else: nonsense or worse.  By extracting an historical person or event from history leaves an historian not with informed guess work, but rather nothing but unfounded imaginings because he or she cannot account for an infinitude of combinations and permutations of what otherwise may have happened. No reasonable conclusions, therefore, can be drawn from such a panoply of "what ifs".  If Reyonolds prefers to write fiction, then perhaps he should simply become a novelist and not pretend to be a historian.  This book has the merit of showing the importance and impact of John Brown on antebellum America, North and South, but it displays the weaknesses of its author who overstates his case and is prepared to employ exaggeration and poor judgement in  his effort to persuade his audience.  Bottom line: Every line must be weighed carefully before it is accepted. Reader beware 
 As I was reading this, I kept shaking my head.  This book didn't really give me a lot of help.  There really isn't much in here that I couldn't find in a lot of other, much better, books.  I found the advice to be plain wrong in some cases, ill-advised in others.  And the author's attitude bothered me.  It was off-putting.    It wasn't a really horrible book, which is why it got two stars, but I've read books that gave me a lot more help.  If you're insistent on buying this book, though, my copy will be up for sale.  :) 
 The script for this flick is great. So the flick has its moments. It could've been a real solid film.  What went wrong? First, casting. Eugene (Silverman) was spot-on for the role and he played the role perfectly. He should be commended for his performance. The father also, in a minor role, did the same. So congrats to them. Unfortunately you cannot ignore the rest. Feh... casting! Really what burns this movie is the poor performance of the Jewish mothers--both Aunt Blanche and Eugene's mom. They negate the comedic effect of the movie, which is just as important as Eugene's bit. The essence here behind all the drama is Eugene versus his mother but in a light way. A funny way. But the Jewish women are harsh Valkyires; they deliver their lines without a bit of the comedic chutzpah intended.  The last strike against it is that it wavers between being a converted theater (play) script and a regular Hollywood movie. What I mean by this is that quite a few scripts have been converted to a movie style, for example Biloxi Blues the sequel, David Mamet's films, and others. Then there are those films that seem scripted, as if we are watching a theater production--a conversion from the stage to the silver screen. This can work really well. Yet the screenwriters/directors did not make a decision whether to go toward one direction or the other.  It's all a shame. Eugene's monologues with the viewer (again, something we mostly see in theater drama not movies) are golden. The jokes are great. But the rest is just poorly adapted.   Should I recommend this movie? I want to because of the plot and Eugene's performance but at the same time there are so many problems it bothers me. So here's my rec... watch the movie Biloxi Blues, the next part in the series. Biloxi Blues is a better movie, better written, better acted, etc. Get a feel for the character. Then watch this one. If not, do not bother.  
 If you got Elvis Presley and Dodie Marshall and put them in the same film you will have Easy Come Easy Go, an Elvis Presley that people who like boats or sailing or both will love. But anybody that hates boats or sailing and is an Elvis Presley fan will be un-happy. And Elvis' leading lady in this film is Dodie Marshall which I guess is a re-make of a film with the same name came out in 1947. And this is one of final films that Elvis sings the same song with somebody else, and the song is Yoga Is As Yoga Goes. He sings that with Elsa Lanchester who plays a not very nice yoga teacher. If you are an Elvis Presley fan, then buy or rent Jailhouse Rock on video or dvd 
 This book was poorly written.  The relation between the two stories was minimal.  The story was hard to follow, 'cause I can't read when I fall asleep from boredom.  The descriptions gave me no pictures in my mind, Dr. Hamiska was a big blur, and I only got a picture of the heat, which I honestly don't CARE about.  It was a real page turner...I was eager to finish the book, and get it over with.  I wouldn't have read it if my teacher didn't assign it.  My dog refused to eat the pages I ripped out, and seemed to, much like me, think the book stunk 
 Maybe it was me, but I kept wanting this book to work and it just never grabbed me and I had to put it down.  It was almost aggravating 
     The reactionary authors of this book, as well as many of the reviewers on this page, apparently believe that there is nothing at all wrong with forcing their religious views on others.  They castigate the ACLU, probably the finest organization in America, for defending civil rights they would rather see stripped away.  The authors seize upon some sensationalistic, controversial cases the ACLU has defended, while ignoring the vast amount of good the ACLU has done for society.  Although the authors ignore the fact, the ACLU has defended both the left AND the right in many cases.  Ironically, if it ever came to pass, the ACLU would also certainly fight for the right of the authors to spread their lies through this book.      This book is written from a far right-wing viewpoint by people who want America to be a church-run theocracy, forcing all minorities to bend to the will of the religious majority.  Sorry, but that is the reason our forebearers fled to this country--to escape the religious persecution the authors and most of the reviewers on this page would like to force down the throats of the American people.  As the old saying goes, if you want a theocracy, go to Iran. The last time religion reigned was during the dark ages, when religious ignorance was more powerful than reason.  The authors would love to return our society to the dark ages.     The ACLU is a beacon of hope and freedom in these dark times.  Join today to protect your freedoms and fight the cowards who would strip them away. 
 If you're a fan of Mineo's and you're looking to add another piece of material to a media collection, buy this book and keep it on a shelf somewhere.  If you would prefer to gain some insight into a complicated life, move on.  This is the kind of biography I abhor:  its content is almost entirely derived from fan magazines, press releases and newspaper clippings.  To make matters even worse, it attempts to pass itself off as a serious work when it should be mass paperback sized and sold alongside the Jonbenet Ramsey and Scott Peterson quickie books at the supermarket.  Peppered throughout the book is superfluous information that appears to have no value aside from increasing the page count(for instance, an entire page is devoted to listing the contents of the theatre owners press book for "Crime in the Streets.")  So many people who were a part of Mineo's personal and professional life are alive and the author appears not to have contacted any of them, conducted one interview or gathered any new material whatsoever.  What makes that even more frustrating is that the author was acquainted with Mineo during the last several years of his life and alludes that writing this book was a mission he needed to undertake. Unfortunately the inclusion of a few of his personal conversations with Mineo (some having to do with Mineo's rather convenient wish that the author write his Bio) are no substitute for a well researched biography and the insights of an expert.  If you'd like to read a fascinating book on a somewhat similar person, find a copy of Charles Winecoff's "Split Image: The Life of Anthony Perkins.&quot 
 I am a soldier in Iraq, and I thought you could play it on a regular DVD player or computer, I was wrong.  Dont buy any HD movies if you do not have an HD DVD player already 
 This is an abyssally written, horribly researched, inaccurate, unorganized babble of idle gossip about some truly great artists and writers. The author should not attempt to write about things beyond his limited ken.  What a travesty that a publisher would agree to print such garbage 
 I would agree with most of the negative reviews this book has received so far, and history has indeed been re-written. While Mick Taylor's role in the Stones' career could not be overstated, it is Bill Wyman's virtual absence that is the most shocking.  Most of the band's shots from the 70's, but especially the 80's and 90's seem to deliberately leave him out.  This is insulting to any self-respecting Stones fan and quite a disappointment (although not a complete surprise).  As everyone knows, Bill was an original member of the band and his career as a Stone lasted almost 40 years.  The Mick'n'Keef show could never have existed without the steadfast rythm section that anchored the band throughout most of its history.  Shame on the other Stones for going out their way to practically eliminate Bill Wyman from this biography.  And who exactly does Mick Jagger think he is fooling when he sings about neo-cons, then proceeds to pick Ameriquest, one of the worst predatory lenders in America, as a tour sponsor?  Who said the Stones aged gracefully?  Get Bill's book instead.   
 Nothing innovative or exciting. Anyone who does not know this stuff should not be in business or in a leadership positio 
 ...as soon as you listen to it once, you're going to want the Complete Sessions boxset!  : 
 As someone who studied meta-mathematics at Caltech and UCLA, I found this book disappointing-stylistically, mathematically and philosophically. To paraphrase the physicist Pauli, this isn't right; this isn't even wrong. This well-meaning man's editors should do a little bit of legwork before reprinting a man's inflated self-appraisal. I am so disappointed in this book that I am seriously considering returning it for a refund.   I guess I should blame myself. My first response to the editorial comment naming the author as the intellectual heir to Gdel and Turing was, "Gregory who?" Shelah, Solovay, Martin: these are names I know, but who is Gregory Chaitin? I should have gone with my gut. In retrospect, it is telling that all the jacket quotes are from freewheeling authors of popularizations, not from respected philosophers, logicians, or scientists.  The entire book is written in an embarrassingly gushing, adolescent style full of boldface and exclamation points. I know that the author was trying to write an enthusiastic, accessible book of philosophical and methodological advocacy, but this doesn't excuse shoddy editorial craftsmanship.   Don't take my word for it. Let the author speak for himself. From page 7, "Gdel's 1931 work on incompleteness, Turing's 1936 work on uncomputability, and my own work on the role of information, randomness and complexity have shown increasingly emphatically that the role that Hilbert envisioned for formalism in mathematics is best served by computer programming languages[.]"   Imagine if a working composer wrote, "Bach's preludes and fugues, Beethoven's symphonies, and my own string quartets have shown increasingly emphatically..." This man's reputation in his declared field is nowhere near his apparent stature in his own mind. The ideas discussed in this book are worthy of late-night musings over a nice brandy, or maybe a Scientific American article, but only after extensive revision. They are not ready for publication in a monograph.  From pages 148-149, "This book is full of amazing case studies of new, unexpected math ideas that reduced the complicated to the obvious. And I've come up with a few of these ideas myself. How does it feel to do that? [...] You have to be seized by a demon, and our society doesn't want too many people to be like that! [...] In fact, I only really feel alive when I'm working on a new idea, when I'm making love to a woman (which is also working on a new idea, the child we might conceive) or when I'm going up a mountain! It's intense, very intense. [...] I push everything else away. [...] I don't pay the bills. [...] And you can't force yourself to do it, any more than a man can force himself to make love to a woman he doesn't want. [...] People may think that something's wrong with me, but I'm okay, I'm more than okay."  And there you have it. I was hoping for a book to catch me up on some of the recent advances in meta-mathematics and how these ideas bear on science and philosophy. For a far better viewpoint on how information science influences modern physics, check out Charles Seife, Decoding the Universe. 
 I love Jane Austen.  I firmly believe that if Jane were to time travel to the future she would throw this book in the trash were it belongs and run, not walk; back to her time travel machine. She would  return to her own time where garbage like this would not have gotten published .  It was predictable, ridiculous and poorly written.  The names of the characters all throw back to Jane Austen stories, including the cat(Wickham!?!?!)  I am all for escapist reading but this was un-readable and left me angry and annoyed.  If I could time travel I would travel to the author's home pre-publish time and erased every copy !!! 
 The author examines Genesis from a strict fundamentalist/literalist/"scientific creationism" point of view. Typical quotes from the book are: "The other books of the Pentateuch,  Moses wrote out of his experience, but not Genesis. Genesis he learned at  his mother's knee." "The basic command for all living things is  that each reproduce 'after its kind'... It is the rock upon which the whole  theory of evolution perishes." "One great factor in precipitating  the Flood was the intercourse between 'the sons of God' and the daughters  of men that resulted in a demon progeny of extraordinary influence."  "Noah was fruitful... Three sons. That does not look like very much  fruit, but from those three sons every man, woman, and child on the planet  has descended." The book's principal weakness is that the author  continually draws conclusions from scripture that the text does not  substantiate. For example, about Joseph's brother Gad, a man of whom the  Bible tells us only his name, Phillips writes as follows: "There was  something about Gad that savored of the gang. He was the bully type, the  kind who would pick a fight when it was safe, when numbers were on his  side... Gad, the coward.&quot 
 Robert Mitchum was a good actor,but,as this album so abundantly proves,he was not a good singer...Now,don't get me wrong here,if some fan of a good actor wants other memorabilia by him/her that is thier right,but being of fan(even a really loyal fan)still does not mean that the actor or actress in question can pass muster as a vocalist...It really doesn't take too much effort to "sing"the sort of calypso tunes that take up a lot of the space on this disc...Mitchum can get by,but then so can I,probably so can you as well...But,honestly,neither one of us is the next Harry Belafonte,and,during his lifetime,neither was mitchum...Therefore,like most other celebrity "golden throat"vanity releases,Mitchum's two albums exist not because Bob Mitchum was such a great vocalist but,instead,because Bob Mitchum was a popular actor,wanted to sing,and his star status permitted him to record..many really talented vocalists should be so fortunate.. 
  Reading Dark Harbor is like watching a mediocre TV show that you can't be bothered to turn off. I listened to Dark Harbor as an audio book, so I don't feel too badly about wasting my time on it because I `read it' while I was doing other things that had to be done anyway, like driving.   If you are looking for something that feels fresh and new - Dark Harbor is not for you. This novel is about as innovative as an episode of Murder She Wrote. To illustrate: Stone Barrington and his cronies quickly deduce that an apparent suicide must have been a murder because the gun was found in the victim's wrong hand. (I think I actually saw that one on Murder She Wrote) Woods either can't be bothered to come up with a new idea or he simply doesn't care.   It is clear early on who is responsible for the murders in Dark Harbor. This isn't because the clues come together in any logical way, but rather because of the predictable nature of the novel. You can just tell. This doesn't mean that the solution makes sense. In fact, there are huge inconsistencies in the plot that make the ending feel forced.   It is as if Woods couldn't be bothered to think all of his plot lines through. Woods is compelled to include his regular characters in the novel even though they have little to do (except of course, to have sex with Stone). Holly barely says a word on her first trip to the island. On her second trip she has an obligatory romp with Stone and then gets kidnapped for the remainder of the novel.   Why was she kidnapped? I don't think anyone - including Woods - can answer that question in any plausible way. My theory is that Woods needed to work Holly into the plot and decided that putting her in peril would allow him to fill a few pages. It also allowed him to include Holly's dad (another regular character) in her search. Wood's motive seems obvious. The kidnapper's motive however isn't - her kidnapping makes no sense. But clearly this was something Woods didn't think was worth worrying about.   The best I can say about this novel is that it is a quick easy read (of course, in my case it was read to me). It may not be worth the time and trouble to actually read (and certainly not to buy) - but as an audio book from the library (with a limited selection of audio books to choose from) it helped me pass the time in traffic.   
 This is a tabloid, so most likely the stories you're reading are not true. Why would someone spend there hard earned money on a magazine that prints alot of unfounded rumors that alot times turns out to be just that, a rumor 
 All the reviews of this book that I read included the words "Well written". This book has a good language, and includes good information on several parts of the world. But it still lacks something. I believe that Hamish McRae has not put enough stress on some very important economic regions, such as South East Asia (the Indian SubContinent), Eastern Europe and Eastern Africa. The only reason why that could be is because of incomple research. This lets the readers draw wrong conclusions about these parts. I would not recommend this book to a friend or use it for any sort of research 
 This book is primarily for architects. It's covers a broad swath of ground in generic sweeping terms. When it does touch metal it covers the development of a web application for a tablet PC, which appears as largely unchanged from what it would look like in a standard web development environment.    The books first three chapters present an introduction and a business case for mobile computing. The fourth and fifth chapters provide a very high level overview of mobile devices and their variety. An example of the level of depth is on page 72 where the author writes; "Most, if not all, mobile devices have flat screens."     Chapters seven, eight and nine cover, again at a very high level, application design for almost any thin client application. It could be web, or mobile, or whatever.    Chapter ten covers the waterfall development model. Which I found really off tangent. I thought from here we would dig down. Instead we are building another information tower about project management and requirements gathering.    Chapter eleven is a case study which is at the level of UML, data model, page flow, and use cases. Chapters twelve and thirteen are also case studies at a similar level.    To get the "Full Microsoft .NET code examples for cell phones, Pocket PCs, and Tablet PCs" you need to go to Appendix B, which is the first sign of code in the book.    Can't say I recommend this book at all. At the level this book covers mobile development it is not significantly different from web development. And for front-line coders this book provides no practical insight whatsoever. I gave it two stars because it provides some interesting facts about mobile bandwidth, and because I find the writing to be better than average. Shame that they couldn't have delved deeper into this fascinating topic.  
 Darryl Worley's "Have You Forgotten" begs another, more relevant question -- "Do You Read the Paper." Despite the fact that Hussein's Iraq had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks, he justifies our illegal invasion and occupation of that sovereign nation with references to the Twin Towers. To xenophobes like Worley, the Middle East is just one big nation of indistinguishable brown people. He justifies our warmaking with cliched references to "our freedom," apparently oblivious to the irony that the Patriot Act -- passed in reaction to 9/11 -- has effectively cancelled the Bill of Rights. He accepts the Official Version of 9/11, despite the fact that the story has holes big enough to fly an airplane through. I've heard some pretty reactionary stuff on country radio before, but this song definitely takes the cake. 
 Many reviewers on this site read TLGPE in the 70's, when we were young and impressionable. (I happened to be 13 when I read it.) If one could be sued for intellectual forgery, Lindsey would certainly be found at fault.  Most of us, thankfully, have gotten past our fears that plagued our teenage years. After all, when we read TLGPE, we were young. We were searching and seeking. We didn't have all of the facts. There were wolves who knew this, and they preyed upon us. Many people who were older, yet still intellectually undeveloped, read this book and were moved to 'believing'.  For most of us, our minds matured. We began to see the vast chinks in Lindsey's pompous Christian armor. We began to realize that fear is a weapon brandished by madmen, by people who use a subtle, gentle cloth of manipulation to control others.  This is beyond dangerous. It is beyond extreme, as most of us have now found out.  I love a good horror novel. I love a good 'true crime' thriller. But the fact that people read Lindsey's books and take them at face value is, perhaps, one of the scariest notions I have ever imagined.  That, dear reader, is beyond horrific . . . and far more terrifying than anything you'll find in the bible or any of Lindeys 'books'. The only thing scarier is that Mr. Lindsey is still receiving royalties from an outdated, silly, contradictory and completely barbaric book penned over thirty years ago. Please don't be the next sucker. Please don't add this one to your cart.  
 This is the first review i've written and I just wanted to let people know that this in essence is a  good book....but only if your looking for drugs/medications as a priority to dealing with your hormonal problems. I ordered this book along with another book called "hormonal balance" and there's no comparing between the two. The other book talks indepth about exactly what your hormones do...and how they control your body. This book gives a short explanation followed by prescriptions that your doctor might advise...it has alternative treatments...but they are not very detailed...and focus more on "get more sleep....exercise....etc". All in all it's not a bad book...but there are definetly better one's out there 
 Ripping off King, but with more sex, shallower characters, and a Hollywood ending. Leave it on the shelf 
 BLACK CHRISTMAS is not as effective as HALLOWEEN. The killer is annoying, some gurgling lunatic who uses obscene language to get his point across. The direction and editing is weak. How many times do we have to see the woman wrapped in cellophane up in the attic...she's dead ..I get it...Move on! I wasnt routing for the characters or the killer for that matter...this movie just didnt deliver. HALLOWEEN and WHEN A STRANGER CALLS "borrowed" from this film and both movies were scarier 
 This book is not meant for self study. This book is too theoretical, and it does not give enough basic examples. It is too abstract. I do not recommend this book to anyone 
 The most boring book I have read in a long time. Cut the biography crap.  The majority of the book is the history of a few guys involved in the study of complexity.  Actual information on complexity is scarce and it is very hard to get through the first hundred pages.  After that the book is quasai readable but still cut the history junk and delve into the subject everyone paid money to read!  I can sum up almost all of the first hundred pages in a single sentence.  At Sante Fe University the various groups of scientist faced money problems but end up dedicating themselves to Complexity 
 A woman I would think would not be interested in totally wasting her kid's time recommended this line of DVDs to me, so I got one - fortunately only one.  It was TERRIBLE!  I don't understand what is going on with all the hype and other fantastic reviews.  The DVDs are mindless, way over-acted, Barney-esque entertainment with very little education.  I really like Little Einsteins, Kipper and Dora - but if you are more of a Barney fan, maybe you'd prefer the Wiggles.  Fortunately, my 2 year old did not get hooked before I discarded the DVD. Yes, discarded - I would not pass this on to anyone else!  
 This is an incredibly bad, laugh out loud zombie flick that makes no sense at all. Bad acting, bad dubbing, bad but gross special effects and a bad storyline (oh wait, there is none, it's never explained why the dead are walking again).  We have slow walking zombies chasing after even slower running people who predictably make the dumbest choices in survival.  In one scene they bash in the heads of the zombies with rocks, successfully killing them.  Then in another scene they completely forget how successful the head bashing is and decide to shoot the zombies with guns until, OH NO! someone is gobbled up in a gross mess of red goo and chicken livers.  I kid you not.    Then, in sudden displays of dexterity, these sluggish zombies move quickly enough to expertly impale their victim with a lawn spike, lop of heads with tree trimmers, chop down doors with axes and, in the most incredible display of dexterity and teamwork I have ever seen in any zombie flick, they band together to use a battering ram to knock down the front door.  About the only creepy thing in this entire film is the freaky bug eyed boy and he's not even a zombie. Burial Ground is a stupid yet midly entertaining film that you should view with a group of friends enjoying a few beverages and/or other refreshments while you catcall at the screen.  I give it two stars only because it takes about 10 minutes before the zombies start wrecking havoc 
 As if the song for mesmerize was'nt bad enough. A F***'IN GREASE VIDEO???!!!! Ja officially became a diva with this album. This album is horrible. The pledge had some life due to Nas appearance, thats why it's hard for me to request a zero star rating. Bottomline if Ja's body was made up of his albums, this part would gangrene, maggots would avoid this and you should too 
 Book is written in Fantasy, no real research done.   Absolutely trashy, no academic value.  Avoid 
 This is a very readable mystery with several cute twists.  If you live in or near the central coast of California you will love the way she works in many points of interest.  The story is filled with love of man-woman, mankind and dog.  You'll love it 
 Nothing new here and the pictures are not really that good.  
 I purchased this unit about 18 months ago. After the warranty ran out, the unit first quit working with -R media. Then there is an issue with finalizing the DVD, which makes the dvd unusable. Unfortunately, this is after you record your show. Then all is lost. It started making squawking noises like something is very wrong. It never remembered the language or channels. Panasonic never did anything about this. After reading others with these same issues, I would recommend that you buy from another manufacturer 
 This fourth installment of Becky's trying tribulations is the worst. The qualty has plummeted from passable fun to total embarrassment. I don't understand how Kinsella's editor didn't draw the line (and the red pencil) at the litany of shopping expeditions. And her endless, excrutitating 'inner' reflections. Becky's exploits aren't amusing anymore. Her purchases on her honeymoon aren't wacky. They're bewildering. For a shopaholic with supposedly good taste, Becky buys the ugliest sounding things on her travels and then flogs them all on Ebay once home in England. And oh yes, then she discovers a long lost sister. That situation is about as believable as three designer wedding dresses and two weddings from the previous book. And then Bex and her sister wind up on a rock rescued by Tarquin in his personal helicopter. I am not making this up. It's all there in the book. And none of it is even remotely entertaining. And now God help us, Becky is pregnant. AARRGGGH!       
 This "book" was put together in a beautiful, trendy package but the recipes were few and not of much inspiration for steaming. It's title is clearly deceptive...The food may be healthy but they're impractical and some were expensive to assemble. They were almost better off to be served as gourmet, finger-food type appetizers rather than part of the main course 
 The book contains a large number of black and white reproductions of various demon and devil imagery in comics. One sample per random artist, generally. The images, many poorly reproduced, low contrast, and small, appear on one page faced by a paragraph or two of commentary.  I found the images to be largely uninteresting. Banal. And the commentary flat and superficial 
 Come on now its puffy daddy without a name change 
       LEARN-TO-DRAW:  UNTHINKING PERSONS APPLY HERE!  Edwards seems intent on obtaining dominance in the field of "How To Draw"  books written by those who cannot  teach,   employing a fashionable Madison Avenue advertising approach to Drawing-On-The-Cash-In-Your-Wallet.        Edwards seems to falsely presume that Michaelangelo,  Raphael,  Leonardo Da Vinci and other Renaissance Masters  all drew upon   knowledge regarding the RIGHT-SIDE of their brain,  or ZEN,  or even YOGA.  It's a nonsense proposition,  unsupported by fact.  Neither were such "masters" of drawing,  interested in selling HOW-TO-DRAW books.      One could examine infinitely the theme of an "Artist Within," a creative self within, or even a Divine Spark within. I myself endorse SPIRITUALITY with whole-hearted enthusiasm. The problem is, it just doesn't matter whether the artist is within/without, internal/external, left-brain/right brain, or just plain WRONG-HEADED;  because it amounts to nothing more than coy marketing where Betty Edwards is concerned.      Betty Edwards engages in gross self-promotion,  prevailing upon public sentiment to hold forth as art expert, Zen Buddhist, scientist, college professor,  and New Age mystic guru.      Authors like Edwards are using two prominent FALLACIES,  to lead readers on with promises of artistic empowerment:  (1)  The WHOLENESS or WELLNESS FALLACY:  which suggests that if  I am HEALED,  or WHOLE (in a psychological sense)   I will   be powerful,  and produce powerful art.   (2)  The KNOW-IT-ALL FALLACY:   which suggests that if I KNOW EVERYTHING,  such as is suggested by  invocations of QUANTUM THEORY,  or reading quotes from scientists, writers,  poets, philosophers  and  adopting Eastern Religions such as Yoga and Zen (on a very superficial level)  I will embrace a THEORY-OF-EVERYTHING, and as a consequence, I will be powerful,  and produce powerful art.         Edwards twists and bends all knowledge into a gooey mass of  rhetorical  gibberish.  Edwards cannot discern the difference between "WITHIN"  or "THE RIGHT  SIDE OF THE BRAIN".  By any stretch of definition,  they cannot be the SAME THING at the SAME  TIME.          The implication is clear;  Edwards believes art is conditional upon maintaining an intellectual act, in short, a KNOW-IT-ALL act,  inclusive of  Zen Buddhism,  New Age Cosmology,   Nuclear Physics,  Evolutionary Theory, Neurology,  and Philosophy. [Just like Gary Zukav];   or,  alternatively,  it is a WELLNESS act,  suggesting that we adopt a qasi-religious philosophy,  identifing with a HIGHER SELF that is WITHIN. Whereas that latter statement sounds profoundly true,   there is a problem.   How can you both tell people that they are "Drawing on the artist within"   and also tell them that the "artist" [HIGHER SELF]  is  "on the right side of the brain"?   This is where Edward's  ideas come into clear contradiction.           It is clear that those who recommend Edward's  books,   do not evidence  a predominance of  Left-Brain analytical functioning,  with objective analysis.  These are not "great thinkers" and yet Edwards claims require deep analysis.  She is very wordy and heavy on text and ideology.  It is virtually impossible to credit those who affirm Edward's  theories,  with an ability to use RIGHT-BRAIN functioning to  visualize the OBVERSE/NEGATIVE SPACE,  and at the same time actively use LEFT-BRAIN  ANALYTICAL FUNCTIONING to analyze or comprehend Edward's outer-galactic star cluster of  disconnected theories.  Go figure!         Morever,  Edwards cannot distinguish between  the fundamentally contradictory  reasoning inherent to METAPHYSICAL REALISM [the Platonic WORDS-ARE-REAL] as opposed to:   METAPHYSICAL NOMINALISM [WORDS-ARE-NOTHING]; but Edwards is just preaching to the choir anyway. Who's kidding who?   This is an overly complex approach, but worse,  it is an absolute contradiction in logic;   but Edwards manages to both affirm  the rational,  the scientific,  and the non-rational and metaphysical at the same time. Her scientists are "magicians" and perform  "magic".  Her magicians are scientists who expound profound  core theories of physics.    Knowledge of both or either of these make you an artist?          Betty Edwards,  by introducing personal metaphysics into teaching drawing,  is essentially dictating to students, that they must accept the philosophical and pseudo-scientific ideology, before they can even begin to learn to draw.         Betty Edwards teaches that THERE ARE THOSE WHO CANNOT DRAW-BUT CAN DRAW-  CANNOT DRAW -- BUT CAN DRAW  -- CANNOT DRAW-- BUT CAN DRAW   ....and having taught this fundamental contradiction in reason,   has found an army of ideological "lemmings" who repeat the propaganda slogan as though it were a fundamental, logical, rational,  medical diagnosis,   a  philosophical,  and psychological  fact.    It's analogous to somebody WALKING down the street with you, and saying,  "I CANNOT WALK!  I CANNOT WALK!" and of course,  you point out to them,  "Hey,  but you ARE walking!" and they respond,  "No, you do not understand,  I CANNOT WALK!"  Whereupon you insist,  "But you ARE walking!  So you CAN walk, after all!"   and they respond,     "Yes,  of course I'm walking,  but only because Betty Edwards taught me how to walk within the NEGATIVE SPACE around my feet!That's why!"             It reminds one of the PARADOX OF EPIMENIDES:       "All Greeks are Liars! --by Epimenides, a Greek     Edwards has a following,  that much is evident;  but merely because a mass of people claim  a thing is so,  does not make it so. [The Populist  Fallacy ]  The contradictions and paradoxes do not sum up to simple truth.       An analogy might be like declaring:  EVERYTHING IS TRUE.  IF ANYONE SAYS OTHERWISE,  IT'S FALSE!     Edwards pulls this off very neatly. You are to both DRAW ON THE ARTIST 'WITHIN'   and also   DRAW ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE BRAIN,  at the same time.  Both are true, and nothing is false.  Scientists are metaphysicians,  and metaphysicians are scientists.     The ultimate irrationality however,  is the suggestion that those who "draw",  by Edward's miraculous methodologies,  are  "artists".  If you subscribe to Edward's theory,  you are drawing on the "ARTIST WITHIN".  Isn't that nice? So,  if everyone is an "ARTIST"  by virtue of the existence of the "ARTIST WITHIN"   how do we distinguish  between someone who IS and IS-NOT   an artist?   You cannot. That is the marvelous slight-of-hand that Edwards is pulling off on the general public.  Both or either YOU and BETTY EDWARDS and MICHAELANGELO.....are ONE,  and not only,  but you are "in ZEN" too!    It's a laughable proposition at best.             
 I was initially satisfied but now it is essentially not working.  FirstI lost the remote temp and now the main unit is do dim you can't read it. 
 the only good thing about this book is that it exposes the crackpot logic of the russian radicals.  chernyshevsky is an abysmally bad writer.  and even though he admits it in the preface, he still somehow thinks that his sheer intellectual brilliance will redeem him.  it doesn't.  this book is important only in that it was extraordinarily influential (a source of inspiration for both stalin and lenin - the latter which deemed chernyshevsky his favorite writer, while calling dostoevsky a "superlatively bad" one - ha!).  anyhow, his analysis of cooperative unions is not entirely without merit, nor are his reflections on women's rights.  but insisting your best friend take your wife as a lover?  rakhmetov as the "extraordinary man," who eats 5 lbs of beef in one sitting and sleeps on a bed of nails?  unconvincing and stupid.  his narrative technique is so obnoxious (oh, my perspicacious reader!) and he interjects too often to "add" insight to the story that he himself is creating.  also, no matter how much of a hard determinist you are, becoming an apologist for "wickedness" by ascribing it to one's environment is simply absurd. 
 I thought "Silver Pigs" was wonderful. By this one, Falco is tiresome, trite and boring. The humourous cynicism present in the earlier novels seems to be both studied and begrudging in the later ones. And the family is NOT that cute. Still, there are a few flashes of humour. If Falco would ditch the extended family, Davis would tighten up the writing and not be quite so coy, this series could be salvaged. Davis should take a few lessons from John Maddox Roberts and Decius 
 I'm not going to waste a bunch of my time or yours giving a personally oppinionated review of the movie plot. It's redundant and unnecessary, and whether someone likes the story or not is irrelavent. Only you can form an opinion of whether you like it or not by watching it yourself. Double that with the fact that most movies hardly ever line up with the book that's based on and well...  My gripe is the transition from putting the movie in it's original format onto DVD was bad. The soundtrack is about 1/2 to 1 second off from the video part of film, therefore the voices don't sync up with the lip movement. 
 ... that brought the this book WAY down for me right from the start. Other books I have enjoyed with a psychic character/element (a la Linda Howard  and Jayne Ann Krentz ) made them seem plausible and not part of the fortune reading scam artist low life crowd that has always turned me off. Trying to legitimize tarot cards and Psychic Phone hotlines in any way just ruined the book for me.  I liked Last Girl Dancing by the same author, but truly felt the tarot reading heroine premise destroyed this one before it ever got going.  I just don't want to continue reading as I don't trust it to get good enough (after it stumbled BIG with the first romantic scene that simply came off awkward and made me laugh at the stupid dialog) to overcome the implausible, so obviously bogus side to paranormal con artists that feeds on the lonely, depressed and naive for money. I have seen otherwise intelligent people, especially women, fork over hundreds of dollars to these low life's of the paranormal, so I admit the topic was already a major turn-off for me.    The book just wasn't good enough to overcome my distaste for the subject of tarot card reading cons.  
 It's hard not to love the idea of this book, just as it is easy to hate marred execution. A fascinating botch job, but still a botch.  As seems to be the case with the authors of many social histories, Kuh is so enamored with the fact that he got to this idea first--and it is a "why-didn't-I-think-of-that? one--that he inserts his story into the mix; in this case, he'd like to see a parallel to Joyce's Portrait of the Artist--but he ain't Joyce, and clearly isn't much of a cook. He's a great hypocrite, however: I found it hilarious that a guy critiquing culinary elitism continuously throws out french dishes without translating or providing an explanation of the dish. You will be amazed at how little discussion of food there is in here.  I won't dwell on the grammatical errors or preening prose--other reviews have--but I will say that the most dishearterning aspect of the book is the author's inability to get over himself, which severely limits his coverage. Clearly, he's not good enough of a writer or thinker to understand his own bias--because he fetishizes the past; makes his time in the kitchen (60s and 70s) to be the most important era in food history (of course!); and then tries to act like a distant, objective journalist for the present, treating it like clinical, lifeless business. This supposed distance kills the book's intent: instead of tracing the evolution of the American restaurant, he ends up lionizing the past and trashing the last twenty years of professional cooking, which get few pages and absolutely no discussion about the food produced. It's remarkable, given all that has transpired in the last 15 years, that he spends no energy on the fact that America is the culinary center of the world, yet can come back to talk about Henri Soule again and again.  The book you're looking for has not been written yet 
 Truly is what it says it is: An American housewife whines about not getting fresh whatever daily from the servants. She could visit the south side of Chicago and whine, sans servants. Her Martha Stewart sensibilities are out of place in a poor country struggling with social issues, quite successfully, I would add, despite North America's stupid blockade.   Needless to say, this book was an aggravation and disrespectful of another place and culture. 
 Perhaps the worst tribute DVD I have ever seen. Jump cut editing will give you ADD (we're talking literally two-second sound bytes!), the grabs are pointless with very few comedians talking about Pryor getting more than one sentence in before they jump to the next trendy talking head. None of them say anything funny or enlightening either, which is surprising for something that is supposed to be a comedy/tribute DVD.  A handful of Pryor clips from an existing concert (just one) and two short clips from the Richard Pryor show. The sycophantic background laughter at EVERYTHING their interviewees say (and I mean EVERYTHING, it's pathetic) is really grating.  And there's too many terrible comics on here - Margaret Cho, Cedric the Entertainer, George Wallace, Jamie Foxx and a bunch of sub-Martin Lawrence jarheads.  Spend your money on one of his live concert DVDs.  This is rubbish made by people who think they have a sense of humour.  It's a beer coaster. 
 Pearl Jam are more of a band of the 90s, and really they should of stayed their and done something else different because the last decent album they released was "Yield". Thats not to say "Binuaral" and  "Riot Act" are terrible albums its just the production on both of them is bad, Eddie Vedders singing is a bore and the songs just are'nt their, thats not to say you should not have them in your CD collection - hah!  As for this laughable Pearl Jam at the garden DVD, well that just reinforced why Pearl Jam are a band of the 90s, and back then they were an energetic and proper enthusiastic live band.  Since then it blatantly seems they have become slacker and boring, fatter and unexciting and older (which is no excuse) to be such a bore on the stage. You would never beleive how bad this band has disintergrated over the years.  No passion whatsoever, they just look like they are their for the moeny - which of course is a huge shame 
 Too hard to follow the instructions . I bought it for my mom who said she could not tell the difference. I am not sure she followed the instructions.I am just assuming  (she is an English Professor )it didnt work too well. 
 We just put the stupid thing together and put the batteries in and nothing worked.  The light would go on and off, but there were no sounds at all.  We made sure we had everything plugged in correctly, but it still wouldn't work.  After all the time of putting it together what a disappointment.  I will be calling Fisher Price tomorrow and seeing if they have any suggests and/or taking it back to Toyrus.  
 When I started reading this book, I was hopeful that it would be an insightful commentary on the ridiculous nature of politically-correct word choice.  Unfortunately, I did not find it to be particularly clever or funny.  On some level, it seems like the PC craze has subsided since the mid-90's when the book was written, and it just doesn't read as the brilliant critique that I expected.  We've now heard so many silly descriptions followed by the suffix "challenged" that it just isn't funny anymore.  I suppose that this book worked much better when it was written, but it hasn't aged well over the ten years since 
  Nothing new here but lies and half truths..His assesment of Orthodoxy is totally garbage....Good book for the trash can 
 Suzanne Somers apparently has no use for modern medical science. Especially as a survivor of breast cancer (although of a very early stage) she is putting her life in grave danger by taking hormones. Recent studies have shown that women who were taking HRT for protection from heart problems actually had MORE problems than normal menopausal women. This is an unbelievably destructive, horribly dangerous book for people to take seriously. Being skinny is NOT more important than being alive. If you want to get the real scoop on hormones, talk to a doctor at an academic medical center (in other words, one that isn't going to mislead the public for personal financial gain) and see what she or he has to say. Chances are excellent that you'll be told to avoid them at all cost. Look at it this way: are you going to put your very life in the hands of Suzanne Somers? I'm sure she's a very nice person; it's just that she has no medical training whatsoever. *** writing from an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center** 
 I read this book in 2002 way before the Iraq invasion seemed probable.  After reading it (and believing that I was reading thorough reporting) I supported going after the WMD in Iraq.  However, now that we've seen how Judy can manipulate facts and her proven track record with no WMD found in Iraq I strongly suggest you read this book with a skepticism to truthfulness.  Some of the non-Iraq WMD reporting was very interesting and I learned a bit from that, but how do I separate fact from fiction?  As a result of being 100% wrong in her reporting and Judy's recent comments, "the analysts, the experts and the journalists who covered them -- we were all wrong," which is not true (read John MacArthur, Ian Williams and Joby Warrick), I think this book loses its credibility.  You may want to read it just to attempt to discern fact v. fiction 
 This book's title shows that "qualitative research" is its primary subject, and "developing grounded theory" is its secondary subject. The opposite is true in the case of the book coauthored earlier by Strauss: "The Discovery of Grounded Theory: Strategies for Qualitative Research." In the interval between the writing of the two books, Strauss may have realized that his thesis was about research work more than theory construction. But the text of this second book too presents research work as theory construction, as explained below. It could be thought that what is to be called a "theory" is a linguistic issue. But the definition of this term must not prevent the construction of real theories as distinct from empirical knowledge.  In lieu of  the implicit definition of "theory" that appeared in the earlier book (p. 1), an explicit one is given in this second book: "A set of well developed concepts related through statements of relationship, which together constitute an integrated framework that can be used to explain or predict phenomena" (p. 15). The new and critical but obscure expressions in this definition are "well developed concepts" and "integrated framework," whereas the idea of explaining or predicting phenomena by using a theory appeared also in the earlier definition. As I mentioned in my review of the earlier book, explaining or predicting phenomena can be done by using empirical knowledge too and therefore cannot be considered a distinguishing characteristic of theories. For example, the empirical laws of electromagnetism known before Maxwell served to explain, predict, and control many electromagnetic phenomena but did not constitute a theory. The authors repeat the same mistake when they admit that "a theory is more than a set of [empirical] findings;" and continue by saying, "it offers an explanation of phenomena" (p.22). They also say, "generating theories about phenomena, rather than just generating a set of findings, is important to the development of a field of knowledge" (pp. 22-23). That is correct, but the problem is to know how theories are generated. Also, "findings" too serve to explain phenomena, as mentioned, although they have a narrower scope than theories.      "Statements of relationship [between phenomena] are commonly referred to as `hypotheses'" (p. 103). "Any hypotheses and propositions derived from data must be continuously `checked out' against incoming data and modified, extended, or deleted as necessary" (p. 22). The key concept here, which the authors do not clarify sufficiently, is the derivation of hypotheses from data. First, some relationships between phenomena can be deduced from the data. But what is thus produced constitutes not a hypothesis but empirical knowledge about those phenomena. It is when those relationships are "generalized through induction," in Newton's words, that they become general rules which are of hypothetical nature, or hypotheses, because induction yields only probabilities, not certainties, as Bertrand Russell emphasized. The authors seem to ignore this fact. Moreover, when the hypotheses thus derived from data are "continuously `checked out' against incoming data and modified, extended, or deleted as necessary" and those that are conserved are finally supported by all new information, they stop being hypotheses and become empirically known facts. And any set of such facts constitutes empirical knowledge, not a theory.  The authors seem not to have a clear view of where induction and deduction are used. "Anytime a researcher derives hypotheses from data, because it involves interpretation, we consider that a deductive process" (p. 22). A relationship that is deduced from the data related to some singular phenomena constitutes empirical knowledge about those phenomena. A hypothesis is created out of that knowledge when it is "generalized through induction." The total process is not only deduction but involves also  induction. The authors express these facts in an obscure way thus: "At the heart of theorizing lies the interplay of making inductions (deriving concepts, their properties, and dimensions from data) and deductions (hypothesizing about the relationships between concepts, the relationships also are derived from data, but data that have been abstracted by the analyst from the raw data)" (p. 22). What the authors unclearly describe as "abstracted by the analyst from the raw data" is what Newton meant by the words "generalized through induction." And the generalization must cover phenomena that do not allow the deduction of the hypothesis from the data if the hypothesis is expected to be used to construct a theory. The authors conclude: "At the end, it is hoped, the researcher has systematically developed the products of analysis into a theory" (p. 22). The major mistake in this conception of theory construction is that it ignores the following fact: A hypothesis that is "checked out against incoming data," (i.e. fits the data, is deducible from the data) is no more a hypothesis but empirical knowledge and therefore a system of statements only such hypotheses constitutes not a theory but a group of empirical knowledge. The authors repeat the same mistake when they say that a theory "is validated during the actual research process" (213). What can be validated during the "actual" (original) research process is empirical knowledge. A second phase of research is concerned with the validation of the theory, i.e. with showing that the consequences of the theory fit the phenomena, or that they are deducible not only from the theory but also from the phenomena. Consequently, the theory becomes usable in explaining, predicting, and controlling the phenomena.   Only when knowledge that is deduced, or readily obtained, from the raw data related to some singular phenomena is "generalized through induction" and assumed, or hypothesized, to be valid also in relation to phenomena that do not make possible the deduction of that hypothesis from the data that a hypothesis is created that can be used to construct a theory. This means that a theory contains at least one hypothesis that cannot be deduced from the empirical data related to all phenomena to which it is assumed to apply. The reason for this is that a law of nature may be deduced from the data related to some phenomena but not from the data related to other phenomena. Consequently, by transferring knowledge from one set of phenomena to another can provide hypothetical knowledge that is otherwise unavailable. A theory is a set of general statements, or laws, of which at least one is such a non-testable hypothesis at the time of the construction of the theory. After a theory is thus constructed, consequences are deduced from it that serve to explain, predict, and control the related phenomena. The usefulness of a theory in doing these things constitutes the proof of its usability and also the proofs of all of its contents, including the non-testable hypothesis, or hypotheses. When phenomena that do not fit a tested and accepted theory are encountered, a more general theory is constructed. The old theory is not discarded by being considered wrong but remains in use in the area where it is valid, because it is simpler than the more general theory.  The above-presented knowledge about the content and the method of construction of theories is derived from the grand theories of physics. I have shown in my books how the same method can be used in psychology too. As an example, I constructed a theory of automatic responses such as the symptoms of non-organic mental disorders, dreams, cerebral lateralization as structural response, etc. This theory serves not only to explain and predict those phenomena but also to control them very effectively where this is possible. I had to mention these here because the best test of ideas is their usefulness in explaining, predicting, and controlling the phenomena.  Although Strauss and Corbin advocate what they call "grounded theory," which is in reality nothing else than empirical knowledge, they expose their distrust of their work, which contains many unclear points, when they warn the reader by saying, "Remember that a theory is just that - a theory" (p. 213). Theories inspire more respect when their method of construction and their function are better understood.   
 Some problems with this commentary are: 1) Too long - Moo uses too many words to express himself and tries to interact with too much that is not necessary or even helpful; 2) Too atomistic - by focusing on too much detail, Moo tends to lose the forest by focusing on individual trees: he does not always have a solid contextual understanding of passages nor of the flow of the letter; 3) His outline is misguided - Moo is trying to follow rherotical theory but this causes him to embrace an outline that really does not do justice to the content of the book; 4) Theologically askew - Moo is not a "modified Lutheran", he is "basically dispensationalist" and is handicapped by the trappings of the view (i.e., Law is always bad = basically antinomian). If you want just one commentary on Romans, Schreiner is better and more recent 
 More than I can count.  But since this is a short review of the book, lets stick to the one reason to toss this book into the recycle bin.  Clinton created a lean and mean military, not Bush.  Any success Bush and Rumsfeld have ever done is because of Clinton and his advisors.  Bush and Rumsfeld have never served in a war, nor have they seen combat.  Does anyone really think they could battle terrorism ? Not on their life and not on any of their rich relatives lives either. (Except for Bush Sr, who was a great president because he had actually seen war and combat.) Leave the wars to people who know about war and leave this author, who hasn't served either, to gather dust 
 A Recipe for Bees reminded me a lot of the novel Vinegar Hill. In both stories, a wife is living in a dark, unpleasant home environment. In A Recipe for Bees, Augusta, an older lady, approaching the end of her life, reflects back upon her childhood and her marriage. Her mother dies at a young age, leaving her alone with an unaffectionate father. When she meets Karl and they become married, Augusta moves from one unaffectionate household to another. Living at Karl's father's farm, Augusta is only subject to more withholding of affection and is living a dark and depressing life. The rest of the novel delves into Augusta's search for independence and what she chooses to make of her life. The story takes us down journeys of the ups and downs of marriage, being a misfit in the community, and mother/daughter relationships. The main problem reading it, is that I couldn't find it in me to like the main character, Augusta. I also felt that the story left the reader with a depressed feeling of what marriage is like.  The weaving of the "bee" theme added a nice touch to the story, but if you're looking for a great read with a "bee" them, try The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd. The writing in A Recipe for Bees was good, but I felt the story was lacking something 
 This book is OK if you have never had sex of any nature, no compassion for your partner, and have absolutely no common sense to figure out these simple steps:  Go Slowly (let the women pace the action) Use Lubrication Use More Lubrication  Save yourself the money, and take it slowly.. 
 I intend to burn this book once the semester is over; it is utterly worthless.  My professor was coerced to use the book and assigns homework from the book, but the exams look nothing at all like the homework or material from the book.  My complaints: Insuffucient examples to teach a concept.  There is an inextricably, monotonous presence of teaching.  The examples are nowhere near adequate to be able to do the problems in the back of the chapter.  Superficially, the content looks great, but when you try to learn it from the book, the frustration builds until you cry.  The wording of chapter exercises and end of chapter problems is vague and problemmatic.  It is difficult to understand what is being taught, if anything is being taught at all.  I would like to use this as a reference when I graduate, but realistically, if it's as useful as cow dung now, then why would I keep it?  So, get it all over with now, the crying, the late nights pulling hair out, seeking antidepressants for the incessant crying and depression due to frustration.  Be realistic in the beginning.  Unless you have an excellent professor, you will probably not make a good grade based on homework and/or exams from this book.  Better yet, don't buy the book - you might get a better grade on the exams if you are exposed to the unnecessary stress.  [This is just an opinion - don't sue me.  If, by some strange reason, you're a math major, then you might have a partial background to cope with the book's inadequacies and take a different view. 
 I having been waiting since 2005 for the release of this book and I am very disappointed because so very little was added to this revision and certainly not enough to justify the cost of the book if you purchased the previous edition, Flash MX 2004 Game Development, which I own. The first edition was outstanding. Because I followed the GlenRhodes.com blog and viewed the really cool stuff he is doing like the LightSaber Configurator and the WolfenFlash Game featuring the "Flash Ray Engine", I expected to get more insight into how he is pushing Flash 8 to create such outstanding work! The book would have been much more valuable to me if 4+ games added to the revision and more insight into his current Flash 8 work 
 This book is for anything but the classroom. The material is too complex for new students. I used it in three sessions. I  could not get over the stress of teaching it. My students found that AE is too hard. It seems that the writers ignored that people have short memories. They expected the readers to keep up with a long project, the subject of the book. I found that the Meyer books had a better approach.  
 Hated it!  Save your money and read A Child Called It.  That's a book that covers abuse, if you're looking for abuse books.  This book is attempting to shock with stories of how the author's brother urinates in his mouth, how he later has sexual relations with his sisters and brothers and then struggles with his own sexual identity.  He later tells what a horrible husband and father he has become and then dedicates the book to his son as if that will cure the damage he has done. The authors trying to ride the coat tails of poor Elizabeth Smart and barely mentions anything about the abduction or Wanda Barzee.  There are about 3 pages total about this and the rest of the book cover the author's life in boring detail.  Seriously, there are much better books to read.  If you want a good laugh, look at the author's own review of his book - funny how he tries to convince you that he's try to help anyone.  How?  My advice is to seek therapy and not by writing a book 
 What an incessently annoying score this is!  There are few times where I so feverishly hated what a composer was doing to my ears.  I have about 400 scores in my collection, and this one is in my top 5 most hated.  Absolutely atrocious. It's hard for me to describe the actual music in detail, because there's such little music to describe.  This CD is more like one of those sound effects collection CD's you buy at the loonie store for 2 bucks.  How people love it is beyond me - it's there opinion, to be sure, but I sure can't agree with it.   If you're looking for melodical music, or action music, or beautiful music, or basically interesting music of any kind, look elsewhere.  This isn't a popular opinion, I know, but it's my personal feelings of hatred towards this "score".  Do yourself a favour and go buy a score that will really give you some great music, like Passion of the Christ, or House of Sand and Fog, or Rabbit Proof Fence, or Requiem for a Dream.  Not this thing, which couldn't carry a tune if it held it in a bucket.   cheers K 
 Getting Married in Korea was one of the 3 books my Cultural Antro professor mandated us to read.  The book is excruciatingly boring.  Unlike his other reading assignments, I couldnt see myself pass the first chapter (or even the first page!).  Fortunately, I finished the book in a month.  (woohooo).  The content was in detail and the book with only few graphics.  i thought it could have been better if the author stuck more pictures in their to at least entertain the reader while reading 
 Meanspirited book by a man who acts like he knows the "real" Martha Stewart.  If he did, his book would be authorized.  I am always amazed by writers who are quick to tear apart a successful person but who could never do anything anywhere what that successful person has done.  Martha Stewart came from modest background and by nothing more than her own brain, guts and hard work, built a huge company that employs thousands of people, provides wonderful products.    If she was a man, no one would call her a B****.    You want someone sweet who will bake cookies for you and coddle you, go visit your grandma.  You want someone who is sharp and expects the best, go work for Omnimedia and let Martha be your CEO.  The author of this book is a weasel 
 I am so proud to know that there are many other Black folks who agree with Bill Cosby. I am also happy that he went public with the truth about what's wrong in our community. "Personal responsibility and personal respectability" is the key expression.   Thank you, thank you, thank you Bill Cosby for speaking the TRUTH! I am feed up with this victim mentality that writers and spokes-people like Michael Dyson perpetuate as it applies to Black people. WE ARE NO LONGER VICTIMS of the "white-man." Those days are gone. DRIVING DOWN A CITY STREET IN A MAJOR CITY AT NIGHT or WATCHING THE EVENING NEWS or LOOKING AT OUR YOUNG MEN WEARING THEIR PANTS DOWN BELOW THEIR BEHINDS shows where our problems exists.   Michael Dyson writes many books criticizing and exposing whoever and whatever; He has even "exposed" Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr in one of his books. What else does he do beyond writing and talking? Dr. King fulfilled his God-ordained purpose and destiny on this earth. And we are not idiots either; we all know he was imperfect. He was human!   Yes, institutionalized bigotry exists, but we as a people overcome in spite of it all. And for Michael Dyson, and the others like him, continuing with this "victim" jargon does no one any good, period.  Bill Cosby was not an elitist, etc, as some of you call him,  HE SIMPLY SPOKE THE DOG GONE TRUTH!!   Right on, Bill. ENCORE!!!!!!!!! 
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 The movie is bad it is second only to Howard the Duck.  It was so bad that I could not sit through all of it.  Don't bother with this one 
 I ordered this book as a gift and found it completely unsuitable because of the photo on the backcover. The gift was intended for a father of 2 small children; he certainly would not want a book with a cover photo of a  man with a vulgar word written on his forehead and making a vulgar gesture.  Neither one of us is a prude, but this is something you don't want around  children. I only wish that Amazon could let customers know what the back  cover looks like in cases like this. I wasted money and time! I'm sure the  inside content would have been interesting, but a coffee table book's  cover--back AND front--need to be suitable for public consumption 
 This doesn't even deserve the star I gave it. Think about how ridiculous this is! It was written by a self-proclaimed vampire, and describes magic spells and other bs used for other aspiring vampires to replace blood-sucking with energy...um...sucking. Don't believe this bs for a second. If you are sincerely interested in the wackjob vampire subculture, get a book on its history. If you personally believe yourself to be a vampire, go for psychiatric help. You probably have dissociated personality disorder. 
 This has to be one of the worst written books I ever read.  I can't believe there are so many ways to say the same thing. So far, Danielle Steel has found a way in the first third of this book.  I just can't read the rest of it. Generally, if a book isn't very good I can suffer through.  This one has gotten on my last nerve.  I had stopped reading her books because they had become so predictable.  But, I don't think I will be reading anymore of her books.  It's an insult to Nora Roberts and Sandra Brown for her to be ranked with them 
 It's over thirty years since I read GAUDY NIGHT and BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON. I don't suppose I'll ever read them again. By the time she wrote them, Sayers had lost whatever she had to offer as a mystery writer. She was taking herself seriously. In Harriet Vane, Sayers produced perhaps the most nauseating wish fulfilment figure in the whole of crime fiction. She makes Jemima Shore look like something out of Dostoyevsky. Avoid like the plague unless you wish to gross out on snobbery and sentimentality. And the murder method in BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON is singularly unconvincing 
 If you want to see pictures of rooms and furnishings that look like nothing  you could possibly relate to, buy this book. The pictures show such fussy, formal, off-putting rooms. Bleah. What a waste of money 
 Disappointing.  Our heroine spends 300 pages convinced her mother (as sane as any wealthy Texas matron) is crazy.  Not believable even in the pretend world.  I was looking forward to this third outing of Ms. Kendricks but had to keep reading faster to not put it down completely.  Surely #4 will be back on track.   
 This is a minstrel show. Period point blank. These guys set black people back 20 years. Look at them in "black face" on the cover of their album. They look like al jolsen twins. Then the music they make is insulting to every race color and creed. Any music that makes you feel dumber when you listen to it should be banned. I'm calling my alderman now to start the movement. LOL 
 I bought this item at the end of January and received it in Febuary it is now March and the edges are all turning white and chipping away sorry I bought this I am going to order another color and see if it does the same.  Not very happy with this 
 I am a wedding planner and an instructor at the local college. I was looking for a book to use as a "textbook" for the wedding planner class and based on previous editions (I own the 2nd, 4th, and 5th editions), I chose the sixth edition for my class before actually reading it. I thought this book was the Bible of wedding planning. Beverly Clark is one of the most renowned wedding experts out there and always has written very thorough and detailed books. I must say I was VERY DISAPPOINTED with the latest edition however. The book took out several chapters, left out key information, and inserted very little new information other than references to their new website, where the reader is forced to be exposed to their annoying banner advertising. Despite my previous enthusiasm for Beverly Clark, I must say I would NOT recommend this book. There are so many others out there to choose from. I must say, if you are a bride, you should go to a bookstore and choose one that suits you and your wedding style, rather than purchasing from a website, where you can't really tell what the book is like 
 At first glance, one sees this book and thinks, "what ELSE can posssibly be written about Callas?" Follow your instincts! The cover is beautiful, but inside offers nothing new, with the exception of an evil "friend" readers may not previously have read about (a woman named Vasso). This author does NOT "refute" with any relevant information, that Callas and Onasis did not have a child who died. For the reader who is venturing into the world of Maria Callas for the first time, this is not really a recommended read, as you will not get complete accuracy, and will not find anything you couldn't find in any other Callas book. For Callas officianados, it is a waste of time 
 I rated this book as 1 star because that's the least that's allowed by amazon. I picked up this book because it is supposed to be a Newyork times bestseller. Now I have realized that picking books that are so called bestsellers is no guarantee of a good read. The book is amateurish, silly, syrupy, incomplete, devoid of a plot, and has a sudden, miserable ending.  Three things left me puzzled and incredulous: 1. How could a respectable author submit this book as a completed work, 2. How could any publishing house worth it's name publish this pathetic piece of ineptitude, 3. How this apology of a book became a Newyork times bestseller 
 I am a big Catherine Coulter fan, but this book is awful.  You can skip all the Soap scenes, a waste of space.  Much of the dialouge made no sense and the characters were very flat.  Don't waste the $6, borrow from the library if you want to read 
 Let's face it: When you want to get started you don't sit down, read through 800 pages, then get to it.  What you really do is read a little, skimming what you really need to get started. When you need to know something, you look it up.  There's the rub.  Unfortunately, ALL of these books suffer from the problem of having a very bad index.  I know the index spans many pages, however, I have seldom found ANYTHING I wanted by looking it up under the obvious heading.  For that matter, often the subject is not to be found anywhere in the index at all.  Which means it either isn't covered in the book, or it can not be found easily.  The "9 in 1" books thing sounds good, until you realize that there is not necessarily an integrated approach to really teaching the whole of Access and the relationship between its parts.  The real problem is that Access is layered on top of 3 'languages' (VB, SQL, and Macros) and has different ways of getting things done for its three main parts (Queries, Forms, and Reports).  (And VB even supports 2 different object models, DAO and ADO.) It is often unlclear how all these different areas interact.  They can interact together easily, but why is a function spelled one way in an expression, a different way in VB and again different in SQL?  There ought to be a cross reference table translating between them.  Or when can you nest aggregate functions and when can't you?  Much of what Access is secretly doing is translating your groupings and expressions into SQL with Unions and inner/outer-joins or what not.  None of this inner working is explained, leaving you clueless when Access refuses to do what it thinks you want to do.  Yes, Access is a confusing product owing to the way different parts were cobbled together.  But it can also be very easy to do certain things, like turning a report's groupings inside out.  Some of these things are explained in this book, but most are not.  A comprehensive index would be a start, but they would of course need the text to go with it.  You'll have better luck finding specific information by searching on the internet.  I have found many great and helpful web sites, but I still haven't found any one book on MS Access that comes close to really explaining it properly.  And none with an even decent index.  It sounds great to read on a book's jacket that it will cover VB or XML or web stuff, but the important stuff is often overlooked. 
 This is a disgrace... don't waste your mone 
 Dated, biased account of what happened at PARC and at Xerox headquarters. Very out of date, especially given PARC's foresight in terms of  distributed, connected computers. It seems like the authors decided to bash  Xerox even before they began their research. Save your money on this one. A  better bet is "Dealers of Lightning" by Michael Hiltzik. That one  points out what Xerox did wrong, and, oh, by the way, what they did right.  (For example, make a couple of billion dollars out of the Laser Print  industry.) The authors of this one just seemed to have it "in"  for Xerox. I wonder if they used a windows based PC or Mac to type the  original manuscript? Not without PARC, they wouldn't have 
 This product to my knowledge is completely untested.  I suspect it because it says it requires no boiling--which sugestes that it may contain a preservative, yeast and/or bacterial inhibitor.  This could not possibly be good for the hummers.  Listen to the experts such as Sheri Wlliamson (Peterson's "Hummingbirds of North America.")  Sugar and water is just fine, filtered water best but NOT distilled 
 I think there is some high quality writing on this disc and I find 3-4 of the songs to be quite listenable. However, that's the highest compliment I can muster. With the exception of "Now Comes The Night," only b/c I burned it onto a compilation, I haven't listened to this cd since the month it came out. I wasn't looking for a Justin Timberlake-esque album when I picked this up. I just don't dig whatever direction Rob wanted to go in with his solo material. I find the stylistic inconsistency as a hinderance to the album rather than a selling point for his diversity. Next effort please 
 This is an exact copy of a letter I received from Don Metz when I complained about one of the sub-1250 sq. ft. plans (from a different book) not being under 1250.  Dear Mr. Measuring Things Very Carefully,    Your letter was surely the most self-righteous, missing-the-point piece of work I've ever recieved.  Frankly, it would please me no end if you did indeed become "very skeptical of any books that you or the other judges publish in the future because of what I perceive as incompetence." That way, I won't have to read another of your whiny little responses ever again. If you are so obsessed with measuring things, I suggest you try measuring your capacity to understand that the book is meant to feature and promote compact house design. What defines a compact house? Size, mostly. What size? Take your pick, Mr. Measuring Man. Small? Not big? Modest? Efficient? I couldn't care less if the houses featureed are a bit under or over the 1250 advertised -- and if your so-called "architectural background" had anything to do with anything other than the nit-picky measuring of things, (as if that were somehow crucial to the importance of architecture) -- you wouldn't either.  As for owing you an apology, I owe you nothing but my bemused contempt. Sincerely, Don Metz   P.S. Any response to this letter will be deleted, unread.  While I admit that I did use the term incompetence, I should also point out that the inability to accurately measure a house in a competition with a square footage limit is, in my opinion, incompetent.  So I feel it was justified.  If curious, here is the letter I wrote.  I would prefer if Mr. Metz would contact me, because this comment is very specifically directed at him and therefore he can most accurately respond. I own the title New Compact House Designs and have a major complaint.   I have an architecture background and am currently designing a house that when finished will be sub-1250 square feet.  I purchased the book to give me some ideas about what I might do to squeeze the most out of the space.  I was pleasantly surprised to see the winning design was very full featured.  It was only when I attempted to apply some of the concepts in the house that I realized that it is not even close to 1250 square feet.  The back cover of the book states that these houses had the following guideline: "design a single-family house with a minimum of two bedrooms whose gross floor area does not exceed 1250 square feet."  Gross floor area is the covered area within the exterior edge of the exterior walls of a minimum ceiling height of 7'6" (typ.) not including areas that are open to the elements such as porches.  I suspect that the winning house would not even qualify if you measured based on the interior of the exterior walls.  The only way I think it can come close is if you subtract all the interior and exterior walls. I have not checked all of the other house plans, but I will be very curious to discover how many followed the requirements of the competition. My questions are the following. 1) Why did you not check the designs to make sure they fit the size limit? 2) Do you plan on doing a second printing retracting those designs that failed to meet the size limits and ask that the ineligible winners return any sort of award they received? 3) Does this fiasco not shoot your whole small house attitude in the foot if you yourselves prefer larger houses and award larger houses instead of small houses in your own competition?   I will be very skeptical of any books that you or the other judges publish in the future because of what I perceive as incompetence.  I think that you owe an apology to anybody who purchased this book and especially to the architects who submitted designs that followed the rules and lost. I will be very curious to hear your response, and in the meantime I will very carefully measure the designs.   Just thought I would share my experiences with this editor.  
 This book outlines a few things about growing cannabis that you may find stunning to read but when you put it into practice you soon find out that it is very vague and sometimes incorrect. I picked up this book because nearly everyone who grows has it, but growers do not actually recommend it for practical use. There is absolutely no way this book will teach you grow large potent bud. It will teach you how to grow an amateur plant with low yields. The curing techniques are also dated. It is fun to read if you want to learn about stone-d age (Excuse the pun)70's growing. Twenty years on the whole world has changed and this book has stood still. This book will lead you to believe that you have a brown thumb more than a green thumb if you put it into practal use. Great explaination of cannabis terms, but nothing you won't find in any standard dictionary. Fun to read, dissapointing to put into practical use. Too much misinformation to sort through. Check through the chapter on nutrients for an example and put them into practical use. You will soon find that it wrong. I do not recommend this book. Find something else.....anything else 
 I had been meaning to read this long-overdue biography of Alan Shepard, and I happened to pick it up in a cruise ship library.  As I read it I was surprised at the number of factual inaccuracies--there is at least one glaring non-technical error per chapter, which calls into question almost everything else between the covers.  Numerous reviews here mention more problems with technical aspects of the book that I was unaware of, but which do not surprise me given the apparent lack of proofreading and fact-checking.  An example:  upon finding the book, I leafed through it and found the section on Apollo 14.  There it mentioned that John Glenn had "almost killed himself when he lost control of the pace car at the Daytona 500 and slammed into a flatbed trailer crowded with journalists."  This sentence boggled my mind, for it contained two errors:  the pace car was at the Indianapolis 500, and John Glenn was a passenger while a local Dodge dealership owner was the driver.  The book is just full of examples of this kind of sloppy reporting.  Edit:  I see that at least the paperback edition correctly says Indianapolis 500, but it still incorrectly implies that Glenn was driving the pace car 
 I like Feinstein's work but this book is a bore. The first 100 pages are mini-biographies of USGA staff. Someone out there must find interesting which college basketball team is the favorite of the USGA publicity director, but I am at loss to understand whom 
 I read about one hundred pages and then, when the consistency of the plot did not improve beyond that of an extra runny rice pudding, I quit. This was my first King book and I am not rushing out to buy another one, especially since it appears to me that this author is unable to pen down anything less than a 1000 pages.  Is it any wonder that it is selling on Amazon for a penny? Actually, I would not even pay that for a product that is as exciting as a bag of wet hair 
 The book was boring  you should not read the it because you get confused.So dont read it 
 This piece of garbage is not worth your time.Go elsewhere for true amusement. Rediscover Kurt Vonnegut. This entire book is just terrible and was the only thing I had on my cross country flight 
 The Story of Zahra is a book that could have been great but ends up being a mishmash of cliches and stereotypes.  The character Zahra does seem to have some sort of psychological disorder because she lets herself be used (sexually or otherwise) by everyone around her and seems to have a lack of will to live. She is a very pale shadow of the main characters of Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar and Siri Hustvedts's The Blindfold. Her desperate need to be "loved" ends up becoming sickening to the reader.  There are glimpses of the Lebanese conflict as well as the Arab system of "proper" marriages but much of that is swept under the self-pitying monlogues of Zahra. The author is also not able to give the characters any dimension, instead they are very flat.    The ending of the novel is quite shocking and powerful, however a lack of empathy with the main character makes it less so.  
 Rarely do I just write off a book especially of such a prolific writer as Coetzee but this book is such an utter disappointment in his career and its only value lies in that it will prepare you for the even bigger disappointment of his most recent novel, Elizabeth Costello which this book is a precursor. I am not violently opposed to this book neither is the writing that excessively bad...the book is a definition of the utter waste of time. 
 After reading His Dark Materials, The White Mercedes and The Broken Bridge and enjoying them quite throughly, I ventured forth into the deep unknown of "Ruby in the Smoke", expecting something equally well written, insightful, and entertaining... what I found was below par to my standards.  First of all, the character development was practically non-existant, I put down this book feeling that I didn't really know any of the characters at all. Sally Lockhart is your average every day Mary-Sue; uncommonly pretty, quiet, strong, independent, and as flawless as the Ruby that she is destined to find. The emotions displayed at the death of her father are bland and un-grounded, and it's hard to believe that she has emotions at all at certain points of the story. There are hints of romance that never follow through, statements that are never really explained, and mystery that is...kind of unintriguing.   Setting aside the flatness of the characters (Jim was the only one that I think I liked at all, simply because he had some flicker of a personality) there are many things that just don't go smoothly in my mind with this novel. A girl wandering alone in England in the 19th century for one--although she is rumored to be independent, there really is no way that she could have been -that- independent, given the context. Her strength is too faltering to really give credibility to the fact that she wanders the streets alone in her free time in an era where those sorts of actions were not even tolerated.   Furthermore, the plot is too formulatic. It follows the Hero Motif to the T, with absolutely no bells and whistles. The heroine is perfect, the companions are as following: the charming one, the mischevious boy, the fiery maiden, the kindly old man, Ms. Scarlet with the candlestick... ok, well you get the picture. The villian is flat, cookie-cutter evil, without the dimentions that Pullman gave to his Mrs. Coultier in His Dark Materials. It's an ugly old woman that wants to kill little girls for fame and fortune. I know that this book was meant to be a cliche--but there could have been a little bit of development thrown in to make it, well, more fun.   The action is a little under-described to make anything truly interesting. It's a bit of tell-not-show writing with a dryness that doesn't go down well enough, and an ending that leaves you thinking "is that really it?" Who knows, perhaps the other books in the series are more engaging than this one--but the way "Ruby in the Smoke" reads, theres really nothing encouraging me to go on with the series.  Overhyped? Yes. Make room on the shelves for a better mystery--this is something that reads better if you don't have to pay for it, I'm sure 
 I simply cannot comprehend the anti-capitalist rantings on this and other sites. Bill Quinn is a bitter old man. He is bitter about his life and about his life choices. He obviously resides in a fantasy world in which nothing changes and progress is unheard of.   Is Wal-Mart evil? No, because even though corporations are considered persons for business purposes, they in fact have no persona. That is, a corporation cannot be evil because a corporation is not a living being. It is a legal entity comprised of physical assets and managed by people.   I will repeat my usual comments with regard to anti-Wal-Mart individuals.   1. If you think Wal-Mart is a horrible employer-don't apply for a position there.  2. If you think Wal-Mart is a horrible buyer-don't deal with Wal-Mart.  3. If you think Wal-Mart is not a consumer's best friend-don't shop there.  Wal-Mart does NOT put the little man out of business. The only "little man" harmed by Wal-Mart (ie. by the customers)is the mom and pop that is open M-F from 9:30am to 4:00pm with an hour for lunch. It is the mom and pop that offers a poor selection of shoddy merchandise at ridiculously high prices because you cannot get this merchandise anywhere else. Then, when Wal-Mart comes to town, the people who have been held hostage by small-town economics choose to shop at Wal-Mart. Low prices, convenient hours, great selection, no hassle return policy, and a clean shopping experience make Wal-Mart the retailer of choice. Certainly there is a reason why those with a choice, the consumer, choose Wal-Mart.   When our new super Wal-Mart opened, it spawned two seperate shopping plazas, including a new Giant Eagle, a Target, A Dick's Sporting Goods, Sam's Club, Starbucks, Quiznos, numerous restaraunts, clothing stores, pet stores, shoe stores, jewelry stores, office supply stores, etc. All of these stores are thriving. Given the arguments posted here, there should be 20 empty storefronts and one evil Wal-Mart, still open for business. Reality over Rhetoric, people.  Finally, the economic impact. I will not mention Wal-Marts substantial charitable endeavors. Rather, I will mention the 1.5 million jobs and millions of indirect jobs. I will mention the nearly $300 billion in stock market wealth created by Wal-Mart. I will mention the billions of dollars in wages, taxes, and benefits to local communities. I will mention the billions in income taxes paid each year. Finally, I will mention Wal-Marts contribution to the GDP. Not only does Wal-Mart contribute to top line GDP growth, it also contributes to productivity by decreasing the cost of purchased goods billions each year. American consumers save anywhere from $10-$20 billion a year because of Wal-Marts downward price pressure. That money is used to benefit consumers everywhere.   Think about the facts before you begin a debate about a subject most of you do not understand. Oh, do I welcome responses 
 I couldn't get past the first five minutes of this. Pfeiffer's Russian accent was so horrible, and her lines so bad, I decided to watch Rocky the Flying Squirrel instead, so I could hear Natasha and Boris have an intelligent conversation 
 Gabriel Noone is a 53 year old gay man with his own radio show which comes on at 11 PM. He's upset because his lover of 10 years has left because he needed space. Into his life comes a book written by 13 year old Pete Lomax (although it took him 2 years to write the book and he began it when he was 12 - so he should be at least 14) about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents and the pedophiles they sold him to. Pete has been listening to Gabriel's show and admires him very much.  Well, Gabe calls up little Pete and begins a friendship. He tells  Pete all his personal problems and Pete sympathizes and gives him   advice.  Later, he begins to doubt Pete's existence because no one has ever seen him. He lives with his adoptive mom Donna - sometimes she's a PhD psychologist, and sometimes she's a psychiatrist (MD) - according to Gabe anyway. (Gabe also has a lot of issues with his Dad - which are neatly resolved by the end).  The movie version goes into much more depth, and is much spookier and actually thought provoking regarding Donna' motives, without dwelling on unnecessary sexual descriptions and details that are important on Gabe's agenda.  It's unlikely that anyone would believe that a 13 year old boy would listen to NPR, or even know what it was. Much less have the patience to listen to a grown man's whining about his love life.  See the movie 
 If you are looking for a fresh look at some of Broadway's bomb, do not stop here.  Suskind wrote very little in this book of previously-published material by other people.  This book is more accuratly "compiled by" than "by" him.  I refrain from entirely discounting this book because it publishes (more or less) in their entirety sources that were used by much better authors by their much better books.  It may be a reference for theatre students, but there isn't much else to recommend this book.  And don't get me wrong; flops are a source of morbid fascination for me.  This is why I am so disappointed with this particlar volume -- there's nothing in it that you can't get in other, better written, better compiled, and better organized tomes 
 I have to wonder at the nepotism of the authors on this book jacket, like Lehane, calling Pelecanos "one of the best crime novelists alive." Maybe it applies to earlier books, but with this as my first exposure to Pelecanos I'm not sure I'll find out. I laugh at this being called noir because he finds current cultural references to spit out. Just listen to these people talk--the most stilted dialogue I can imagine: "What?" said Tracy. "Nothing." "You were staring at me." "Sorry." "I don't know why I mentioned my father." "I don't either. Let's get to work, okay?" This kind of uptight and forced dialogue goes on ad nauseam. Ouch. And Pelecanos obviously needs to fill space, filing whole scenes telling the reader about Pee Wee football, what the offensive play calls mean. Noir should not be stiff, and stiff is what Strange is. Lehane may not be always as current but he is fifty times more hip because he isn't out to prove knowledge of the latest rave club or music group. From the reviews here it appears this guy gets polarized reactions so I still encourage you to read him. But maybe start with a library book, like I did. 
 I never recieved this Movie so cannot review it.I could have ordered it and have 440 Western Films. so I cannot keep track of what I order 
 I read novels to escape from people like Izzy Spellman, the main character, not to be subjected to 300+ pages of her dysfunctional misadventures. There was nothing to like about her. The storyline contained opportunities to make her seem like a real person--to give her at least a grain of fear, warmth, or love of justice. As readers, we needed some reason to at least feel sorry for her ever if we couldn't bring ourselves to tolerate her.  A better title for this book would be, "The Case of the Missing Plot." The plot (if you want to call it that) doesn't start until you're 1/3 of the way through the entire page count. About half of the scenes in the book border on absurd. The ending is not rewarding in the slightest.  I obviously disliked the book. The only way I could justify the money  I spent on it was to view it as a parody of family dysfunction. If it is viewed as such, it's not half bad. As a mystery, or series of P.I. stories, it might want to indulge in a "Missing Weekend. 
 0 stars if there were such a thing ugly boring squares (oops, i mean "patterns") cheesy hickish dialect Great! for middle america an example of bloggers jumping on the knitting book bandwagon feeding the sheep along the way really can't for the life of me figure out the hype behind this book 
 This is the most boring book in the entire world! It wasn't very upbeat in my opinion, and nothing really happened! I would never reccomend this book to anyone.. 
 This is a boring album from a boring band. It just want to turn it off everytime i hear it. Dont recomend it to any "real" music fan 
 i saw this and bought it from qvc because they raved asbout how it moisturized thick curly/kinky hair. it didn't do anything for my hair and i didn't like the smell (but its not that big of a deal)--i returned it. i don't think its for coarse-kinky curls, but maybe for others textures.    <for coarse 'naturals' try carol's daughter's healthy hair butter and khoret amen line 
 Bad, bad, bad movie. Bad. Insipid acting (particularly on Theron's part), horrible writing, it's unbelieveable, paper-thin and most of it is truly boring, despite the backdrop of war, death, Nazis and Paris. It takes a genuine lack of talent to be able to pull that off. While the costuming and the soundtrack are fantastic, the movie looks like it's been set on a soundstage producers would use in the 40's, I had a hard time believing most of the sets were on locatio, and they just looked fake. And the ending, pooh. By that time, you barely care about the characters and hope the thing just ends quickly. A very irritating a cheesy movie, it tries desperately to be aloof and melodramatic at the same time. Ugh 
 The discoveries made by the COBE satellite were truly astounding: the microwave background has a blackbody spectrum, the diffuse IR background, and the fluctuations in the radiation temperature (the 'wrinkles'). Unfortunately, the author spends too much of the time making it out as if he really made the discovery and leaving out how it was actually made by the whole science team. Furthermore, there is no mention of how he ignored the disclosure rules of his groups and held a self-aggrandizing press conference before the official announcement of the measurements.  For a much better accounting of this historic experiment, read the book by John Mather, the other recipient of the Nobel for COBE 
 These did nothing for me. Ask your doctor about aphthasol, a prescription drug approved by the FDA -- which means it's passed rigorous government testing standards. Aphthasol changed my life 
 I read The Real Lincoln once and was, in some regards, impressed with the number of sources and the style of writing.  Still, it bugged me because so much that I have read did not allow his pejoratives to ring true.  Therefore, I began investigating its sources in detail, one by one, before coming to a conclusion.  I have found that The Real Lincoln is one the slickest example of half truths, anachronisms, and unfair assaults I have ever read.  So incensed am I that I am preparing a book to counter Mr. DiLorenzo's disgraceful rewrite of history.    Obviously, I can't go into great length here, but let's look at two examples.  1) Several times DiLorenzo scathes Lincoln for ordering the arrest of Clement L. Vallandigham for making an anti-administration speech before Congress in August 1861.  That is false on two counts.  First, Ambrose Burnside alone was responsible for ordering Vallandigham's arrest, a fact well documented but not appearing in Mr. DiLorenzo's bibliography.  Lincoln knew nothing about the arrest order until it had been consummated.  Second, the event that led to the arrest was not Vallandigham's August 1861 speech to Congress but a May 1863 speech that he gave in Ohio.  All this appears several times in the Official Records and contemporaneous newspapers.    2) DiLorenzo cites a number of Republican newspapers that ostensibly criticized Lincoln's policies.  Except when you read the entire article (one from the New York Times, for example) you find exactly the OPPOSITE is true, that DiLorenzo only cited that portion of the article that paraphrased the opposition's thoughts, not subsequent paragraphs where they savaged Lincoln's opponents.  This happens in many other cases such as making historian David Herbert Donald appear to be on the DiLorenzo ticket of Lincolnism when full cites would have revealed something totally different.   Either Mr. DiLorenzo did not do his homework, or he is outright lying.  His obvious purpose is not providing a cogent look at Abraham Lincoln but beating the drum for his modern-day libertarian economic viewpoints.  Only the purest form of the Jeffersonian economic and political model matters to him, and any deviation from it is tantamount to tyranny.  While one may argue the point of minimal government interference, DiLorenzo blasts Lincoln with one pejorative after another and gives but lip service to Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal.  DiLorenzo even goes so far as to blame Lincoln for Reconstruction, as if the dead president were somehow able to lead events from the grave.  Radical Republicans are responsible for Reconstruction, and Lincoln was never a Radical Republican, much less a live one.  I could say much more, but it will have to wait for publication where I can expound at length.   The saddest part of this book is that too many believe this drivel. 
 Waller is usually awesome...but I think he missed it on Puerto Vallarta Squeeze.  Not that I wasn't entertained, because I was...in a mindless sort of way.  The book is a made-for-tv script just waiting to happen! But mediocre Waller is better than most at their best....so buy this book....used if possible 
 I was looking for a substantial book about small-scale livestock farming, and instead I was treated to a very basic introduction to agriculture.  This book would make a great high school agriculture text, but beyond that it falls short of providing any real, useful, institutional knowledge that I was looking for.  For example, in the book the author reviews basic high biology concepts such as the water cycle, the food chain, and the energy pyramid.  She also reminds readers how to round up or round down.  And if that were not insulting enough, she then informs readers that to be a successful farmer, you must dress like a farmer; "clean bib overalls and a straw hat, or a plaid shirt, jeans, and a cowboy hat."  Give me a break.  Again, if you want a simplistic, new age, farming book of little practical use by an author who has less than a decade of farming experience, this book is for you.  If you want a no-frills, no-fluff, useful, dirt under your nails, John Deere farmer kind of a book, I would look elsewhere and I would suggest Gene Logsdon's The Contrary Farmer 
 I bought these shoes to do aerobics in. They look good and are comfortable, but only to walk in. There is zero arch support and when I walk in them I feel as if my feet are flat on the ground. There is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics. My old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones, but I can't use the old ones. The gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes. They are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt. I am really let down over this as it took me three weeks to have them delivered to my remote location. Now I have to look again 
 This was given to me as a gift.  The owner's manual and rechargeable battery pack were missing. The case was the wrong size and the DVD player did not fit.  All I wanted to do was exchange the kit for one that was complete.  When all the 3 different stores told me they were out of stock and did not know when more were coming in, I wrote the company hoping to get the problem fixed.  I never recieved a response and will never buy a MINTEK item again.  
 I personally think that there is a little more to me than  my sexual organs.  I enjoy my body and my husband enjoys my body as a gift from God in our private relationship together.  In my opinion, those who have to scream out loud about it in the vulgarest terms possible aren't in healthy and satisfying relationships.  Lesbian relationships involving little girls certainly aren't healthy or good (make that 24 year old a man and see what you think then) and while it is important to protest the abuse of women in war situations, don't bring that into your life with all the fear and mistrust women like Eve Ensler want to promote against good, loving men.  You'll end up alone realizing that a sex toy or your fingers (or another woman) is not very fulfilling, not only in a sexual sense but in terms of what you get emotionally and spiritually in a relationship that deals with you as a whole person 
 Highly concentrated chemical smell, definitely gets rid of odors but DOES NOT smell like a new car 
 ok SO FIRST LETS GET ONE THING STRAIT THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER AND THATS ABOUT IT.ok so I really liked the book and i was excited when i heard they were making a movie of it but then i saw it and didn't even end up finishing it it was soooooo bad they ruin everything nothing is the same...and when they go to the giant village there like belly dancing and Ella is singing?????? alright that doesn't even sound good but theres a ton of other things as well but it would take to long to right it all down. I really sugest that you don't wast your time on this movie its not funny cute profitible not anything except bad. ITS A WAST OF TIME TO WATCH THIS MOVIE. 
 As a training developer I've been interested in the use of stories in business for several years so I was excited to read Denning's book.  However, the content was literally not worth carrying the weight of the book back home from a business trip.  The book is meandering, repititive and poorly edited.  It's one long train of thought loosely organized in a trail of chapter and section headings.  Most of the book is filled with business cliche's and has little do to with how to construct and use a useful story.  I don't find this surprising since I didn't find Denning to be a very good storyteller, nor were many of choice of other stories interesting.  He has two "stories" from IBM executives which are really just three paragraphs of buzz words strung together. Denning has a very loose definition of the term "story."  Finally, I totally picked up on the self-congratulatory vibe mentioned in an earlier view.  It's thinly veiled in light self-deprecation.  In reality, it seems more likely Denning is a rather lucky man who took a failed career at the World Bank and turned it into a couple of books.  He views his work in knowledge management there as a triumphant turnaround in the face of "political" sidetracking, but I didn't get the sense he knew anything specific about knowledge management 
 Very nice alarm clock, easy to set up. But huge draw back is that the time screen is not backlit, so if you want to see the screen you have to push a button. Very inconvenient!!!! 
 It still amazes me that anyone takes Gould seriously. He is an admitted Marxist, and he allows his social beliefs to influence science. That is not science. Science is a dispasionate search for the truth. I get the feeling reading this book that Gould doesn't like what the truth is, so he wants to shape the way we see the truth. They used to do that in the middle ages when it started to look like the earth revolved around the sun.  Gould tries to claim that Samuel George Morton fudged his data on measuring skull sizes. This is not true. Morton conducted his tests with integrity, and only one error was found which actually benefited the measurements of a non-Caucasian group (Kevin McDonald, "Culture of Critique", 36). General intelligence is not a "statistical artifact" as Gould wants to promote.  Gould or any other scientist who wants to take Darwin out of biological sciences should be viewed with extreme skepticism 
 A "Chosen" Shrink uses Stalinistic tactics to promote his world view.  Very typical stuff. A good book to read to understand why the Jews can't living in peace with anyone 
 Competent, but uninspired and boring. The sound quality is marginal even though it's SACD. The piano is miked too far away and is too low in the mix. Spend your money on Oscar Peterson or Bill Evans instead 
 I first saw this film on British TV some years ago and was mesmerised - beautiful and compelling.  Sadly, the only DVD release was the long out of print cropped US disc, which was not worth the hundreds of dollars it sold for on e-bay, or a reportedly dreadful import from China.  When I heard it was getting a new release I was extremely excited, and pre-ordered it immediately.  "It can't be worse than the alternatives", I thought.  How wrong I was :(  This DVD release (along with Raise The Red Lantern from the same company) is simply one of the worst DVDs I have ever seen - and I've seen some of the worst the format has to offer.  How any company can justify releasing such a shoddy product is beyond me - it must take some effort to make the film look even worse than it does on VHS or the import from China.  Amazon should refuse to sell it 
 This book does contain useful information about general nutrition, especially when it comes to encouraging whole grains, fruits and vegetables. Beware, though, because the author advocates megadoses of vitamins that in many cases are not considered safe by the medical community. While she does reference studies in some cases, she also bases a lot of claims on anecdotal experience, and any scientist knows this isn't science at all. 
 This book is terrible. It is hard to follow and the sequence is illogical. There is no section that simply lists names and meanings...everything is chopped up into silly little chapters. All in all, this book offers little new information. I got a better list of Irish names from a regular baby name book 
 After owning 3 Blackberry's over the years, I made the switch to the BlackJack because of the camera and the ability to add memory. Compared to the Blackberry, the Microsoft operating system is very cumbersome (for me) and was somewhat frustrating to set up initially. On the plus side, the Blackjack has good battery life, the screen is excellent and it has the best reception I've ever experienced. The reason I only gave the phone 2 stars is because after just 3 months of moderate use the ink (ie: the numbers) began wearing off the keys. It's to the point now where the phone is pretty much unusable, especially when it's backlit. I called Cingular first, who passed me on the Samsung where, after 2 hours on the phone, I was told that my only option was to send the phone (my primary source of communication) to their service center and wait 3 weeks. To my surprise, they went on to say that, at their discretion, they might also charge me for the repair. I've read comments on these reviews were people complained about service and I always just assumed they were exaggerating but now that I've encountered this, I do feel it's worth considering.   If you're thinking about a Blackjack, I encourage you to be aware that, for one, the ink may inexplicably wear off the keys, and, that you may well be on your own when it comes to service. I feel that it's reasonable to expect a device as expensive as this to remain functional for at least 3 months and if not, the company who sold it should assume responsibility for making it right. 
 I feel very sorry for Barbara Marciniak. She is being used by these forces of darkness to spread the message that Christ never existed.  I hope and pray that she and her followers see the light before more people become deceived into believing this sugar-coated web of lies 
 This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.  Barbet Schroeder's film, a "self-portrait" of the infamous Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, generated much controversey and even death threats. Idi Amin himself demanded that Schroeder remove particular scenes from the film under the threat of killing french citizens living in Uganda.  The film is well written but almost appears sympathetic to Amin.  The DVD only has an interview with director Barbet Schroeder for a special feature, although the liner notes contain a transcript of a letter Amin write requesting the deletion of particular scenes.  This film has significance, but is not a good one 
 I hated this book.  This family has two girls, Racie and Jaynell.  Rachie is a girly-girl and Jaynell is a tomboy.  It seems like the only person who loves her is her grandpa.  Her parents are just plain crazy.  Mama repedily whipped Racie with a flyswatter because she ate a sugar cookie and the dad threatens to "tear up" their hides each time they do something he does not like.  Once Jaynell said something out of turn and he grabed her shirt collar, nearly strangleing her, and pushed her rougly to her mama and forced her to apologize. Then Jaynell says that she will flench everytime she sees a flyswatter and she gets really scared when mama uses it on Racie.  Her parents are just crazy.  Then grandpa dies.  Dad becomes even angrier and mama just looses it.  I understand that sparking fear in a child's eye is a good thing.  Children should be afraid of their parents-but this is crazy.  Racie just ate one cookie and from that one mistake she recives a thrashing that is talked about in two paragraphs.  Jaynell says that she could hear the repeted blows and it just sounded aweful.  These people were crazy.  This book is crazy 
 It appears that there are fans of Roomba products however, iRobot definitely got ahead of itself with the introduction of this model.  The scheduler is a great feature although programming it is rather clumsy in its design.  The Intelli-bin feature does not live up to its name.  It does not work.  Either iRobot did not test it fully before release or it is plagued by manufacturing defects.  To make matters worse, iRobot's customer service is inexcusable.  After several emails and lengthy waits on hold, I have yet to get a replacement or any kind of resolution.  I'm given a different answer each time I contact them and I never hear back from them when promised.  My advice is save your money and avoid the frustration.  If you're still convinced you want one, wait until iRobot fixes this model and gets its act together 
 Ms. Jacoby appears to believe that what holds black people back is their own shortcomings and the bigotry of some white people. I find missing any comprehension that when the people in power have discriminated against  another, mostly powerless group for hundreds of years that what results is  a dramatic imbalance of power.  Racism in this country has resulted in a  system of white priveledge that still today gives many white people an  advantage over black people.  She can easily fault black leaders for their  initiatives when she doesn't recognize that what blacks are trying to  overcome is a basic imbalance of power.  Why do we need affirmative action,  she seems to ask, when blacks are held back by their problems and by a few  white bigots?  If the question is how do we achieve integration at all  levels of the power structure in this country, then the answer might be  different.  Jacoby never tells us what her personal beliefs are, appearing  to tell what she thinks is the truth.  But there are many ways to interpret  the same set of "facts," and she has clearly interpreted some  things using her own preconceptions 
 "Chamber" was always the worst entry in the Harry Potter series, but this film adaptation manages to take what was already a crappy story and make it even worse. Choppy editing, horrible humor personified by the untalented Rupert Grint, smug acting by the equally untalented Emma Watson, poor screenwriting by that hack Steve Kloves and incompetent direction by the other hack Chris Columbus makes this a very unpleasant experience.   Skip it if you can. 
 If I hear that song one more time, I think I will scream! It is not only the worst rendition of Let It Snow I have ever heard, I would say it is one of the worst songs ever recorded. If you waste your money on this CD, I hope Gloria buys a good tune-writer with it 
 The score to AVP is made up of what comes to feel like orchestral clich√©s and lack luster moments of mediocrity.  There is nothing original about the music, and it comes across as being more of an instrumental experiment in white noise. The film, itself, was a Saturday morning cartoon version of ALIENS, and I suppose to Mr. Kloser's credit he managed to capture this very well.  None of the film's characters are well crafted or conceived, and as such they don't leave a lasting imprint beyond their fleeting moments on screen.  ...Unfortunately, the score suffers from the same fate.  There are a few interesting moments that make instrumental allusions to the scores of ALIENS and PREDATOR, but aside from that there is nothing notable or worthwhile about this CD.  I am a rabid fan of the ALIEN saga, and each of the previous scores in the series captures the mood and essence of their respective films - especially when looking at the first three films.  ...Harlod Kloser's AVP does none of that.  ...The photography on the insert is more interesting that the music itself 
 My wife bought this for our daughter for christmas several years back and frankly it is a terrible book. This coming from a huge fan of Dr. Seuss. It basically has no story or interesting plot at all. The purpose of the book is just to have a bunch of tongue twisters just to have them there. I really was surprised how bad this book was since I love so many other Dr. Seuss books (our child has at least 15 other seuss books we love). Honestly, my child picks this book periodically for bed time stories, and my wife and i will cringe when reading this. Also, our child doesn't really seem to care for it either. 
 I am appalled at the self-serving attitude of this "book". It is amazing how a group of so-called educated people can call this book "amazing" and "wonderful". This book does nothing but push Celine Dion's arrogant face into the public once again. Lest we forget her over-written pop songs or the cartoonishly vile Anne Geddes and her exploitation of babies. Slap a newborn in any costume and it becomes "cute". Anything with a baby is cute. But to package babies wadded into the hands of someone like Celine Dion is borderline obscene.   And "Oh Joy" we get some songs from Ms. Dion. Why don't you just drive the knife just a little bit deeper into my sense of good taste?  I hope Ms. Geddes and Ms. Dion are happy with their work. I am sure this "book" will be bought by the masses of people who fall for packaged art simply because it has names that have been forced upon us. Open your eyes and see this for what it really is. A vehicle to capitalize on two watered-down artists who would sell their names to anyone for the right pric 
 A dated effort with terrible production quality.  Comes off as smarmy and cheesy.  Accurate information but the same amount of knowledge you would get in your first 1-3 hours of basic group introduction.  Only useful if you want to look like you know what you are doing in the beginners class, otherwise completely unnecessary.  I wanted to like this very much but was sorely disappointed 
 The amazing part of this tragedy is that Shilits was a frequent visitor to the baths he condemns in this book even after knowing he was infected and thus infected countless other humans, directly or indirectly.  This book is good only if you view it as an example of someone blaming someone else for your own destructive behavior. While this book has become a major read for those who are into "victimhood" the sad truth is that Shilts is far more guilty than any of those he condemns in this book because he was the one who transmitted the virus, not the owners of the baths he paid money to in order to have his night of fun and ultimate death.  Shilts was sick in more ways than one when he wrote this and deserves condemnation rather than praise. Good night, killer.  
 This book exposes nothing.  There are way-better books out there, better written and better researched.  I bought it after watching her much needed bashing of these retarded Neo-Cons on Bill Maher's show.  Here's the lowdown:  She grabs one subject and repeats it dozens of different ways, adding new twists, puns and jokes.  The book has no cohesive structure.  Like an ADD-sufferer on coffee. Worst of all, she was part of that system.  She gets divorced, and boom.  Her politics take a 180 degree turn.  How's that supposed to work?  If the payoffs from these interest groups are providing for your cushy life, it's good.  But if you divorce your Neo-Con husband, then, all of a sudden it's bad.  Honestly, I see a lack of integrity here.  So, if tomorrow she marries a communist, will she be singing Lenin's praises?  Or how about a devil-worshiper?  Will she go satanic? Then, I watched her devolve on Maher's show, constantly doing nothing but vent her anger at her ex-husband in a thin veil of politics.  She ran for Cali governor and her points were high.  Then, she started opening her mouth, and her points plumetted.  For good reason.  Because she ran a negative campaign against the Governator. (Which is exactly the same thing she acuses Neo-Cons of doing in this worthless book). But, of course, knee-jerk liberals love her, because they see her as a repented sinner who sees the error of her ways.  LET ME SUM UP THE BOOK FOR YOU:  A party holds on to power too long, it becomes corrupt.  Campaign reform is needed.  End of story 
 I was hoping that this book would seek to represent the risks and advantages in an unbiased way but alas it is clearly situated in the anti-vaccination camp.  The author's background and conclusions reveal an interest in promoting alternative and natural medicine, which is not wrong, just be aware of it.    I'm going the way of selective vaccinations and my pediatrician even supports my decisions and agrees that the vaccines I am leaving out carry a very low risk of infection in the first place.  I did not forego DTaP because statistics indicate that Pertussis is a very real threat and the vaccination has put a serious dent in this disease's fatalities. I also plan to get MMR because of recent evidence in Germany that measles can make a comeback if enough parents get scared and refuse the vaccine.    For a more optimistic look at vaccines you should consult something by Paul Offit MD.  Yes, it is probably also biased in favor of medicine but you might as well read both extremes in order to make an informed decision.  
 Although the setup for this movie's plot was interesting, the story gradually unravels in a mess of implausibility and a clunky climax. Campbell Scott is believable, but Rebecca Pidgeon's acting is painful to watch, and her reading of lines is amateurish and sounds too forced. (Perhaps her husband, director David Mamet, should make his next movie about the perils of nepotism.) It is unclear why her character would try to help Scott's character from being captured by the police, while continuing to lead him into their hands. There are countless holes in the plot, and the ending does not tie up several loose ends 
 I bought this book thinking that it would be a nice guide to have after reading all the other great reviews. However, this book is not all that. Most of the stuff in it I already knew. It is a good book if you are completely clueless about this stuff, however, for those that know SOME stuff about the subjects I recommend that you pass on it and find another book. 
 You need only look at the back cover proclaiming Pedro Martinez the best pitcher EVER and claiming Mariano Rivera WASN'T the best closer in baseball from 199-2003 to know this book is a joke. The Pedro claim is based on comparison to pitchers in the same park that year (so if the rest of the rotation consisted of John Burketts and Derek Blowes, that made Pedro better). The Rivera claim goes totally unsubstantiated, aside from the fact that he only throws one pitch!    Good for giggles if you get it here on Amazon used for $2 or so, but no great revelations to be found.    I can't wait for "Mind Game II"..."How the Red Sox let Pedro go, the wheels fell off & now Boy Blunder Epsten is Unemployed"  THAT should be riveting reading.  
 If you are from planet Mars, you still wouldn't find this book useful.  The dumbest person I know, knows more than is in this book.  There is no code.  It doesn't tell you exactly how to do anything.  It just blah blah's on and on about useless info.  Design, Build, and Maintain a website title?  It doesn't cover any of the technical side of this like the title says.  Save you money and pay someone to start your online business for you.  It took a whole book to tell you this?????  Save your money 
 As I stated before, I have a fabulous thing called "Digital Cable". One night I was flippin through the channels and this movie was on. I could only watch so much of it before I had to turn it off because the voice dubbing was way off. Sometimes that happens with "Digital Cable", but it usually it will right itself in the end. As I watched for about a half an hour I could not take it anymore. I tried everything to fix it including switching channels, turning on and off the TV, and things of that nature. I even went as far as calling Comcast and complaining, but even that was a wasted effort. I eventually had to turn it off because I was a hairs-width away from haymakering Morris.   Well, even though Comcast ruined my viewing experience so far, when I was at Blockbuster I decided to give it another chance. I know I mentioned that the lead actor could not act but I thought I could look past this, because it might not be completely his fault. For one the visuals could be slightly off like the voices, or it might be because it's his first movie. Who knows but Howard's mind was made up. "Rumble in the Bronx" was to be rented. From what I saw so far on "Digital Cable", I possibly found a person I could call my mentor, when I enter the world of stuntmen.   When I returned home I threw the DVD in the DVD Player and guess what? The DVD was messed up as well, the voice dubbing was totally off key as it was on "Digital Cable". I raced back to Blockbusters and returned it and grabbed another copy, telling them this DVD was broken. I returned home again and tried to watch it. "WHAT THE HECK!?" I yelled, "IS THE WORLD AGAINST HOWARD TUTTLEMAN!?" You guessed it that DVD was messed up as too. I even tried it out on another DVD Player and it proved to me that the run of DVDs Blockbuster has were all messed up. I got so frustrated that I threw the DVD out the window (I rented it on my father's card so there is no recourse to me).   After I cooled down alittle bit by blasting away on my harmonica, I was still determined to see this movie. I ran up to Best Buy in Troy, and I found a copy. I asked the servant that was working in the movie section if this is the most updated and newest version, hoping that it was a new pressing. I was happy with his answer and purchased it. Well I returned home and made up some popcorn and grabbed a pop. I put the DVD in the DVD Player and dimmed the lights. Finally, Tuttleman will have his moment.   Well to keep this clean and short, let me say that, that night ended with a baseball bat, three (3) stitches in my hand, a broken window, and a hefty grounding-sentence(we are talking WEEKS here). In Conclusion, some movies can't be good, no matter how cool the stuntman, this movie should be pulled off the shelves because it could possibly start a riot. Later.   
 I thought it was me until I read several other reviews of Predator.  Ms. Cornwell can do so much better than this disjointed mess.  If she's going to continue the Scarpetta series, she needs to get back on track, creating characters that we care about.  I finished this book as quickly as possible just to get it behind me.  What a disappointment 
 This is a novel about a professor who is slightly cuckoo.  This is a story about a man who is filled with opinions that can not only be considered conservative for our time, but did for his time as well. I used this novel to exercise my Nabokov, and is my least favorite novel by the author.  I am glad he wrote others, because this alone would have stolen Nabokov's artistic genius.  The book is written well, but the plot is immensely boring.  I would suggest you NOT bother reading it. 
 For one, this is a picture book with captions allegedly written by Ted Williams but certainly ghostwritten.  Two, although there are a few new Williams photos that appear to come from his own private collection, Williams himself has stated that he lost almost everything of this nature in a hurricane years ago - most of the photos in this book have appeared in one or more of the illustrated Williams books that have already appeared.  Three, the reprint quality of many of the pictures is sub-par; better versions appear in other books. Four, given Williams' recent debilitating illness, there is something a little weird about bringing out a book like this at this time.  That being said, if you absolutely have to have everything that has Ted Williams' name on it, get this book,but only if you already have everything else.  Otherwise, start your collection elsewhere 
 A book only a family member could love. Topics include: what Tom thinks of maple syrup, the Peterman catalog, and Amerigo Vespucci. Questions answered: Does Tom jog, swim, or walk? Does Tom like the new Italian restaurant near his Vermot estate? And speaking of Vermont estates: What is his happiest memory of spring? If you are hell-bent on getting answers to those burning questions, then this book is for you.  Insights range from the helpful if somewhat inane (you can change in a second, but making good on change takes commitment and time... or design matters) to the plain old whacko ("revel in life's yeastiness.")   I'm not saying there aren't good insights or that the book is a dull waste. Peters is a good storyteller with a lot of business wisdom. It's just too bad he puts neither skill to much use in this droll dress-up of dross 
 I hope it's live because if it's memorex, it's crap!  that's my latest opinion after using this product.  I have a LiteOn SOHW-802S and it hates Memorex.  I rarely get a decent burn.  More often than not I'll discover while watching my movies just how horrid the quality it.  My movies will skip, stutter, or stop all together.  So disappointing!  Unfortunately I found out too late that Memorex uses CMC media, which only has a 0-50% success rate!  [... 
 I'm a fan of Janet Evanovich and her Stephanie Plum series, I think it's laugh out loud funny.  I didn't care for this story at all, it seemed sloppily constructed and I agree with other reviewers, lacked a story line or believable characters.  I left off a few chapters into it, there was no point in finishing.  
 This book does takes America's False Images of Islam (murdering terrorists) and shows how there are not only true, but even more true.  Findley is able to get a few moderate folks to say some nice things.  But what they can't do is say anything nice about democracy, Israel, the Jews, women's rights, etc 
 This book is one of the most obnoxious partisan screeds I have come across in a long history of reading about this region. The authors conveniently ignore the entire political context, that of Isreal's belligerent military occupation of Palestinian territories, which is what the people they have written about are fighting against.  Such decontextualized, depoliticizing representations lead readers to interpret the subjects of this book as simply deranged individuals, rather than politically motivated people who are shaped by and reacting to their history and social context. In addition, the authors either misunderstand or deliberately misrepresent the range of complex meanings associated with martyrdom in Palestinian society, which in fact go well beyond the issue of suicide bombers. Drawing on the most cliched set of Orientalist caricatures, the authors portray their subjects as alternately murderous, backwards, bizarrely exotic, sadistic, or simply crazy. This is not a book for anyone who actually wants to learn about the social, political and religious situation in Palestine and their relationship to martyrdom and suicide bombers 
 Ok I agree with what most other reviewers have to say a disaster from the start, he should have flown to Patagonia and saved us the anguish of laboring through his journey. It was condescending and degrading in its description, being a former PCV and an extensive traveller I would definately not degrade those around me for being poor.  It would make an amazing diary, if someone else had written it! I was barely able to read the 1st 4 chapters and realized it was only getting worse and dropped it 
 This book was awful.  I read "The Sugar Addict's Total Recovery Program" (DesMaisons) first, and I was spoiled by more rational, documented approach to the subject.  To be fair, I only got through the first part of this book before I put it down in disgust.  This book is the rantings of someone who feels passionately about something.  Great.  Now back it up.  You can't just  say, "This is bad and you have to do this!"  Well... I suppose you can.  But in my opinion that makes for a lousy book for someone who is trying to learn and separate fact from hysteria 
 This guide isn't a guide at all. So many missing links. Thank God for Mick Martin & Marsha Porter for filling in the blanks, their "DVD & VIDEO GUIDES" are much better. It's rare that I don't find the films I'm looking for with Mick & Marsha. With this guide I only find something like 5 of 10 films. Mick Martin & Marsha Porter 9 of 10. Perhaps I'm just spoiled by them, because I see by the other reviews here that this guide was informative to some. Maybe its the only one they've read. One flaw example: Look at actress Winona Ryder's filmograghy, it has Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow listed. Ryder is not in that film (not even in a cameo) 
 This book is great for anyone with a thin knowledge of hip-hop culture.  Boyd drops a lot of names and poses hard but doesn't leave the thoughtful reader with very much by way of hard analysis.  He doesn't even really explain what his thesis is beyond solipsistically refering to a generation's hunger to "get paid."  The fact that NYU Press published this book and sanctioned it as "scholarly" work is a sad commentary on how deeply the ethos of entertainment and racial posturing have permeated contemporary American life.  Boyd will certainly live to regret the title of this book 
 I purchased this cushion thinking it would be comfortable and durable. When you lay in the cushion it is rough and abrasive. If ANY water gets on it it stains immediately and the stain does not disappear when it drys. I am very dissatisfied with the cushion and would not purchase one agai 
 If you are a fan of Ashlee Simpson or Kelly Osbourne, I think you'll really like this album. This seems to be the template for their careers. If you are into anything rougher/cruder in sound than those ladies, I'd say stay away from this. It will only disappoint 
 I think Beyonce has talent&is one of those Musical Acts with that Certain "IT",but at the same time her musical tendency's tend to be over the top. vocally she goes overboard&over things tend to  bring down her attempts at what she is trying to get to. this song is just part 2 of "Crazy in Love" which was a better track. this song sounds like it jacks Teena Marie's 'Square Biz". bringing back Jay Z is a waste of time because his rap on here makes no sense whatsoever. her vocal runs are nice& the channeling of Tina Turner is cool in places,but  more records like this show while Beyonce has a pressence along with charisma&is a Foxxy mama,but making  another so-so track is not a good look at a career that could&Should be something special in time 
 This review is for Turbo Tax Basic for Mac/PC 2005 The software is easy enough to use but either out of curiosity or self abuse, I checked the results manually and found a round off flaw contained in the program.  If you are self employed and use Form SE (Self Employment Tax Form) the program fails to round "up" correctly.  The mistake favors the individual and not the Feds.  This is a math error and the IRS can red flag it.    I remember several years ago I purchased the Deluxe or Premire verson and the program recommended that I might consider putting $300 into my IRA in order to lower my tax bracket, it was great!  However subsquent versions did not do this, after which I only purchase the Basic version. 
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 I'm not a kid by the way nor a teenager. I'm only using this kid's review feature since I'm not a customer. I watched Casablanca recently and my gosh I was disappointed. I really don't understand the fascination people have with this movie. It's a film about unrequited love which frankly doesn't appeal to me. I don't care about great dialogue or "whimsical", "beautiful" acting and drama. This is a film from the 1940s and the acting is stagy and the film has no entertainment value. A film where a bunch of people talk for 3 hours is not the greatest ever made 
 I must say before I write this review, I tried. I tried really hard to get into this album.  I am a huge Pink Floyd fan, a fan of all Classic Rock for that matter. I got this CD for it's historical significance. It is, after all, the first Rock Opera.  Anything you hear about this album being similar to The Wall by Pink Floyd is false. True, it is a rock opera that tells the story of a troubled individual, but it doesn't get as advanced or deep as Pink Floyd does. There are a few key problems that get in the way of this goal.  The music. Original as it may be, The Who's strange melodies and instrumentation don't do anything for me. The melodies are for the most part, predictable. When they try to go out on a limb, it fails and sounds forced. The guitar parts and solos sound thin, and although a big part of it is probably because the master tapes were ceremoniously burned and the recording isn't prime quality, I'm sure a lot of it has to do with a mediocre recording job. It has it's moments, for example, the first few secconds of "Smash the Mirror". But on the whole, it sounds almost like amateurs.  The songs. Not trying to rag on any diehard townshend fans, but the songs seem to be forced into the Opera mold. While this may make it more of a true "rock opera" than "The Wall", for example, it doesn't make for a very easy listen.  The horrible thing is that it IS possible to write songs in opera form and have them flow. Exhibit A: Queen's "A Night at the Opera". Although Queen's superb tracking skills probably helped their case a lot. Which leads me into my next point.  Lack of depth. While musicians who don't layer their songs with extra tracks and studio musicians generally appeal to me, they shouldn't try to make arena rock operas. The Who's attempts to make this work is very similar to asking the white stripes to make a rock opera. It can't be done effectively within the limits of the band.   I did give this album two stars. One for an original concept that gave us so much in the long run, and another star for those few moments it has. Smash the Mirror (the introduction), Pinball Wizard and The Acid Queen are alright. There is a reason why those tracks are popular.  I'm afraid that a lot of people aren't really analyzing this album and are just giving it five star ratings because it is "The Who", the band with the man who smashed his guitar onstage.   If you are looking for a Rock Opera, I suggest "A Night at the Opera" or "The Wall". If you are looking for another "The Who" album, I would suggest some of their later works. "The Who Sells Out" was alright, certiantly better than this. 
 Difficult to read, minimum of information, and no sample usage. Only an english definition and a kana pronounciation to go with each word. This is my least favorite Kanji dictionary.   Instead, check out the Kodansha's Kanji Learner's Dictionary (ISBN 4-7700-2855-5) which is easy to read, with great explanations, wonderful lookup systems, and demonstrates the kanji as used in REAL words. Each kanji has meaning, but are rarely used by themselves in Japanese. Instead, this dictionary gives you a handful of words in which each kanji appears, a definition, and an example sentence or phrase 
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 Well, I was excited to see that this book held my attention for the first 80 pages.  Then thumbing to the back I noticed a couple pages at the end of the book selling devil worship.  These books are authored by the person that gives the forward to The Mastery of Life.    At that point I realized that this book was not for me and I gave it away.  I can't base my life and decisions on where the moon is or what day of the week it is.  It might work for some, especially since Satan has been given certian powers, but I refuse to go to him for security in my life.  I know that he will always let you down in the end, and there is only One that can defeat all enemies for you in the long run.  This is my personal decision and feel that others that make a different decision in their life have the right to do so, and I don't degrade them in any way.  I support their right to choose 
 Remember the days when we were punks and we'd gather 'round the phonograph and listen to some Puccini on the old Edison cylinders? They held up to 4 minutes of music! Count 'em, 4 minutes! Then that hippie opera singer Enrico Caruso came along and all the young punks would listen to him, including myself. He was quite the singer. When I was a young kid though, the only form of music we had were the concerts. I remember seeing Franz Liszt play the piano in concert, quite an amazing virtuoso, and Johann Strauss Jr. conducting his orchestra, those were the days.   Then they came out with those things called grammophones, which were even more modern, if it was even possible. But it was, because then they came out with a new modified version of the phonograph that all the young punks would listen to, lazy kids. I mean, you didn't even have to crank a handle like you had to with grammophones. And what's this, 1 hour, a full 60 minutes of music, on 1 record? Pshaw! 4 minutes of music was all I needed, and I was still pooped out even after that. In my day, it was bed at 4 p.m., breakfast at 2 a.m., then off to the mines. We didn't have 60 minutes of free time.   I have no idea what form of music they have now. Appearently, they came out with a couple other things after the phonograph. Now all I see these days are kids with their fancy eye-pods (?) and MP3, MP4 players, whatever they're called, listening to that "hip-hop" tomfoolery of theirs. You can't even call it music, it's just noise. Well, gotta get ready for bed now, it's almost 3:45 
   Greene is a conman, you dopes! You're being set up to buy this watered down Machiavellian compost, using the 50% of his "laws" that don't contradict the other 50%.   He gets you to believe that your selfishness and aspirations to megalomania you possess are justified, desirable, and trustworthy. You're all going to die, sorry. Try to imagine what they'll be saying at your funeral, no matter how rich and powerful you (in your dreams) become by using the self-contradicting nonsense in this book. "Man, what a selfish prick" would certainly be among the most commonly heard expressions of sentiment.  
 i followed the instructions to the letter , but it only worked about 50 % of the time. i will be sending it bac 
 First let me say this was my first exposure to Jodi Picoult, so maybe her authorship of many novels may imply talent, I can't comment beyond this book. That said, this was one of the few "novels" I was always reluctant to resume and ultimately abandoned halfway through. In addition to another reviewer's comments on shifting POV (for what reason?, I couldn't come to terms with it), unrealistic characters, and soap-opera-type scenes, it was jarring to come across a lack of basic writing skills in some passages. "Pop lit" came to mind immediately, and while I tried to finish this book loaned by a friend, I found it an irritating endeavor. Despite some popularity, I'm not likely to pick up another Picoult book 
 The disc sent is restricted to Area 1 and my machine is unable to  play it.  What do you suggest 
 the plethora of percentages and numbers weigh it down. The views of the author were one sided and sometimes a little biased agaisnt the majority. This is a small quibble and does not really take away from the main message the author is trying to convey. This book is, however, quite an eye opener especially for those who believe that in this country all men are created equal. This book proves that it simply isn't so 
 I also bought the hype of NYTimes Best Seller.  Goes to show you some people have really bad taste.  The story was promising and could have been exciting without the awful dialog.  It seems like the author was being paid by the word - too much repetition, entire scenes which added nothing to the story, etc.  I would NEVER purchase another book by this author.  Glad it's over and this ones in the trash can...  Charli 
 Wow.  I read this book a few days ago, and definitely have my own opinion on it.  I thought I would come here and see what other folks are saying, and I'm not altogether surprised.  The first thing that continually surprises me when I read a poorly written book is how so many people can think it is, in fact, well-written, if not even brilliant.  There is, of course, no accounting for taste.    What disturbs me more than the inability of people to recognize both poor writing and equally poor scholarship (which suggests a lack in either education or practice) is how people can urge others to have a balanced view on a subject when they quite obviously could not be more imbalanced in their own views.  I urge those of you that see Bush as a righteous man to please "read around."  There are, obviously, dozens of books about this man and his actions that touch on topics that books like God and George W. Bush will not even acknowlege, much less discuss, defend, or justify.  To ignore these other sources of information is to be possibly tragically misinformed.  While I do not doubt that many of the previous reviews come from good and intelligent people, I am forced to wonder how they can support a man who performs acts, or at least allows them to be performed, that are every bit as vile as that which he claims to oppose.  Read other books and you will see.   One subject that always makes me wince is the labeling of those fighting our soldiers as evil.  I am not supporting them or denouncing our own, but merely urging all of us to recognize the humanity of others.  Labeling a people as evil undermines their humanity and suggests that they do not have good reasons to be fighting, but that they fight simply to overcome those who "love freedom."  This is from  page 114 of this very book, (a quote from Phyllis Wheatley) "In every human breast, God has implanted a principle which we call love of freedom."  Here's a 'revolutionary' thought: Everybody loves and wants freedom.  If people are fighting they are fighting for freedom, we simply must ask one question: Freedom from what?  Read around and see for yourself if you can answer such a question.  Also, see if you can discover, honestly and objectively, the freedoms that we are currently fighting for.  Another huge bother for me in this book is that Kengor refers to Texas as the largest state in the nation.  It's difficult to take the rest of his scholarship seriously when he makes such a statement.  Another horrific, to my mind, thought is that Bush, and lots of his followers, truly believes that God wants him to be president.  A megalomaniacal zealot in charge of a cadre of nukes with an "I'm on a mission from God" world view scares the hell out of me. 
 Like "Jurassic Park", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters. My reasons for such an accusation: 1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling. 2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.) 3. The book's ending is utterly terrible. 4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.  Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me 
 The Melting Pot has worked for 200+ years. Just because an Invasion of Illegals has broken our borders,our prisons,our hospitals,our schools, laughed at our laws and is now marching in our streets Tamar thinks they should dictate our Immigration policy as well.   History has labeled people like her "Usefull Fools". 
 Not much there,some good ideas but really only a few chapters worth of materia 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 In this novel, Ha Jin writes like a Chinese Michel Houllebecq- the language is simple and direct, and the ultimate outlook for humanity is grim. The protagonist is also a shy young male on the outer rim of the mainstream community.  Like a lot of the modern Chinese fiction, the novel is preoccupied with the psychological damage inflicted by China's Communist years, and the paranoia and self-censorship that occurs to this day. The year is 1989, and the narrator's teacher, Wang, has just had a severe stroke. The narrator, Jian, is studying for the PhD candidacy exams; he is a student of classical Chinese poetry and hopes to be granted a PhD so that he can move to Beijing to live with his fiancee Meimei, who is his teacher's daughter.  Wang's stroke has left him raving and mad. Jian is assigned by the university secretary to care for Wang while he is in hospital. During Jian's afternoons spent in the hospital room, he is audience to his teacher's ravings, which begin to reveal all sorts of disturbing truths that had managed to stay hidden until that point.  The story is set against the backdrop of the student activism leading up to the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square. Toward the end of the novel, Jian becomes so disillusioned by his teacher's revelations that he decides to forfeit the PhD exams, resulting in Meimei's breaking up with him. Aimless, he travels to Beijing and takes part briefly in the student demonstrations. Amid the violence, he is lucky enough to find his way back to the train station to return to his university in Shanning. Upon return he is informed that he is about to be taken away for his role in the Beijing demonstrations, and the novel ends with him on the run, having been forced by circumstances to abandon his belongings, his friends, and his identity.  The stark language with which the ending is rendered makes it all the more appalling. The matter-of-factness with which Jian takes the steps to erase himself from his previous life suggests the ordinariness of his actions in such extraordinary times. 
 This book seems to be the classical text on probability in engineering  and computer science programs, but is definitely  not an introductory textbook. The explanations are overly mathematical. As an engineering student, I'm not interested in proofs and mathematical rigor-I'm interested in understanding how probability works and can be used in  practical applications. A much better book in this respect is the recent book by Tijms with wonderful examples and exercises. 
 I had to return this.  The poetry in the book was very nice, but the pictures were too abstract I think for a preschooler to grasp, and not particularly compelling for me as an adult who not only uses preschool nature books professionally but also collects them as a hobby.  
 Like another reviewer, I had a hard time following these recipes.  Many ingredients are given in Hindi -- for example, "brinjal" or "hing powder".  I know that it is possible to google these things, but it's still an unexpected nuisance.  Additionally, the chapters run right into each other without a break.  There is no index.  There are pictures of dishes, but you'd be hard pressed to find the actual dishes because... no index.    I believe that many measurements are also off.  As an example, the rice pudding recipe calls for 12.5 cups milk(!!) and 2 tablespoons of rice. Many recipes call for 1/4 cup of vegetables.  Erm.  I have no doubt that the book was originally published with metric units and converted unsuccessfully to English units.  Some day, there will be a nice book for non-Indians on South Indian food -- until then, I think I'll have better luck with recipes from the internet 
 I was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004.  I was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie, but it was really lackluster.    The acting is wooden, the script is very lame, and worst of all, the action isn't very exciting.  I expected a much better movie from director Richard Donner.  There is a battle scene, and there are action scenes, but they just aren't exciting.  When the action isn't exciting, you better have a good story.  The story here is alright, but certainly not enough to save the movie.  I don't hate any of the actors, they are decent when they have something to work with.  Here they had nothing to work with, so they obviously didn't do too well this time.  This really isn't worth your time.  I gave this to the thrift shop after I got it, and I feel sorry for the person who bought it there 
 This work was painfully de-gayed.  This film made it look like Keith Haring cared about causes for communities in which he was not a member.  He was valiant on those issues too.  However, he was a proud gay man.  He made art that had homoerotic themes.  Andy Warhol was a mentor to him, but not just as an artist, both were openly gay men in the heavily homophobic 1980s.  This disc showed some of Haring's safer sex messages, but they just breeze past the art he produced on a large pink triangle.  At the end, they say he died in 1990.  However, they should have said, "He died in 1990 due to complications from AIDS."  If Madonna could do AIDS activism in Keith's name during the time this documentary was made, then this documentary could have been bolder.  Keith worked hard to liberate gay men.  This disc is not a respectful tribute to him.  It's offensive in its erasure 
 I did not like this movie. I know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity. Nonetheless, I found it very disturbing: his lack of concern for his wife and children, how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional, and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have "a bit on the side." And what about her kids? apart from the first scene we never see them again; she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man. I'm not a prude, really, but this film left a bad taste in my mouth 
 I thought the information in this book was not usefull to me in any way. I was really disapointed 
 This game was a little too hard for my tastes. Despite the fact that I played at the junior level I managed to get killed shortly after starting out. I also had to restart the game to figure out what my room number was because once I left the room I couldn't find my way back (all the corridors look alike). So far I've fallen down an elevator shaft, gotten caught breaking and entering, been crushed by an elevator, frozen to death and been hit over the head...I've got to ask is this really appropriate for children 
 I thought it was going to cover the entire aspects of the recording studio including the suitable equipments, unfortunately it was just directed toward the construction. I'm not the construction engineer so why would I care too much on the details. I think basic theory on the construction is enough and more elaboration is needed for the furniture and equipment selection 
 This coffeemaker is a huge disappointment!  The stop when you remove the coffee pot rarely works, when pouring coffee the lid is not well made so coffee spills everywhere, and if you do not use additional paper filters, you get coffee grains.  In summary, a huge mess everytime you make a pot of coffee.  The plus? the water filter, but that is it 
 In Edward Klein's The Kennedy Curse: Why America's First Family Has Been Haunted by Tragedy for 150 Years, there isn't much new here except for pure gossip, rumor and innuendo.    Klein starts off to make this a pseudo-scientific study of facts contributing to the Kennedy curse including lots of psycho-babble, genetic factors, etc.  He claims his book is a detective story.  He tries to show how "the Irish immigrant experience of poverty and humiliation developed into an obsessive lust for power and dominance over others at the expense of all ethical behavior."  Throw in domineering fathers, cold mothers, alcohol, drugs, sex, thrill-seeking behavior, ADHD, restlessness, boredom and impatience, and you get a prescription for tragedy.  Many people believe a black cloud has followed the Kennedy family for many generations.  It actually appears that the Kennedy's followed the black cloud on their own.    In trying to prove his curse theory, Klein spotlights seven family members including immigrant Patrick Kennedy, Joe Kennedy, Sr., Kathleen (Kick) Kennedy, JFK, William Kennedy Smith, JFK, Jr., and JFK's maternal grandfather, John Honey Fitz Fitzgerald.  He barely mentions other Kennedy's that have suffered tragedies including Bobby Kennedy, Ted Kennedy, and Joe Kennedy, Jr.  It was interesting to read about the immigrant experience of the Irish, as well as some of the lesser known family members including Kathleen Kennedy and Honey Fitz.  But overall, there isn't much new here, and what is new seems mostly rumor and innuendo.  For instance, Klein accuses JFK of having "chronic venereal disease" and claims it is possible that this caused the death of his pre-mature son, Patrick.  This is a pretty serious allegation to make without proof.  He also tells how Carolyn Bessette Kennedy's friends destroyed her drug stash after that fateful plane crash.  I don't believe the Kennedy's are saints and I know they've done some atrocious things, but give us hard facts.  Overall, my recommendation is to skip The Kennedy Curse.  If you want to read more about this fated family, there are much better and more comprehensive books to be had.  It is hard to believe this book was written by a Pulitzer Prize-winning author. 
 A very slow-moving, frustrating reading experience.  I couldn't get into it and didn't finish it.  Ended by skipping around, trying to get re-interested.  What some people mean by "poetic" is what others would call aimless, a device to avoid actually having to interpret anything.  Instead, the author gives snapshot histories.  Some people call that "postmodern" instead of lazy or not very well done.  Not my taste, although apparently others liked it well enough 
 This book is required for a Finance course.  This is one of the worst college level textbooks I have ever been exposed to.  I am taking this course as a requirement for a 3rd college degree so I have bought a few textbooks.  There are answers to every other problem and not one explanation as to how the answer was derived.  Oh wait!!!, you can buy the accompanying student workbook and there are some semi-explanations there.  If this book is intended to be a teaching tool it has failed.  The authors deserve an F and should reconsider themselves as "professors" or educators.  My university will hear about this total waste of money.  Authors (of this book), educators and others: feel free to contact me and I will elaborate.  I will also offer suggestions and solutions to better present the material where this textbook fails.  [... 
 As an instructor I felt the book was very good, but the students could not use the software on excel 97 or above. It was really frustrating, and I will not use it next semester 
 This book was extremely short, relying on large type and large margins to fill the book. It was devoid of any real plot and left me with a bitter taste. It was typical of "Oprah Book Club" books in that it is very depressing. I think this could have been a great book had the author expanded on the topics and built out the characters more fully. You did get a sense of the main character, but with such a short book, the rest were very weak.   
 This book is not only unremittingly malicious in tone, but well known as being inaccurate, sloppily put together, and a book whose author clearly had an agenda in depicting Paley as some kind of monster of evil. A bad book that leaves you feeling bad.    
 I had to put this book down! I couldn't waste another minute trying to get through this book. She hasn't written a great story since G-Spot and candy licker. Baby Brother was a decent read but Thug-A-Licious and this thong on Fire left alot to be desired. Please keep your money because I truly wish I had! After I read a few bad books back to back by the same author I become very skeptical about purchasing any future releases.... at this point I wont' be. Keep your money! 
 When I first picked up this book, I detested the main character and her bug as shallow, stupid, unadaptable and spoiled.  I plowed through only because I love Connie Willis.  Once Delanna, the main character, reaches her farm, things began to amuse me more - however, that might only be because I enjoy romance.  The book was predictable, the characters infuriating and their emotions undecipherable - who moons after a five-year-old for fifteen years, anyway?  And why does Delanna like Cadiz so much when all she ever does is complain?  On second thoughts, maybe that is why - they're kindred spirits.  Connie Willis can do so much better 
 I recently bought this product for my Palm TX and was equally disappointed as well as annoyed with the cheap belt clip.  It isn't apparent in the photos, but there is a screw attached to the back of the case, which makes it impossible to lay flat.  This I found extremely annoying. The clip (which you can take on and off) is extremely cheap and doesn't secure well.  It flops and swirls around.  Otherwise, the case would be fine.  I do not recommend 
 "I Think Where Alone Now" is her only good song.  The rest is teenybop filler.  Her 15 minutes are long gone 
 This book could have been so much better since the plot is really good. The writing here is a knockoff of Michael Crighton and really doesnt juve very well. I found myself skimming the pages after a while. The subject  of a super algorithm to translate code that has been corrupted is a good one and almost deserves to be written over again 
 I have been collecting field guides to American domestic archiecture for many years and beyond a doubt this is the very worst guide that I have come across.  This guide has many strikes against it.    First, it is too short to give the reader any real understanding of the different styles of American domestic architecture.  Many styles are ignored and the styles that are covered are done so superficially.  As an example, the section on the International Style of architecture only has two washed out black and white photographs. The few details that are explained are done so in the most superficial manner.  Second, the quality of the printing is very poor.  The quality of the paper and binding makes the book look like it was produced int he 1970's. Worst of all, the photographs used to show the different styles are washed out.  A revolution in publishing has happened in the past twenty years and this publisher has missed out in the opportunity to produce a modern looking guide.   Finally, there are some wonderful field guides in current production.  Don't waste your money on this guide.  Check out the guides produced by Lester Walker and Virginia McAlester.  Those are the types of guides that can inspire the reader to learn more about history and American houses.  Avoid this guide 
 You'll never get the straight story about nationalism out of Eric Hobsbawm, who himself appears to try to reconcile his own ethnic identity with the topic.  David Pryce-Jones once noted that in Hobsbawm's own autobiography: "he [Hobsbawm] boasts of a visit to Bir Zeit University on the West Bank to display solidarity with the Palestinians.  Why Palestinian nationalism is valid, and Jewish nationalism invalid, is something else Hobsbawm fails to analyze and explain. Quite crudely, he approves of nationalism in countries which proclaim themselves Communist and anti-American, like Cuba or Vietnam, while rejecting nationalism in countries which are not Communist and are pro-American, like Israel" ([...], Jan. 3, 2003).  Such twisted thinking is evident through "Nations and Nationalism," where Mr. Hobsbawm spares no effort, however subtle, to demean nationalism that doesn't conform to his pre-existing prejudices.  In short, when writing about nationalism, Mr. Hobsbawm allowed his considerable analytic and writing skills to become corrupted by his religion, communism.  Therefore, unless you are an acolyte of that religion, this book is not worth your time, money or effort to read, and if you *are* a member of that religion, I suggest you broaden your intellectual horizons a bit, perhaps by reading Liah Greenfield's "Nationalism: Five Roads to Modernity" or Benedict Anderson's "Imagined Communities. 
       Stout pads out an already short book by repeating herself word-for-word, asking rhetorical questions, and descending into obvious generalizations. When I was an editor in publishing, we used to accuse this kind of author of "phoning it in."          Her worst misstep is deciding to "fold" all the traits of sociopaths into two highly unlikely composites--a corporate wunderkind and a backbiting therapist. As you'll learn from "Without Conscience," Robert Hare's far superior book on the same subject, the average sociopath is more typically in chronic trouble with the law, not in a secure marriage or finanically secure, often gets caught up in lying, and shows other traits of which Stout seems largely clueless. Better yet, Hare actually uses direct quotes from real-life sociopaths, and does not--like Stout--mine the existing literature for conclusions and insights she then adopts as her own.     After two deft, incisive, authoritative chapters of Hare, I saw no reason to endure any more of Stout's thrice-made points and abandoned her book 3/4 of the way through.     Bottom line: buy Hare's book, not hers! I give Stout two stars only because she does provide a valuable eye-opener for anyone who gets involved with a sociopath--which, as she points out over and over, most of us will.    
 Off-hand, I can't think of a worse movie. (And I think Nicolas Cage has done some truly awesome work in other films--hey, he's making a buck, here.) That's all. 1/32 star, if possible 
 i tried reading it, and made it about 3-4 pages.  i'm pretty sure that's a bad sign.  i seem to recall mr. sedaris writing about his mother's bedpan or something.  the impression i instantly got was "BEEP BEEP!  PRETENTIOUS YOUNG WRITER PEDDLING SO-CALLED BAD CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FOR FAME, MONEY AND SYMPATHY."  guess what, mr. sedaris?  i don't give a (expletive deleted) about your so-called bad childhood.  millions of people have bad childhoods and don't play the sympathy card.  check out augusten burrough's books, they manage to have humor and touching moments without this kind of pretentious style.  
 I've enjoyed Johansen's books for years, but this one was awful...I'm beginning to wonder if she's using a ghost writer.  Totally ridiculous plot, trite dialogue...I lost count of the times she used the phrase "Sophie said through her teeth..."  I was beginning to wish someone was PULLING my teeth rather than having to read this book.  Johansen is capable of SO MUCH BETTER than this!  I'm praying she isn't falling into the Nora Roberts/Danielle Steel/James Patterson habit of churning out the same old tired fodder just to meet a publisher's deadline 
 The problem with all Indian cultural analysts living outside India including those writing on cinema is that while they fulfill a mandatory understanding of the cultural theories in vogue at the undergraduate level  in the US, Europe and Australia, they display a singular lack of  sensitivity while dealing with the material at hand. Their survival,  therefore, depends almost entirely on their reader's lack of knowledge of  the field of study which will include amongst other things the native  language, the local history as well as the local lores. On all these counts  Ms Chakravarty's book is sadly lacking in a defined sincerity of purpose.  There are pieces of information which cannot bear testimony - the  relationship of Ali Akbar Khan with the Navketan Productions, for one.  There are descriptions - such as the music composer SD Burman being  described as a baul singer - which are downright ridiculous. And, of  course, her command of the Hindi language is unquestionably poor! Surely  the West and the East deserve a better introduction to the Indian cinema  than this book 
 This is by far the worst action/adventure book I have ever read.  I'm surprised that aliens didn't show up at the end to fight against everybody else...  How this book ever got a top review is beyond me.  Please do not waist your tim 
 More garbage that subtly steers the reader away from the idea that Washington had "No Idea" about the 911 attacks and that they merely screwed up. This book is for cowards that are afraid to look at the hundreds of glaring pieces of evidence that point to Washington pre-knowledge; actually,I think Mossad did the dirty work. I get sick of reading junk like this that serves to only mellow out and support insecure people that cling to the phoney American Dream while they wave their stupid little flags that are made in Red China. The complicity of the American sheeple is beyond belief! Every body is willing to become a suck up like Stalins Yezhov or Beria believing everything that is said to them, then Bang, right in the head. What will you Sensible, moderate sheeple say when the North American Union 2010 and Shafta steal your job and corporations steal your retirement. Another similiar piece of garbage that advances the "Innocent view of the CIA and Washington" is E. Howard Hunt's Book "American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA" Completely sanitized of any useful information. If a book has any truth to it, it will be either "Out of Print", Extremely expensive or the Author will have died of lead poisining ( Gary Webb, Gurudas, David Allen 
 Anyone looking for the old pocket sized "Combat Leader's Field Guide" should walk away from this edition.  I purchased the 13th edition of the Combat Leader's Field Guide for my Nephew who has recently deployed to the Sandbox as a brand new member of the U.S. Army.  I had found the 9th edition to be quite valuable in my Army career because it could be easily carried in my equipment case or in a pocket and was chock full of valuable information. The purchase of the 13th edition was based completely upon total satisfaction with the 9th edition (which, by the way, I still own after 21 years).  The 13th edition is the size of a hardcover book.  That's right, it's huge.  It's ungainly! IT WILL NOT FIT IN ANY POCKET I KNOW OF ON ANY UNIFORM I've ever seen.  It no longer in any way lives up to its name of "Field" Guide.  Desk Guide would be a better name, I expect. In fact, that's what I'm going to use it for instead of sending it to my nephew. Well, let's be honest, part of the reason for keeping it is because Amazon's return policy would deduct so much for postage that I would probably pay more for postage than I paid for the book to begin with.  So, Stackpole: Just what were you thinking?    Who took the Field out of "Field Guide" 
 Why should one buy this series? What about the missing episodes? Are they going to be added later, or this is it? I cannot believe this. Would you buy a bicycle with a missing wheel? Or a keyboard without the C and R keys? I'd like Amazon to explain its customers what it plans to do.. 
 I was looking for a book that is not as detailed and complex in its description as that of a history atlas, but also one that is not as shallow and perfunctory in its survey as that of a textbook targeted at high school students. "A History of Civilizations" satisfied the above criteria but failed to evoke in me any sense of satisfaction after reading the book.   Instead of the usual way of simply chronicling events, Fernand Braudel decided to approach the subject matter from the perspectives of geography, history and significant periods in the evolution of the civilization. A pretty innovative approach, I thought. But in so doing, not only did he miss out on important details in the content, he fell short of conveying what meager ideas that he had left in a lucid and effective way. He assumed that the reader has sufficient background information and hence plunged right into the `deep end' of the subject matter. The already mind-boggling reading experience was worsened by the choppy, inadequate translation of the original French writing. The lack of illustration, annotations, maps/diagrams will contribute to the bewilderment, and not the enlightenment of the poor reader.  If you were to buy this book, just read Chapter 1 (a general review) and the chapters on Islam, Latin America, USA and Russia. The rest of the book is not worth your effort getting mired in the entanglement of information (or rather, lack of information and insights) and having to bash your way through. Furthermore, the book was written two decades ago, and hence the information presented is not up-to-date. Well, treat it as a `time capsule' of facts then. 
 This is a short review because when you've heard one of these you've heard them all.  They're all played in the same starched, stiff mannor, with brisk tempi, little feeling, no shaping of phrase, and no color.  The Mozart symphonies--the latter ones, anyway--have their own style and merit different approaches (No. 31, the "Paris," is almost curtain-raiser music for an opera buffa, for example, while No. 39 is in some ways proto-Beethoven, harmonically sharing a good deal with the "Eroica," and No. 40 shows Mozart heading into a realm of a basically Romantic chromaticism that would have led to much fascinating music if he'd lived longer and written more in that style).  Yet here all the works are played interchangably.  These are performances that could have been generated on a computer.  The sound is excellent, but that's about all there is to recommend this set.  Hogwood's traversal on period instruments has more personality, believe it or not.  And to really show what can be done with works like these on HIP instruments, try Franz Bruggen's remarkable recordings of the Haydn symphonies on Philips.  I can't recommend this set, and I got it for considerably less than the Amazon price, too.  
 If you like watching F-86 Sabres pitching, yawing, rolling, shooting, and crashing then this film might be for you. There is plently of this as it was made in cooperation with the USAF.  Be warned however: - This film contains an idiotic romantic subplot. - Robert Wagner's "cool" character appears to be from another film. - Chinese soldiers are portrayed as gibbering idiots.  Watch "The Bridges at Toko-Ri" if you want to see a decent Korean War/USAF film. 
 "You've got to be kidding me" is what I exclaimed when I received this book in the mail.  I was shocked that it had a solid 5 stars from all of the reviewers as I think this book is very outdated. If you are interested in current fashion and beauty trends, this book is not for you.  Although the copyright is 2001, it might as well be 1986 -- that's what the photos look like.  Yes, the diagrams are somewhat helpful but if you are a lover of current fashion photography, you won't be inspired by any of the photographs to actually use the techniques. I found the photographs and the art direction of the photographs to be a bit cheesy and tacky.  
 PLease consider how many books there are out there before you pick up THIS one.  Though you may be a fan of suspense or romance, this has a plot that has managed to be predictable, dull, and pretentious all at once.  The story is a basic spy story, and the little romance is obscured by slang which has no place in today's literature.  The author tends to describe things in a way that could take paragraphs (if not pages) to explain.  The only reason to go near this book is for a school project or in class assignment.  Otherwise, ther is no reason to read through this "classic".  
 "Mahler ist nicht fur Kinder." --William Steinberg, hearing MTT conducting Mahler  What's most surprising about hearing this concert on CD is that I was there.  I attended one of the performances used to make this disc.  Somehow the live event was more thrilling than what came out on this CD.  I know it's hard to capture the full impact of a Mahler 2.  I also know that "being there" adds a certain thrill.  Nevertheless, while I noted some of these shortcomings at the concert itself, they seem to bother me more on the recording.    One of the things that bothers me most is the way MTT really elongates the tempi.  This is easily the slowest Mahler 2 I've ever encountered on record.  But it's not because of extreme contrasts between slow and fast sections.  *Much* of the performance is slow--too slow and de-li-ber-ate--and often the structure crumbles in MTT's hands.  For just one example, the first theme in the first movement doesn't have nearly enough tension and build, so that when the cor anglais second theme emerges (*beautifully* played by Julie Ann Giocobassi, by the way) it's not a "respite" from anything.  The whole first movement never really gets off the ground, so that there's no dramatic contrast between it and the bucolic second movement--which is to be so strikingly different, remember, that Mahler wanted five full minutes' pause.  Compare Rattle, Walter, Bernstein, and Abbado, among many others, for logic, architecture, build, just sheer excitement.  The second movement contains some of Thomas' worst conducting on record, with him doing absolutely nothing with the second staccato theme that starts in the high strings.  The strings just bow the repeated phrases in unison without any shaping.  The very Yiddish third movement in the Phrygian mode doesn't sound very Yiddish or very Phrygian in the hands of MTT, where he blows through it very briskly without acknowledging any of the good humor.  (For the life of me I don't remember it being that way in concert.)  Urlicht is the first high point, with Lorraine Hunt Lieberson singing gorgeously and with so much of the emotional range missing from MTT's rather repressed reading.  Finally in the last movement things get exciting.  Suddenly we have the huge contrasts in dynamics and tempi that Mahler demands (though more in dynamics than tempi--Tilson Thomas rarely gets beyond medium-slow in this interpretation).  The chorus is superb, maybe the best I've heard on record.  The soprano, Isabel Bayrakdarian, last heard on the soundtrack to the second "Lord of the Rings" movie, is awful--with a small, colorless voice that sounded as unimpressive live as it does on this CD.  But she is very pretty and young and thin, and Ms. Hunt Lieberson is older and plump and plain, so guess who got the bigger applause at the concert?    Some interesting discrepancies: the offstage brass on the CD are flawless.  In the concert I attended they fell apart at their first entrance in the last movement, that section being a true train wreck.  Such are the dangers of a live performance!  And the organ at the end is much louder on the CD than it was live, where it was barely audible, even though I was sitting rather close to the pipes.  However, even on the CD it is muffled and indistinct, and in fact the whole final episode is somewhat "tubby."  Curiously, the sound throughout is compressed.  I can understand why the soft sections were pumped up a bit--to squash audience noise--but why are the loudest parts flattened?  Just compare the brass fortissimos on Rattle or Bernstein or Haitink to this CD to see what I mean.  It was louder in concert, that's for sure.  And listen to how "pinched" the brass section in particular sounds in the fortissimo sections.  I'm sure they were using unidirectional mikes to keep as much extraneous noise off the recording as possible; still, DG does this kind of recording all the time these days, and they do a better job of it than is evidenced here.  Perhaps it has something to do with this being a hybrid SACD: maybe some sort of data compression had to be used to fit everything onto the discs.  Or maybe there was lots of overdubbing (the trumpets from night two mixed with the strings from night five, with the winds from night three, etc.).  Or maybe the beauty of tone of the SFSO just isn't comparable to the best European Orchestras--even at the concert I noted a certain blatty quality to the brass, especially the trumpets; they sounded raggety.  Compare Rattle for volume with control.  Whatever the reason, this is not an epic Mahler 2nd, and "epic" is written into the pages, obviously.  But more frustrating is MTT's slow ponderousness.  He makes every moment in this performance a "big moment," while paradoxically not really coming up with any big insight at all.  He just seems to think slow tempi and reverence equates with profound.  Sometimes I feel like he's up there saying, "Look at *me,* conducting *Mahler.*  The big leagues!"  But despite the handling with kid gloves, the overly-reverential (almost sentimental) approach, he doesn't really come up with a new angle to a work that--hate to say it--is starting to almost become a warhorse, or at least very very familiar and no longer shocking in its effect.  Just as the last generation tested their mettle on a Beethoven symphony cycle, Mahler's symphonies seem to be the proving ground for this generation, and I personally get the feeling MTT is going about this cycle and recording it with audio and video for posterity mainly to vault himself up there into the realm of the conductors of legend.  I say that in part because, from a musical standpoint alone, this CD and indeed this whole MTT Mahler cycle has been totally unnecessary.  The conductor clearly has nothing new to say, even though he has spent a great big chunk of an oil barron's money to say it.  But there's really no reason to recommend the present recording with Rattle, Bernsteins I and II, Haitink, Scherchen, Solti, Walter, Klemperer and Kubelik available.  Just off the top of my head 
 As a South African acquaintance said to me... "I've never been able to finish a Gordimer book". I decided I would finish this book, and it is well written if in an archingly intellectual manner. But its tough  going...too detached, and ultimately not enough to keep you wanting to go  back. I chose it at random since I had heard so much about Nadine Gordimer,  but had never read any of her work.  Suggest finding another one 
 It's summer, and my reading matter always lightens up significantly! I spotted this book at the library and figured, why not!  I know, I said never again for Danielle Steel, but the plot interested me.  How bad could it be, right?    Well, there's good news and bad news.  The good news is that the plot is different for DS, and held my interest enough so that, unlike Impossible, I actually finished it in one day.  The bad news is that this book seems entirely devoid of any attempt at editing.  The repetition is maddening. When reading becomes a chore, and you can skip entire pages and not miss anything, it's time to start some serious editing.    Here are some suggested areas of improvement:  - Shorten up the paragraphs.  They should not exceed a page! - Try spending a little more time developing the characters.  I couldn't "see" Sarah - when I read, I want to be able to clearly visualize the people and after hundreds of pages, I never had a clear vision of the main character - Pay attention to style. Every time she spelled out 30,000, I wanted to pull my hair out.  Small thing, but numbers over nine should always be written in numerals unless they are at the beginning of a sentence.  As I've written before, DS needs a good editor. This book could have been one of her best to date.  
 i bought this for a friend so i dont like it. thats all i have to say 
 I grew infuriated (and bored) with this novel when I discovered that, about halfway through, that it had no idea where it was going. The small elements of the book that deliver actual story are some of the most engaging efforts at fiction I have come across in years. It is genuine, deeply interesting, and swolen with careful, careful writing.   Unfortunately, "In the Skin of the Lion" strays far too often into a kind of lazy poetry-prose, a landscape where every notion is ephemeral and fleeting. In some parts, this book is not so much a novel but a dull soliloquy on the helplessness, bravery and romance of the people we are supposed to be interested in reading about. 
  DFB are a complete disgrace. Remember the days when true artists like Pac, Big, Ice Cube, Nas, Bone Thugs n Harmony etc. gave us classics that had a message of some sort? Well unfortunately, that was back in the 90s where there were few corny acts there and there, but a majority of true people had great music. Fast forward a good decade later. Acts like D4L and DFB has to be the worst thing to hip hop since Vanilla Ice. Don't even call this hip hop or even music. it's a bunch of silly noise that was meant to be played on MTV & BET with no substance whatsoever. Even white kids at my school listen to this mess. What has humanity come to? I'm pretty sure if I said who A TRibe Called Quest are, they would have blank faces on them. Yup...so sadly, great hip hop is destroyed by nonsense, lazyness, and dumb lyrics. If you spent a dime on this thing, I truly feel sorry for you b/c I'm pretty sure your farts has more music ability than this. So please stop promoting this garbage. It's a waste of time and spce 
 Here's the deal scoop on this.  Lots of repeated questions, at least one blatantly wrong answer, and some ambiguous questions that will make you feel stupid for not getting it when in fact it's just a stupid question.  A lot of times the author gets lazy and will provide the following explanation as to why the answer is correct: "statement of fact".  Gee that doesn't help too much.  I guess you can get this book if you like tough love, meaning, it MAY teach you by abusing you.    Not a book for you if you don't already know the material.  Only get it if you need sample questions.  
 The book covers the process of smoking well. Good information on brining, sausage making, and processing smoked foods is provided. It lacks fundamental data such as internal temperatures of smoke cook meats. A few  recipes are presented, but this is not a cookbook 
 Linda Ashcroft crafted a well-written book of fiction. The dates she claims to have been with Morrison have been publicly proven as inaccurate. She was sued by the Morrison family when the book was first published in Europe and she lost the case, 3/4ths of her advance money and the book was pulled from the shelves. When the book was edited and published in the US, it was proven she did not know Jim and she again lost her advance money and her publishing company canceled her book tour and refused to do any promotion. It would be a great book if she just published it for what it is...fiction. 
 I committed myself to reading all of the Caudill nominees for 2006, but broke that promise to myself on this book.  I thought the whole premise was preposterous (why would great-ancestor Smith waste so much time and money building these treasure houses?), and none of the mysteries held the slightest bit of suspense for me.  I trudged my way to the half-way point, then just started skimming until I got to the end.  For all that buildup, I thought the ending was really hokey and dumb anyway.  I hate giving such a negative review, but I found nothing redeeming in this book 
 It is usually a bad sign when there is a guide included to explain the movie makers reasons for making the movie and to explain the lesson they want to teach.  The movie does give you a conclusion for the anime.  There is little to laugh at in this movie, the directors are to focused on making their point.  They have decided to make the anime and movie more "real" than the manga and as such have lost the light hearted humor and in their attempts to be "realistic" have created inconsistancies that can not be explained.  The music and animation are excellent.  But I would recommend buying the soundtrack and renting the movie 
 I have been a professional cook now for about 8 years and I am maybe not the best baker in the world, but I do pretty good. After reading the reviews I decided to try this book for myself, I was looking for the Best Cupcake Recipe. Well I certainly DID NOT find it here (even though the front cover is cupcakes). The cupcakes were hard to swallow they were so heavy and oily and the icing almost made my teeth fall out. NO ONE liked them. I did find the best recipe (not from the book), but it took me 4 days and lots of trys, but I now have my own. I agree completely with the other negative reviews at least for the recipes that I tried 
 I just got this thing 2 hours ago. In the middle of grinding a 16oz bag and it stops working. Made it through about 8oz...try again two hours later thinking motor got too hot, nope. Number one, this is nothing more than a typical small "hand held" grinder with a few lights and a cup dial that does absolutely nothing. DO NOT BUY THIS. The others who wrote a positive review must have been lighting the bottom of a spoon before they tried using this thing 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 I probably would have never read this book had I not received it as a gift.  However I am a fan of the occult and unexplained phenomenon, so I gave it a shot.  The book is entertaining; if only for the fact that her assertions about things like crop circles, the pyramids, and Atlantis are outlandish and fanciful.  Her research is morbidly flawed, she sites several websites, and never bothers to site any credible references.  It's important to note that the book has no bibliography.  Many of her conclusions are a result of information received from her spirit guide Francine, and it occurred to me many times while reading this book that perhaps Sylvia should take what Francine has to say with a grain of salt.    The book is rather light on content.  She tackles several "secrets & mysteries", however only dedicates a few pages to each.  Her chapter on alien abductions is barely three pages long.  For someone really looking to delve into unexplained phenomenon, there are plenty of books out there which explore these things in much greater detail and with more credibility.  But if the book happens to fall into your hands, you might as well read it.  It's good for some chuckles.  (Of course, it's not supposed to be funny. 
 Bought this book because it looked like it covered all the topics I needed to finish a project I was working on, but so far have yet to actually find an answer to a single question. This is one of those books that seem to plague the technical genre: it "alludes" to a particular topic, but never actually goes in-depth on anything.  Simply listing all the options available on a screen, while taking up lots of pages and creating an entry in the table of contents, doesn't make for a useful book. The examples provided were so superficial, I've got to wonder whether the author has actually done anything more than played with the software.  This one goes on the bookshelf with all the other "never to be picked up again" books. Too bad they're only of value to the paper recyclers 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 This was a somewhat enjoyable book until about 2/3 of the way through it. It became an excrutiatingly slow read. However, if you want to read up on HIV and it's symptoms/emotions, you might enjoy it 
 Feisal Abdul Rauf is an honest and decent man who sincerely believes what he writes. He has an excellent reputation, well deserved.  Having said that, I must now address what he has written.  Part of the book's title is, "A New Vision for Muslims and the West." Unfortunately, that's all it is, a vision, a fairy tale told to those who want to believe it.  The dark and sinister forces who are radical Islamists will have none of it, and if we are lulled into complacency, the events of 9/11 will become repeated events.  Like it or not, the hardliner Islamists are at war with the West, where the objective is total world conquest, where everyone either becomes a Muslim or he dies (the exceptions being Jews and Christians who, as People of the Book, will be treated as second class citizens).  What Raef refuses to acknowledge is that there are earlier verses in the Qur'an that _do_ preach peace and tolerance....but their are the later verses calling for subjugation and death to the infidel. Islamic scholars have decided that the later verses abrogate (trump) the earlier ones.  For this reason, in my opinion, the book misleads and is fatally flawed 
 Amazing that one can write this revisionist nonsense and get an audience. It shows how far the Christian Church has fallen in its educational and apologetic duties. How can our community be so ignorant as to fall for this PRSH (look the Hebrew up)? 
 I found lots of annoying aspects to this 2004 Third Edition of Shapiro's J. K. Rowling biography.    What had to be the most annoying was that  Shapiro apparently just slapped extra material at the end of the book each time he came out with a new edition.  At the end of what must have been the original 2001 edition, Shapiro talks about 2001 events in the present tense, and about looking forward to what will come in 2002.  This appears to be the case again where the 2002 edition must have originally ended.  Apparently there was no major revision of the material in the earlier editions for this new 2004 edition - it was simply added to for each new edition.  Among other weaknesses, the book is very repetitive and choppy, with the chronology often disorganized.  Also, the author's personal comments did not seem very insightful.  He mentions several times what a good husband and father Rowling's second husband is and how happy the marriage is, not as a quote from anyone, but just as stated "fact."  The book contained plenty of good and interesting information, and I believe that the inaccuracies that other reviewers mentioned from earlier editions have been mostly corrected (as it matched most information I've read from other sources, which Shapiro is often good about citing).  However, some major editing needs to be done on the book 
 A quick glance through and I was very disappointed. There was no table of contents and virtually no intro/summarization/overview. It just plunged right into a particular encounter. This book has also been shredded a bit on various boards. I might buy it if an extensive errata came out soon.. 
 When I first picked up "Tomb of the Inflatable Pig", I was blown away. I'd never even thought about Paraguay until I'd read that book and I'll still maintain that it's one of the best travel books I've come accross. So "Theatre of Fish" comes as something of a disappointment.   Put simply, it's very dull. Occasional descriptions of massacres are interesting but generally it show none of the verve or humour of his first one.  Frankly I've only read half way and I'm having trouble trying to finish it.   If you've read his first book then avoid this one like the plague. You'll be shattered. 
 If you want a balanced, thoughtful background on the PRC's relationship to the US you will have to read this book in conjunction with something written by Maoist revolutionaries. From the first page the authors fail to provide any kind of serious analysis to provide a thinking reader something to ponder. Thankfully I received the book as a gift and didn't have to waste my own money on it 
 It distresses me not to be able to write a rave review for this book. Linguistics and religious language are two of the subjects that I am most deeply interested in, and I'm well trained in both; the need for clarity in religious language is a cause that matters greatly to me. I greatly admire the work of Wierzbicka, who is a superb scholar. I should have loved this book. Unfortunately, I didn't. That doesn't mean that it's not a valuable and important book, with all the necessary scholarly bells and whistles. It's all those things; I'm glad I have it on my bookshelf. But it is so meticulously detailed, and makes the same points so endlessly many times, that it's extremely difficult to read. I wish it had been edited as rigorously as it was written 
 This otherwise excellent account of George W. Bush's appalling environmental record (strategically?) ignores, and thereby condones, the President's three most deadly anti-environment policies: never-ending mass immigration, nearly open borders, and countless stealth attempts to reengineer more amnesties. These policies are fueling a US population explosion that is outstripping that of many Third World nations.  Bush and Pope (and his Sierra Club) are something like the dazed South Asian islanders seen wading out into the sudden eerie low tide, oblivious to that high distant foaming crest, a tsunami, making its way, making its way.  
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 The cover of this book caught my eye and even though I hadn't heard anything about the author I decided to give it a try.  It was a light, easy and mildly entertaining read. When I read mysteries I never try to guess who did it.  I prefer to just enjoy the unfolding story.  However, I figured out who did it without even trying.  The story wasn't very original and the motive behind the murder was so (for lack of a better word) lame.  I may give Ms. Swanson another try just to see if she has improved.  
 As other reviewers have said, this book was not my cup of hallucigenic tea. My best guess at what the author was attempting was the injection of a Camus character in a Beckett play as filmed by Fellini-- all the existentialist angst of the masters yet none of their profoundness.   To be fair, there were wonderful exchanges and insights (10-15 at most) peppered throughout this 243 page book.  However, most of the book feels like the author wrote a wonderful sentence and then took funny blue/green/red pills to take the edge off...  and became really impressed with himself and his ability to "get" the absurdity of our modern times. I wish he would have sobered up, consumed a bag of M&Ms and written the book the cover promised to deliver: "a dark comedy for overlit times" that is "satire with a capital 'S'. " 
 I find this book unreadable. I read the first half and scanned the rest. I found it rather like a joke played on the reader rather than a novel. If this was a parody of style, it would work better if the reader was very  familiar with the styles being parodied. I felt betrayed for having bought  it. No character, if any could be called that, appeared to be remotely  likeable 
 I really wish this product had been better designed because I loved the fact that it's a tablet style and it's a lot easier to hold and watch, especially when you are sitting in tight spots like a bus or plane, and space is at a premium.  Alas, my unit had several problems and I decided to return it.  The biggest problem was that after about 3 days of use, the screen went blank on me when I turned it on.  I had to fiddle with the battery pack and plug it into the A/C adaptor to get the screen picture to come back on.  A few days later, it happened again, and then again.    The other big problem was that it really didn't like playing DVDs that I burned myself.  It played regular store DVDs well, but when I played my own burned DVDs, whether it was DVD+R or DVD-R, the player's picture would constantly freeze.  It just couldn't handle the slightest imperfections on the disc, and since home-burned DVDs aren't burned in the same fashion as commercial DVDs, this player was just too sensitive to successfully playback home burned DVDs.  The final concern was the fact that it didn't come with any kind of case, and there is no way to protect the screen while transporting it.  I was very concerned that over time, the screen would get scratched and damaged.  You would seriously need to consider buying a 3rd party case for this unit.  Design-wise, the tablet style is a great idea and I hope that more manufacturers start making tablet style units in the future 
 Don't waste your money on this reprint edition. It is printed on poor paper, the type has been reduced in size, the typesetting thus compacts and makes it difficult to read, and the ink has blurred.   I had borrowed an earlier paper edition and thought that was what this is. Not so. Buy an earlier paperback edition if Block is your mentor. I wouldn't buy it again. Perhaps that's why there are so many "used" copies available everywhere. Books are written to be read; this particular printing was printed to be sold. They should have left well enough alone.   By the way, I'm not a beginner. I've been writing and published in numerous venues for 42 years.   
 I over prepare for trips and in doing so I bought Fodor's guide to all the Hawaiian islands, Frommer's Kauai (the one you are thinking about buying), and the Ultimate Kauai Guidebook. This Frommer book is absolutely awful.  It has no more detail in it than the Kauai section of the Fodor's book covering all of the islands. I have never been more disapointed with a travel book than I was with this one. The best Kauai book by far is the Ultimate Guidebook by Doughty and Friedman. Again, this book is nothing more than a waste of your money. 
 I heard an interview with Dr. Kushner on NPR today.  He explained how the comfort in the 23rd Psalm lies in the realization that, for example, God is not on the side of the terrorists, or the hurricanes; he is on our side.  Why define the world as divided so in the first place?  Terrorists are people too.  Nature is people too.  Until we accept the fact that God is in all of us, we will continue to place things in "good" and "evil" bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world.  Our comfort and relief from Psalm 23 will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we (WE, not God or some divine law of the universe) label as evil.  I rate the book 2 stars instead of 1 because it is clear the author means well and has a heart of gold, full of compassion.  Unfortunately his wonderful intentions are sorely misguided. 
 I heard great things about this cd.  however when i popped it in my player the 1st song was edited. i thought this must be a mistake because it had a parential advisory sticker.  but the whole cd turned out to be edited. ALL SWEAR WORDS ARE REPLACED WITH ANNOYING RECORD SCRATCHES.  i even bought another copy. they are all edited.  DO NOT BUY THIS CD.  or maybe buy the real edited copy.  who knows?? 
 I bought the 688 for its price and Logitech name. Customer service was good. I bought it in April 2006 so I have 9 months of marginal satisfactory experience with the device. Took me 4 hours to program, and I needed their help. Same problem with CD as others have reported. Remote does not hold programming, and it is too much trouble to reprogram. Worked well for a while now works spasmodically. Some times I have to resort to the cable remote or the remotes for devices to get desired operation. Battery life is poor. I have had very good results with Logitech support. They would send me a updated file for me to install.  However, I wish I had spent more and gotten one with rechargable batteries and easier to read and operate controls 
 This must have been fun to record but it feels to me like they were just having a lark w/country music. As a result, it's competently performed, but bland in a sort of Country Lite kind of way. When famous musicians cross genres, it's more rewarding when they at least bring us something new, or dive in w/both feet and give us the texture of the new genre--I was looking forward to something more. Instead, it's like hearing a good country cover band in a Las Vegas lounge (nothing wrong w/that, but at least in Vegas the music is free).  There are many better country or folk or bluegrass albums on the market right now that are more rewarding than this. Start with, say, "You Don't Know Me - Songs of Cindy Walker," just released by Willie Nelson, a better example of how to do a tribute album. 
 I really liked this when it came ut on vinyl, but in retrospect, it was the cause, not the music. B. Raitt is grand, G Nash with an excellant Cathedral, J C Young, and the highlight to me We Almost Lost Detroit by the great Gil Scott-Heron. But the second disc is second rate. Edit the filler and it rates higher 
 Faith Hathaway had just graduated High School and was one week away from going into the army.  She was full of hope and life.  Robert Willie( the man this movie was based on), along with his accomplice raped and murdered her.  She was raped, stabbed 17 times, and raped after she died.   The director of this movie denied requests made by Faith's mother, and gave all the attention to the only person who deserved to die.  Where was the mercy for Faith?  Where was the compassion for Faith?  Where were the people protesting for Faith's life?  Finally where was the story about the mercy which was denied to Faith?  What about her suffering and that of her family?  Barely a foot note in this movie.  Ohh and Sister Prejean has been discovered to lie when it suits her case.  
 If mystery wood bugs you and you have to know what it is, this is the book to use.  Appearances can sometimes be deceiving even for experienced woodworkers.  The techniques in this book are easy to use and, as the title  says, accurate 
 Everybody I know loves this film. In today's environment, when WKW is being hailed as the premier director from Asia, and one of the world's best, I don't know how many really actually love the film, and how many don't have the courage to state a contrary opinion. Make no mistake, I think WKW is one of the greatest directors I have ever watched - how can somebody who makes a movie like "In The Mood For Love" (ITMFL) not be? Actually, his greatness lies not just in his ability to make a movie like ITMFL, but in his versatility. It is almost impossible to conceive that the same person made both ITMFL and Chungking. Well, his greatness notwithstanding, I can't stand this film. And no, I can't sit, lie, or do anything else with it either.  So what is it about this movie which gets my goat? The directorial style, and the cinematography. Actually, I think parts of the latter are great, and the parts I don't like are influenced by the former, so let me just talk about the former. WKW uses a particular style which extends across most of his other films, including "Happy Together" and "Fallen Angels" (yes, I've seen all of them, and hate almost all of them uniformly). The hallmark of this style is a very modern, staccato, piecemeal approach, stringing together relatively disparate ideas, scenes, or action sequences (almost reminiscent of Godard's "Breathless", as the editorial review says here, though not quite). His style is further marked by characteristic filming styles - for example, the slow shutter speed effect. Actually, this is one of his peeves, which even spills over to ITMFL, where it oh-so-doesn't-fit-and-stands-out-like-a-sore-thumb. Having watched nearly all his films, and having seen the wide array of situations across which is deploys this mechanism, and having spent hours analyzing the potential connecting theme, I can assure you that there is absolutely no uniformity and sense to its usage. It gets used for dream-like sequences, for grounded reality; for sentimental togetherness, for aloofness; for tears, for laughter; for thoughts, for action; the list goes on. WKW similarly uses other weapons in his vast director's repertoire to some bizarre effects, taking improvisation to an extreme where it stops being laudatory.  The above notwithstanding, let me round off by saying that if the kind of style I have delineated above appeals to you, then you should definitely watch this film, for outside of his jarring style, WKW has pieced together a great story and actors. As for myself, I will continue to watch every one of his films, living in the suspense of what this genius will do next - make me fall in love, or hate.  
 This the first of Daninell's books I read.  I learnt that she was the Queen of romance novel since I was a teen.  I'm a little disappointed by the book because it's really boring for most of the part. It's like reading an alternative version of Princess Diana's traffic accident.  I realize that Daniell likes to repeat herself a lot.  There are too many reptitions of descriptions of all kinds.  It's also too predictable.  To me, everything that Bill did is really cheesy and unreal and his stubborness of rejecting and denying Anabelle after he became paralysed makes me wonder what a tyranny psycho he is that he just wants to inflict pain on the woman who loves him and who has nobody there for her at all. It's really hard to believe any man who acts so unreasonably stubborn on his own version of love and happiness that he can actually be an ideal partner for any woman.  Men like that are normally pretty controlling and emotionally abusive. This is the major element in the book that really turns me off.   I have to admit that the last part where Anabelle finally convinced Bill to be with her is quite touching.  I think Ms. Steel does have her crowds of fans.  My boyfriend's mother had been crying all the way thru the book.      
 Everyone in my family has owned these clic goggles.  My original pair gave out after three years of use.  I ordered these because they said "standard size" they normally come in small medium and large.  WEll, I am medium and the standard size is large (same as my husbands).  I had to tape them at the back to make them smaller so I could wear them.  Did not have time to return....very disappointed.  Will consider this before ordering from you again. 
 If you're considering buying the Peter Smith "edition" of this book, note that it is NOT a new "edition" in hardcover but the Vintage International edition rebound in red cloth, with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front. It looks like it's been rebound for libraries, is the type of thing that's usually not for sale to the general public (. . .) The book is WELL-REBOUND, and may still be worth it to you Cormac McCarthy diehards out there -- it is for me, and ultimately I'm just gonna keep the copy of it I bought, but it's still quite disappointing. Thought you deserved a warning, hope it came in time. McCarthy's a great writer, of course -- feel a little guilty about the one-star, but it's an issue of the edition, not the book 
 The explanation is too  long, examples are vague, ambiguous and the cases provided is not really relevant to my level of knowledge. This book might be  best for PhD  holders, but not for me who is  an undergraduate. My lecturer  also complained that the explanation used is  not suitable  for our level. No interesting graphics  or colour to attract readers 
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before 
 Schaeffer's work, Escape From Reason, leaves much to be desired in the way of 'penetrating' thought. Quite honestly, he doesn't leave room for thought of any kind.  This book reads like the Christian version of "Final Exit," reeking of the nihilistic determinism of death, though in the first half of the book, he blames everybody and everything for the "theological shift," he claims, that has occurred. Countless times, (I gave up trying to count them all), he parlays that knowledge is by revelation ONLY, that reason is the cause for all of man's problems and difficulties; a conclusion which is patently false, because as the Bible states, sin is the cause of all of man's problems.  He engages in a fallacial logical argument, where he negates at predicate twice to call it identity. For instance, instead of A is A as identity... He says that A is NOT Non-A. The statement A-> ~(~A) is false when using quantitative reasoning, something to which Schaeffer objects.  As a Christian, I was outright offended by the statement he makes, that unless you have the content of the meaning of the name of Christ that the people of the Reformation had, then Christ's name is meaningless, or so says Schaeffer. I also found that many questions I had while reading this were not answered, and some altogether avoided:   If knowledge (wisdom, intelligence) is only gained by revelation, and only the select few are entitled to that revelation, should the rest of us remain ignorant? Schaeffer would say yes.   If reason is so bad for man, why is anti-reason not the answer either?   He goes through the line, Nature is bad, the principle of mechanics is bad, humanism is bad, freedom is bad, which would lead to the conclusion that intelligence is bad.   He asks the question, "How can unity exist when differences in thinking exist," to which I initially and facetiously replied "Marriage."  In his analysis of the Renaissance, he faults Thomas Aquinas for what he believes is the introduction of "humanism" into the doctrines of the church. Then he faults Leonardo da Vinci for Neo-platonist tendencies in Leo's works. "Curse those inventions of Leo's mind," Schaeffer seems to say. The list could go on and on, but it occurs to me that the only theophilologer to which Schaeffer completely defends is Immanuel Kant, whose whole premise was that reason should be completely abandoned for man to survive, and then so what if he doesn't.   So what Schaeffer really believes is that we should abdicate our minds, that things like this review have to be knowledge anomalies; that Christians are designed to be dumb and solfidious, (Justification by Faith Alone). Even when he clings to the existentialism of Karl Barth, Jean-Paul Sartre, (and Camus), he is forced to admit that his theory needs help from humanism, or else mankind has no redeeming value to himself or to God, (determinism, or in Christian circles, nihilistic pre-destination). It reminded me of the song, "Gloom, Despair, and Agony on Me."  Perhaps he should have read James 2:18, "I have faith and you have works; show me your faith, and I will show you my faith by my works."  Unfortunately for Schaeffer, works would require that man know how to do things, a concept called intelligence and learning.   This is ultimately a terrible book, offering no new thoughts or solutions, (how could he? the solutions have to be THOUGHT out.) to the continuing predicament in Christianity 
 This book is too much, and I mean that quite literally. It's too long, too heavy and the style of hypnosis it teaches has been around too long. Slow old fashioned and labourious.  I brought this to compare with my favourite book on stage hypnosis by Jonathan Chase, ' Deeper and Deeper ' available from his site or amazon.co.uk It doesn't compare. McGills tombe reads like a clinical diatribe with no humour or pazazz. And for me if stage hypnosis doesn't have that then it has nothing.  Much of this book is directly 'borrowed' from the works of Coue, Braid and Eisdale and has little or nothing entertaining in it. The routines are simply banal or unoriginal and much of the history of the art is inacurate at best.  I've no doubt that McGill was a wonderful person but his book should pass on as well. Overpriced and over written.  Bil 
 A totally worthless piece of garbage 
 This GMRS 2-way radio claims to have "UP TO 16 MILE RANGE".  However, on the back of the packaging there is a statement in very small print that reads, "Maximum range can only be achieved over water or open rural areas under optimum conditions."  I live in a housing development in FL that has one small hill running through it.  That small hill and the houses (all one story ranch) limits this radio's range to less than one mile!  That's no better than a non-GMRS 2-way radio!  The lack of range is reason enough to not recommend this radio. However, the real "kicker" is that in order to leagally operate these GMRS radios, you must pay a $80 fee to obtain an FCC license! Bottom line: Save your money. This radio's "long-range" capability is "incapable" unless you live in the "flatlands" or on a boat.    
 Imagine no possessions?  Fine, then you get rid of your jewel encrusted luxury palaces.  Imagine no religion?  Fine, if religion's such a "crutch", then you forsake your million dollar drug habit.  Imagine no countries?  Fine, then you move from England or America to Africa or El Salvador.  The world will be as one?  Fine, then you act like an adult and don't abandon your wife and child when they need you the most.  John Lennon was a text book phony.  He was a grown-up with a child's brain who ordered the rest of us to live a life that he wouldn't.  Maybe if he didn't squander his days snorting cocaine through one hundred dollar bills he would have recognized how utterly ridiculous he sounded.....then and now.  The utopian dreams of the 60's are history, and they were destroyed by none other than Lennon himself-an unscrupulous fantasy peddler who selfishly preyed upon the optimism of a generation.  His blatant hypocrisy was so obnoxious that the very thought of his music makes my stomach turn.  Thank you very much.  -DW.  
 The authors of this book seem to be trying to create a history to support the documents that they wish to believe are accurate.  It is largely based on the premise that the Freemasons and their rituals and documents date back to ancient history, rather than the 1717 date commonly used, or even the 1590 date given in "The Origins Of Freemasonry: The Scottish Century 1590-1710" published by Cambridge University Press.  Instead they claim their information dates back to the Knights Templar and then back to the Jerusalem Church in the time of Jesus and James.  One of the problems with their argument is that they are using written evidence to build a picture of a time before there was writing.  If you take their date of 200 B.C.E. for the writing of the Book of Enoch; it is still over 7,000 years after the events they are trying to reconstruct.    Given that we don't even know the author of the Book of Enoch which was written a little over 2,000 years ago, what makes them think that the writer has such detailed knowledge of events over 3 times further in the past?  And for that matter wouldn't earlier sources be even better?  They don't seem to think so, as they only use writing from over 2,000 years before their source (i.e. Babylonian, Akkadian, and Sumerian) as supporting their source, rather than the other way around.    We have had writing, and historians documenting most of the intervening period between today and the writing of the Book of Enoch, but that was not the case for the period between the writer of the Book of Enoch and the events they are describing.  Writing is estimated to have been invented around 3,000 B.C.E., which leaves over 4,000 years between the events and when they could have first been documented.  To make matters worse, the idea of writing down an accurate history only dates back to Herodotus in 440 B.C.E.; which still leaves more than 7,000 years between the events in question and the unknown writer and their uncorroborated writing.  As part of their evidence for the age of the Freemasons, the authors cite that "the rituals of Freemasonry contained a great deal of historical information, despite the fact that the United Grand Lodge of England continues to insist that their rites are simply invented nonsense."  It is not clear exactly what weight this gives their argument, since it would be natural to use a historical basis from to create the rituals in order to make them appear more authentic.  Age is often used as a symbol of status as far as civilizations, countries, and organizations are concerned, and that is why using a historical or biblical base would be used.  If you want to avoid the Freemason debate, then the best way to judge this book is on how they present the material from more traditional sources.  From very early on in the book, the historical and scientific merit is questionable.  The authors clearly decide to pick and choose bits and pieces of other people's work and patch them together to try to make them support their theories.  For example, they quote W.L. Strauss and A. J. E. Cave's `Pathology and Posture of Neanderthal Man' from 1957 where it states "If Neanderthal Man could be reincarnated and placed in a New York subway - provided that he were bathed, shaved, and dressed in modern clothing - it is doubtful whether he would attract any more attention than some of its other denizens."  Later in the same chapter when they draw heavily from James Shreeve's "The Neanderthal Enigma", they somehow forget to note that Shreeve said that that idea of the very statement they quoted before was shattered by the `Eve' hypotheses which they are using.  The authors are also not accurate with their dates.  From what I read, they date the age of the Sumerian and Egyptian civilizations to about 3,000 B.C.E., but both are considerably older than that.  Even when an older date would help their argument they don't necessarily get it correct.  For example, the ice-age kiln discovered in Europe which they claim to be 26,000 years old is actually 29,000 - 30,000 years old.    The authors also get some things wrong.  When discussing the Kennewick Man, discovered in Washington State in 1996, they consistently refer to him as a Caucasian but this is not correct.  The Kennewick Man is a Caucoid, which would likely make him similar to the Ainu.  They do discuss this, but they continue to call them Caucasians when they are not.  It is true that it was reported this way in the papers and on TV, but for what is supposed to be a scientific argument to misstate this is simply unforgivable.    I gave up on this book after finding too many inaccuracies.  I have read a lot of ancient history and some anthropology so for those areas I know they made a number of wrong statements.  Since they were incorrect in the areas in which I had prior knowledge and could easily go back and check, I can only believe that they are equally inaccurate for areas which I don't have a background.  If you are looking for a book to support your belief in the Freemason's history, then you will probably enjoy this book, but if you are looking for a book that investigates man's prehistory then I would recommend Jared Diamond's "Guns, Germs, And Steel. 
 This is one of those books where all the best parts can be found on the book jacket!  I was intrigued by the book jacket description of the Swap Shop Show:  "If you've got something you're itching to sell, something  you mighta never woulda bought no way, then give us a call," but this  idea isn't expanded upon in the text.  Instead, this seems to be another in  a series of recent books where the authors seem to believe a series of  quirky characters alone a great novel make.  Not so.  Readers want  characters they can get to know, characters who grow and change throughout  the book, not a series of semi-related vignettes about cardboard cutouts of  people.  I particularly found McCorkle unable to handle the parallel story  lines well.  Perhaps the plot ties together in the end (I just couldn't get  that far, I really tried!), but the impression I got was of jerking back  and forth between stories that may have stood better on their own.  For  examples of successful books employing the parallel-lives technique, see  Tom Wolfe's *A Man in Full* or Michelle Huneven's *Round Rock.*  I've  gathered in reading reviews that McCorkle is being hailed as a great new  Southern author; I found no Southern flavor at all in this book.  These  silly characters could have lived anywhere.  I guess I'll stick to Rita Mae  Brown when I want a taste of the South 
 Okay, you kids can listen to your crappy little green day band, but get it off the radios and out of my head 
 "The Last River - The Tragic Race for Shangri-la".......Tragic. Yes I'd agree that this book is tragic. Tragic that I bothered reading it.....tragic that I paid for it in order to read it.....tragic that Todd wasted his time writing it......tragic that I disliked it so much that I can be bothered writing a review. The warning should have come upon examination of the back of the dust jacket. "Advance praise for The Last River" it reads. In retrospect this means no one is prepared to recommend the book after they have read it. It seems that Todd had a vision of how big a book needs to be, and went to great lengths to flesh out the story to reach his goal. So much of the content has so little relevancy to the story, that you soon tire trawling through it. This was my third Tsango experience. I do recommend the Outside documentary on the Lindgren expedition. "Hell or High Water" is not outstanding, but is worth a read, but on this book, my advise to Todd is please make this the Last River that you drag through the wringer 
 I am a huge Type O fan. I have seen them over 20 times and have driven hundreds of miles to do so. My wife and I have been waiting for this album and subsequent tour for years. We had tickets to see them in Philly last time  but thats when Peter had his drug incident and the tour was canceled.   Anyhoo, so I pre order the album and wait with baited breath. When it finally arrives,  I am almost instantly disappointed. I have played in bands throughout the years and I know when jamming with a group sometimes you try to get something going and it just isn't working. Usually you stop playing and move on to something else. Most of these songs fall into this category. Unfortunately for us, Type O went ahead and finished, recorded, and released them.   Peter's usually well crafted lyrics have been replaced with words that a 6th grader could have written. "she burns me down, down, down to the ground". What the heck is that? As one reviewer wrote, there are only two songs of note. The one, September Sun, is ok. This is mainly because its a rehash of their greatest song "love you to death". this song even suffers from the same silly lyrics being repeated ad nauseum for the last minute or so of the song. I don't even remember the name of the other song that I somewhat liked, but it doesn't matter anyway.  To all of those reviewers that rave about this album, whats wrong with you? Wait, I bet you all liked Metallica's St. Anger too... for any true Type O fan, this album is a grave disappointment. My wife and I we're psyched to go see them at Sonar in Baltimore, but after this album came out, we'll just watch their "Symphony For The Devil" DVD at a loud volume instead. The bottom line is, don't bother with this. 
 A very well written disappointment.  I read to the last page, eager to see the storylines resolved, only to be abandoned by our writer, our tour guide; who seemed to jump ship on us.  I was interested in the characters, so the author succeeded in that.  But that's only half the journey.  I can only guess that the characters are symbolic of extremes within ourselves, from oblivious, to bitter to codependent.  The lesson might be that each extreme brings its own brand of sorrow, with a study of these extremes in character form.  Or maybe not.  But it takes the disappointment out of reaching the last page without resolution.  I love Tyler's work and admire her skill.  But if I'm going to read half a story, I'd like to pay half the price.  
 Not a very playful book. In fact... it seems to follow the old playbook of how things are done. The same playbook that men/boys have written when it comes to gaming. Shoot first and ... questions? what questions? story? What's that? I already knew the material that was in this book. Didn't offer anything new for me. With this book... just a play an online game or grab a game off your shelf, read about the history of "interactive" media and computers and .. voila... you've read the book. For what I needed... this book just did not cover it. Time to lay some new ground in the gaming arena 
 We used this book for an adult Sunday School class that I taught.  I was extremely disappointed by the superficial treatment of the text.  I found myself using the Biblical text and other sources.  For the most part Dr. Swindoll's book was a distraction rather than a help.  For example, 2 Samuel 7 descibes God's covenant with David that Christ, the True King, would be David's descendant.  Swindoll uses this text as to how to react when God says no to our plans. (In this case, it is God's rejection of David as the builder the temple that Solomon eventually built)  The covenant IS the point and Dr. Swindoll completely misses it. If your looking for moralisms that you really already knew this is your book.  If you want a serious study of the life of David you would do well to look elsewhere or try something bold-- a careful reading of the Biblical text. 
 Really Really boring, don't think anyone should waste their time reading this garbage.  Horrible 
 Did I miss something, or did this guy risk his life based on a promise to someone he just met? Too much irrational behavior to mention.  I had to force myself to finish the book just to see how much more ridiculous it could get.  The (paperback) cover refers to Michael Crichton three times, the praises inside, another three, and one reference to Stephen King.  These are two good authors that I enjoy reading but this book was not even close.  
 I liked it better than the Hour Game, which was so slow I never finished it.  Baldacci has unfortunately, like other authors gotten a little preachy.  They disguise it as part of the story (as if their readers don't see it) but there are whole sections that flash "Author's Message" in neon lights.  First, there are much subtler ways to send a message, second, I just don't like being preached at no matter if I agree or disagree with the message.  I stopped reading Tom Clancy (opposite view) for just this reason 
 As a professional art historian who teaches twentieth century art at public university, I find this book to be virtually worthless. Not only do the authors leave out artists from their book because they don't adhere to their own rigid ideological orthodoxies, but the book is very badly written; they undermine their own arguments by constantly lapsing into semi-meaningless jargon. A good postmodernist/ Marxist perspective in a general introduction to twentieth century would be useful, but these authors are too inept and arrogant to bring it off 
 The three positive points to this map are that it is sturdy, waterproof, and colourful.  For practical use it is difficult to use.  You are constantly flipping the pages to find out which section you are looking for, and often the street you are looking for lies exactly in the part they decided to cut-off.  I find it is not comprehensive enough, and think it would only be good if you were touring for one day in the touristy places.  It's not really a map to get around the entire city with 
 Although this electronic atlas has all the Netter plates, and quite a few nice new ones, as well as some radiographic views, it is nearly unusable in practice. The images are scanned at such low resolution that many important details are simply not visible. The program can only display images at 640 x 480 x 256 colors, regardless of your monitor or video card (it even says so right in the documentation). Part of the horizontal resolution is used up by the navigation bar, so the actual plate image resolution is even lower than 640. If you estimate a typical plate to be 10" x 10", that works out to maybe 50 dpi. Many of the smaller features on the original art cannot be seen on tne electronic version, and often it is impossible to tell where the leader lines are going. The quality does not change when you print or zoom in. All the other bells and whistles, like the study lists, searching, etc. just do not make up for the fact that the image quality is absolutely awful. And the user interface is terribly archaic, nonstandard, and hard to use. The font for the lables is horrible. Also, I'm not sure I like the pronunciation of the speaking feature: "pec-tor-AY-lis major"? If you have the cash to spare, it makes a nice toy, but it is not worth the price 
 This isn't a very good book. It might be good if you're in love with history and you like reading 'Harriet freed slaves. She took them to Canada.' over and over again. Someone would read this and think Harriet Tubman was boring. If this is Harriet Tubman's life, then my life is cool. In other words,beware. This book is only for school reports. I wouldn't say this is a good book by any means. It's like being in slavery when you're reading this. I'd do math homework before this even crossed my mind 
 Horribly, horribly disappointing.  Books that simply trash another opposing theory (think US politics in 2004) without coming up with solid ideas of their own is not nearly as interesting as original/positive thesis.  Smith spends a huge chunk of the book doing just that and portraying scientists as soulless students of dead matter.  Really, if Smith's version of science was truly the dominant cultural paradigm, 5 percent instead of 95 percent of Americans would believe in God. In addition, he takes superficial examples from other cultures and uses them to defend his monotheism (an underlying Christianity, based on some passages).  While I agree with the author that tolerance without thinking is just as bad as  intolerance, using native cultures as examples and then arguing that there is an absolute religious Truth (not a spiritual truth) is difficult to swallow.  Sorry, you can't have both.  In addition, the writing is generally chaotic in the last half -the author seems to be trying to squeeze his life work into a few pages.  Again, Huston Smith has MANY better books out there that treat the world's religions with more respect 
 This movie started off about as refreshing as you could get. Sure, there were "Lifetime channel" moments and such but for a horror movie at least it didnt just dump a bunch of hapless teenagers in the woods for them to be hacked one by one.    The atmosphere was eerie and convincing.  The cave shots were well done, the tension was building ever so slowly and it was somewhat un-nerving when you just knew that something bad was brewing.  So, the first part of the movie was thumbs up all the way.  Unfortunately, like sooooooo many other horror films it resorts to silly blood spatters and totally unbelievable situations and it gets old rather quickly.  The creative tension that got me hooked was quickly replaced by absurdity. Too much ketchup, too many frantic scenes of the "monster guys" jumping around, and of course...the completely silly "tough" chick that Kung-Fu'ed her way through most of the monsters like they were invalids. That alone killed it.... the main characters were disposing the bad guys too easily and some of the ways they killed them was laughable.  I was angry at this movie not so much because I wasted my time but because it had a lot of potential and seemed to run out of ideas so they went the "Gorefest" route and completely chickened out of making what could have been a classic if it was done right.  Remember how perfectly the original Alien movie slowly but surely built wicked tension and it never released you from that tension?  Remember how uncomfortable that movie made you feel for almost the whole running time?  This film started that way.... it was very creepy and made me feel uneasy. Just like Alien.  However, Alien never let up and did NOT turn into a pointless gore-fest like this movie did.  Too bad, it really is.  Not Recommended... but rent it, dont buy it if you have to see i 
 Garbage. They tweaked it in every place that didn't need tweaking. Straker is no longer bald, Matt Burke is no longer caucasion, and now he's gay. The bus driver is now a vietnam vet instead of korea. In this adaptation, Ben Mears was the kid who found the bodies of Hubie Marsten and his wife. The story begins in winter instead of late summer. Ralphie Glick doesn't just go missing, he's drowned in an icey pond. Instead of Ben Mears coming to town and finding the Marsten house already sold, Crockett has already promised it to Mears, but now he's renegged and sold it out from under him. I don't see the point. They didn't just change the story, they didn't leave anything intact. It's bad. It's unwatchable, especially if you loved the book. None of the characters have Maine accents... Hmm. Could it have been filmed in... oh I dunno... AUSTRALIA PERHAPS? 
 Bill Maher personifies the reason why I, a life-long democrat and a teacher, am moving away from the current "Democratic" party and leaning more toward independent.  I am sure he has wonderful ideas but couching them in a constant barrage of foul language and hate-filled rantings makes me realize that the party has left me, I haven't left the party.  JFK would, today, be considered a right-wing wacko using the Maher standards.  I was so excited to get this book, hoping to hear (I had the CD) wit and humor with far thinking ideas.  Instead it was the same nonsense spouted by the likes of Michael Moore and Cynthia McKinney. Sad really. I disagree with most of what Ann Coulter says, but at least she's intelligently funny.  
 Having never read a book by Danielle Steel but seen and liked a few of the movies adapted from her novels, I was looking forward to reading Answered Prayers, since I usually always find the books more deep and interesting. Sadly, I couldn't have been more disappointed... The first thing that bothered me about this novel, was the amount of repetition it has. I was just through the first few pages of the first chapter, and I was already being told things (usually insignificant) which I had just read a few lines before.  Secondly, the moment Brad is introduced into the plot, I could foresee with certainty, how it was going to unravel and how the book would eventually end. So as not to dampen my enthusiasm and continue reading, I reasoned that if the plot was going to be so predictable, the book couldn't possibly be Danielle Steel's "Number One Bestseller" as the cover proclaims...seems like I have a grave misconception regarding the criteria needed to make a book a "bestseller".  The major flaw of this novel is that it desperately lacks imagination. Even the main characters themselves and their situations are mirror images of each other. Faith is sweet and caring, has two daughters who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving her feeling lonely and sad. Her husband is cold, unreligious and gives her no attention.  Brad is sweet and caring, has two sons who have grown up and left to live on their own, leaving him feeling lonely and sad. His wife is cold, unreligious and gives him no attention. Even Faith's "deep dark secret" is too unoriginal, and it is revealed to the reader at the very early stages of the book, leaving no room for curiosity and suspense.  Halfway through the book, I was so bored that I considered giving up reading it altogether. However I kept pushing on, praying that some twist to the plot would miraculously materialize somewhere, to at least make reading Answered Prayers worthwhile... Unlike Faith however, my prayers remained unanswered... It's going to require a lot of will power to attempt reading a Danielle Steel novel again...  
 If you're really hard-up for a laugh, you might like this flick. But you'll also have to be happy with the following qualities: Slapstick, stupid, forced humor, poor acting, mediocre dialog. It's obviously low budget. And it just isn't funny, which is bad since it's suppose to be a romatic comedy. Don't buy it. And don't waste your time renting it. Try Mambo Italiano instead 
 This movie must be restored--the quality of picture is unacceptable beginning with Bloody Mary's singing Bali Hi. I tried to purchase a completely restored, digitally remastered DVD of this musical and could not find one in 2007.  I returned this DVD to the seller 
 If you believe this baloney, then I have a bridge I'd like to sell you.  
 This book is a attempt to make people believe the "red menace" line of thinking, it never says that the soviet union was a defensive  nation, it's nuclear and conventional forces were all defensive, while nato and the US forces were always offensive one may look no futher then the american and soviet navy, the soviet navy was built as a defensive force using cruisers as the back bone of their navy with defensive missles, while our navy used aircraft carriers which we see today in the illegal invasion of iraq as tools to launch invasion from, Turkey 1961 anyone? yet another location was armed and placed within firing range of the soviet union, what was the soviet unions response to that threat? defensive missles placed in cuba to counter the aggressive american(and nato) approac 
 I started to read this book with great interest, as I had heard about the wonderful miracles that are taking place, etc.  However, it is biblically unsound at its very core, and it is very easy for a Christian to read this book and get very excited indeed.  Rutz expects that by 2032 approx., most if not all of the world will be Christians, and bases this on statistics into the future.  The Bible says that when Jesus returns there will be very few left with faith in Him, as many will have turned away.  Rutz doesn't want to mention Sin because, as he says himself in the book, he wants to keep it positive.  It is a dangerous book, in that you can so easily be taken in by it, and really, you need to keep your Bible handy to see if what he says is true.  It offers a "new" Christianity with very reduced, if any, writing in relation to sin, hell, and wrath, because the "new" Christians don't like these words and find they would be threatening to new converts.  However, ultimately, we each stand before God, and this diluted, poisonous book makes me feel so fearful for many Christians who will be taken in by it 
 The unlistenable CD prompts this review.The music is great,be assured of that.It is ingeniously inventive and highly imgainative lyrically while fully satisfying musicianship engages you with deft skill producing truely fun , pleasant and enjoyable aural fruit that's why i bought it but within seconds i was hearing distortion not associated with the playing,it was a poor CD mastering job  in my opinion then the skips.....skips,skips and more skips.Little one second dead spots.Enough to get blood pressure up.The disc is going back but i won't be buying another from this label.I'll take Vol.Three from Sony in exchange thank you.Great music of course right?Don't hesitate to buy the seperate original recordings remastered if you like intelligent fun.A study of that phenomenon referred to as Dada said to influence these blokes could benefit in getting underneath the   the psycology of the music.Whatever its real nature or influence the track on Volume 2 titled;Dada was here is  a beautifully refreshing piece sung aentirely in Spanish and if that embodies any aspect of this 'movement' it gets my hearty applause as it really conveys a whimsical elegance that lends a deep satisfaction to  ones contemplation of life. Enjoy......... 
 Disappointed. As an English teacher, I expected a more compelling and less hokey use of Whitman.  The first story, of the deformed Whitman loving boy, was utterly unbelievable and the continuity was incredibly challenging 
 I started to read it.  I tried and tried, but in the end I gave it up.  Maybe I don't have the "intellectual equipment" to understand this book, or most of the other fraudulent tripe of that era.  I felt ashamed of myself for a while - until I found this gem in the Penguin edition of Somerset Maugham's "The Summing up" (page 60):  "It is strange that one can ever have admired that prose.  It does not flow.  There is no air in it.  A careful mosaic constructed by someone without great technical skill to decorate the walls of a station dining room.  Pater's attitude towards the life around him, cloistered, faintly supercilious, gentlemanly, donnish in short, repels me.  Art should be appreciated with passion and violence, not with a tepid, deprecating elegance that fears the censoriousness of a common-room.  But Walter Pater was a feeble creature: it is unnecessary to condemn him with intensity."  Alright, I'm a philistine for not enjoying "Marius", but I can take some comfort in being in excellent company. 
 Unless Amazon sent me the wrong one (i disposed of the wrapper before finding out) this model doens't even come close to fitting a Dell 15.4" screen. 
 I ordered this item and was so excited. It loaded fine. It let me upload files just fine. It wasn't until I actually tried to create my PVD that I received errors that shut down the program (many many many times...with numerous types of video files) I double checked the system requirements for the software and my computer checked out fine. The worst thing is that there is no support for the media player. I tried contacting Hasbro with no response. I am so dissapointed. 
 Badly written, badly researched, and offensive to women, Africans and anyone who's ever read a book over 150 pages.  I don't know where to begin. This man obviously never went to Mali, and I'd be surprised if he did more research on it than read the first two pages of a travel guide. His inaccuracy about the people there borders on criminal. If he had written such a thing about a Native American group, he would have been pilloried. He turns one of the few peaceful countries in Africa into a pit of corruption, torture, war and cruelty. This is a country that, in order to prevent ethnic strife, adopted the custom of "joking cousins:" if you come from one of my "enemy" family groups, I tell you you eat beans, and you tell me I eat donkey, and we both laugh our heads off.  Then we have Dirk Pitt. Where did this guy come from? A Saturday Night Live parody? Sweaty, hairy self-righteous manly man whose skin is impenetrable to bullets, crocodiles and apparently, the Sahara sun.  An incredibly self-satisfied, lazily-written piece of drivel 
 this is the worth book i have ever had the pleasure to put in the trash (the only place where it belongs) 3 pages showing a photo of a potentiometer and the constant nagging of buying things from to person who wrote the book (he calls himself an "AUTHOR") he should call himself a salesperson. the book is aimed at the mentally challanged, it has such a slow pace , i felt i was in a movie with slow playback, and most of the crap was not complete.Do your self a favor dont waste your money if you want a sales catalog, just call any electronics vendor and you will get one for free (including shipping 
 I love the Redsox and have since I can remember, but I had trouble finishing this book.  So we get a diary from the perspective of two diehard fans.  All this does is remind me of what I was thinking during the season before/during/after certain games, but it never provided me with an interesting tidbits.  As for the perspective of a true "diehard" fan, O'Nan acts like an imbecile.  I can imagine him out at the game forcing his way past kids to get balls during batting practice.  Wow, that sure is fun to read about!!!!  And his obsession with his fishing net is scary as well.  He comes across as a whiny kid in an adult body that has fun bragging that he had an "in" during the season.  He provided nothing to the enjoyment of this book.  King was better, and because his mind seems to work differently than the average person, it was fun to see his perspective on certain events.  Some of his passages are the only reason that I gave this book two stars instead of one.  I would suggest that if you followed the season closely either through reading the Globe or Herald, or listened to Boston sports radio, you will get nothing out of this book.  If on the other hand you were caught up in the euphoria of the postseason and want to know some of the feelings Redsox fans went through during the season, you might enjoy some of the book.  Now can I direct my book royalties so that O'Nan doesn't get anything 
 The only reason I'm giving this two stars instead of one is because I love Benefit. That being said, this perfume is what we like to call a sleeper. It's so faint that you can hardly smell it, but when you do, it's not pleasing at all and you immediately scramble for something that smells better. If you are looking for a young, fun perfume, stay away from this one. It smells old and drab, like your grandmother's china cabinet or an antique store. But if you like that.. 
 Unfortunately this book is not for those of us who need "how to" guidance.  It is full of useless information and opinion, but very little substance.  You are better off searching the web for information 
 It takes over half of the book to get to the plot, a criminal who passes away after telling his family that he was a war hero during WW II, and it turns out that he wasn't when the family tries for a military burial, the lead character Private Eye Kinsey Millhone is not the sharpest tack in the box, at least 60% of the writing is vivid descriptions of room decor, scenery and includes the foaming soap bubbles in a sink of dishwater, and if she mentions her underpants once she mentions them 40 times, the ending was too rushed and very unsatisfactory.  This was my first Grafton book, I may go try one of the earlier ones as I can't believe an author this popular writes this style of trivial drivel.  Skip L is for a Loser 
 I started reading the book anticipating a great mystery/detective novel, However, it first took me some time to get into it(about half way) and I still found it to be a dry read. I was expecting a page turning, exciting and mysterious book, but instead I found that the parts of the book that were meant to be exciting and mysterious, would be boring and found myself dosing off. A good book makes you stay up, regardless of how tired you actually are. I will give Mr. Kellerman the benefit of the doubt and will read another book by him, but I definately cannot say I loved this book. It was a very dry read.. 
 This doll scares me half to death.  It has a very creepy voice and a creepier laugh.  It reminds me of a female Chucky and I'm terrified that it might come alive in the middle of the night and kill me.  I don't want it in my house anymore, so I'm going to give it to charity and hope my daughter forgets about it 
 If you are looking for information on Seichim and Reiki Healing, this is NOT the book for you.  It is, primarily, an advertisement for Mr. Ramsey's healing sessions and classes, including articles written about Mr. Ramsey in obscure newspapers and testimonials from three of his patients along with ads for his Seichim classes showing when, where and how much.  The poor grammar and lack of knowledge of the English language make the reading difficult.  Most noticable is that none of the titles of the newspaper articles are capitalized properly.  There is a very brief history of Seichim that lacks detail or substance.  There is no information concerning Seichim or Reiki healing methods or ideology.  The chakra information in the book is contradictory, placing chakras in the wrong order in one section and then the proper order on the next page.  Also the chakra colors are not consistant within the text, and they're back to being out of positional order again.  I guess confusing and misleading would be the best things I can say about this book.  I find it nervey that it is called a "handbook".  This book is a waste of money.  Sincerely, Bobbi Curtis  
 This book is as far from the title as you can get.  It's somewhere between Dr. Phil, an Einstein lecture and a Mensa meeting.  !0% of the writings related directly to the title, the other 90% was as far way as you can get.  That's where you should be from this book. 
 Obviously, anything can get published nowadays. I wouldn't want to be rude to the author, and I didn't find anything wrong with her writing. If you want to know how to raise a left-handed child in a right-handed world, I'll save you the money here. Just raise him/her like any other child. It has nothing to do with what hand is dominant. Seriously, I think the self-help books are getting a bit carried away, now. I'm left-handed myself, but there were a lot of things that didn't necessarily apply to me. I can't see any reason why you would need a book like this. It's all stuff you've already heard. I'm calling her publishers to see if they'll publish my book on the proper way to inhale when you exhale without hurting your child's self-esteem 
 I just got my copy of the DVD R-Rated version and yes the best parts of the bondage scene are missing. Why those edit happy bozos would remove the lower body scenes showing the actresses powerful legs around her captor and leave the breasts showing is beyond me. Since this scene is most appealing in the way the Original version first displayed it in 85, to take it out in my opinion degrades the movie entirely. I was completely dissapointed in this version of the movie. If anyone saw the unrated 1985 Vhs version you would know what I mean. Lana was the movie. Why remove it????? I have [not a] clue!!!   Unsatisfied customer 
 DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT. There, simple advice I wish someone had given me before I bought two of these. With the first one the battery died 13 months after purchase. Since it was 30 days outside the warrantly, apple support told me "sorry, tough luck." I made the mistake of buying another one figuring I just got a bad one and there was no way I could have the same problem again. WRONG!  Second ipod just died (same battery problem) - this one died within the warranty period but becuase it took me two weeks to get into the ipod store to see what was wrong and, of course, by the time I got in I was past the 12 month warranty period (who keeps track of the purchase date? I sure didn't).  Other than the fact that your substnatial investment will be worthless in about a year - it is a fantastic product. I'm just sorry that it didn't last (twice!) cause otherwise I'd be a fan 
 I have the original Fox and The Hound and have watched it many times. This new sequel does not tug at the heart like the first, therefore, this new storyline seems rather silly.  Do see the original first, otherwise, you may miss a wonderful family film 
 I love cheesey horror films from the late 60's/early/70's. With that being said I was very dissapointed watching this movie. It's bad. Not bad in a good cheesey way, but bad as in almost impossible to watch. Here are my reasons why:  -The music. My god, I have never heard such wrong music for a movie. When I see people getting killed I know that I want to hear soft James Taylor type music. It added nothing to the atmosphere of the film, and in fact hurt it.  -The editing. I have never seen such bad editing. One moment one of the victims is across a large creek from her attacker, and the next the attacker is on the same side chasing her again. I could go on, but there are so many editing goofs that I would be here all night describing them.  -The screenplay. The situation itself could have been believable if the dialogue , and scenes, had been better written. As it is the entire situation seemed really unbelievable. It makes me wonder how this film ever got made.  -The acting. None of the story was believable because the acting was so awful. As I said before I love cheesey movies. Sometimes that includes bad acting, but when it is combines with the above stated faults it makes it a horrible thing to witness.  The reviewer who said that this is an important horror film has got to be kidding me. Hammer horror films from the same era are important. AP horror films from this era are important. This film? It should be forgotten and avoided at all costs. I knew that there was a reason why I have never liked Wes Craven's movies 
 I would LOVE to have the above item. Actually really wanted it so much that I called about it twice. BOTH times i was sent 6 oz. PACKAGES of pecans that I could have (but probably would not have) bought in any store. My husband is extremely fond of the CANNED pecans and was very excited when i told him i had located them on line. I don't have to tell you the disappointment when we were sent the others. Sorry but i'll have to really research the product before i order again. Ms. Judie Cardwel 
 Technically bloody awfull, otherwise great. Was it really worthwhile to DVDize this particular copy?  What has happened to the color version, also with Leslie Howard, that I saw in Z√ºrich in 1946 - 1953 
 When I read the original "5 languages of love" 3 years ago, it changed the way I related to the important people in my life. I also learned how to ask others to show their love in a way I could understand. So, when I saw that Chapman had written a book for singles, I ordered it immediately. I couldn't be more disappointed. While the original book presented sound and common-sense psychological research and insights, the newer "singles" book has devolved into far-right Christian dogma. While the original book was 'descriptive', telling one how to show love in a way one's mate could understand, the new book is 'prescriptive', demanding that one have "wholesome" relationships according to ultra-conservative Christian sensibility. The section on "loving touch" repeats over and over that sexuality is to be expressed only within the bounds of marriage, a view that won't help the majority of possible readers. Even if you're single, skip this disappointing book and find the original in a used bookstore 
 This book is touted as being a guide for the highly sensitive person looking for meaningful work. While it offers excellent practical advice for dealing with difficult people (wish I'd had this book two jobs ago), the majority of the book simply describes what the ideal workplace for an HSP would be like. The author's conclusion is that HSPs are best suited for self-employment in a creative field. OK, great. Where Ms. Jaeger falls short is in providing practical advice for how to find or create that type of work situation. Obviously she conducted multiple interviews to get the personal stories that are sprinkled through the chapters. Most interview subjects are creative professionals, yet the most they say is something like, "I really love my job. Now I feel like I'm doing the work I was born for!" NO ONE talks about what they did to establish themselves (classes? training? trust fund? luck?), or how they stay in business (for instance, as an introvert, how do you effectively market your services/products to new clients?). Being an HSP who's considering self-employment, I found it frustrating to read a so-called "career guide" that in essence told me things I already know. Yes, I know I'd work best in an enviroment where I pick my own hours, have soothing lighting, and friendly coworkers. And sure, I want to find my Calling. But simply telling me to "keep working on yourself, and eventually you'll find your true Calling" really doesn't do much for me. Would have enjoyed this book more if the author had included a chapter in which her interview subjects shared personal stories of the steps (esoteric as well as practical) that they took to find their Callings 
 If you are looking for a nonconsistant book that jumps around and does not follow through on its explanation of certain topics than this is the book for you 
 I'm at page 116 right now.  The writing is lovely, the specifics dense, and the sense of place rich.  If the author tries to create suspense one more time by having the father say, "I just can't go on with this story!" I'm going to throw the book at the wall.  Also, so many embarrassing little holes.  If I were a librarian I would say, "So Dracula's checked out.  Go to a bookstore.  Every bookstore in the country has a copy."  And if I were the cat, I would know I was a goner the second I appeared as indeed he does within a paragraph(you need to plant the gun in an early scene if you're going to fire it).  Lastly, it seems like Dracula would be so much more efficient if he just killed the main characters rather than killing everyone around them.  Unless "Dracula" is related to our heroine--that would be good.  Will read a bit more. . . 
 Like other reviewers, I bought this book based on Amazon's 'if you like David Sedaris,...'  Wrong!  Rakoff depressed and bored me.  I read most books in 2 to 3 days, but it took me two weeks to get through Fraud.  Sedaris made me laugh out loud - I never even cracked a smile with this guy.  Some of the stories could be really interesting, but he takes the fun out of a dry sense of humor 
 The book cover tells us that Wagener was a journalist for 30 years.  This book makes me wonder what kind of journalist he was.  The book is full of inaccuracies.  Some examples:  he calls cosmonaut Alexi Leonov Alexi Leonor; he states that Christa McAuliffe was selected as the Teacher in Space because she won a "Why I Want to Go Into Space" essay.  (cheapening her hard work and ultimate sacrifice); he writes the shuttle's solid rocket boosters fall into the ocean and are never used again even though they are recovered, refurbished, and reused.  There is no documentation for statements he makes that contradict other records.  This is poorly written and researched book.  I have told my wife, who is the director of our local library, not to waste money buying the book.  I won't donate my copy to the library.  Ignore the book and read the books written by those who were a part of the effort of going to the moon.  
 Of the many books and periodical articles that I have read concerning the Spanish Inquisition, this is the most biased and speculative and opinionated.  I would not recommend this book to anyone.  It is extremely long and tedious. We realize that the Inquisition was shameful. However, this work substitutes one prejudice for another 
 Let me start by saying that I may need to quit listening to the opinions of some of my co-workers in regards to movies to watch, at least when it comes to the horror genre. Numerous people where I work told me that this movie, "The Descent" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made.  In their defense, my co-workers weren't the only people with this opinion, many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing.  Well, apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to, because I was sorely disappointed, but more on that later, for now I will give you my plot summary for last year's supposed horror spectacular, "The Descent"  "The Descent" begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends, when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident. One year later at the prodding of those same friends, she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure, the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave, in fact it's a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet.  So as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave.  Making matters worse, this cave is not like any ordinary cave, for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal.  At the beginning of watching this movie I was really interested in the developing story, and the shocking opener really caught my attention, giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected.  However, once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave, which is actually where the majority of the film takes place, things begin to go awry for the picture.  At first, the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere, giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom.  Then the filmmakers introduce a fact that I felt completely derailed the movie, this is a cave that no one has been in, and these girls are hardly professional.  So, who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave.  It's absolutely stupid, especially when placed viewed in the context of the character's interaction and companionship with each other, none of these girls would do this to each other. After this occurs the mutants show up, a plot point that I was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction; however, this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster, because it's now just one gory scene after another, and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie.  A decision I somewhat agreed with, yet still didn't agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown.  On the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls, you just assume they're cannibalistic, but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there.  Even though "The Descent" was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time, by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers, to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity.  "The Descent" is unrated and contains violence and language 
 This DVD was expensive and disappointing.  I cannot recommend this for anyone who wants to use a DVD as a learning tool for makeup instruction.  It's not even good entertainment for those of us who consider the makeup-and/or-hair-styling-instructional-DVD genre as the epitome in chick flick decadence.   The featured makeup artist, Ramy, may be talented - it's hard to tell based on this effort. The DVD comes across as nothing more than an extended infomercial promoting one artist, his New York salon, and his line of Beauty Therapy cosmetics.  And not a very tempting infomercial, either.  There appear to be lots of products and colors visible behind Ramy's station as he works on the models.  However, he seems to use the same one or two products and colors on all of his subjects. That wouldn't be a problem if the featured colors were so neutral that they did the job for all the girls, but they don't.  Even though the majority of the models apparently fall into the warm-with-golden-undertones category, the two favored foundation colors (Porcelain Doll and Almond Princess) were obviously too yellow for most of them.  The fact that he used these colors almost exclusively leads one to conclude that the make up line is limited and leans toward warm tones, but not in a natural way.     The production values here weren't very good.  Although the DVD wasn't filmed in HD, it's simultaneously enlightening and ghastly to view this on an HDTV.  Not only is it disturbingly obvious that the products Ramy uses don't match the skin tones, they don't go on evenly.  Ramy continually stresses that his foundation is a liquipowder that goes on liquid but "dries to a micronized powder" - a very blotchy powder apparently.  The finished faces looked unnatural with patchy areas of uneven pigment around the mouth and  nose and obvious lines of demarcation.  Almost every one of the girls looked like a "Glamour Don't" after the make up was applied.   Although his contouring work is pretty good, Ramy demonstrates by working on one side of the face and then turning the model's chair so we can see the difference between the two sides.  Unfortunately, while he's working, the camera is usually on the side of the model that isn't being worked on, so most of the time it's hard to tell what he actually did to get that effect.     If you're interested in picking up makeup tips and techniques, a much better choice would be the DVD, "Your MakeUp - Simple Steps to Amazing Looks".  That DVD, also available on Amazon, has higher quality video, more practical instruction, and greater diversity among the subjects.  It features a variety of male and female make up artists using generic make up and describing in detail everything they're doing and why. It is far more interesting and instructional than Ramy's extended sales pitch for his cosmetic line. 
 Living Things is very disappointing. The previous CD, Kimi Ga Suki Raifu, was such a powerful collection of songs, written and recorded with such clarity and immediacy, a rock classic that is truly one of his best efforts alongside Girlfriend. Living Things is touted as Sweet's return to a fully produced, thought-out album. It even has Van Dyke Parks...so it must be a slice of Wilson-esque classic pop, like In Reverse...right? There's only one problem: the songs. Living Things rings very hollow musically, and lyrically it is hopelessly bleak, the actual opposite feeling of the album's title. This is not a sunny pop album, it is a dark series of resignations on the hopelessness of life, with almost none of Sweet's humor to balance out the darkness. It just feels like a bad head trip. I have listened intently to this disc, in various settings and states of mind, and have come up short every time. The material is lacking a heart, a center of gravity. Yes, it has all the external elements of Sweet's pop sheen: the overlaid vocals, the guitar textures, the power pop grooves. On the surface, it all sounds attractive, but underneath all the layers is empty, bleak music. It feels like "Matthew Sweet by the numbers."   Moreover, Living Things is supposed to be a more "produced" album than Kimi Ga Suki, and yet it feels sloppy and unrehearsed. Only a couple of the songs have a proper "ending" or even a fade-out. Most of the tracks sound like demos, with haphazard sloppy endings where the music abruptly cuts off as if the band were only rehearsing the song and decided to quit before the end. This is not a well produced album, to be honest it sounds unprofessional. And the fact that there is no booklet, no lyrics, also shows that Matthew wanted to put this CD out "on the cheap," which shows some disregard for his fans, in my opinion. Girlfriend, Altered Beast, 100% Fun, In Reverse, all of these discs have always had some form of lyric booklet. Even with Kimi Ga Suki Raifu, there was a booklet with liner notes by Matthew, a sense of personal involvement. But on Living Things, nothing. Just the tracklist and personnel. I detect a disinterest on Sweet's part, a lack of concern for our reaction to the sloppy song endings, the redundant material, or the lack of any liner notes or lyrics. Matthew seems essentially absent from the whole operation, from the packaging to the songs.    One reviewer compared this album to Altered Beast, which also had a more densely layered production style, a more "experimental" album than, say, Girlfriend. But at least Altered Beast still had a very high calibre of songs: Dinosaur Act, Ugly Truth, Time Capsule, Life Without You, Reaching Out, Falling. There is nothing on Living Things that stands out as a memorable song in the end. It all sounds like a series of hooks and textures that don't go anywhere. Another example of a more "produced" Sweet album is 1999's In Reverse, which has the Spector/Wilson "Wall of Sound" production on some tracks, but again, it works well because Sweet wrote a solid collection of SONGS for that album. Hide, Split Personality, I Should Never Have Let You Know, Write Your Own Song. These are all true gems in Sweet's catalog. And once again, Living Things fails to produce even ONE song that rises above the surface exterior in order to make a lasting impression. Really, I cannot think of even one song that stands on its own merits. "You're Not Sorry" and "I Saw Red" are probably the "best" tracks, but even those songs only sound like hollow imitations of much stronger material by Sweet on previous albums. He's covered all of this ground before, with much better results. For an album called "Living Things," it all sounds lifeless, a collection of dead shells. Attractive containers with nothing inside. 
      These days I don't often read tie-in novelizations of upcoming films, preferring to wait and experience the actual movie, which most would agree is probably the best way to discover a story designed for the screen.  But novelizations can often be fun, and this one was written by the talented comic book writer Peter David (who adapted the film script written by three other folks), so I figured I'd give it a whirl.       Sadly, if the movie sticks close to the story in this paperback, it will end up being a wasted opportunity to bring something great to the screen.  In the comments that follow, I'll discuss this book, but I'm really talking about the movie on which the book is based.       Overall, Mr. David does his best to make the story work in book form, toning down idiotic sight gags (yes, Reed Richards gets kicked in a sensitive place by Ben Grimm when Reed tests Ben's reflexes with a little hammer blow to Ben's newly-rocky knee), but in the end two adjectives come to mind to describe this story: silly and thin.       What's depressing is that this is the Fantastic Four, the title that established Marvel Comics' famous formula of heroics combined with melodrama, where the heroes can save the world one issue but not be able to make its lease payment on their headquarters the next.  Where wonderment and imagination permeated every issue of the original FF comic book no matter the personal dilemmas taking place.  Other movies should be looking in reverence to the Fantastic Four movie to see how a super-hero movie should be done.  Sadly, though, it's probably a good idea that other films don't emulate this one.  Because this Fantastic Four movie, based on what's in this novel, doesn't trust its own pedigree, and instead cynically includes touchstones from our "popular" culture to make the story more "approachable".       It's not amazing enough that Johnny Storm can burst into flames and roar through the skies.  No, we better have him first discover his powers while snowboarding with a hot nurse, catching fire while gaining speed on his board.  Then, the next time he displays his powers, it's while participating in an X-Games/Extreme sports tournament, bursting into flames while doing stunts on a cycle.  I can almost hear the story conference: "What do the kids like these days?  I got it, snowboarding and all that Extreme sports stuff.  Let's work that in somehow."  Since when does the FF need the latest hip & trendy gimmicks to sell what they're all about?  Did the X-Men movie need to do this?  Did Spidey?  Why did the producers feel the need to "help" the FF this way?  The Dr. Doom stuff is okay, but just so, well... thin.  Doom is nothing at all like the classic villain in the FF comics.  Here, he's just a guy who's mad at Reed Richards for frustrating his attempts to make money from the cosmic storm experiment, and for wooing Sue away from him.  These are believable motivations, but not very interesting ones.  And having Doom slowly turning into a being of metal, ala the X-Men's Colossus, was a needless change.  Doom's "superpower" was always his intellect.  Insane intellect, but intellect.  And why NOT keep him as the monarch of the fictional Balkan country of Latveria?  There are tons of examples of male monarchs in recent history (Prince Rainier, for one), monarchs who studied in the U.S. during their formative years and could have met a Reed Richards type and established an uneasy friendship.  Then Reed could have went to his friend- now a monarch in Europe- and asked for funding for the cosmic ray experiment. But here Doom is just a boring Donald Trump type, with a little scientific knowledge.  Hey, I know super-hero movies need to make some changes from the original comics source material, but why take out great, entertaining aspects of the original material and replace them with watered-down stuff?  I could go on and on, but I'll just make one or two more quick observations: Picturing Jessica Alba as I read this novelization, I began to feel that she is much too glamourous for the role of Sue Storm.  I have no problem with her being in the movie, but she would have been better off as one of Johnny's girlfriends.  Or better yet, as Alicia Masters.  Wouldn't that be a kick... the monstrous Thing's girlfriend geing hotter than any of the women following Johnny around?  It would add an interesting subtext to Ben's and Johnny's friendship, his secret jealousy of Ben's girlfriend.  But, no, they went for a much simpler and less interesting idea: let's make Sue really hot.  To end on a positive note, there's a pretty good battle at the end in the streets of New York (though it doesn't really do anything new), and, earlier, a nice scene in a planetarium between Reed and Sue, as they begin to reach out to one another.  And, without revealing too much, the producers leave things open for the return of Dr. Doom in a sequel, a Dr. Doom much closer to the conception of the character in the comics.  We'll see.  But, in the end, and just from reading the novelization, I'd give the story a C/C- (readable but nothing special) and the characterizations a B/B+.  And, who knows, if they don't junk up the movie with too much rock music, and the Extreme sports stuff doesn't take center stage TOO much, we may still have a watchable movie that will permit the production of a better sequel.  Oh, one final thought: none of the criticisms mentioned above are Peter David's fault.  He didn't write the movie, only this novelization of it.  He remains an entertaining writer who did his best here, though one gets the feeling he wrote some scenes through gritted teeth, and refused to fully embrace those scenes containing especially heavy doses of dumb-ness.  But I don't think anyone will hold that against him.  After all, most people agree with the old saying that says (paraphrased in a less vulgar way here) there are certain things that simply can't be polished.    
 This book had lovely pictures and the text on African American History was interesting, but what it lacked was information on how to actually plan a ceremony.  When and how do you jump the broom, what words can you use, what  are your guest doing while you jump the broom.  It left me still searching  for information.  Hopefully the follow up is better 
 This author claims to use logic and skepticism, all I can see from his book is a lack there of. This book along with Lyne's other book is the only propaganda, not some some massive CIA front. I was once a believer but no longer, UFOlogy and all that Tesla nonesense is just that, nonesense. If you want to learn about physics read anything by the genious of Einstein, not by this quack. If you don't want to waste your time I suggest getting any book by Philip Klass instead of this book 
 As a yoga video junkie, I have tried out a lot of different routines and instructors...and the best I've come across so far is Yoga for Surfers Fluid Power Yoga -- you don't even have to be a surfer to benefit from it! It's really beautiful, and Peggy Hall strikes just the right balance between the physical and spiritual sides of yoga. There are easy modifications to follow, and she's really inspiring and encouraging. She also ends with a very peceful relaxation sequence -- great images for visualizaion without getting sappy. There's a real sense of beginning, middle, and end, a full, complete practice. I also have Yoga for Surfers I, and I'll buy whatever else Peggy Hall creates 
 I found it depressing and way too long.  Instead of admiration for the heroine, I felt aggravation.  An abusive alcoholic for a husband, no way to make ends meet except the occasional contest win, for items that had no use to the family--Arthur Murray Dancing Shoes, for example.  Barely able to feed the kids she already has, she eventually has 10.  I know women lived differently in the 50's, still, most learned to drive a car!  With so many little ones, it seems to me irresponsible to not be able to drive, esp. with all the emergencies in this very dysfuntional family.  I kept waiting for the part when she would throw the bum out, obtain an education or job skills and show her family how to survive on more than luck and corny jingles 
 Sugrue takes a look at one of the crisis to hit not only Detroit but the rest of the country in his book on race and inequality. While there have been a lot of disturbing factors that have occurred during urban renewal Sugrue takes his text a little far. His flagrant bashing of urban planning gets old after the first two chapters and the book tends to drag on. This is an important issue that bears further studying but hopefully it will be done in a more academic way. This book does have all the information you need to start studying the subject and is a good way to begin looking at urban renewal.   
 not worth spending any money on. stick to third world cop and dancehall queen if you want to watch a good jamaican movie 
 Selfish is a word that quickly comes to mind as a good way to describe Rebecca Eckler. She's not a bad writer or storyteller, but she really paints herself into a corner here and makes herself almost impossible to like. She is self-oriented at a time when some thought might best be given to her child's welfare, and yes, as everyone surely noticed, she smoked during her pregnancy. This woman needs to mature. She likes to think she is a cool person, a woman in touch with the scene and one of those who defines her era, but I found her deluded and irresponsible through and through. Where was the deep maternal side to her? Her baby seemed to represent an annoying interruption to her "life of amazing hipness". If she is in any way a self-created role model wanna-be, then she adds to my fears for the future 
 Calling "The Truelove', whose story is primarily that of Clarissa Oakes, a woman who has been sexually abused from early girlhood until she boards Aubrey's ship [and, one might argue, until she leaves] a light hearted romp is misleading.  Hardly the first time this series has dealt with the impact of a woman on 'the wooden world' that Aubrey, Maturin and the ever changing cast of supporting characters inhabit, this time it shows everyone behaving in odd and surprising ways. Jack is thick headed and oblivious. Stephen, normally so clear-eyed, sends Clarissa, who admits not only to disliking children but to throwing an infant down a well, to stay with his wife and their newborn. Pullings throws off his sense of duty and is befuddled as well as bewitched.  Since Clarissa [like all O'Brian's 'strong' females] is really a man in a skirt [for a woman in uniform we have the aptly named Killick, in all his shrewish glory] she is far too flat, vague and undeveloped to carry such large portions of the plot with any measure of success.  This is definitely the worst book of the series and, sadly, in some ways not a good book at all. Not just because the plot is so out of place in this series, or even because characters you have grown to know start behaving in ways that are inexplicable, but because they have almost disappeared from the story to be replaced by someone you can't actually care about because she seems so fake 
 What the hell happened to this cd? After #1 and #2 came out i was itching to get my hands on this one... and when i was done (yes i gave this piece of *poo poo* some 2 hours of my life)listening to this one... i returned it. Trust there are about 3 or 4 good songs, the rest arent even average...they SUCK 
 A disappointing package of disjointed material and a lot of recycling of standard leadership theory. The old theories are repackaged in heavy academic jargon to make it seem that something new is being offered. I am  sorry to report that I gained very little from the enormous effort that was  involved in reading this book.  It was disappointed that so many well-known  academics and experts in the field allowed the publication of such  disjointed ramblings under one cover. If you are having difficulty getting  to sleep at night this book is for you 
  To be honest, I do pick up this Mag from the Newstand 4 to 5 times a year, but I can hardly call myself a fan. If you are looking for a solid computer or tech mag, Wired is not for you, It tries too hard to be hip and trendy, but it's group of Left/Lib Nerds too often come off as being lame and borish.  Wired needs to be "ReWired" to meet the needs of the modern tech community 
 I bought this book with a lot of excitement and was surprised when I saw that the CD was not shipped with the book. I don't know how I am supposed to purchase the CD or download the audio files. It's a little frustrating.   I have not judged the quality of the book.   Other buyers, please be aware that the book does not ship with the companion audio CD. 
 Here are the obscure recordings of "Flash-in-the-Pan" artists and "hits" of us Baby Boomers!  Stuff that was the temporary fodder of Casey Kasum and the "top 40' "Hit" radio stations across the United States in the '60's.  One Hit Wonders that were played over and over in their time then promptly forgotten.  They were re'released in the many incarnations of "K-Tel," then forgotten again as these K-Tel records found their way to thriftshops, then landfills.  If you want to reminisce about all that "bubblegum" heard as a child, be more imaginative!  Pass this one by and instead purchase The Resident's Third Reich and Roll!  Only The Residents could give these "one hit wonders" the ROASTING they DESERVED 
 This book is nothing more than an insult to the Irish people. It paints terrible steroeotypes and does nothing else but put down all this Irish. This book should be burned 
 Perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses, Boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others.    Lacking even the slightest trace of shame, he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses.  As a result, there's nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages.  Even more pitiably, like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to "sanitize" his clandestinely-acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source, Boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed.  One wearies quickly of the Manichaean results.  And like any ideologically-driven but technically inept would-be nuclear (or social) engineer, he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally, succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was.  Why, even the title itself has been purloined from Alistair Home's 1977 underground classic, "A Savage War of Peace"!*  Considering that Home's tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from Boot's, this is irony most profound.  It is scarcely surprising, then, that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear-splittingly trumpeted in Boot's book, thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it -- unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the Ozymandian ruins of Boot's espoused belief system.   * Recently reprinted and highly recommended!  
 This book does not respect the Gospel of the suffering of Jesus Christ on earth.  If it did, it would spend more time talking about the guilt of the Jews.  The Gospels spend many chapters and many pages describing the guilt of the Jews.  For Dr. Morris not to do this is intellectually dishonest and disrespectful of the Gospel's own account of what the Jews did.  Why would God spend so much time talking about the Jewish guilt if He did not want the churches of Jesus Christ to preach it and teach it.  Dr. Morri's skirting of the issue shows what is wrong with Evangelical Christians today.  Evangelicalism has become a theology that follows a certain interpretation rather than respecting the Truth of the Gospel.  That is why evangelical preachers no longer preach against Jews.  Why did St. Stephen preach against the Jews?  Why did St. Paul preach against the Jews?  Why did Jesus Christ preach against the Jews and call them the children of the devil in the Gospel of John?  Because God wants the church to preach this way.  Today's evangelical preachers do not respect the Bible and do not honor God.  This is evident in their attempt to hide the guilt of Jews in killing Christ.  The New Testament certainly opposes such cowardice on the part of evangelical preachers 
 I have the black version, but I'm writing reviews for the white and red as well to save you from buying this toaster model.  From day one, it hasn't been able to toast anything evenly - be it frozen / fresh /refrigerated  bread / bagel / english muffin - you name it.  If you don't believe me, see the photo I uploaded.  The toast is burnt and raw at the same time 
 I'm sorry but I'm quite disappointed with this movie.  I gave it 2 stars because it did follow the book closely.  I do not like the acting in this movie at all.  Besides the poor quality of the movie, there is absolutely no chemistry between Jane and Mr. Rochester.  I have no idea how Jane and Mr. Rochester could fall in love with one another in this movie.  They both appeared cold and distant toward each other.  I felt like I was watching a bad soap opera and this version is way too pricey compare to the other much better versions of Jane Eyre available out there 
 This book, while mildly entertaining in parts, and informative on occasion, is marred by an overall unsophisticated understanding of both poker and philosophy. The blurb on the back cover says "This is post-graduate poker, not for the faint of heart", but the actual content of the book falls far short of this description. Anyone who's read even one good book on poker will be quite disappointed by the poker content of this book. And anyone who's studied a fair amount of academic philosophy would (I hope) be disappointed by the philosophical content of this book. There is _some_ good content -- more on that below -- but most of it is uninformative, silly, and/or wrong.   The most egregious claim in the book is made by multiple authors: they basically claim that they have psychic power to help determine which cards are going to come next. For example, the claim is made in the very first essay, by Michael Ventimiglia:  "I'm convinced that plays I've made based on instinct have proven to be right more often than statistics predict."   He points out that sometimes these judgments based on instinct are a result of getting a read on people,   "But sometimes they're just about which way the wind is blowing, about how the cards are going to fall. I am continually amazed by how often they are right."  Why would someone think something so clearly false? Fortunately, the answer is provided later in the book, in the nice essay by Bassham and Marchese, about how psychological biases can adversely affect one's poker play. As they point out: "research shows that people naturally tend to remember `hits' (occasions when strategies or predictions succeeded) more often than they remember `misses'." Ventimiglia would do well to read their essay.  In addition to major false claims like Ventimiglia's, there are also a number of minor errors that will irritate anyone who understands poker. For example, Kenneth Lucy claims that when you're on a flush draw before the river, there's a 1 in 4 chance of getting a flush, when in fact there's a 1 in 5. Willy Young describes a hand where, after the river, there are four hearts on the board, and you have the 6 of hearts in your hand. He writes "You reach for the pot -- you've got your flush" when in fact it turns out that someone has four of a kind. Well, in addition to worrying about four of a kind, you should be _really_ worried about someone holding a higher heart than your measly 6.   In addition to poker errors, there are philosophy errors too. Don Fallis describes David Lewis's Principal Principle -- that your subjective probabilities should match what you believe the objective probabilities to be -- as "the most famous proposal for exactly how probability should guide one's life". Actually, the Principal Principle has little to do with how probability should guide one's life -- you could have no beliefs about objective probabilities, and hence never utilize the principle, and yet still want to use your subjective probability assignments as a guide to life. This sort of fallacious reasoning leads Fallis to criticize Sklansky in a completely unfair way. I'll leave it to the reader to figure out what's unfair about the criticism -- there's a certain enjoyment that one gets in ferreting out a mistake in someone else's philosophical argument, analogous to the enjoyment one gets in outplaying one's opponent in a game of poker. This is one of the many interesting connections between poker and philosophy that isn't discussed in this book.   I'll close on a positive note. The best essay, in my opinion, is by Brian Huss, about the nature of bluffing. It points out the similarities and differences between bluffing and lying, BS-ing, accepting (in the technical philosophy sense) and fooling yourself. It's a nice piece of conceptual analysis -- probably not worthy of being published in a philosophy journal, but more sophisticated than the other essays in the book.  
 I bought the audio book and I didn't like the way the woman read the material.  Her voice was sappy and affected which was a real turn off for me.  I felt the examples used in the book didn't quite capture a wide enough variety of woman.  I actually came away feeling worse about "midlife crisis" which was not my purpose in purchasing the book. It was typical of the material out there already.  Nothing fresh or new.  For example, "the gardener" was one of the categories of women in mid-life crisis. Cut me a break!  That is the old stereotype of a middle aged woman.  There weren't enough modern references 
 I bought my Sunbeam 450-watt Heritage Series stand mixer at Kohl's yesterday afternoon and I woke up bright an early today to make my first batch of Choc-Oat-Chip Cookies -- the recipe was on a bag of Nestl√© Semi-Sweet Morsels.    As I was beating butter and sugar, it was spraying outside of the bowl onto my shirt, toaster, wall and anything else nearby.    I also noticed that the butter in the center of the bottom of the bowl was not incorporating with the sugar.  I never had this problem with my old mixmaster.  When I added the flour very slowly to the bowl, flour dust ended up covering anything within a two-foot radius of the mixmaster.    Everytime I scraped the sides of the bowl, the bowl motor whined and I wasn't scraping that hard!  Isn't this machine designed to scrape the sides of the bowl as the machine is running?  After I had all the flour added, the bowl motor burned out!  The vertical part of the stand was VERY HOT.  I transferred all of the dough to another bowl, cleaned up the machine and returned it to Kohl's for a full refund.  The beater release button and the tilt button are extremely difficult to use.  I couldn't even get the beat release button to use until I tilted the machine back to down.   The control knob on the back of the mixer is lightweight plastic and felt flimsey as compared to my original mixmaster from the 1980's.  I was really excited to get this machine, thinking it would be a dream to use.  Boy, was I wrong.  I'm glad I was able to return it for a full refund.  What a disappointment!  For those thinking of buying this machine...  You might want to wait until engineers redesign it.  
 As an agnostic, I eagerly approached Surprised by Joy expecting to have my beliefs (or lack thereof) challenged by someone sympathetic to my point of view. After all, I thought, Lewis was once an atheist.  Surely, he'll gently guide me to the Christian path that he himself followed.  In this I was greatly disappointed.  The book is neither a true autobiography nor a rigorous Christian apology and sadly, rather than using his considerable talents to persuade atheists and agnostics to his way of thinking, he frequently resorts to disrespectful, even scornful attacks on non-believers that are sure to offend and alienate them.  Moreover, his arguments are written not for a layperson but for someone well-versed in philosophy and literature.  And even with all the scholarship he brings to the table, in the end, he resorts to his gut feeling rather than rational discourse when explaining why he decided to convert.  In the beginning of the book, Lewis tells us quite a bit about his early childhood and formative experiences.  His story becomes increasingly sketchy as he ages.   Although his life was certainly filled with dramatic events, such as the death of his mother and his combat experiences during WWI, his accounts of these events are vague and seem strangely devoid of emotion. Other life experiences that most people would consider important and relevant - the death of his father, for example - are barely even mentioned and are dismissed as having no bearing on the story Lewis is telling.  One always has the sense of being held at arm's length in this book. We are invited into Lewis's mind but rarely into his heart.      What is left, then, is an extremely cerebral life story.  Lewis writes endlessly about his education, the books he's read and the influence they had on him as well as the brilliant young men (and it's nearly always men) who befriended him over the course of his life and made him re-evaluate his thoughts and beliefs.  All well and good.    But when he actually comes to his conversion, I'm afraid it's difficult to follow his train of thought.  Lewis clearly expects his reader to be as erudite and well-read as he is.  Sadly, that isn't the case for me, nor I suspect, is it true for most modern readers.  I am not a student of philosophy and I am woefully ignorant of English literature.  All his references to these topics, therefore, were entirely over my head.    Still, it's clear that an element of the irrational creeps into his arguments for rejecting old ways of thinking.  For example, when Lewis senses a certain inconsistency in his own beliefs and the tenets of realism, he's must decide whether to reject realism altogether or embrace Behavioristic theory.  He chooses the former not for any clear objective reason but because, as he writes, "I cannot force my thoughts into that shape any more than I can scratch my ear with my big toe..."  I suppose I could give the same reason for my lack of faith.  In fact, it isn't a reason at all.     Lewis would have us believe he was a very reluctant convert.  Perhaps he was.  But once converted, he clearly had very little patience for those whose views he once shared.  He explains this with a quote from Donne: "The heresies that men leave are hated most."  He goes on to add, "The things I assert most vigorously are those that I resisted long and accepted late."    To be fair, Lewis retains respect for an atheist called Kirk who played an essential role in his education.  But he doesn't extend that respect to other atheists:  "Atheism has come down in the world since those days, and mixed itself with politics and learned to dabble in dirt...I am ashamed that my old mates and (which matters much more) Kirk's old mates should have sunk to what they are now.  It was different then..."  Ah yes.  Somehow, when Lewis himself was an atheist, that particular way of thinking was far more respectable than after he converted.  I suppose he would have nothing but contempt for atheists and agnostics today.  I don't mean to sound bitter but I really expected something much better from this book.  I honestly hoped I would like it.  I didn't.  His reasoning, though bolstered by a veritable library of books, is unconvincing.  His life story, though intellectually compelling, is an emotional desert.  As I read it, I kept wondering, What of love?  And anger? And sadness?  And passion?  Doesn't he feel anything at all?  Even his description of Joy is oppressively unemotional.  Was Lewis really so unfeeling?  The Chronicles of Narnia suggest otherwise.  In short, the book was not to my taste but I suspect it was never meant to be.  Lewis seems to be preaching to the choir, not reaching out to sinners.  Those religious types out there who already adore C.S. Lewis should, no doubt, disregard my opinions on Surprised by Joy - I'm sure they, at least, will love it.  But for those non-believers out there half hoping to be converted by Lewis's words I can only say it didn 't do it for me 
 "Rachel and Her Children" is an award-winning compilation of the author's conversations with homeless people, highlighting how the downtrodden suffer in the United States at the end of the 20th Century.  Jonathan Kozol pulls no punches in his one-sided indictment of the American way, putting the blame for homelessness squarely on the shoulders of everyone else (Americans with homes, that is, the rest of us).  Although much of what Kozol depicts is heart-rending, I would have welcomed a more balanced presentation of the homeless issue, not only discussing the shortcomings of a political and economic system that makes it difficult for the homeless to overcome their situation, but also indicating that the homeless bear a good deal of personal repsonsibility in their plight (making little to no effort to seek employment, avoiding or sometimes even refusing to accept the albeit limited help offered by government agencies, sinking further into poverty by irresponsibly having children whom they cannot afford to support, etc).  For those of you who want a stronger kick in the pants about the suffering of the poor than that provided by Jonathan Kozol, I suggest reading the essay of another Jonathan (Swift's "A Modest Proposal") 
 I gave this album 2 stars because this is apparently the same band that produced "Logic Will Break Your Heart", although you would never know this by listening to "Without Feathers".  As other people have noted, this album is infinitely different than the amazing "Logic Will Break Your Heart".  I fell in love with "Logic..", and when this album came out I was first in line to pick it up. After a thorough listen, I examined the packaging.  I thought, "Did I buy the wrong cd?  Dear God, please, did someone accidently place a different cd in this case?"  But, to my dismay, it was The Stills.  Say what you want about this album, but I don't see how anyone who really felt "Logic..." could be anything but disappointed in this album.  I've tried examining it from a different angle.  I've given it a "fresh listen".  Nothing.  I got the same feeling from this album that I got after I watching "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace".  What happened to the magic, man? 
 So I love Bill Bryson - and have bought many of his books and Cds - however I was dismayed to see something marked as "Audio CD" shipped out which is a weird Ipod nano sized MP3 device with the whole book on it. (appears to be a non-rewriteable MP3 device) Not that that's not a neat idea - but it demands you listen via headphones - I listen at work or while I drive and was expecting a CD - I am returning this item - and looking forward to getting a real CD.  Buyer beware!! But Bill Bryson is a great reader and storyteller 
 Although Anne made some excellent points, it was still one-sided. She still speaks of Republicans in general as being better which is wrong because many of them are just as hypocritical as Democrats (and some are worse because they know what God commands but don't actually care), and although she gives some explanations as to why Republicans are the better party, they are deceptive and wrong.  For example that Republicans are better because they promote Chrisitianity and are specific in their arguments: yes, that is true in some ways, however many promote false Christianity and make it look bad because many of them are not truly Christians but putting up a show. That needs to be said otherwise people get the impression often that all Christians are hypocrites and that it's all about financial gain or vain glory. And merely having a specific argument doesn't make an argument better. For example I can say, "Democrats are out to get your kids and the poor because they want to raise taxes on the poor and give tax cuts to the rich and want to force children to learn white wash" but so called Republicans like George Bush want to do that too and have done that.  I would like to say that this is a good book to give to a young girl, because it shows you can still be fememine, wise, and a Christian, and yet not be a fool or knowledgeable and emotionally immature (in other words a nerd), but it has too many big errors.  It's helpful howewver for everyone in general who wants to know what is wrong with some type of arguing and how to argue constructively. Although she doesn't give a thorough explanation on that subject, it's very good and concise. And I just happened to be comforted by her words because the day before had been attacked with vagueries by a pastor from an AOG church 
 This album is terrible.  As a Mississippian, I know David Banner did a poor job of displaying the quality of music in Mississippi.  Besides the singles that were released, this cd has absolutely nothing to offer.  I commend him for trying to put Mississippi on his back, but if he's going to represent on meaningless (how many different times can you refer to your genitalia on one cd?) and useless (even though it's a southern cd, the beats aren't even that good) albums like this, I'd rather he left "The Sip" out of it 
   Now here's a publishing phenomenon. Stephens publishes his first book on the Maya and it is hailed by Edgar Allen Poe, among others, as "perhaps the most interesting book of travel ever published". His second book on the Maya, the one for sale on this page, was called "better than its brother" by William Hickling Prescott. 153 years slip by, and a new edition of "Incidents of Travel in Yucatan" is published by none other than Smithsonian Books.  I made the mistake of assuming the new edition, coming from Smithsonian Books, would be of high quality. How wrong I was.  Mr. Ackerman, in his own words, has reduced the text of this classic "by two thirds, but aims to preserve the spirit and essence of the original work". That's right, this "editor" cuts out 67% of one of the greatest works of literature in history, and has the impudence and effrontery to say he aims to preserve the book's spirit and essence. Then, taking the concept of hubris to a new level, he puts his name on the cover under that of the author--as though he had actually added something.  He has added nothing, only subtracted. Besides the 67% of the text, he also removed the name of Frederick Catherwood, who did the marvelous drawings, from the cover.  In the introduction, there is not the slightest hint of shame for the gut job, which he describes: "I have eliminated Stephens' description of the journeys to and from the region...I have tightened Stephens' prose, eliminated the detailed measurements of buildings and mounds, and excised long historical digressions and anecdotes...I have not used ellipses to indicate compression..."  With all the eliminations and excisions and hackings, Ackerman elects to leave in place misspellings because they "reveal Stephens' character and time". Let me get this straight. Historical digressions and anecdotes, admired by the likes of Poe and Prescott, must be cut. But misspellings must be preserved to reveal character and time? What sort of a wacky caricature of a scholar did the Smithsonian Scholarly Book Fund give a grant to?  I have tried to fathom why a person with an interest in archaeology and history and literature would maim a book in this fashion, but I'm at a loss. One would expect this sort of thing if Spielberg were making a biopic about Stephens. Then, the cuts would be necessary to fit the story into a 90-minute slot while keeping enough space for a sassy love interest and a talking jaguar. But this is a fantastic book that eight generations of readers from around the world have loved in its entirety.  Where is the Dover edition?     
 The author's method of "revealing...deeper organizational characteristics" is to arbitrarily circle arbitrary sets of notes, assign them meaningless names like "4-17", and make trivial assertions about the integers from zero to eleven 
 You loved Ender's Game, right?  And even though the next couple of Ender-related books were more confusing and not of the same quality as Ender's Game, at last came Ender's Shadow, the parallel story of Bean.  Terrific.  Then came Shadow of the Hegemon.  It is, literally, a shadow of the original talent and quality of the first five books.  The dialogue is tedious, the story line pencil thin, and the plot has a huge Achilles' heel (pun intended).  This is another example of a book out by an author (in this case Orson Scott Card) who must have been pressured to produce, because this baby needs more cooking.  It will make no sense if you haven't read Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow.  It hardly makes any sense at all.  Beware 
 I didn't see anything in this book that was not covered in my college courses. I felt like the author assumed I knew nothing, and it felt like she was speaking down to me. I wish I had never bought this book because now I have to deal with the hassle of returning it 
 I was sad to discover this is not nearly as fun as its brother the Mattel Football handheld. The play modes are not well-defined: level one is too slow and level two is too fast even after hours of play. The buttons are much less durable feeling than one would expect as is the casing. Kitch value makes it cool to have on your coffee table, but most people pick it up, play it once or twice, and say the same thing "where's the football one like this? 
 This movie lacked truly experienced actors in serious, and romantic roles.  Sure Chris and Sandra have starred in romantic movies, but they are unoriginal, and just like the next.  Chris O'Donnell was the last person who should have been picked for the role of such a noteworthy and distinguished American author.  This movie puts Ernest Hemmingway to shame.  Which is a complete disaster.  Where was the build-up of true love?  This movie bounced from one scene to the next, without ever convincing me Agnes and Ernest were truly in love.  This movie did not deserve the accolades it received from the critics.  It has the potential to be excellent, if there were different actors in the roles of Agnes and Ernest.  It had the potential to be good if it hadn't been so "Hollywood-ized."  If you're interested in Ernest Hemmingway's life, read "A Farewell to Arms."  It's far better 
 I heard about this book growing up but didn't read it until just recently (a middle-aged adult) and I have to agree with so many other reviewers who feel its popularity largely stems from the time period in which it was written, i.e., it was SO SHOCKING AND DISGUSTING! Such filth! I mean, that's why I heard about the book when I was growing up. But as so many others have already pointed out, it is tame by today's standards. I also have to agree with another reviewer who wrote that the "female protagonist is completely a male fantasy. The book's message is simply that men like women who are able to climax at the same time as their partners without any need for foreplay or other effort on the man's part..." Now, you see, what struck me about Sir Clifford's situation, and Lady Chatterley's, for that matter, is if they really loved each other, his paralysis from the waist down wouldn't have had to put a stop to his supplying her with orgasms; there ARE other things that can be done, yes? In fact, quite possibly Connie would have had an orgasm for the first time! (Ahem, women readers will know what I mean.) But Clifford treated Connie poorly. With or without the lack of sex issue, I think she would have been emotionally open to an affair anyway. Which to me, just goes to show that a man wrote the book...a man totally out of touch with what really makes a woman tick. 
 hm.  i found it to be rather amazing that this book was even published.  IT IS SO BAD.  the dialogue is saddening and the story is only slightly better.  stay away, otherwise you will be regretting the waste of valuable time 
 I bought this book expecting to immerse myself in an epic struggle of Good vs. Evil.  I got a facile tale of the Southwest.  Buyers beware!  This is not the Miltonian epic, but rather a wolf in sheep's clothing 
 For all the endorsements, you think there'd be more material than "here are some good ideas on how to listen and communicate with others".  I was disappointed with this book.  The author spends a lot of time trying to classify people into 3 different categories, and then trys to define how you can communicate with each category.  He provides no DATA on to support this categorization, just "hey this seems like a good idea&quot 
 Ok, I have LOVED Sophie since she hit the scene. But what the heck happen here? I'm stuck somewhere in the mid-beginning. I'm going to go back and finish it and will add to the review then, but right now I'm at a lost for words. Sophie come back! 
 This book was the worst book i have ever read. I had to read it for an english project and man it was boring.  It had no point to it at all and it was so confusing it didn't make any sense.  I found that the prarie idea was a bad idea to write about becuase it doesnt capture a teen audience and it was so confusing becuase it jumped from year to year going back in years and then to two years alter and characters would leave and then never come back.  The eight stories in one book just made it too much to take in at once.  
 Go right to the heart of the matter with Graham and Dodd's Security Analysis if you want to know how Buffett started.  Hagstrom's book is a poorly executed fifth grader's book report on the primary investing philosophy of Buffett.  Don't waste your money here.  You'll regret it.  This doesn't even really scratch the surface of relevant information 
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 While I found this book helpful in the general sense of the word, it was  aimed solely at the "outside" sales rep who sees his/her customer  face-to-face. It provided good reminders for seasoned sales reps, but  wasn't revolutionary in it's ideas of selling. It was a short read - no  more than 4-5 hours. It demonstrated very good closing tactics and  objection handling, but all of this is after you make contact. It didn't  explain how to get past the secretary screen, how to get the appointment or  even how to find out who the decision maker is. Most of the sale, if not  all of it, is done over the phone and that was completely overlooked 
 Gene Hackman is Jedidiah Tucker Ward, an aging yet tireless litigant for the public good, enemy of evil corporate type and the bane of overpaid attorneys everywhere.  On the other side of this gap of good and evil is Maggie Ward, Jed's headstrong daughter.  Between them is a products liability lawsuit involving car lights that kill people.  The premise suggests the ending - Jed will win the day, but not before his daughter has been transformed into a noble attorney.  Jed will fight the good fight (which will require supreme grandstanding) while Maggie learns just how amoral her side really is.  What robs this courtroom thriller is what's missing in virtually every courtroom thriller - a case that could go either way, an actual case in controversy.  Maybe because of the amount of preemptive litigation required just to produce a major motion picture, Hollywood is simply too beholden to lawyers to make a truly biting film about them.  Instead of a compelling case, we have one that's ready for our verdict as soon as we've seen the suits worn by either side or their offices.  The case in "Class Action" is one you can typify as "David & Goliath", which is to say that the end has been fated to be won by the little guy by a higher power.  There's no way that we're going to see a case won (even by dishonest means) by Donald Moffat's hired band of Harvard-trained professional liars, and there's no way anybody in the audience is going to buy their arguments.  Maggie's bosses are so transparently bad, that not only do they screw up, but even their explanations are patently evil  Even so, the film stacks the deck against them by cynically attributing to them as evil what are basic facts of life for lawsuits of this kind - namely that products liability plaintiffs will make overbroad requests for discovery, and defendants respond in kind by deluging the other side with documents responsive to the request but otherwise valueless.  For a thriller about high-paid lawyers, "Class Action" has all the legal acumen of high-school mock-trial, with fewer suprises 
  I enjoyed Odd Thomas, the first novel in what is becoming a franchise for the author. I consider it one of Koontz's better efforts, but Forever Odd is no Odd Thomas.  It's a tedious, sometimes painful read.    The biggest let down in Forever Odd is the cartoon-like villain.  She's annoying, not the least bit interesting, and more pathetic than she is menacing.    The plot itself is thin.  Koontz stretches things out, giving us more detail than we need about the tunnel system beneath Pico Mondo and loading his sentences with as many adverbs and adjectives as he can.  Odd himself was endearing in the first novel but in Forever Odd his musings get too preachy for my taste.  The life affirming ending was meant to be poignant but I found it sappy.   And was Koontz serious when he killed his villain by random cougar attack?  A cougar?  Really Dean?  That's the best you could come up with?   Sometimes Koontz hits, sometimes he misses. Forever Odd is a miss. 
 If you are looking to pass time with an author who is gifted in communicating strong emotions, you found your book. If you are hoping to learn about corporate bait and switch or getting a job, this book is void of that.   The book jacket and introduction tells readers the author sets out to get a job, work in corporate America and then write a book about her presumed challenges. Barbara Ehrenreich admits she lied (p.9) to employers about her job history and got friends, with similar values, to support her lies. It didn't work. She never got a job and wrote a book about it anyway. The content basically is a five-page article that Barbara Ehrenreich sold as a 237 page book that is slow paced. Monotonous details are ubiquitous (e.g. itemizing the food in buffet lines and what strangers put on their lunch plates).   If you are discouraged about your job search, don't get this book. It will not lift you up, it will not help you get a job and it has serious potential to put you in a depressing downward spiral. Barbara Ehrenreich is unbalanced against capitalism and corporate America. While it is well known they are not perfect, Barbara Ehrenreich never mentions the positive aspects of capitalism and corporate America. Nor does she give comparative statistics on the amount of people who live well in capitalist economies verses other economies. The book is a constant flow of vocational pessimism.  Although the author uses the first half of the book to set herself up as a well-reasoned, balanced and unprejudiced person, one does sense there is a some bias to her writing. Not until page 139 does Barbara Ehrenreich reveal she is an atheist. Thus, one would think she would avoid churches. Yet she unashamedly goes to churches hoping to secure a job while lying about her background. She then grumbles that she wasted her time there. She mercilessly mocks common church-going people and those who don't accept her anticapitalist views. It is hard to imagine Ehrenreich walked into the church meetings without prejudice.   While it is true that bait and switch is going on in numerous HR departments, this book has nothing about that 
 Marketers and advertisers base the majority of their life on the creation of false needs. Siegel demonstrates why it is that this "tween" market has become so interesting for businesses: this particular age group is old enough to make suggestions to their parents about how to spend their money but still young enough to be utterly manipulated 
 When this book arrived, it had obviously been handled very poorly during the packaging process. There were smudges and rips all over the cover, detracting from the book's appeal as a coffee table book. I returned it to a local Borders and requested they order a replacement, but I'm still waiting for the new book to come in. This has been very frustratin 
 What a waste of time, you knew all along what was going to happen and the characters are all just a little too perfect to be normal and believable.   Some things are totally out there... for exapmle, Allegra is woken up in the middle of the night to bail her client out of jail? Come on! Lawyers are not ethically permited to post bail for their clients. Do some research Danielle, like the rest of the authors do... don't rely on what you see on television. No lawyer would ever give out their home number, let alone answer calls in the middle of the night.   And I am sick and tired of this obsession this author has with thinness. A size 10 is fat? Women like to read about characters who they can relate to and are like themselves... not the ideal woman created by the male world.   Don't waste time on this book, unless you are still in high school.  
 What kind of rapist gets to be a hero in another book? When I first started reading this book I wasn't very impressed to begin with.  I have read some of Catherine Coulter's other books and found them very enjoyable.  Imagine my surprise and disgust when after I read that horrible rape scene I turn to the back of the book and-viola!- the VILIAN has his own romance staring HIM as the hero??? Just knowing this made me unable to finish the book.  I realize that the plot is set hundreds of years ago and although this might have happened then I certainly don't want it happening in my reading.  What ever happened to the hero having integrity? Honor? Courage?  Did the author hope to make this look like a "nice" rape?  It ruined the entire book for me and I doubt I will be reading the other books in this series 
 Mr. Segev has written yet another history of Israel.  THis time the topic is Israels first year in existence.  He touches on such topics as; secularism vs. religion, settling the territories, arab lands, immigration.  His argument is simple.  THe Jews, having defeated the Arab in the 48 war, treat their neighboors badly while at the same time creating a theocratic state and encouraging Jews(who according to him were living peacefully with their arab neighboors) to emigrate to Israel.  This book is very informative and well written but its argument is wrong.  For a less biased account I would recommend "From time immemorial".  For an account of the war read 'O Jerusaleum'.  Segev does no justice to the heroics of the early Jews who built a strong state in the face of enemies, but he does try and substantiate Arab claims that they were forced off their lands(after murdering thier Jewish neighboors of course).  Be careful with this book it is biased 
 I have always been intrigued by Mr.Cramer, when I found this smallish book I decided to read what he had to say about the market crash. I hoped to find some deep insights from a man who is a Wall Street insider. I am very disappointed with the book, you probably will learn more about what caused the bubble to burst by reading newspapers and magazines then you would from this book. The material in the book is very superficial and the only thing that stuck was that he was shamelessly using it as a means to advertise his web site and alert service. If you have loads of money that you want to waste, please mail it to Mr. Cramer at least then you will save a tree 
 I've read most of Ludlum's so this one was a bit disappointing.  Too formulaic and downright lazy in parts.  The dialogue was sloppy.  One too many "oh my gods" made me think the characters were more wowed than I was. Aquitane Progression and the Bourne trilogy rules 
 Major disappointment. Probably a ton of good content. But the little stick drawings of plants, at best, and no drawings a lot, for most, is a real let down 
 Abandoning the reinterpretation of the initial epoch of Batman, like the previous writings of THE LONG HALLOWEEN and DARK VICTORY, HUSH instead is a tale set in the modern era. The plot concerns the arrival of a new villain and the supposed control of the insane criminal base of Gotham City. The Dark Knight must work to end the transgression that seems to be rapidly spiralling out of control.   The story begins as a simple kidnap and ransom story, that appears to be only a fraction of a greater crisis playing out behind the scenes, eventually turning into a mass profusion of ideas and set pieces without proper relevance or connection. The denouement is inauthentic, where it's fragmented and composed of distracting slack subplots largely unnecessary to the thematic undercurrent. Rather than follow through on the normal writing design of problem - reaction - resolution, the plot advancement has Batman continually reacting. A villain is introduced, generating the requisite fight scene that unfolds over an entire issue. This technique carries on until all the A list villains appear. It keeps the readers' mind disengaged from the "mystery" with its barrage of moments that provoke the certain, predictable appeal from the readership. HUSH ultimately becomes out of control throughout the plot development in its intent on being an epic, all defining book with its features of shocking moments and revelations. That trick has an overall numbing experience as the writing never recovers from the numerous blows to its credibility from the revisionist writing method.  The obvious mystery at the core is a simple pretext to affix a lingering, indulgent plot to the city's criminal element, ensuring that numerous revered characters are on display, the narrative never addresses or justifies the illogical, unexplained behavior of the characters. Rather than constructing a contemplative mystery worthy of Batman's abilities, the character is rewritten without the strong awareness and detective instinct, his character arc severely undermined as a result.  Overall, Hush never feels like a sincere attempt at storytelling. Where it differs from Halloween and Victory timewise, the revisionism and borrowed themes that characterized past writings are conspicuously promoted throughout the work with the same undisciplined methods. The book labors beneath redundancy and re-examination of ideas and passages already demonstrated, following the similar formula of those aforementioned works. It lacks inner consistency of the recent treatment of the world, and it fails to reconfigure its limited concept to place well within the current framework of the character. It doesn't attempt to explore the limits of the medium, but one entirely content to reside within its past conventions. Barely acceptable as an entertaining diversion 
 As a shaman myself I was appalled when I began reading this book only to discover that entheogens--THE VERY SOLE FOUNDATION FOR SHAMANISM ITSELF--are not mentioned once--not once.  Somehow this book is 600 pages of information about shamanism while not informing the reader of its actual basis.  What a blunder that this is supposed to be a definitive textbook on this religion and some poor people have read this book and considered themselves learned in shamanism.  It needs to be taken off the shelf 
 Taunton needs to take a rest. Their books are usually very good, but lately I've noticed the same pictures appearing again and again. If you've seen their "Built-Ins" or "Storage" books, you've seen it all. This slim volume is a rip-off and an insult to the reader. Do they actually think that people won't recognize the photos? Take it out of the library - don't buy it 
 I recently found this two-pack in a bargain bin for five bucks, Being a Lucy fan I snatched it up and brought it home. Well all I can say is that I'm glad I only paid five bucks for it. On the up side the shows are highly entertaining and they highlight an era in television that rarely receives it's due, But on the down side the tranfer looks like it's been pooped on and at times all you see is a white screen with an outline of Lucy. But the shows almost make this DVD a good value, bottom line! BUY IT FOR FIVE BUCKS. Any higher it's a bad value 
 Even though it was fun to read, I give it one star lest the brainwashed academics out their suffer further undue influence.  This book has been highly misrepresented by evolutionists for decades.  One reviewer made this point but failed to back it up with any facts.  That reviewer failed to point out that it was in the "Descent of Man," not "Origin of the Species" where Darwin first presents man as having descended from apes.  Evolutionists apply natural selection to explain all biological development.  It's the worse case of reductionism in history.  James D. Watson and Edward Wilson were on the Charlie Rose show talking about this book.  They described natural selection as the single great development in science since Newton.  They claimed to describe this book as great English literature yet they badly misrepresented it as teaching that natural selection applies to everything biological.  How could these allegedly great scientists be so unscientific?  Scientists aren't supposed to be cavalier in their judgment.  Scientists are supposed to be conservative in their judgment.   First of all, let's quote Darwin himself from this book, page 75:  "To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances for adjusting the focus to different distances, for admitting different amounts of light, and for the correction of spherical and chromatic aberration, could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest degree."  There you have it, from Darwin himself, from his famous book.  Yet, today, textbooks that claim a lineage to Darwin, depict evolutionary trees of everything biological sprouting from natural selection.  Evolutionists like Robert H Hurlbutt, oppose William Paley's design argument because it makes God, not natural selection, the origin of design in the human eye.  See Hurlbutt's book, page 173, "Hume, Newton and the Design Argument."  Watson and Wilson also attacked the human eye argument in an ad hominem way without producing any argument.  But, while Hurlbutt is a typical product of academic brainwashing, which passes for education these days, how could two Nobel Prize winners of science, Watson and Wilson, make such a foolish mistake?  First of all, Watson and Wilson are crooks.  Their Nobel Prize fame for unlocking the secrets of the structure of DNA was illfounded.  Rosalind Franklin of King's college is well known to have discovered the structure of DNA and her supervisor Wilson passed it on to Watson and Crick, who, along with Wilson, took credit for it.  A little research by the Nobel Prize committee would have discovered this.  I guess the Nobel Prize really isn't worth anything when you consider how sloppy they are in giving their awards.  Einstein was given a Nobel Prize even though his papers on Brownian movement are a plagarization of Josiah Willard Gibb's book "Statistical Mechanics."  Concluding unscientific postscript: Could Darwin's "Descent of Man" have psychological origin in the fact that Darwin himself looked like a monkey 
 I use "The Notebook" and "A Walk to Remember" as optional films in my upper division sociology courses. After hearing many positive student responses, I was curious about Sparks as an author--one of the few males writing commercially successful romance novels.  After a slow start with "True Believer," I was more satisfied with "The Rescue."  Taylor's friendship with Mitch and his emotional growth add dimension to an otherwise standard tale of boy meets girl, etc., etc.,  
 I will not watch the movie "Andersonville" until they make a movie called "Elmira"(the camp in Elmira, N.Y., the worst of the Union prison camps had 35% death rate) 
 Heavy ball on bottom weighs down the curtain and the curtain comes right off the rod every time I'm stepping out of the shower - pass on this and just buy the cheap rings...you won't be sorry.   I didn't even buy these for myself, but they came in the apartment I moved into.  Quickly replaced them!  Horrible.  
 I was astonished at how flimsy the poncho turned out to be. I mean, at almost $25 invested included shipping, I was expecting better quality.   Well, it's very thin, made in China, and has plastic snaps. The so-called polyester lining just adds to the heat that's generated. I've owned many ponchos through the years, and the first thing you learn is that a poncho is a terrible design to keep out the elements for more than a short period. The reason involves the way it's cut. What I've learned is that you should buy something with some weight to the fabric so that the wind doesn't lift it up or out and allow the elements inside.  Next, you become hot and start sweating profusely in short time. So, a good lining, or a breathable system is required.  If you're just going to use it for short bursts in the rain, then you can get a cheap $10 nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere. However, if you camp a lot, or will be out in the elements, you need better. The best poncho I ever owned had a rubberized outer layer and a thin cotton liner. This solves both of the problems I mentioned, because it had the weight to stay down and had the lining to help evaporate the sweat 
 Where to begin???  This toy after setup, didn't last 15 minutes before breaking.  The ball return quit working literally after 15 minutes.  (My 2 and 6 year old were very disappointed).  The "Floor" of the bowling alley is a painted garbage bag--that is how thin the material is.  The plastic tubes running along the sides only rest in a few plastic holders that are only in place with stickers/ velcro.  Nevertheless, these tubes constantly fell apart and come undone.  There are 3 power wires running all over the game.  1 for the scorer, 1 for the ball return, and 1 for the pins---the ones for the pins and ball return don't fit into their female receptacle properly (they will hang loose and stick out about a 1/4".  The pins aren't pins.  They aren't round, they are cut in half and hollowed out.  The two bowling balls that come with this are smaller than softballs and are plastic.    I don't know what else to say, I have a 1, 2, 6, and 8 year old and have had thousands of toys.  This is the first one that I said the quality of this toy is complete garbage and I must take the time and get on the internet and figure out how to leave a review, because this toy wins the award for biggest piece of garbage ever!!!!! 
 This is cute and kitschy, but too small and overpriced. They aren't kidding around putting *mini* in the name of this item. It's way too big to make individual servings of cake with, and yet not nearly large enough to use up anywhere near one full sized cake's batter. You would need at least four or five of these to use up the typical cake's batter. For that price, you can buy a full sized bear cake pan and have money left over 
 I have the Proper Care and Feeding of husbands and I enjoyed that book.  Woman Power is full of blank pages for you to write your thoughts and ideas. I think it is a waste of time unless you just LOVE to journal.  If you took the useful information and took out the blank pages the book is about 2 chapters.  My advice is to put your money to better use at Victorias Secret.  Your husband will get a lot more out of it!! 
 I loved the movie; I hate the CD. Sadly, the music without the movie just doesn't cut it. Some of the songs don't even sound the same and there are some extra songs added in. I have wanted to order this CD forever and finally got around to doing it recently. I just lisetened to it for the first and last time. It will go out at my next garage sale. What a waste of money.  
 This pet chime was a good idea, but I am sending it back.  Sometimes the chime won't ring and at other times it rings on its own and worst of all it starts ringing and won't stop.  Clearly the manufacturer needs to work on quality control 
 I feel they should have called this movie "Punisher and Friends". Yes, I loved how they had the punisher move into his new apartment and make friends with his quirky and lovable neighbors. He even joined them for dinner, but still remembered to keep a frown on his face(he's still hell bent on vengeance you see). It was also great how the villains were able to do battle with him by simply driving to his apartment, how convenient. But what truly made this movie legend was the deeply moving dramatic performances of Rebecca Romijn, especially that scene where she is attempting to portray an actress crying near the end of the movie. I love when I feel embarrassed for an actor when they are attempting to perform. And the Popsicle torture gag was simply delightful (wink,wink,nudge,nudge). You silly punisher, even though your life has been senselessly destroyed you still know how to play a good practical joke. I was so excited to see this movie, but I was simply orgasmic when I realized how much they had watered the story down and turned it into Punisher Lite 
 Insane. That anyone would ascribe to these ideas...let alone actually trying to apply them. I've listened to the tapes, read the books, became more incensed as I went along. Yes, there are differences between the sexes, but this guy doesn't come close to getting it right, and if you're a man following his advice, then you can write off having a long-term with an intelligent woman. This fool creates "escapes" and excuses for sheer bad behaviour of some men, claiming that it's innate to the male gender,  and would suggest that their women forgive them for it! Sure, forgive them....but expect them to grow up at some point! I support equal respect for men from women, and vice versa. If I catch you flirting with other women, and expecting carnal favors rather than gently soliciting them, then supporting your bad behaviour with this garbage book, I'll shove MISTER, (not Doctor)Gray's book where the sun don't shine. For those looking for a better appraisal than mine, please google The Rebuttal From Uranus, they really capture the truth 
 I recently saw this book on the bargain bin.  This book was pure garbage, by two arrogant 20-somethings in clown suits.  Basically they are saying valuations don't matter.  Since they wrote the book, it has been prooven that their philosophy, approached over the long term, produces some great damaging losses.  The book may be useful during the next bubble, which if history serves, will occur well after these clowns pass on to the big three-ring circus in the sky.  To the dungeon with these two knaves 
 There were a number of examples in this book where the authors seem to question the truth of God's word--1: "...it might be unwise to seek to reconstruct Israel's earliest history from the stories in Genesis..." (p63) 2: "Creation is described as taking place in six days...This is not a chronological account..."(p116) 3: "Noah's story: As with creation, we should approach this account as story..."(p122)  There were others I don't have the space to mention. I personally believe that Satan is using his first and greatest ploy within this book:  "Did God really say...?" (Gen 3:1)  It is subtle, but it does cause the reader to question God's Word. As long as I'm the librarian of my church, this book will not make it to the shelves 
 This book is filled with information. Too much information in my opinion. If all the info about diet, work hazards and alcohol were true, then there would be hardly any babies born in this country! This book is very alarmist and over-reactive. It is geared toward women who are having a hard time getting pregnant, and basically uses scare tactics rather than provide helpful information about realistic ways to deal with infertility and simple things that can be done to get pregnant.   A prime example of the alarmist content of this book is the list of occupations that supposedly put a man or woman at risk of infertility. Well, people who are stockbrokers, airline pilots and police officers have children all the time! It seems unnecessary to scare readers into believing that their job, or their spouse's job is causing the infertility. I would hate for readers to feel like they needed to change careers just because they read in this book that it is not a good career for fertility! What un-useful information!! 
 This is a very lean version, with some characters being removed or merged with other characters.  Whole sections of original dialogue have been removed, or at best, changed.  Avoid this version like a robot plague 
 It was hard to like this book when the heroine was such a complete buffoon.  Clare decides the murder attempt was meant for her friend for no apparent reason. She decides the police are incompetent and unwilling to see her point of view before they even arrive on the scene. She then proceeds to investigate on her own, doing idiotic things like swimming out to an unlighted boat by herself at night to follow the person she thinks might be the murderer and breaking into someone's house because she's nosy. The whole thing was just so unbelievable and stupid that it made it hard to even care.  I hope the next installment is better.

 Barber's trenchant jargon updates slogans for class-warfare and utopian proletarian dictatorships. The rhetoric relies on emotion to bridge logical leaps, hides a distain for cause and effect relationships and sidesteps questions about human nature.  Instead, Barber carelessly brews a mix of hip buzzwords and mass marketing clich. If you read this tome, be prepared for endless repetition of 'the capitalist is dangerous, but united the people cannot be defeated':  Repeat the following 5 or 10 times and you have the book in a nutshell: "Jihad pursues a bloody politics of identity, McWorld a bloodless economics of profit. Belonging by default to McWorld, everyone is a consumer; seeking a repository for identity everyone belongs to some tribe. But no one is a citizen. Without citizens, how can there be ..." {fill in the blank with any utopian quality: justice, happiness, equality, etc.}  The central problem for 21st century Marxists is updating the logic of class struggle.  In the first half of the 19th century Marx taught a strict evolutionary progression from noble-savage to slavery, from slavery to feudalism, and from feudalism to capitalism.  Within a few years, Marx predicted, capitalism would collapse and the unavoidable socialist utopia would emerge.  Of course, the collapse didn't happen and Marxist have been rationalizing ever since.  Lenin had to add the Imperialist phase.  21st century Marxist need to show imperialism mutating into  global consumerism.   Towards this end, Barbour argues: 1. Capitalists have shed their 'nationalist' identity, finding it easier to enslave the proletariat via media manipulation. 2. Media manipulation (global consumerism) seeks to replace indigenous cultural identities with slavish loyalty to global products.   3. 'Wild Capitalism' promoting global products causes criminal damage to indigenous communities, and threatens environmental catastrophe.  4. Protecting these indigenous communities (victims) will require violence (socialist revolution).  Hidden beneath this victim-oppressor dualism lies the traditional Marxist faith in central planning or 'government by intellectuals.' Democracy can be dismissed because the 'means of communication' are held by the multinational capitalist elite.  And, Marxist don't need an elections, as intellectuals they already know what is best for everyone else. Thus, Barber spends the second half of the book describing the failures of democracy. Barber asserts that "the epoch on whose threshold we stand -- post communist, postindustrial, post national, yet sectarian, fearful, and bigoted -- is likely also to be terminally post democratic."   Time has not been kind to Barber. His 1995 predictions of post-democratic cultures has failed to materialize.  The 90s were not a decade of American decline.  Despite his attempts to be hip and techno-savvy, he entirely misses the dot com craze and  blogosphere. Further, failed to address the rise of Islamofascism.  He calls commercialism all sham, but relies entirely upon its rhetoric.  Consider the cover photo, why is the girl wearing so much makeup behind a chador?  How is she getting the Pepsi through the chador to here lips? The book has nothing to do with Islam, it is just a marketing sham about marketing shams.  In the end, it sell 'Barber, the hip international intellectual' and little else 
    Abolsutely one of the worst self-help books I have read. There isn't any structure, and it's not simplistic. The advice given is helpful but the authors then reverse the whole deal. Its like one chapter says this will be helpful, and then another chapter says it wont. It just goes all over the place and you cant really follow what the authors are trying to get at.      A book I highly reccemend for anxiety and depressive related disorders is "Feel the fear and do it anyway" Much more simplistic, easier to read and get thru. And much more cheerful.       I also dont like that these authors have seperated anxiety and depression from one another. I guess they do have a new book coming out that combines them both. It will be interesting to see if they have learned anything from their last two failures.       But for someone that wants quick and easy advice, this book is certainly not for them. I'm afraid that this book of jargon will make it more confusing. 
 I don't have academic training on philosophy argument and thus the book becomes a long and winding essay that is difficult to grasp.  You can read the first chapter from http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/7749.html and see if this is the kind of books you would like 
 I bought a pack of 3 and used twice daily in the shower to try and clear my oily skin problems.  This product left my skin dry and sometimes peeling.  Did not work for me, but it might work for you 
 I purchased this video for my sister who has disabilities but does chair aerobics at the senior center.  She enjoys exercising at an easy pace but this video is too fast for her to follow.  Even the older woman in the video looks bored or annoyed at times.  
 This books was way too overhyped.  Upon purchasing it I was greatly dissappointed.  It does give an introductory crash course in some guitar theory, but a lot of its information is half assed.  The way that scales are presented is incomplete with only partial scales and very poor explanations of how the different forms within a scale link together that I would actually consider as being wrong.  A lot of the examples and techniques explained are stupid. Who cares how to play "Louie Louie" in a bunch of different ways, but I suppose that might get you started at finding chords in more than one place on the fretboard.  Nevertheless, this book is boring and incomplete. Buy something else 
 A note of caution to those considering purchasing the Hard Press edition of "A Hero in Our Time."  I bought this edition based on the reviews that mentioned the edition as having been translated by Vlad & Dmitri Nabokov.  So I was surprised when I received the Hard Press edition (soft cover, with grayish-green panels on the top and bottom, and grey and white panels in the center; no picture on the cover, only the text of the title/author).  NOWHERE in the book does it state that it was translated by Nabokov; indeed, the book contains absolutely no translator info whatsoever, leaving the reader completely at sea in determining who translated it (despite Amazon's description that it contains a "Translator's Foreword").  Instead, the book appears more like a manuscript submitted for review, rather than a publication.  There isn't even any Library of Congress or ISBN info anywhere in the book, nor is there a publication date (usually included on one of the opening pages).  "Page 1" is completely blank (other than to say it is "Page 1"); "Page 2" consists of a table of contents, and page 3 launches straight into the author's text (despite page 2's table of contents indicating that the book starts with a "Foreward") 
 Though I love his show, this book does not seem to have the outstanding qualities I expect from Jeff Smith.  You would be better advised to purchase his "Frugal Gourmet Cooks American".  THAT one is a treasure 
 I'd love to be able to give this book a five star rating, since conceptually it is just what so many parents need to fortify their children's education.    But anyone who would call Elizabeth I "England's Greatest Queen" has a decidedly Protestant, "Whig" view of history.  Christian readers should know that "Good Queen Bess" formalized her father Henry VIII's violent separation of England from its historic ties to Christianity and made martyrs and outlaws of the realm's leading intellectual lights, e.g., Edmund Campion, William Allen, etc.  It kills me to give a project with such a noble ambition a paltry two stars, but the last thing we need is another set of history books lionizing one of history's great despots 
 I was somewhat disappointed in this book despite its endorsement by one of my business school classmates.  Professor Tichy discusses already well known principles of leadership within the context of what is promoted as a "new" approach.  Only a few individuals and companies are profiled and are used repeatedly throughout the book.  The examples cited fit awkwardly into the message that is being presented.  The title of the book attributes greatness to the individuals profiled based on only one attribute--a belief in teaching and learning.  This seems such a narrow focus on which to base such accolades 
 Totally disappointed!!! I love Woody Allen, love his films BUT - dvd-s are coded for US market and are not possible to be viewed on our European dvd -s  total waste of money you should have warned me on that  Barbara Kalas, architect from Croatia 
 This was the first book by Daniel Steel that I laid my hands on....Really could not make out how she strikes the chord with the readers. There are so many open ends in the story...chartacters are not distinctly outlined...Tremendous scope of improvement on the story is there 
 this book is poorly written and just uses pictures we've seen many times in magazines and other books. 
 It's very good, and I only give it one star because my teacher ruined it for me.  She analyzed everything Arthur Miller wrote in it, whether the lights were to be dark, or bright, how he shift time, how the instruments played, believing symbols of all of them.  Contrary to Arthur Millers own statements which I printed out and gave to the class, that he didn't plan on anything, he just wrote.  Let people do with it what they do.  In that affect, the teacher took a great play, and ruined it with her ideas of what he meant.  
 The men literally drag the women by their hair in this novel, it is beyond me how it got categorized as a romance.  The romance is virtually non-existant whereas violence is abundant.  If you're looking for brutality, rape, incest, homosexuality, and things of that nature, read this novel.   
 That is all the author did was take declassified FBI records and wrote a book. Most of which the information about WD FARD and Elijah Muhammad were contradictory. Wish I had the time to elaborate. He should be ashamed of writing such. Sad 
 I already knew before buying this movie that I wouldnt like it, atleast it comes with Phenomena wich is alot better IMO. Inferno is not one of Argento's best at all and doesent even deserve to be known as a sequel to Suspiria. I like all of his films espesially the gallio ones but this just doesent hold up to his other work. It does have all his imagination but not his style. Pick it up with Phenomena and maybe youll like it but I doubt it 
 I like the idea that Michael Lewis wrote this book/article to defend a man whose coaching techniques are clearly out of style in todays world of my child this and my child that. Having said that I did not like this book:  1) the writing was chopping and hard to follow at times. i had to re-read many sentences to understand lewis' point.   2) the story lacked the depth of lewis' other wonderful books - where's the who/why/what that lewis used to moneyball (and others) educational - i wanted the story behind the story.   3) who were all the pictures of? i found them distracting...   i'll continue to read lewis' books bu thope the next one is bette 
 With all due respect to Richard Carpenter, this collection is a disappointment. I have a very high end audio system. If he was going to remix these songs, why not get rid of all of the excess and artificial sounding reverb and clean up the vocal tracks? Why not try to create an intimate in your room sound instead of the same old, tired, re-packaged sound. The SACD track only helps alittle. The vocals still sound edgy and grainy to me and since the original tracks were analog, this was in the mix or the mastering. Next time, go for a cleaner, more intimate sound, not the same stuff we've already heard countless times 
 With all the five stars having been given this movie, I expected much more. The packaging of the DVD gives a false impression (looks nice on the outside but inside mostly repackaged old stuff.) While the historical context of gay life is worthy of perhaps four stars, the feature itself rates less. It is short at seventy-six minutes. The picture quality for this overpriced DVD is poor. The outtakes are very poor. They appear to be copied from an old worn out VHS tape with no remastering. Don't expect much from this DVD. 
 An argument in favor of book burning.  Those first positive reviews must be shills.  A complete waste of paper 
 On our beloved Kay Scarpetta and the illustrious Ms. Cornwell?  Having been an avid fan of her novels from the very beginning, I simply cannot help but ask myself....is she really writing this stuff? Very slow in the beginning, I began to fear a repeat of the struggle that I endured to finish Blowfly.  However, this novel does begin to pick up momentum...but not until the reader is halfway through, and certainly not until this author had left me sufficiently disgusted.  The storyline finds Scarpetta summoned home to the scene of the crime...Richmond, Virginia, where her previous employer seeks her assistance in unwraveling the mysterious death of a young girl.  So Scarpetta---with Marino tagging along of course---heads back to Richmond from her new home in Florida to offer assistance; only to find that her old building is being demolished...and that the new one, under the leadership of Dr. Joel Marcus, is sloppy regarding policies and procedures.  The demoralization of her former staff by Dr. Marcus is also unnerving to Scarpetta; and clearly he resents her intrusion. So why has he asked her to come? Meanwhile, Lucy, as head of The Last Precinct, is once again up to her ears in nonsense.  For such a brilliant, successful young woman (as readers have always been lead to believe), why must Cornwell insist on making her so completely stupid in her literary life?  In this tale she is once again romantically linked with a narcissistic sociopath who also happens to be her employee. Worse than the weak storyline, and the fact that this novel is just all over the place, is the author's disturbingly sterotypical portrayal of African-Americans throughout.  Drug dealers are black, they're dead of gunshot wounds, and most ludicrous of all is in one instance Cornwell references a dead young man's "conspicuously large organ."  Are you kidding me?  The trash collectors are "big dark men" and of course in an upscale neighborhood, the "old black woman" must WORK in one of the houses.  The author's unbelievably narrow-minded, stereotypical view of other races is disturbing at best, and frankly makes one think that she may just be as stupid from a common sense perspective as Lucy.  Read only if you must, but frankly there are better ways to spend your time.   DY 
 This is the perfect CD for taking a nap to. It's mostly full of slow pop and rock. If you're a fan of this type of music, I recommend this CD, but if not, don't buy it. There are only a few good tracks. All Star, Bad Reputation, I'm A Believer, Stay Home. And I don't enjoy buying a CD that only 1/3 of it is good. So, I wouldn't buy it, if I were you. 
 I usually enjoy reading EB's books as I find them insightful, humorous and easy to read in a leisurely fashion.  I've read quite a few of the reviews of this book and have a completely different take.  If I'd managed to raise two selfish, self-centered monsters who insisted their mother wait on them hand and foot, I'd be like Marion and lament going astray in parenting skills.  How anyone could have compassion for these little manipulative twits is beyond me and only wonder why Marion didn't bail sooner.  Not only are Ginny and Sharla obnoxious pieces of work, dear old dad is a major loser.  Stiff, cold, inflexible, that's dad. I'd rather hang out with Marion than any of these other characters. I'll continue to read EB's books and hope they're more believable than this offering.  
 What was Bobby Hicks thinking about when he recorded Fiddle Patch? He has ruined some good fiddling by including three vocals which would make any country music lover cringe - they are straight out of the Top Forty charts. As examples of soppy, stupid, schmaltz they excel and should never have included in an album of traditional fiddle. You have ruined this CD for us Bobby please do not do it again 
 Kuiper calls himself a reformer but he does a carefully worded job of making the Reformation look like a mistake.  According to him both Romanists and Protestants are linked by the Creeds.  He calls the Latin Vulgate "Jerome's noblest achievement".  Martin Luther attributed much of the errors in the Roman Catholic Church to Jerome and Origen, but Kuiper leaves such "tidbits" of important information out.  If you want to return to Rome and have "historical precedent" from the RC perspective for doing so, this is the book for you 
 As others have noted, very uneven audio quality - I suspect the audio was recorded on videotape, that's the way it sounds to me.  Song selection below average and performances are so-so.  As a piece of history it's nice to hear him sound so ... well, so glad to still be around and appreciative of an audience.  But he's not Mr. Ring A Ding Ding anymore, he's an old singer on his way to the lounge.  Sinatra at the Sands ... now THAT's the way to remember Francis Albert.  This album is part of a Capitol Vegas series and is an obvious attempt to wring some dough out of Sinatra fanatics and those who see it at Target (like me) and think, "What the hell ....."  EDIT: I've let this CD rest for a few months and returned to it.  Upon further review (as they say in the NFL), and in a different setting, I enjoyed the performance after all.  This time I listened in my car, and the lower fidelity helps mask the poor quality of the recording and the thinness of Frank's voice.  I was frustrated initially that his rich, deep baritone was missing, either by poor recording or Frank's condition at the time of the performance I'll never know.  But even thin Sinatra is better than most people on a really good day.  He's so darned cheerful and effusive this night, it almost gets maudlin.  He's always so careful to credit composers and arrangers of his songs.  So how ironic that after all that banter the concert just suddenly ends with a fade, I'm sure he had quite a bit to say before he left the stage.  So my earlier preference for Sinatra at the Sands still stands (where both he and the Basie band are in tip-top shape).  The band this night is pretty good but not top-shelf, like Francis himself, but as an alternate view of Frank later in life this CD, if not listened to on audiophile-level equipment, can still be satisfying.  Apparently I can't revise my star rating, so consider it raised to 3.5 
 The sound was great, but the DVD would lag every 10-15 seconds during any and all movies.  It drove me nuts. I had to return it. 
 While a wonderful story, this movie ruins it with two child actors who make the movie painful to watch.    A bit hard to understand why the child of two English parents would speak like she's from New Jersey!  I couldn't watch the end of this it was so bad.  Recommend you see another version. 
 For some reason I thought this would be a spiritual look at philosophy, life, etc.  ... a more "light", eastern-style book.  After reading just a few pages, it seemed to me to be more a way of showcasing Singer's own intellect.  I can't stomach books full of pseudo-intellectual double-speak.  Just say what you gotta say, without trying to come off so damned intellectual 
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 Sixty-four out of the 66 reviews currently up talk about THE BOOK. The product listed is THE AUDIO CD of the book. I ordered the CD set for Christmas, and it was good - up until the final, 6th CD. There, one section repeats over and over, over all 18 tracks. It's the part of Chapter 26 where Thor and Kate meet Tsuliwaensis. Each track is not identical, but the part of the book that is read, is. Needless to say, you never get to the thrilling conclusion of the book.  Amazon quickly replaced the CD set (thank you!), but the replacement set has THE IDENTICAL PROBLEM. (I apologize for appearing to shout here.) Has anyone reviewing this product actually listened to the CD from beginning to end? Are they all this way, or have I gotten two clinkers in a row?  Thank you 
 I bought this basket because it was the lowest price and cool looking. But after I say 2-3 months the basket broke in one spot near the handlebars, at a critical point. I did carry a heavy backpack in the basket. But still I think the basket is a piece of junk.  Plus the basket requires you use the hardware to connect to the fork, which limits your height of your handlebars. The basket seemed like it was badly put together and just not durable.   I can't recommend this basket. Buy a basket from your local sports authority or something.  thanks DaRealDeal 
 Love the movie, but the quality of the DVD put out by Alpha Video was so bad it was very difficult to watch. The sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up. If you don't want to be disappointed and feel like you've been ripped off, wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one 
 I remember this movie back in the 70's as being much, much funnier. I bought it. I saw it and I will never watch it again. It is in the give away pil 
 This book has some good concepts, but the majority of the text deals with the workings of the brain, neurophysiology and neuropsychology. The book is entirely mislabeled as a business/marketing book when only 10% of the overall text addresses  business, marketing or even consumer science. It is a cleverly disguised neuropsychology book 
 Frank Oski draws attention to the very real health dangers of commercial dairy products. Unfortunately, he does consumers a grave disservice by encouraging the consumption of soymilk, an alternative that is even riskier. Soymilk was rarely drunk in Asia prior to the 20th century and like other modern, nonfermented soy products has been linked to digestive distress, thyroid damage, cognitive decline, ADD/ADHD, immune system breakdown, infertility, reproductive disorders and even heart disease and cancer. Sadly, many people have seen their health seriously deteriorate because of soy milk. Children are at such risk that in July 2005 the Israeli Health Ministry issued a health advisory warning parents that they should not feed their children soyfoods or soymilk more than once per day or a maximum of three times per week.  For people who would like to explore all sides of the milk controversy, I highly recommend Ron Schmid's "The Untold Story of Milk" 
 This book has photos of some neat projects, however, there is one page of basic 'instructions' which is not helpful at all. There is no advice on selecting wood/branches, bending them, curing them, finishing/varnishing etc., nor is there instruction (except for screws and a very basic tenon on the aforementioned instruction page)on how to attach the pieces. The only 'directions' are simple illustrations of what order to put the pieces together in. A real disappointment.     
 The flagellum of the salmonella bacterium, again? This old canard from the Intelligent Design movement has been refuted, in print and online, for years (check out talkorigins.org for one of these refutations). Ditto for the mousetrap argument. Basically, Dembski hauls out the same arguments that he's always hauled out, with similar lack of effect. Throughout this book, Dembski refers to the theory of evolution as "Darwinism"--which is about as silly as calling the germ theory of disease "Pasteurism." Dembski demonstrates no real knowledge of evolutionary theory, except that it surely must be wrong.  For those with doubts about "Darwinism," I would strongly suggest the following books, which are refreshingly devoid of the kind of pseudoscientific hogwash found in this one: Richard Dawkins--The Selfish Gene and Climbing Mount Improbable Robert Wright--The Moral Animal David Buss--The Murderer Next Door (ESPECIALLY interesting) Good luck in your search for knowledge. In future, avoid "science" books written by members of think tanks. It just leads to trouble. 
 I bought this book because I love Robert Munsch's book I Love You Forever. I knew what I was ordering so it's my own fault, but I can't use this book. It's stuck up in my closet and I've never given it to the kids. I have a 6 year old and a 3 year old boy, and I have enough trouble with them talking about things that I'd rather they didn't, so I don't know why I ordered this book. I know they'd think it was funny, but the last thing I really want to do is get them talking about farts all day. I'm sorry, if your kids are more mature I'm sure it would be fine for them. But it definitly wasn't for my family 
 For the most part, I found this book to be very disappointing. I had a hard time getting through the book and didn't really feel like I learned much of anything. I also feel that the title is very misleading. I bought this book expecting to learn about about walking in the Spirit/being led by the Spirit. But this book devotes only a single chapter to those subjects. Another concern I had about this book is that I felt it wasn't biblically based. My recommendation is to skip this book. A much better book on this subject is "Grace Walk" by Steve McVe 
 I bought this CD because it said Eamon as an artist. WTH? I can't find Eamon anywhere on this CD. It says Eamon on the other one, but I'm not even going to try. Never again will a buy a CD associated with Agnus Dei.  LAST WORD: Don't buy this if your buying it for Eamon music 
 This book is very comprehensive but contains many errors, jar measurements are wrong in many cases, jars are misidentified, and prices are much higher than the market or other guides.  Photos are small and difficult to see 
 I purchased this HDTV and it worked OK for the first 10 days. After that I was unable to power the tv on or off using the remote or manually. Read that other Olevia models had experienced the same or similar issues. Called Olevia customer services to complain and was put on hold for at least 20 minutes. Save your money or put it to better use....buy a different HDTV!! 
 While this book is, at its best, interesting, it is mainly a mire of predictability and has an overpowering sermonic bent. Sister Fidelma is written as being almost superhumanly righteous. It's quite difficult to  like her. The adoration of her ethnic background is heavy-handed. The  behaviour of the characters is definitely a bit modern for the time  setting. Sister Fidelma is apparently a 17th century Catholic, but her  views really seem to differ quite strongly from the religious standard of  the day. Peter Tremayne, however, shows some promise as a writer. The book  was quite readable, just improbable, and irritating at times 
 The total absence of normative values makes for tedium, and revulsion, not for greatness.  Nor even, for that matter, for titillation.  When even father/daughter incest is treated as a matter of callous indifference, it becomes easy to see why the French are exterminating themselves, by refusing to reproduce themselves. At the fertility rate of 1.4 children per family, the French nation will be gone in another few generations. This movie will help the viewer see why.  Sociologically and philosphically interesting, in that it epitomizes the banality of evil, and demonstrates the futility of putting lipstick on a pig. Secularism is devoid of soul, and offers nothing to live for, nothing to live by. 
 I work as a therapist. In my work I have been positively influenced by the Jungian tradition, including James Hillman & Thomas Moore. I read this book hoping to gain a deeper understand the archetypal foundations of war. However I struggled to stay with Hillman. I struggled to stay with the details the horrors of war included in the book. War sickens me. I will not watch violent films or violent television. I struggle to watch war and acts of terrorism on the news. I already know. Enough is enough. My stuff... I know, but if you're like me; avoid this book. I also struggled to stay with Hillman because I am positively influenced by the inner core of Christianity. (I am also deeply critical of much of what passes for Christianity and often struggle to describe myself as Christian because of the stereotypes now associated with the word 'Christian'.) I believe that beneath the religious and cultural externals that adorn the Christian faith there exists a path; this path (eventually) leads to a unitive experience of the Divine and at the same time a grounded experience of becoming truly human. The Christ experience. One of the normal fruits of walking this path is a commitment to peace and justice: because, those who suffer in war, on both sides, are our brothers and sisters. I thus relate to the Christian contemplative tradition. For me this books great flaw is its unbalanced criticism of Christianity. On one hand Hillman rightly points out the way that sections of (cultural)Christianity have engaged in acts of war. He also rightly points to scripture's such as 'God is a God of war' that have been used to justify war. I would agree with these criticisms. However Hillman's criticism of Christianity is one sided. He assumes 'We are all psychologically Christian.' I would agree that the Western psyche is profoundly influenced by Christianity, but to me there is a world of difference between this unconscious influence and a person consciously attempting to live in the spirit of Christ. Those who are consciously attempting to live this way are usually committed peacemakers. (Take Thomas Merton and Desmond Tutu as two examples among many) Hillman ignores; both the actual teachings of Jesus regarding peace and the huge influence Christians have made, and continue to make, in the struggle to bring peace and justice. He seems to assume that all Christians are fundamentalist. They are not. It seems to me that Hillman himself is taking a fundimentalistic stance in his attack on Christianity. He becomes one sided, biased, narrow, strident. To me this is the major flaw in this book. I have given it two stars. It gets two for the way it has provoked me to think. It loses three for its simplistic bias.              
 This one will be brief. The movie is an excuse for young actors to use the "F" word and demonstrate that cannot act. The characters are cheap rip-offs of the original, which is to say one-dimensional. American Pie presents Band Camp certainly does not flesh them out. One final note: Eugene Levy- How much cash had to be thrown at your to take this one on 
 I am still waiting for my refund or replacement, as I returned this item immediately as the problem with the electrical (on/off button) were a serious safety issue.  I returned this and have heard nothing from Amazon or the manufacturer.  The power switch would give you a slight shock when touching to turn the item on or off, at first I thought it was just me, but after checking it several times my husband and I decided "two-to-go" although very convenient in thought was not worth risking electrical shock, or possible fire due to shortage.    It has been nearly a year since the item was returned and I have had no luck from anyone in regards to a refund or replacement.  
 I hadnt' read a Johanna Lindsey novel in many years and now I remember why. I picked this one up at a local library and promptly returned it a day later.   Among other complaints is the fact that I really could not like this leading man. He was too selfish. Prime example...he snuck into the heroine's bed and divested her of her virginity while she was still asleep and half drunk because he "thought" that she was giving him come hither signals. He just said the equivalent of "oops". This was at a time when a woman's virginity was the key to the rest of her life....come on  Graduate up a few levels and read Tempted by Virginia Henley for a truly remarkable historical romance set in Scotland. You will love Black Ram Douglass and get a taste of historical romance fiction for the more mature palate 
 It's NOT a good read about the WM3 case.Many mall-drifters would probably approve of this book.The title is lurid,and adds to the hype surrounding the horrorific crimes.Mostly the underbelly of Hollywood declares the innocence of the WM3.And even when i first heard about the WM3 situation,i thought it was a blatant case of 'Satanic- Panic' and that all three were probably 'innocent'.Well,after reviewing the full story and motives of all parties involved,it's clear that Damian Echols is guilty.My theory-Echols was a Xanax-dope buyer from John Mark Byers.Both knew of each other.The truck-car wash was the dope-cove for buying and dealing.MissKelley and Baldwynn were just hapless followers of Echols,and got sucked down the satanic-toilet vortex with Echols.Echols may have been involved in a 'drug-burn' with Byers.Or Echols performed 'sex-acts' with John Mark Byers.Or simply both .How could JM Byers hold down the three victims and emasculate his own step-son?How could Byers direct and watch the WM3 kill these boys,so cruelly,and remain passive?Did Byers exchange Xanax for services rendered? If solo,did Byers then calmly drive to Echols' family property,and throw the murder-weapon knife ,in the adjoining lake,without being noticed?And why would the evasive Echols draw satanic-pentagrams ,in his holding cell,in full-view of the police-guards?I would read the court transcripts for the most accurate view of Echols' feelings.He was defensive,evasive and protective about his satanic-gothic beliefs.Echols had a novice layman's education about the 'earth-religions',and was heavily influenced by the Hollywood grist-mill.So why doesn't Byers go into detail about Echols,being the main murderer?Would this not expose a drug-dealing link to Echols.Why would Byers want to befriend the three small-town outcasts,like the WM3?If anything good comes from this WM3 case,it is that the practioners of the Occult,must always use their skills for the benefit of all mankind.When an occultist uses the Wicca-craft for evil-doings,it will attack back at them ,three-fold. I think once Byers and Echols expire,then the long-sought truth will finally be elucidated from the murky darkness. Update:Nov.4.06.-I talked with a gal(a Theatre major) who was aquaited with the drug,Xanax.She informed me that large-doses of Xanax will make anyone hallucinate and raise unsettled feelings from within.The user will forget what they had done ,when affects have worn-off.So,i came to the conclusion that ,it's possible that the WM3,just don't remember any of their deeds, because of the large quanties of grounded-up Xanax they had consumed.Just like an Aztec shaman consuming a fermented agave drink to loosen them up before the temple sacrifice.           
 First off, special effects mean nothing compared to actual quality. But at least this is better than the abomination that was JAWS.  The only dinosaur movie I can think of that's worse than this is RAPTOR, which consists of parts of the three Carnosaur movies cut & pasted together.  It has some redeeming feature in that Ian Malcom and John somedoy (I forget his last name... the guy who owns the park) were actually interesting characters. I guess Steve Speilberg finally realised that monster/animal attack movies only work when you have characters people are going to give a monkey's rear end about. Unfortunately, the boring, stereotypical Alan Grant was the central character in this.  If you want to watch a Steven Spielburg movie that's actually good, watch E.T. or something. Or "The Lost World: Jurassic Park" (even though recommending a sequel may seem lame, the sequel is a million times better than this)  If you want to see a dinosaur movie, then watch either the sequel to this movie, or Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Lost World". I would also recomend the 'Carnosaur' movies but I think they're out of print.  If you want to see a movie where Sam Neill plays an interesting chracter, watch 'In the Mouth of Madness' or 'Triangle'  But definitely avoid this movie. The only reason I even own it is because it was sold in a box set with "The Lost World: Jurassic Park 
 I've begun reading this book and I was sailing with Thomas Moore real tight.  He was skillfully sailing the ship until I got to his fourth chapter where he got off into a skiff and cut the rope.  He has set me adrift in a wide sea without a moral compass.    He leads his readers into the occult and astrology. A place where a former Monk should fear to tread. While I don't mind learning about insights of the dark night through greek mythology and other lesser known personalities, I feel Mr. Moore could have served his readers better examples by using concepts and personalities from the Judeo-Christian tradition.   Mr. Moore holds too highly the concept of self and self fulfullment.  What I understood from Part Two of the book "Disturbances" is don't take responsibility for your choices.  Follow what you feel you must do in order to develop your inner self and talents even it that means to destroy and hurt your relationship with family and friends.  Jesus' idea was in losing one's self that we find out true self.   I haven't finished the book yet so I guess it's a bit unfair to write a review so soon. However, I thought I would tear through this book because the first 68 pages held so much meaning for me.  I've gotten bogged down in the middle and have picked up another book by James Finley which is an expose of Thomas Merton's thought.  Merton's Palace of Nowhere -A search for God through Awareness for the True Self.  I love this book.  What I am discovering from Merton is that the self we construct is an illusion but we need to find our true self through our search and union with God.  I believe this is the true purpose of the Dark night of the Soul which is to lead us to the realization of our need for grounding in the source of life.  I have two more books by Moore which I plan to read. Care of the Soul and The Re-enchantment of Every Day life.  So stay tune 
 This is a book which can be read rather quickly simply because there isn't much there.  As a biography, it presents very little information that cannot be found in magazine articles and interviews. Nor is its analysis of Shepard's plays very helpful. One hopes that a literary biography will cast new light both on an individual's work via an investigation of his/her life and on an individual's life via an exploration of his/her work. This book, unfortunately, comes up short on both counts 
 I found this book to be trite and simplistic.  Sure, we all wonder about the ones that got away, but seriously, spending a summer tracking them down and detailing the flirtation is pretty lame.  I definitely got the feeling this was a game of mind flirtation to ignore the larger real-time problems in her life.  
 In her first work to be translated into English, Ami Sakurai's Innocent World is a quick peek into every middle class parent's nightmare: incest, casual prostitution, rape, and the utter nihilism of today's bourgeois youth. Part document of the numbed state of teenagers in Tokyo, part manga-like read, this novella is the book for those with an interest in the underbelly of Shibuya youth culture, in particular of how young women are able to divorce their bodies from their minds in pursuit of money - and what they will do for it. The protagonist of Innocent World, Ami, is Every Young Girl in Tokyo: educated parents who send her to a private school, an absent father, a young woman lacking nothing who is utterly devoid of feeling. The only possible twist is that her older brother is retarded. She discovers that she was the product of fertility treatments that involved a sperm donor not her father (her mother did not want another child with developmental problems, for which she blamed her salaryman husband). This leads Ami in pursuit of Number 307: the man who donated his seed. On the way she prostitutes herself - perhaps out of boredom, perhaps out of resentment - and becomes physically and emotionally involved with her half-brother. A depressing if insightful read 
 I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries.  The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.  The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.    What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.  I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book, however, was truely repulsive.  I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book 
 Don't waste your time or money on this one as there are far better forensic books out there. This book was just a collection of short narratives reading more like a personal diary than any kind of scientific narrative laying out the facts of cases. I guess it lives up to its subtitle of "Life as a Forensic Anthropologist" in that she usually presents only HER part in each case with little presentation of the entire case. The forensic cases are not really the star of this book, the author is. I was frustrated with the lack of depth. Instead, read "The Body Farm" by Bill Bass. Excellent storytelling there! He gives you personal stories, but also provides all the fascinating forensic info to provide a complete picture for the cases he has investigated 
 This is a horrible movie with no redeeming value. I realize that such a knock will actually drive people to purchase this. Let me bring something to you attention.  This is a slasher movie with effective gore. In fact, for the time, the gore was more sick that similar movies. However, there are no scares, no suspense, no clever script, no story and it has a stupic ending. I know, that applies to most gore movies!  The problem with this movie is that it is overly mean spirited towards women (I am a man, a 6 foot 235 pound big strong guy that also raises a family).  The story, which has a guy killing women b/c of mistreatment from his mother, seems like it was written and directed by a person that shares the same demons as the killer of the film.    The murders in this movie are so mean-spirited (yet with no cinematic value) that a normal movie goer would have to be offended. This movie is not sick in a "good" movie way but rather sick in an ashamed manner.   This is a woman-bashing movie that should make any viewer feel guilty that they are patronizing this garbage. A movie should have an entertainment value. There is no cinematic, artistic touch on this film.  This is simply a mean, mean movie!    
 This book is proof that anyone can say anything and get it published.  The sad thing about this is that many women are going to take this to heart. It is a book obviously full of anger. It is also full of errors. An epidemiologist should have better data. It is apparent that this MAN has spent very little time in Labor and delivery and if he says he has, he did not understand what was happening around him. I don't see how any physician (he's a pediatrician), with any medical training, even outside one's own specialty can make such huge errors and errorneous conclusions. He is also an epidemiologist which tells me he's spent his life treating numbers and NOT patients.  This guy has NO insight into women's health care.I think the key word here is HE.  Perhaps somewhere in time what he says may have been true, but the obstetrician described by Mr. Wagner is a dinosaur.  Over 50% of residents in Ob-Gyn are now women. Women who would consider reading this should ask, do you really care what a man has to say about women's healthcare 
 The portrayal of the Bobo in this book, and, more importantly, the fascination and inner glee with which many will gobble up this portrayal, seem light-hearted and fun, but herein lies the reason that Dubya managed to win over the hearts and minds of good, average, working-class people everywhere. Shockingly similar to Brooks' depictions is the conversatives' and right-wing fundamentalists' portrayal of liberals and Democrats: as effete, latte-loving milquetoasts, who know little to nothing about the travails and tribulations of hard-working, ordinary folk. The resulting "cultural wars," based on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and separation of church and state, served as the perfect mask to the dark agenda that Bush and the right-wingers have planned: privatization of social security, revamping of the tax and bankruptcy codes to benefit large corporations and the ultra-wealthy, the destruction of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and the list goes on and on.  Although I will admit to having enjoyed many of the anectodes in this book, it must be pointed out that they appeal only on the basest, most superficial level, and for this I am ashamed. Diverted by all the gadgets, toys, and conveniences of modern-day living, and the incessant feed of so-called ideas from a putatively liberal media, the Bobos and the primates who poke fun at them remain blissfully oblivious to the utter economic and environmental disaster that we're headed toward.  Instead of spending your money on this book, I recommend that you sit down, find some well-written blogs, and read some (free!) critical commentary on politics and the state of our country, and then try to formulate your own ideas about our society today; in other words, THINK for yourself 
 Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, US Defense Contractors were also on the verge of collapse, that is until someone had the bright idea of privatizing the government. Current government privatization efforts have resulted in huge contracts costing the American taxpayer double and triple the cost of the original government employees. This book is a Conservative Pipe Dream, a guide to a fantasy bureaucracy that never existed, and a bomb that has totally disrupted the efficient operation and security of the Federal Government 
 This movie has too much talking and absolutely zero action, and a misusage of Christina Ricci's talent. The whole movie is Woody Allen making a tribute to himself. Allen plays one of the main characters and the rest of the actors are obviously too much in awe, or is it fear, of him to improvise on lines that would have fit if Woody Allen was saying them, but really didn't fit their characters. Much of the plot plainly doesn't make coherent sense, and all that whining is tiring and cliche. Eeeegads! The movie would have been better if Woody Allen wasn't in it, and if Ricci wasn't used to add depth to an undeniably stupid shallow character. (Rose McGowan would have played a better Amanda, incidentally.) There needs to be much more action and storytelling in this movie, than the much too much neurotic talking. What a waste of talent and time 
 Glitter was pretty on my pastries but I was under the impression it would be flavorless and it actually had a yucky aftertaste 
 I started reading the book as a part of my personal development with the company that I work for. The book is founded in behaviorism, and does not stray from the concepts associated with this worldview. My issue with it is that I believe that people are more than a reaction to the things that happen to us. We have unique personalities, and they consist of more than the conditioning that they are subjected to. This psychology takes away the idea of free-will and choice, and eliminates personal responsibility. When it comes to managing people, I believe that these are important elements to tap into. This behaviorist approach to management may look good on the surface, and make logical sense, but is flawed by its nature, and cannot have any long lasting impact 
 While this book by the long-time Sporting News editor is a excellent re-issue for its historic value, Sporting News (the new foreword is by Sporting News research director Stephen Getscher) should have taken the time to correct the numerous errors it contains.  
 This book tends to jump off topic (most aren't explained well). For example, they talk about one thing but the exercises are a bit different than the chapter's topic. Most of the information isn't fully explained. If you are in a class where the instructor assigns the exercise questions for homework, you are screwed. You may not know what to do unless you seek outside help (study guide, tutor etc.) or read beyond the chapter 
 Usually I like fantasy, comic fantasy, parodies of all sorts etc... but I simply was not able to move beyond first ten pages -and believe me, I tried! After all those good reviews...  being not able to read even half a book - this almost does not happen to me (usually I feel obliged to author to read more, before passing judgement). BORING 
 This film is pure formula - predictable and cliche filled - except for the camera loving Penelope Cruz's face it offers little. They put a partial quote from USA Today on the DVD container "Plenty of Steamy Sex". What? For a total of 10 seconds from the three scenes in the film. And where is the comedy? Classified as a romantic comedy, only a few scenes with a taxi driver are fun. The transsexual Monica (Cruz's best friend) is suppose to provide most of comedy (as Cruz has not yet shown that ability in any films that I have seen) but her role is all cliche and seldom funny. Cruz's face is gorgeous as always, but her walk down the street with a hundred guys trailing, all tantilized by her beauty - why? The cannot see her face; her ballerina background is evident with her very slender build and then add an ordinary walk.  On a positive side, they did a wonderful job presenting the music of Brazil - the soundtrack CD is worth examining if you love the film's music.  Bottom Line: I watched this film because Penelope Cruz was the starring actress. But I feel I wasted my time, I could have done my laundry.  
 Unlike most reviewers here, I really disliked this book.  The main reason is that the entire novel is a gimmick without any real substance.  There is no reason to tell such a dull story except for the fact that there is some mysterious story-within-a-story complexity.  The characters, especially the protagonist Iris, are bores.  Iris is like a 300 page wet blanket.  Most of the other characters are 1-dimensional cut outs.  Her sister Laura is the exception, but she got on my nerves too with her one-note quirkiness.  The story-within-a-story is more a gimmick than anything else.  The science-fiction meta-story within that story I thought was the most interesting part of the book, but it goes nowhere and its purpose is even more tenuous than its parent.  Finally, this is my second Atwood book, and I really dislike her writing style.  It reads as if she is trying too hard, and even the simplest situations feel forced.  I don't understand why everyone seems to like this book, but I would just suggest not to believe all the hype. 
 I am Christian, and I also have been diagnosed with depression.  When I received this book, I opened it expecting anecdotes and little things to do in my daily living to help me get through my depression.  However, the book  focuses entirely on Christianity.  Phrases such as "The person who is  depressed should ask himself what he is doing to make himself depressed.   He may discover that he is living a lifestyle that is clearly against  God."  For those to which this statement applies, the book could be  very helpful.  The authors believe that depression is some sort of mindset  that can be easily overcome, not a real disease that millions deal with  daily.  If you want tangible ways to overcome depression, beyond prayer and  an active relationship with God, then look elsewhere 
 Okay, this book was so absolutely basic that I could have written it.  I was extremely disappointed with how much I didn't learn from this book.  It is 45 pages long, so if you're expecting a good, interesting weekend read--this is not it.  There weren't any detailed case studies.  There weren't any crime scene pictures.  Just basic info on fingerprinting and skull re-construction and a little bit of this-and-that.  Extremely basic.  Recommended for the interested 11 year old, but not for anyone who wants to really learn the nitty-gritty of Forensic Anthropology 
 I agree with rigg_vienna. This film is one of the worst of all Agatha Christie movies. The version of 1981 with Sir Peter Ustinov is MUCH better, and not to forget such great actors like Dame Diana Rigg, Dame Maggie Smith or James Mason. If you want "Evil under the sun", forget the new one and buy the classic one from 1981 
  Folks, don't spend too much time in fantasy land!  While purporting to be an "insider", Robert Lomas has alienated himself from most of The Fraternity by breaking his obligation and detailing his experience of initiation.  If he's willing to break an obligation like that, just think of the crap he's willing to publish.  Fortunately, his is a gross mischaracterization of the experience and ritual varies widely in different regions.  The experience of initiation is meant to be very personal and is different for each individual - so it's a disservice for Lomas to give his interpretations to the world in this way.  One would walk away with Lomas' view of Freemasonry and not the view of 99.99% of Masons.  Suffice it to say, if you're speaking with Masons I wouldn't mention Lomas' name - you might get a weary look and be quickly labelled as an oddball.  There are plenty of other good books that are more factual and would be a better use of your time 
 I gave this only one star as I didn't actually read it. I thought I was ordering books for my grand-daughter, but it turned out to be audio tapes. I paid over $12. for it, but was only refunded $7. Extra fees were added that weren't there when I purchased.  I wrote to Amazon about not wanting a refund, but wanting the actual books, I got NO RESPONSE. I will never order from Amazon again, I am very disappointed with the way this was handled 
 Dr. Seuss, what an author - he sure ruled his day - each book that was written he always went out of his way... make a statement, some logic, someing for a kid to ponder and read... always a message for which young and old should take heed.  This wonderful man was so great at his craft sometimes even the titles made you laugh...  But as time does come - one day for all of us he left this earth - as they say ashes to dust... His legacy will live on in the hearts of so many but THIS book was printed JUST to make MONEY.  A tribute book with his unused drawings would have been so very nice but for another to TRY writing his style - ...they should have thought twice.  I read the book - I looked page by page I saw nothing of Suess in the printing they made... Let's leave our icons alone when it's their time go remembering is all we need at that time, I shoud know.  Dr. Suess, rightly so, is a hero for so many AND he always will be but this book is a disgrace to his memory for me. 
 There are many interesting memoirs out there...I did not enjoy this book.  This might be of use for people that have problem children, but no thanks 
 This is the kind of information my therapist of 4 years spewed...then I found one who offered practical guidework and here I am...a healed child. 
 This is just like Cup Noodles without the noodles.  Eek 
 More mind numbing Christian apologetics.  Comparable with the ideological propaganda disseminated by McDowell and Strobel.  If your intellectual capacity is very limited, then you might find this book compelling 
 The Shining remake was Casablanca compared to this drivel crap. Do not watch this movie. If you are a hardcore fan of the original Salem's Lot, you will suffer. This film is as bad as the unecessary sequel Return to Salem's Lot. Ther shoud be a zero star option for this film 
 There is no one experience that could somehow describe them all. I didn't find the book very interesting, nor would I recommend it as reading for those who are going to go on the JET Programme sometime in the future. In fact, I recommend you read very little of the 'foreigner does Japan' genre and stick with facts, figures and Japanese language. And basics of English language teaching. Believe me, you will enjoy your 1-3 years in isolation and miscommunication without your head full of pop-anthropological nonsense and you will come to know your full self 
 I liked this when it first came out b/c I was 16. I was a rebel, wanted to be part of something different. This is their best work since the weirdness does get lame after a while.  Favorite song is Mongoloid...totally strange but rocking song. "Uncontrollable Urge" rocks (in a weird way) and Come Back Johnny is almost a conventional song. Satisfaction is completely unique but its not a good song.  The group was obviously trying to do more than music and develop a KISS, multi media, making money kind of thing.  I saw them live (they were horrible) during their hey day. The most interesting thing about them is while other odd bands were eventually accepted and integrated into the mainstream, DEVO is still as odd of a group as ever. Mark Motherbough does a lot of soundtrack work (Rugrats) and you can hear the DEVO in all of his work.  Anybody that gives this novelty group 5 stars is cheapening what true excellent music is. DEVO came out as a Goof, not as serious musicians. They got big in the 70's b/c they were part of the new wave and kids (like me) were looking for alternative music that we can claim our own. 
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 It has some funny moments but it's certainly not Pratchett's best. As crazy and sometimes corrupt Hollywood is it's not the sort of industry where Cthulu would be comfortable. The combination just doesn't make sense. And then there's the talking dog. On about every fifth page Pratchett stops the plot (what little of one there is) to do yet another talking dog joke 
 While Microsoft tries very hard to make Office "think ahead of me," they almost always seem to get it wrong.  The result is a package that consistently annoys me.  It is true that one can turn off the "helpful" hints and otherwise customize the programs so that they are less hindering, however the bloated package will nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody's business.  In my opinion, Office '97 was an excellent package, and the versions since then have gone steadily downhill.  As with many people, I use Office at work because I have no choice.  At home I've had good luck with StarOffice from Sun.  While not perfect, StarOffice has read and created files compatible with Microsoft Office very consistently in my experience, and it's a whole lot less expensive.  I am therefore hesitant to recommend Microsoft Office Professional Edtition 2003 to anyone except those who need the most advanced functions of Excel and/or need to use Access database frequently.     
 MASH is my all time favourite show. As such, I am one of those that bought each season as it came out. I bought mine at a store though and each of mine cost $35 so that's $350 invested so far. When I went looking for season 11, this is what I saw and I still can't believe the absolute disregard Fox must feel for its customers. This is seriously one of the most inconsiderate things I've ever seen a media company do. Those of us buying the seasons as they come out provide the MASH franchise with a revenue stream. To be this unappreciative of that revenue for the past several years is unfathomable to me.  What makes it worse is that there was a very simple solution. All Fox had to do was put a voucher in the regular season 11 box. Send $14.95 and a proof of purchase and receive the bonus features. Simple and plain.  So Fox, if you're paying attention, why should I buy other Fox shows as they are released? By doing this, you have completely eroded my interest in buying Simpsons and other shows since I'm obviously going to be stuck with several shelf-space stealers and no reasonable way to obtain the difference between those and the grand finale box set. Make amends and all will be forgiven, ignore us loyal customers and find there are fewer of us than you would like.  PS. And, no, this isn't whining. This is a vocal objection to being swindled 
 I enjoy the Hillerman Navajo mysteries because the characters are well developed. Not so in this book. I found the first half really boring and hard to get through. The characters were not people you could care about, an important issue for me 
 This complete waste of 90 minutes is probably the strongest contender ever for a lone-star movie.  With cringingly awful acting, laughable special effects (the ridiculous head in a bucket is a real guffaw moment), appalling dubbed dialogue, cheesy music, inconsistent and confusing plot and no tension or atmosphere, The Grim Reaper is a total disaster.   Don't waste your money on this turkey. 
 This movie falls into a strange gray area.  Absolutely horrid.  A fetid pile of cinematic mediocrity that doesn't even deserve the effort to pull it out of the dumpster.  ...and yet, it's not bad in the right way to be entertainingly bad.  
 I believe that the "EP" has some great moments like "Here Comes the Summer," which recalls Bowie. But this album is trash. They have good ideas that are promptly DESTROYED with layer upon layer of out-of-place synth skronk that sounds more like bad carnival music than anything else. Way to go, Fiery Furnaces. You managed to create an album that is a prospect for worst album ever recorded. Don't believe the raves from Pitchfork. Spare yourselves. For the love of god 
 It is my general policy not to write a negative review of a book. As an author, I try to support other writers and not tear them down. However, I occasionally make an exception, and Troll is one of them. I decided to write this after I committed to reviewing all the short-listed Gaylactic Spectrum Award nominees for Best Novel, and because I have yet to read or hear anything negative about this book. I think it's time another point of view is heard.  First published in Finland where it won the coveted Finlandia Prize for best novel, and then translated into English, Troll has received almost nothing but praise. The book came to me highly recommended, but I simply hated it. My first challenge was the writing. The style is simple and direct, almost too simple at times. It's also written in the present tense, an unusual choice and, for many readers, rather disconcerting. It's not an easy book to get into. The highlight for me was the alternating chapters that were "taken" from various resources on trolls. The encyclopedia and book entries were so well-written that you almost believed that trolls could be real. If only the actual story was that compelling.  I found the story itself to be extremely disturbing. The author goes out of her way early in the book to establish that Pessi is a wild animal on a par with a gorilla, and a juvenile animal at that. When the mounting sexual attraction culminates in a sex scene of sorts, I wanted to throw the book across the room and wash my eyes out with soap. In the end, the author tries to challenge your thoughts on what is culturally acceptable and warn you against making pre-judgments, but I thought the attempt was clumsy at best. Even if you assume that trolls are the equivalent of humans and therefore Angel is not into bestiality, he would still be a [...] since it was well-established that Pessi is immature, barely more than a toddler from the descriptions. Other readers have addressed none of these issues, so I can only assume that they only bothered me.   There is no doubt that this is an unusual and original book, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is good 
 The Dead's popularity has eluded and confounded me for decades. Lots of folks I like and respect love the band, such has Village Voice critic Robert Christgau, and it was because of his Consumer Guide review that I gave this live album a listen. But like wow man. The fact that nobody in the band can carry a tune or that the lyrics are bereft of a single coherent thought, pales next to the realization that the muscianship is one long guitar(s) noodle with background drumming that seems to be following its own talentless path. It's like bad jazz played by deaf people. The audience, when you can hear them, sound stoned...which is apparantly the only way one can appreciate this music. Around this same time or a little after, CCR recorded a song called "Ramble Tamble" that outjams, rocks, and otherwise destroys anything on this disc. And they do it in seven minutes! The evidence on this record confirms my belief that, along with The Doors, The Grateful Dead are the most overrated rock band of the period. All you young ones that don't know any better, stick with the Stones and The Velvet Underground. You'll be better off 
 I've always been disappointed with this album. The good songs are really hurt by bad production, and not every song is good. (Maybe "Martian Landscape" was a good idea in the seventies, but....no, it wasn't. It's horrible). The best songs here are in much better form on The Live Album, and a couple of the songs aren't good at all. That leaves few reasons to get this: "Highway Lady" is a fair song which probably would have been great with some production. "Belladonna" is a standout ballad. "On With the Action" is the best cut here: a crushing (but slightly bigoted) burner. There's not a track here that doesn't have something wrong with it. To hear what these songs sound like with their full energy unleashed, get "Strangers in the Night". To hear how good these guys could sound with a producer who understands them, get "Force It" and "No Place to Run" 
 You're kidding, right? The only good film in the trilogy is the origonal. How dare you try to continue the story of something that cannot be continued. The orgional was good enough. Leave it there. Just because you want money, don't ruin such wonderfull entertainment.  I didn't even stay awake through all of the movie, it was so bad! I'd rather watch Barney with my 2-year-old 
 This CD should come with a warning label: not fit for mature / discreet listening audiences. Listening to this bloody dreadful CD could be hazardous to your ears. In case anyone hasn't noticed Rod has changed careers before our very eyes. He's retired from being a legendary artist to corporate sales rep( checkout the CD cover,it resembles an employee ID badge ). He's obviously opted to trade his artistic collateral to enhance the corporate bottom line.Elvis had Col. Parker and Rod has Col. Clive. My only hope is Woody and the lads can stage an intervention and get Rod into RnR artist recovery program. Someone has to successfully curb his dependency for recording every published song in America. Does Rod really want to join the ranks of Frank Sinatra jr. and company.Rumours abound on the east coast,that Rod's next project is recording all of Elvis Presley's soundtrack music 1963-69.There's also talk on the street that a box set, American Songbook vol.6-66,the Lost Recordings, are being scheduled for a 2007 holiday release.Finally,have you noticed on the web sites that various studio musicians are claiming they don't recall participating in this recording even though they're listed on the CD sleeve? 
 As several other reviewers have noted, this book is very deceptive.  I bought it on the spur of the moment, based on its title.  However, I soon discovered that 90% of the book is about the author's recuperation after a near-fatal auto accident.  His acccount of heaven is not only brief, but highly repetitive.  The same thing is said over and over, sometimes it's said in a different way and other times almost the same words are used.  Obviously it's done as a "filler", to make up for the lack of substance and to add to the number of pages about Heaven.  It's not at all convincing that Piper was clinically dead for 90 minutes. He says he was, based on what EMTs said on the scene.  But it sounds like the medical personnel came to that conclusion based on the severity of the accident as opposed to actual tests.  It's also very possible he was alive for the 90 minutes in question.  His description of Heaven borders on the fanciful....streets paved with gold, iridesent pearly gates, etc.  I suspect he experienced Heaven more or less as he would have expected, given his background as a fundamentalist minister.  Had he been of a different faith, I would bet his report would have been quite different.  This entire book could have been condensed for a publication like Readers Digest.  At least there would have been other articles and features to justify its purchase 
 I had to read this book in english class this year and it was absolutely horrid. The jokes weren't funny and the story was just stupid. Also, if you actually like the book, don't buy this edition because it falls apart. The book is about the battle of the sexes and it's stupid, pointless and boring. On top of it, you'll be really confused at times because of the old english. It's not a fun read more like a frustrating read. This is definitely one of my least favorite books of all time. 
 This series which presumptuously celebrates and brags about the sodomite lifestyle, feminism and the destruction of the nuclear, traditional family is one of the worst, most inexcusably heinous shows currently disgracing the TV landscape--although that isn't saying much since the ruinous, liberal ideology has for the longest time monopolized pop culture. This Desperate Housewives series is rebukable on several, equally critical fronts. The first and most infamous is by far its moral vileness;  the second is its horrid status as a mouthpiece for incriminatingly liberal "values"; the third is its low class cast of monotonous, expressionless actors; and the fourth is its either appallingly repetitive plot twists or its idiotically ludicrous tangents it goes off on when it needs to "freshen" its stale storyline.  At the first season's start, the viewer is mistreated to the basic concept: Mary Alice commits suicide, and this sets off the looming, boring storyline about the other four, remaining housewives "intellectually" attempting to solve her death for the rest of the season. At this point, the traditional and moderate American has already been subordinated to the liberal culture war where a family is left motherless with the death of Mary Alice. Liberals love to assault the traditional family with all their sick, "alternative" debaucheries, and the show endorses this through the removal of Mary Alice (mother) from her family, where we only have a dad/son left. Later on, the assault on the traditional family is worsened when the noble concept of adoption is attacked as the real mother of Mary Alice's son is revealed to have been killed by her adoptive parents, Mary Alice and Paul Young.  This show is nothing but a disguise of an assault on the traditional family. Other families include the divorcee (Teri Hatcher) whose husband is blamed for the infidelity that ruined their marriage; flagrantly, feminism is viciously alive on this show as hatred is directed to men. Another is the Van de Kamp family which egregiously loathes itself since the parents are trapped in an apparently loveless marriage, while one kid is a flaming, budding sodomite and the other is an uncontrollable villain. The next family involves the Felicity Huffman character whose troubles raising her purportedly ADD/hyperactive children derogates the concept of raising kids. The dislike towards the male gender is furthered as her husband comes home to be a demeaning, stay-at-home dad since his wife gets the bigger paycheck--an abnormality which rarely if ever happens in real life!!!! The last family is the most accursed as this depraved show celebrates pedophilia, through the Eva Longoria character preying on the high-school kid (John), and also infidelity while she rapes him.  By the rock-solid and sentencing examples above, it's clear that the incorrigible theme of Desperate Housewives is the single-minded and malevolent attack and belittlement of the traditional family. This cannot be defied; only if you're a moral relativist who practices PC can you excuse this mischievous show as something that merely serves as entertainment. The culprit for the mercilessly dissolute topics of unwholesomeness is the creator of the show, one Marc Cherry. Cherry is a shamelessly, openly gay sodomite, and his "alternative" (read: irreligious) lifestyle choices are egregiously what influence him to slant the show in such morally bankrupt misdirection.  Using basic common sense, we see Cherry's sodomite lifestyle influencing all the show's plot twists, as Cherry likely harbors much, personal resentment towards the traditional family, which likely but rightly shunned his choice of an unorthodox, sodomite lifestyle. When Cherry manufactures these scripts about Bree Van De Kamp's son being a closet homosexual who rebels, this blatantly is about Cherry's own, frustrated childhood. When Cherry writes about all the marriages breaking up, this is merely his thinly veiled bitterness at marriage being protected from sodomite unions recognized legally.  To boot, this show's acting by the four, enormously over-the-hill and washed-up fortysomethings is just unpardonable. Hatcher acts like the ditzy buffoon; Longoria is the slutty tramp; Cross is the pasty-skinned robot with no emotion; Sheridan desperately shows off her forty-plus body; and Huffman acts like the frumpy housewife. Their "performances" (read: monotonous impersonations of people) are repetitive and abnormally rehearsed.  In conclusion, Desperate Housewives is one of the worst, most irreparable shows to come out of un-American and liberal Hollywood in years. It--under the moral relativist-guise of entertainment--unaccountably celebrates profanity and misconduct to the extreme, and it attacks one of Judeo-Christian America's most revered institutions: the traditional family. The show is a ghastly train wreck which relies dependently on one crazy plot twist after another to keep the viewer lured because it cannot do so based on storyline, character development and interest alone. One severely suspects that it was created merely to scornfully give some bored, lonely housewives hypothetical situations which they will never find themselves in to alleviate their stay-at-home monotony. 
 generally a big fan of Cara Black but this latest is a big mound of material searching for a decent editor. Even for a big fan its a slog. I think that there is a fine book buried in the text but whomever is claiming to be the editor of this book should be fired - it's a mess.  Second Draft (maybe) but ready for publication it is not!  
 I have been a fan of Dean Koontz for many years, but I stopped reading his new novels about 6 years ago, because after awhile, it seemed as if all of his characters were the same. I recently read the back cover of this book, and it sounded so interesting, so I gave it a chance. Boy, was I sorry. It is as if Dean Koontz regressed to a first year creative writing student! His sentences are awkward, mostly out of an insane desire to use as many adjectives and adverbs as he can - it is as if he wrote the book with a thesaurus by his side. This was way too distracting, and it really diminished what otherwise could have been an entertaining tale.  Please Dean, take an opportunity to read some 'how-to' books on writing 
 The second tape does not move backwards or forwards. I am very diappointed 
 Too bad there isn't a 0 star rating. This was simply awful.  I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years - waded though a lot of her semi-readable stuff - waiting for another decent installment.  But I give up.  No more Kaye Scarpetta for me.  This book cured me - for good 
 Why is this? Why are Arabic instruction books sooooo atrocious? There is sufficient demand for Arabic now and sufficient research in language education to come up with something better. What a sad testament that Al Kitaab is actually the standard in university-level Arabic instruction! It makes me want to rip my hair out. Somebody, anybody, PLEASE publish a decent Arabic instruction text. And, for all you publishers out there doing colloquial Arabic: EGYPTIAN!!  A third of all Arabs are Egyptian and it's the only dialect universally understood by other Arabs. So please quit with all the Lebanese, Saudi, Iraqi, Jordnaian colluquial courses until there is a decent Egyptian course available 
 This music is a rip off. All is borrowed to the 4 first albums of Marc Bolan playing under the name of Tyranosaurus Rex. Something more bluesy here and there but nothing allowing to give any credit to this guy.  A shame 
 I have had nothing but problems with this book.  The practice problems in the chapter do not reflect the ones at the end of the chapter, which pretty much leaves it up to you to figure out what is going on.  The chapters are not well written in the first place!  Very hard to follow!  There is no supplemental solution manual to follow along with so you can see how the practice problems were solved.  I could go on and on.  In general, possibly the worst chemistry text I have ever had to use 
 The Q&A approach adopted in this book is very useful.  It would provide for a very useful reference manual on M&A if its content were not so dated.  Its discussion of taxes, accounting, and deal structures does not reflect recent changes in rules and M&A practices.  It would be helpful if the author would update the material. Other more current and more comprehensive books on the subject that I have found useful include Mergers, Acquisitions, and Other Restructuring activities by Depamphilis and Bruner's M&A book 
 Though most of Ballard's work contains unvarying plots, motifs, characters, etc., I was quite stunned to find that `Super Cannes' and `Cocaine Nights' are - albeit with minor tweaks and variations - actually one and the same book.  From the backdrops to the manic idiosyncrasies of the characters, the key components in each enjoy such thorough correspondences and identity that a synopsis of one book effectively adumbrates the other.  It seems Ballard's technique of thematic reiteration and repetition has achieved such perfection as to suggest that an author has finally (and remarkably) cloned his own work and slipped it over the transom.  Read both books if you wish to scrutinize the sublime homogeneity of Ballard's imagination. Or pick one or the other, and feel satisfied that you've economized on money and time 
 I proceeded to open the container then pour it all over myself, in front of my girlfriend. Imagine my embarassment with poweder all over myself.  Needless to say the evening did not go as planned.  Though I did take a bath, and the water did taste an awfully lot like milk.  My fault though, for thinking the company was Nido Powde 
 This thing doesn't hold a charge for very long and anything with weight gets left behind. They need to do more work on this idea 
 Amartya Sen is a serious economist, who has some serious ideas, but they are not in this book.  The book purports to be an philosophical/economic argument for "freedom now" as both the means and the goal of economic and social policy, and an argument against the postponement of "freedom" until after "purely" economic development has occurred.    Freedom, Sen claims -and not merely wealth or the rule of law- is the best vehicle to promote...well...freedom itself.  If this reasoning sounds circular to you, you are not alone.  On one interpretation, this strikes me as trivially true.  Sure: promote freedom and you will indeed get freedom.  If, on the other hand, Sen is stating that freedom is "the solution" to global poverty, his thesis is dubious at best.  And this is especially so because Sen's book is NOT really a polemic against Confucian statism (i.e. the "Lee thesis"), it is a polemic against economic liberalism.  Lee is just a straw man used to advance Sen's more fundamental claim: that freedom -properly understood- is actually what he refers to as "capability."  In other words: freedom is not merely the absence of external constraints, but the capability to accomplish things in the world.  This is NOT "Development as Freedom" but rather "Freedom as Capability."  And this is where Sen really loses me.  Even IF "capability" is a quantifiable, measureable, controllable, predictable variable that can be maximized (extremely dubious, since the list of possible verbs of which one can be capable is practically infinite), this argument is nothing even remotely new.  Sen's allegedly groundbreaking discovery is simply the modern incarnation of Isaiah Berlin's "positive freedom," FDR's "freedom from want," and the other muddled reinventions of the concept of "freedom" which together date back to the early Counter-Enlightenment.    These ideas sound like doublethink because they are doublethink.  Public health care and make-work jobs simply do not leap to mind when one thinks of "freedom" - if they did, there would be no need for this book.  The conceptual epitome of "freedom" is one's release from prison.  That's not the necessarily the "capability" to do anything.  If we want to discuss welfare economics, on the other hand, that's fine -- but let's not confuse our students by misappropriating the language of liberty.  But I am not deterred from this work merely by the fact that I disagree with Sen's thesis.  In the end, I am turned off by the massive acclaim this book has recieved, despite its glaring intellectual mushiness.  Sen has supplanted Marx as the English professor's favorite economist, distracting attention from those thinkers whose ideas might actually make a modest difference in combating global poverty 
 Gosh....., where can I start, I buy it combine with Complete Epic Series, I found it no much diffrent.  CES also have this episode.  Amazon should advice the customer clearly pertaining this matter before the customer buy it.  Now I'm facing difficult to sell it back to amazon due to the locality of my country (Malaysia) and its very difficult to find fans of BSG (old version) in my country in order to sold it off.  So should there any BSG fans in my country who read this, I'm willing to sell it around RM30.00 (very good condition)   I can be reach at : 019-756740 
 Yogananda's message is potentially world changing.  However, I got more out of the Autobiography of a Yogi published by Self-Realization Fellowship because it was full of added footnotes which I found just as important and meaningful as the text.  Many explaining the essential oneness of western and eastern religions through biblical passages, etc 
 Full of misquotes, untruths and gossip this book adds no new information on Tibet, but rather glosses over the tremendous devastation created by  China in Tibet.   How does anyone rationalize the murder, directly and  indirectly, of more than one million Tibetans by the Chinese 
 This "documentary" is a blatant attempt to contribute to and fester the 'myth' of Henry Darger, a reclusive, backward man who concocted a trite and repetitive story (18,000 pages) filled with extreme inconsistencies (his "Christian" army is involved in bloody warfare - tenets of Christ were those of a pacifist, etc) and sadomasochistic tendencies.  It seems he lived in his own sullied world, formed mostly by an extreme fascination with children and the sufferings of Christ (he had upon his wall 13,000 representations of crucifixes).  His landlords found his room after he died, stuffed with inumerable articles of junk, stacks of wet papers, hairballs, empty bottles and yet, being artists and entrepreneurs themselves, they hatched a theme to create Henry Darger as a genius of 'outsider art', their attempts succeeded, Darger's immature works, mostly traced drawings, slapped on with some vivid color schemata, in every sense lacking any cohesive aesthetic, have sold for millions now.    The room itself was photographed, cataloged and inducted into the 'folk art' hall of fame.  Darger was seemingly a lunatic, at odds with his warped Christian conditioning and society itself, he would hide in his room for hours on end, lusting after children and cut out articles and trace faces onto pieces of toilet paper (he was poor).  There's no doubt that he holds some fascination for us, mainly because of his weirdness but eventually even that is usurped by the painstaking tediousness and forcefulness of accepting such unworthy levels of art into our consciousness, as this documentary begs us to do.    Since he is dead, he can not speak for himself, and thus, his 'myth' is assurred, bringing the curious to worship at his feet and sell his works for staggering prices 
 I found the book mostly entertaining until the end. I was very disappointed by the convoluted story, and things were not explained very well at the end. I loved all her other books, but this one was horrible. I found it much more violent and disturbing than previous books, too. The stupid DID ending came out of nowhere and made no sense (maybe she has been watching too much One Life to Live). There were too many characters, too many plot threads, too many murders, and it was not tied together very well.  I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  I sure hope her next one is better 
 Just plain common sense. There wasn't profound thought through out the whole book.  I finished in thirty minutes 
 The book basically covers three subjects.  First, a political and historical background of Iraq and Saddam - Excellent.  Besides the history primer, Mr. Keegan also has some thought provoking, if negative,  remarks about Islam (or at least some of its variants) which I may research later.      Second, the events leading to the second gulf war - Poor at best.  I agree that Saddam had to go, preferably sooner than later.  Failing any political progress, war was a likely outcome.  Having terrorized his citizens, started two major wars and having a record of NBC/WMD weapons research he wasn't someone anyone felt comfortable having around.  The UN embargo wasn't working and medical/food shortages were killing up to 50.000 civilians a year, according to some pre-war estimates.  Mr. Keegan jumps firmly, but clumsily, into the pro-war bandwagon.  The issue of missing WMD is never really addressed very well.  Did the Western intelligence agencies really drop the ball?  Or did the US and the UK lie to their citizens in order to drum up support for an unpopular military intervention?  If it wasn't a lie, could the intelligence agencies have done any better?  If not, what lessons to learn from that?  His characterization of opponents to the war is lame.  Mr. Chirac?  "A braggart".  Europeans? "idealistic Olympians who do not recognize the need for force".  And so on...  Now, I dislike Chirac myself. But a skilled author owes his readers some balance and, especially, more justifications.  The French do have a long and shameful history in Iraq.  Selling weapons.  Having their defence minister, Jean-Pierre Chevenement, refer to Saddam as "a new Napoleon" (which is praise, in France at least) after 1988.  Looking happily to the end of sanctions to sell more stuff in an area without US competition.  Given all that, France deserves criticism, but Mr. Keegan doesn't bother to argue his case by mentioning any of it.  The BBC also gets nailed for its "biased coverage", again without any arguments to support that position.  Personally, I rather liked their coverage and thought its bias less visible than Keegan's.  And, no, I don't think that hoping for a future without wars is silly.  It might not work out, and sometimes (Rwanda, Kosovo, Bosnia) it is better to go to war after all.  It is necessary to resist dictatorships such as Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, North Korea.  But you can't fault pacifism as being only for silly idealists.  It has, for now, all but stopped wars among Western nations and it has instilled a healthy distrust of "colonial interventions" by most of those nations' citizens.   Third - the war itself - Not all that great.  There is some high level analysis of what units were moving where, and what they did.  Some coverage of local action, plenty of other interesting stuff.  Keegan is in in element here.    What there isn't is any interviews of Iraqis.  Or any detailed info on Iraqi activity during the war. No Iraqi is mentioned by name outside the usual suspects covered by CNN.  Everything is from the Allies' viewpoint.  I don't blame Mr. Keegan for staying out of Iraq right now.  But it makes you wish that the book was written ten years from now, with Keegan having been able to do his usual world class research.  Nor is there any analysis of how the US should face the Iraq insurgency, despite the 2005 addition to the book.  With current events being what they are, we need people like Mr. Keegan to reinvent themselves as analysts of low-level, guerilla warfare, terrorism, etc...    But this book is more informative about the perils of writing history books too soon, before the facts emerge fully 
 I find this book very difficult to read and probably will not finish it. The subject matter and the reviews fascinated me, but the actual reading of the book is very hard work.  This is not  like reading something by Richard Dawkins or Stephen Jay Gould.   This is like reading a college text book.  People sometimes believe that because a book is hard to read and understand that the author is expressing deep and complex ideas. Sometimes that may be true, but it is more often true that the author is just not that good at expressing himself in an easy to understand way.  Obviously I am in the minority here, because most of the other reviews gave this book 5 stars.  It was some of the other  reviews that caused me to buy the book, but the truth is that I  got more from reading the reviews than I have gotten from the  book so far 
 This play caused a great controversial stir when it was first performed in 1965. This is supposed to be a classic example of an existentialist and absurdist play. It was Pinter's first stage play and the one that made his reputation. Although it was very daring and shocking in 1965, the play has aged and lost its freshness and original power, in my opinion. There are many other portrayals of dysfunctional families that have retained their freshness and power--such families have been a mainstay of drama from the time of the ancient Greeks. Shakespeare and even fairy tales have built themselves around exploring the dark and abusive aspects of the family dynamic. So Pinter's on to nothing new or radical here. The script as such is blatantly misogynist. The one female role, Ruth, has no lines that sound human--she comes across as a stilted android. Ruth is so obviously not a real woman but a male projection of lust, fear, possession, hate, and paranoia. I recently saw this play performed in Manchester, UK, and have to wonder why people still think this play, with all its misogynist posturing, is relevant to a contemporary audience. If it were just a black absurd comedy, it might have worked better for me, but Pinter seems to be aiming at something deeper and more menacing yet can't seem to make up his mind if we're supposed to be feeling sympathy with his characters or taking them (and the underlying meaning of the play) seriously or not 
 If you are looking for fun books to read to your 3-8 year olds, read the many books by Carolyn Haywood, beginning with "B is for Betsy."  While Junie B. Jones books may have good endings, why teach your kids that her behavior is "normal"?  It isn't, and these are not the kind of stories I want in my children's precious minds.  These books are so popular with public school educators it is yet another reason I am considering homeschooling.   Parents, as Evangeline Johnson would say, "Guard your child's brain space!"   
 The authors spend so much space on extended examples that they make the basics difficult to find.  The odd appearance of conditionals is, for instance, the most surprising thing about bash, at least for csh users; their explanation of it is separated by several pages from the main discussion 
 I have never read an Iris Johansen book that I didn't like...until this one. The characters were never developed and were unbelievable. Sophie is supposedly a genius researcher and a doctor. MacDuff is a Scottish laird who's background we never learn about. Two gorgeous killers who we're supposed to empathize with. The list goes on.   I forced my way through the book, what a waste of time. I'll think twice before I read another one. Hopefully this was an anomoly 
 Nothing innovative or exciting. Anyone who does not know this stuff should not be in business or in a leadership positio 
 I bought this machine after researching it for a long time.  I could deal with the hard cleaning of it, I was willing to shell out $100.00 for a good quality maker, and I loved the design.  After two or three uses it started to leak.  After much searching I realized the caraf itself was leaking into the electronics and causing it to short.  I paid too much and do not like the fact that it broke so quickly. I didn't return it, I just will NEVER buy bodum again 
 i ordered this item 5 months ago was told by amazon that i would get this item and it was avaliable and then after 5 months they tell me that they cant get it and it is still avaliable on there web site as far as im concerned amazon is not worth shopping if they cant hold there promises and say it is avaliable please take this very seriously when ordering from amazon thank 
 This terrible unit damaged may carpeting. Even though I had placed it in a tray, still a half gallon water was leaked on my carpet 
 I had never read a Danielle Steel book before, and decided to give her a try, given that she is so popular and has so many books published. I was pretty disappointed. I agree with the other reviewers that the plot is unrealistic; however, if a book is unrealistic but well-written and engaging, I would still like it. I think the biggest problem with this book is the author's excessive repetitiveness. Yes, I get that this character is really cold and unloving---that was already covered 50 pages ago! In addition, character traits could have been better conveyed through situations, rather than simply stating, "so and so was a devoted mother" and repeating this fact again and again and again. These flaws in the author's writing kept me skipping through whole sections of the book. This book did not leave me wanting to read more of Ms. Steel's books. It is an ok book if you like romance and very easy, repetitive reading. 
 Adirondack chair plan doesn't give sufficient information. After I cut all of the wood as instructed, found out that there are no measurements given for placement of key parts. Obviously this book was never shop tested. Do not buy this book 
 Not comfortable.  The "thong" between your toes is too thick and too tight.  If you are looking for toeless, this is not the way to go.  Try DKNY hosiery instead.  Expensive, but worth it for the comfort factor and they are very durable

 Don't buy this.  It doesn't work.  The ink is not even at all if and when you can get it on the stamp.  I've attempted around 50 stamps (on some range balls) and not one is crisp and clear.  The stamp is either running (too much ink), or the middle letter is messed up from too little ink.  Save your money, buy a sharpie pen and mark your balls with that 
 I bought the book for my girlfriend, but found myself without a book to read. I expected to find a nice account of a start-up (I love those kinds of books). I couldn't get past the 2nd chapter. The sugary sweet telling of what MIGHT be a true story; the silly and unrealistic situations; and the contrived dialogue, which I can't imagine coming out or a real person's mouth, forced me to put this down If you are a 14 year old girl you might be drawn to the story, but if you are looking for an business account of how the three dog bakery was started this won't be for you 
 I purchased this book looking for information on specific methods of financing my pre-startup with little of my own money.  I read the book in it's entirety and here is what it is:  A wonderful personal story of winning and losing in business.  It shows that creativity can be used to overcome lack of cash, but gives few useful ideas.  Like I said, it's just a nice story, not a business resource 
 This book is not worth your money; I wish I hadn't paid full price. I was expecting some fun, some chills, some scares and it really only gave me goosebumps thinking of the fact that I paid for this when I could have gotten something better to read for the price I paid.   Don't get me wrong it had some scary moments but was overall it was a flop. Much of it was boring - especially the flashbacks which went on for chapters. The ending felt forced and rushed.   And oh man did the women in the book run around naked a lot. C'mon even when you are being pursued by a madman you cover up! I don't want to speak ill of the dead (I read that Richard Laymon has died) but this just seemed like a weird fantasy playing out for him - all the naked and lesbian-suggestive moments.    Save your money. 
 I'm a long time fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries, and have read all the others. Unfortunately, "Hard Truth" does not live up to the quality of Ms. Barr's earlier works. It feels very contrived. It also appears to take advantage of stereotypes against religious groups. This book just does not meet the expectations I've come to expect from the series. 
 The book was ok but lacked enough to keep me interested. It kept going over the same old stuff that most paintballers know allready. If yer a newbie who has money to burn and time to waste, get this book 
 I wouldn't go so far as to call it brilliant. Zorba is a refreshing and likeable character, but at times i felt that he was a bit too preachy, his dialogue a bit overly pedantic. The story to me felt a bit too long and choppy, with not much of a plot. But there are a few interesting and beautiful moments that reminds us to enjoy life to the fullest. Like I said, not a brilliant book, but pretty good nonetheless. 
 Copyrighted in 2001, the Cisco CCNP library has already been rendered obsolete by Cisco themselves.  Not only exam revisions, but a fundamental structural change to the CCNP examination series has taken place in the short time since these books were put on the market.  Unfortunately, I can see no other benefit to these books beyond providing a revenue stream to Cisco.  There are better books available if one is looking for truly educational technical books rather than exam-specific guides 
 I am a huge fan of EFT and am always eager to learn more, but this book was a complete zero for me.  I haven't been this disappointed in a book from amazon.com in a long time.  The authors are more concerned with self-promotion than helping people, which gets in the way of their communication.  The content is vague, diffused, and very limited.  I would recommend instead Gary Craig's free manual, or Energy Tapping by Fred Gallo 
 I saw the author during a book signing on television.  I saw a young, intelligent, articulate lady who had some very interesting ideas about American culture.  I picked up the book to learn more about her and her ideas.  Unfortunately, though there is a lot of meat in this book, simply put, I was bored...bored...bored.  This is not a subject I take lightly and believe me, I wanted to like this book because I like the author.  I have to agree with a lot of the reviewers here.  There is a lot of data and no real point.  A lousy effort and there are few people more disappointed than me 
 This book tried to do for tonal music what Chomsky's work did for language.  That is, come up with a theory that is dominant in its field in academia, has tremendous prestige, but almost no explanatory ability for how language or music actually works in the real world.  The book is tedious with only a few interesting points.    The book has been in print more than twenty years (and that amazes me), but has had almost no impact on any musician outside of a small circle of academic thinkers for whom music is more of a technical and arcane game / puzzle than an art of expression and emotion.  In fact, bringing up emotion and expression will cause immediate laughter and a great many derisive comments.  Save your time and money.  Whenever I am tempted to read a book like this, I realize how little time I get to play my piano.  So, I go do that instead and find it a much better use of my time 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 I have been reading James Patterson's books since the first Alex Cross came out. I thought the first 3 or 4 Cross books were brilliant but since then I feel the standard has dropped gradually to where we reach London Bridges.  This book has a solid storyline that needed fleshing out but I think the author was in too much of a rush to get the book on the shelves to worry about the story.  Let me get this right - Alex's family are taken hostage in the final few pages of the book, we get a couple of pages devoted to Cross' work and then the family is returned. There was no discussion on the anguish Alex was facing, nothing on the fear that the family was facing, nothing written about this at all! It would have been better to have taken them at the start of the book and have the book devoted to the fear that Alex was facing and his determination to catch the Wolf and get his family back.  If Alex was so dedicated to catching the Wolf, why was he taking so many time-outs throughout the book to visit little Alex, have dinner with his numerous friends etc?  Most disappointing, Mr Patterson 
 Georgescu-Roegen's intentions are laudable, as are many of his proposals. The thermodynamic basis of this work, unfortunately, is unsupportable. This is a pity, as it has left his critique of capitalism open to dismissal, and has contributed to a generation of obfuscation in social and environmental theory.  The problem, simply put, is this: while it sounds convincing to most lay-people (and even many physicists, chemists and engineers) to equate thermodynamic entropy with "disorder", this is based on a meaningless misinterpretation of the second law of thermodynamics. The second law of thermodynamics simply states that energy tends to disperse, if it is not hindered from doing so. It says nothing about "orderliness", and nothing about availability of matter.  Entropy is an extensive property of thermodynamic systems. It is not a property of energy, and certainly not of matter. It is nonsensical to speak of "high- or low-entropy" energy. It is even more nonsensical to speak of "high- or low-entropy" matter. Better to speak of energy quality ("the sun provides us with high-quality energy, and low-quality energy is re-radiated back into space"). Entropy is used to measure the "concentration" (I use this term for illustration only) and hence the usefulness or availability to us of energy, within a given system of matter and energy. The second law of thermodynamics tells us nothing about the tendency of matter to become more or less useful or available to us. There is no thermodynamic basis for reading inevitable decay onto physical, biological or social systems.  Dr. Frank L. Lambert, Professor Emeritus (Chemistry) of Occidental College, Los Angeles, has carried out extensive work over the past few years to demythologise the popular (and, all too frequently, specialist) misunderstanding of the second law of thermodynamics. For anyone contemplating reading "The entropy law and the economic process", I would strongly advise that you first look at Lambert's website: http://www.entropysite.com. He goes through this in detail in multiple format aimed at a range of audiences from lay-person to scientist and engineer.  This review is not intended to be disparaging, towards either Georgescu-Roegen, or others who share the common misunderstanding of the second law of thermodynamics. The problem is deeply entrenched and it will be a long time before the myths around entropy and the second law are dispelled. This is a start 
 This "book" is more like a short document you could download off the internet.  There are hardly any exercises in the book. The author asks you to exercise on other artists works using various methods. The whole book could be summarized on one page if you ask me.  Also, half the book is dedicated to teaching you how to read music.  Having played piano for 20 years, this half of the book was just wasted paper.  
 I would not say that this is the best book to buy for the aspiring project studio owner. While there are some neat stories, etc, the interviews don't give you much other than the "GO do it your own way, your ears are always right, when we recorded x-famous person, blah, blah, blah, ".. I found the Mix Engineers handbook was more practical. I have read a few of the recording and mixing books available, and while this was a fun read, it was the least practical.  If you are looking for production/recording tips get studiobuddy and then buy the recording and mix engineers handbooks 
 This is what?  Some story about a college art teacher who eventually coerces a comely student to pose topless for him to paint? We're supposed to be "shocked" at this? The idea of a sequel is to provide a continuance of a previous story, giving the audience a further dose of what they found entertaining the first time round.  Not happening here, folks. Somebody seriously dropped the ball here, took someone's "mid-aged man gets to see 19 year-old breasts" fantasy and labled it after a blockbuster movie as it's sequel. But there's no 'bad-girl interjects in wallflower's family' here, no "I seduced your Daddy" thing - the main character isn't even named Ivy ... and, unlike the original,this storyline makes it clear the young lass is both "of age" and also, the college prof didn't seem to need to do much convincing to get the blouse to come off.  All in all, it does get two stars because the actress truly is a very beautiful thing and we do get to see her half nude a couple of times (although she just - like, SITS there).  This film has no big-name actors in it, not that such could have saved it.  There's more satisfying erotica in the stage play-scene from "All That Jazz" than there is here. 
 After reading the first book *(which was catastropha) and reading the second which was really good, I thought that the series is taking off, I was mistaken, the third book is slow, and boring, you can see very well that Stephan king has no Idea what so ever where he is going to take that series  Nothing much is happening, and while the second book introduce some interesting ideas, the third book just go to the ordinary adventure that you can find (And better written as well) in dragon lance series, or other adventure books, also many ideas that were in this book already appear in many king books,  reading reviews of manuy users on the fourth book, which some say is very boring  I guess this is where the adventure end for me.. 
 Sparks must have had a momentary lapse of reason when he decided to take a stab at suspense by writing The Guardian. This book is awful. The storyline is weak and predictable, the dialogue is excruciatingly lame, and the characters are poorly developed and lack depth and chemistry. There is virtually no romance, which is the reason to read Sparks' books. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at the stupid things people said, the way the dog seems to be human, and the predictability of the plot. This book is so poorly written and so lame I have trouble believing Sparks wrote it. If you want a good plot with romance mixed in, read Message in a Bottle or A Walk to Remember. If you want suspense, read Mary Higgins Clark or Agatha Christie; they do a far better job with it than Sparks does. 
 This actually could have been a very watchable movie; Anthony Hopkins would be excellent anytime.  Micky Rourke is better than usual.  Mimi rogers is great.  two things make it not so good.  Comparing this to the original; there just isn't a comparison.  & Lindsay Crouse...oh man, she's painful in this one.  she has a very, I mean very, bad southern accent & it ruins the film 
 I have returned this item to Amazon; I paid $43.99 when they had it in stock. The audio out on this dock is a stereo mini (1/8") jack, the connection is terrible from then getgo, with low volume, distortion, and noise when the jack is jiggled.  I would highly recommend the dock they're currently selling at Radio Shack for $29.99. It has RCA outputs on the back and excellent sound quality, it charges, and the remote has a menu button 
 The premise of the book -- scientists trying to contact the near past in order to divert environmental disaster -- is interesting.  The premise and the alternate version of the present might have even been fascinating except that the ideas are overwhelmed by much too much text, unnecessary plot developments, incredibly boring detail, and characters you don't much care about.  Of all the many, many books I've read in my life, I have purposely not finished only a very few -- but this was one of them.  I was just too disinterested to continue reading 
 First of all FLOETIC was a brilliant album and after I heard SUPERSTAR on the radio I thought FLO'OLOGY was going to be a classic too. I was wrong. This album lacks originality, its inferior to be precise. The first time I popped this CD into the system, I found myself being friends with the skip forward button. The length of the records is despicable   This CD is not worth having....the only track that stands out for me is SUPERSTAR and I think COMMON is amazing 
 Someone gave me this book and told me how thrilling it was. Halfway through, I find myself still reading it mostly to laugh at the horrible writing and melodromatic style. It's a little depressing to think that millions of readers have made this guy rich and famous on such awful writing. It's good for me to pick up a book like this now and then to be reminded that by avoiding the most popular authors, I'm not missing much. 
 And it was never meant to be. I'm sick of corporate fatcat traveling show preachers like Pat Robertson and Jerry Farright complain about this supposed "militant secularization of America". Gimme a friggin' break. Conservative christians have DOMINATED this country's political power for the greater half of the past 200 years in this country. It was only recently that people realized that not everyone in America was a caucasian christian with a fair amount of money that things started to change to accomodate everyone, and so the far right fundamentalists cried out in rage that their long reign was being disputed. Today, they act as if America has branded christianity public enemy one. Patty boy has even gone as so far to compare today's conservative christians with Jews in Europe as far as oppression goes! Yes, the Ten Commmandments have been removed....but so what? Do you see government troops raiding your house everytime you have a christian Youth Fellowship meeting? Are you threatened with execution on treasonous charges in America if a government official finds a Bible in your possesion? NO! But this is what real people in much less priviledged countries have to go through, and Robertson and his like should be ashamed to compare themselves to people who really suffer for what they believe. The America of old JAILED a man for simply teaching a science theory to a high school class. The America of today rightfully jails psychos who think that unborn fetus life is worth more than the lives of the doctors who are simply helping women from being butchered by a backalley thug with a coathanger.  America is not, was not and will never be a theocracy. A theocratic government is primitive, pious and dangerous. One need only look at Iran for such an example. Let's leave theocracies in the dark age where they belong and leave power-hungry false prophets like Pat in the trash 
 I  think this book was okay because I like to read about tornadoes and twisters.  Pete was a very nice man. Pete's  dog did what he was told.  I like Tornado because he did a lot of card tricks.  I like Mary Lou because she fed the turtle a lot 
 Fairly good reading - but Rock and Ice offer climbing instruction that would get most people climbing in a weekend! I reccommend taking a course with them. Jump to: www.rockandice.co.uk and have a look 
 My daily commute is +/-3 hours, so I listen to many audio books. I love biographies and I was looking forward to this one after hearing "1776," but I could not stand to listen to this book.    The pace is painfully slow.  The 13 CDs easily could have been condensed to 10 by a reader with a better pace.  The narrator takes audible breaths at about two hours into the CDs, his stomach starts gurgling.  (I thought there was something wrong with my car.)    I'll have to get the book to comment on its content, because I couldn't get past the terrible narration.  
 I read this at Barnes & Noble (no purchase necessary). As an agnostic, my interest in ancient and current religions and belief trends never leaves me without something to read. Having researched Wicca and Neo-paganism myself - extensively along with other religions, I can honestly say without a doubt that this man did absolutely NO RESEARCH whatsoever on Wicca. None. Christians and Muslims alike are very quick to cry foul when their religious beliefs are doubted or questioned yet in turn are the first to belittle beliefs different from their own. My advice to anyone christian or otherwise, before you spout off at the mouth - do extensive research on your subject before professing knowledge on it.  That does mean reading more than 4 or 5 books on the subject. WHAT A CONCEPT!!! 
 As a Pilates instructor, I do not think this is the best book for pregnancy. There is no discussion about what is safe in each trimester, and I do not think there are enough modifications of the exercises to accommodate pregnancy (in fact, the only modified exercise is the hundreds for third trimester). Essentially, she gives the exact same exercises for each trimester and gives no information on how to modify them for an expanding belly, for safety, etc.  A much better book is the Pilates Workbook for Pregnancy by King.  If you already know Pilates then you dont need Winsor's book (very basic exercises that you will already know), and if you are not familiar with Pilates you should find a more detailed, safety-oriented book for your pregnancy 
 I don't own this specific APC product, but I do own other APC products.  My home was hit by lightning on July 2, 2004 during a severe lightning storm. Both of my garage door openers were destroyed during the strike and they were on separate NET3 power line surge protectors made by APC.  NET3 surge protectors offer the best ($50,000) damaged equipment warranty that APC offers. APC refuses to pay for replacement garage door openers since in their determination, the surge protectors are functioning properly (I had to send the surge protectors at my expense for analysis at their labs).  I will never contend that a surge protector can protect any device from a direct lightning strike, but the APC warranty contends that they will replace your equipment in the event this unfortunate event occurs.  I now do not recommend APC equipment, since their warranty is worthless 
 This would have to be the worst book I have ever read.Wow Will is running from dead people. Some one is trying to kill him so cool.How much more boring can you get.I would not recommend this book to a cave man or any thing for that mater. So what I'm saying is it stinks 
 This recording is just ok.  I didn't see why she needed to do a cover cd patti is so much better than this and it's not that she is singing the songs just ok it's just that she doesn't add anything different to them to make me say yeah thats it.  make the next recording will be the one i can enjoy until then i guess i will put "flame' my favorite patti cd 
 In the years since September 11th, 2001 many authors have tried their hands at the 9/11 novel, with all of its delicate subject matter, and thus far they have met with only limited degrees of success: Jonathan Safran Foer, Julia Glass, Wendy Wasserstein, and others have centered novels on the pre- and post-9/11 era, and now Claire Messud takes her turn with "The Emperor's Children," a novel set during the months preceding and immediately following that horrific day. The titular 'emperor' is Murray Thwaite, a prestigious journalist living the quintessential Manhattan lifestyle: fame, money, parties, and the adoration of literati and socialites alike. He has cultivated an image based on truth and integrity, although those charactersitics are notably lacking in his actual person. His 'children' are the people immediately surrounding him, captivated by his presence and hoping to coast on his celebrity with varying degrees of maliciousness. At the novel's onset most of them are suffering from some form of paralysis about their life's direction. First and foremost is Marina, Murray's daughter, who seems hopelessly trapped in a prolonged adolescence -- afraid that if she grows up and tries to make her way in the world she will be unable to live up to her famous father's reputation (the thought of disappointing him is particularly troubling to her). It is easy to forget that Marina is 30 years old because she is quite deliberately written like a high school aged socialite. Then there is Murray's nephew, Frederick "Bootie" Tubb,  who has grown up in awe of his distant uncle and comes to Manhattan after dropping out of college to ask him to be his mentor. Bootie, an intelligent but overly philosophical and idealistic young man, quickly becomes disillusioned with Murray (for who could possibly live up to the lofty expectations that celebrity produces?), and becomes determined to expose his uncle for the charlatan he believes him to be. Complicating things further is Ludovic Seeley, a smarmy Australian businessman who has come to Manhattan to start his own magazine -- and aims to shake up the existing journalistic order by dethroning the reigning king. Ludovic is such an arrogant cliche that all he needs is a mustache to sinisterly twirl to be an outright cartoon. Lastly, there are Marina's best friends: Julius, a gay hanger-on from chilly Michigan eager to make an impression on the New York social scene, and Danielle, who is presumably the humane center for the novel to pivot on, but suffers from such ludicrous Ally McBeal-esque crises in her love life that her credibility is dangerously suspect after the first hundred pages. The characters are uniformly pretentious and are alternately mildly and seriously annoying, but Messud manages to propel her novel forward despite their intrinsic unlikability because, as shallow as they are, they are all multi-layered, complex, believable people. The many threads comprising the narrative are expertly weaved together for some compelling character studies (even if you wouldn't necessarily want to hang out with the lot of them). But that willingness to stick with their stories is, at least for me, predicated on the belief that they will be changed people by the novel's end. They aren't. And while the narrative is expertly crafted, Messud has a penchant for overusing commas in her prose that becomes, increasingly, irritating, as she uses them to stretch out her sentences, and to add separate thoughts, or descriptive elements, and even, occasionally, dialogue, so that they feel like run-ons, like this one right here, this example I've devised for you, but are, for the most part, technically, grammatically sound, even though you may have to re-read the most trying sentences a second time, just to figure out what she is saying, without letting all of her distractions get in the way.   Messud does an admirable job building suspense as the chapters go by and September 11th draws near. There is a great degree of foreshadowing to be found, some directly indicating that September will be a month of great change, what with Ludovic's magazine set to launch on the 13th and a wedding to take place, but naturally none of the characters can predict just how fateful the month will prove to be. The sense of impending disaster looms large in "The Emperor's Children," and it is quite unfortunate that the novel loses steam when tragedy actually strikes. Indeed, 9/11 is almost anticlimactic when it occurs, serving merely as a catalyst to wrap up everyone's story lines. It was unbearably annoying to endure the outrageously selfish way that the characters responded to the attacks and the gross loss of life that they witnessed. In the late afternoon of that day, after the towers had fallen and Manhattan's skyline was irrevocably altered forever there wasn't a lot of soul searching going on in the hearts and minds of these characters. All they care about are their own petty problems and how the terrorists ruined their carefully planned calendars (I felt like throwing the book across the room in disgust when Ludovic had the audacity to go on a tirade about how his precious magazine's launch had to be cancelled). I live in the tri-state area, about an hour and a half away from Ground Zero, and the events of that day and the intense mourning that followed will be with me for the rest of my life, and what Messud has critically failed to capture is the way that 9/11 actually brought a grieving city closer together for a brief moment in time, and how for once people put aside their petty complaints to work on the larger issue at hand. I remember crying at work alongside my stunned colleagues and the reassuring hugs we gave each other, the phone calls I made to -- and received from -- people I hadn't even spoken to in months or even years, just to make sure that they were all right. I remember the eagerness with which people helped each other out, whether the need was great or small. This incredible outbreak of brotherly love earned the admiration of the world, but it is conspicuously absent from Messud's telling. One character uses the tragedy for personal gain career-wise, one uses it as an excuse to wallow in self pity (not for anything to do with 9/11, mind you, but for strictly personal reasons) ... I don't want to give too much away by outlining the callous behavior that offended me so much, but in my opinion it was woefully inappropriate. I had hoped that tragedy would change the Emperor and his Children for the better, but I was wrong. And it's a shame. Messud is definitely a capable, promising writer -- but this isn't her finest hour 
   What is it with these gossip magazines?? Please tell me, because I truly think NO ONE in their right mind would ever subscribe to this garbage. All it is is mindless crap that the media puts into kids minds, while not having anything important else in the magazine. Unless your 10 years old, do NOT subscribe to this. There are better magazines out there fortunately, like Seventeen and CosmoGIRL! which aren't nearly as filled with garbage like this. The reason you don't see J-14 or this magazine or any other magazine like this on the top of the magazine list is because it has no effect on people, it's for little kids and it's not mature. PERIOD. 
 I purchased three sets of Wamasutta 300-Thread-Count Egyptian Sateen Sheets and thought I had made an investment that would last for years. The sheets looked lovely, the colors bright with a soft sheen, the texture smooth with satin like feel. I consider myself a "laundry care queen" always carefully following the manufacturers care instructions: within two washes the "Sateen" look and feel of the sheets was completely gone (washed out). The sheets are very dull and very much wrinkled. They're still soft and serviceable but now I also doubt the thread count.  My supposedly lesser quality sheets are more comfortable and attractive. 
 Had to stop about 1/4 of the way through it and give it away 
 i just couldn't believe these 4 naive cambridge guys who were supposed to be very very smart would be so naive and stupid to become the most notorious spies that british empire could have produced. so two of them were homosexuals or bi-sexuals, and the other two would be just idealists. why they couldn't be smarter to verify the realistic communist russia first, see what atrocities the communism had broght to their people? did they ever read a common line such as 'seeing is believing'? if a bunch of morons would have successfully stolen the british classified secrets for over several decades to feed the russians, then you have to admit one fact: what a joke that the british government turned out to be. this is a very funny spy movie i should say 
 I read this book as a requirement for a class in eschatology in seminary. Pentecost block-quotes other authors for about 60 percent of his text, at which point he could've just provided a bibliography. There is little originality in thought here. Pentecost surveys the narrow world of premillenial dispensationalism and says anyone who disagrees with his viewpoint does not take the text "literally" and ignores the "clear, plain meaning of scripture." But his hermeneutic is a bit inconsistent. He insists that various parts of the apocalyptic imagery presented in Revelation, Daniel and other parts of the Bible must be taken literally.   But he then turns around and says the odd beasts in the Revelation are figurative. Okay...who's not being "literal" here?  Like too many evangelical theologians, Pentecost has no concept of how apocalyptic worked in the Second Temple period. I would imagine that, having translated the Testaments of the XII Patriarchs, I've done more background work than he did in the area (unless reading the notes in the Scofield Bible counts).  Instead, he spends all of his time demonizing those blasted amillenialists. An enormous waste of time and energy.  Then again, the book is almost 600 pages long, and uneducated people are always impressed when they see you reading something large. But for my money, you could learn more about how to live like Christ in the light of his imminent coming (the point of eschatology) by reading an even bigger book you probably already own: the yellow one with restaurant listings 
 Other current pop-rappers like Jibbs or Unk that have one or two hits usually have a consistent album behind them.  At least that's what I thought.  I can't say the same for Mims.  With his long-winded intro about music saving his life, you start to wonder if Mims is trying to appeal to your heart or your ear.  Pretty soon you find that it's not really either.  Many of the songs are too soft compared to the hit, lacking even big bass that makes for an enjoyable car ride.  Savior self, skip Mims 
 this tor breakes when you build tall buildings, but I made a mouse out of them. when the magnets are pushed back that makes me angry, but you can make people by just putting four magnets on one ball, but in all I say you shuld decide yourself. 
 I suppose it serves a function for people with bad eyesight or something. But......dear GOD that thing is ugly 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 This is the first Cussler I have read and I have to admit at being terribly disappointed.I have a liking for books that combine history and fiction (loved The Da Vinci Code) but this has to be one of the least readable in that genre.An important reason for this is that the hero,Dirk Pitt,is an immensely unlikable character.He's too smug,is a walking human encyclopedia who knows EVERYTHING,has all the physical and mental attributes of a God and appears to treat everyone around him with a distinct superiority complex.I ended up smirking on several occasions as his virtue's were extolled upon by all and sundry.Another drawback is the sheer number of characters.New one's keep popping up practically every chapter (and there are 78 chapters in all!).Their names and descriptions get all muddled up by the end of it and one really just stops caring about any of them.As if this weren't enough,there are several plots running parallel with each other and each of these becomes more and more ridiculous as the pages go by.To add to the boredom,detailed descriptions about cars,planes,ships,gadgets etc.are provided at regular intervals.This wouldn't necessarily have been a bad thing if it weren't completely redundant.It seems as if the author is merely trying to show off his knowledge about these things.The only reason I finished this book is because I am a completist by nature.I do realise that such books are supposed to be pure escapism and I'm all for such unbridled entertainment - except that there needs to be a method to the madness.This definitely seems like a case of biting off more than one can chew 
 There are some interesting interviews and selected passages in Gail Sheehy's Hillary' Choice, but on the whole, the book is a slightly more literate National Enquirer tabloid-style trashing of the First Lady and President Clinton.  There are a few nods toward the Clintons' great achievements during their 8 years in the White House, but the book is written for the lowest-common denominator among those fascinated by hyperbolic, negatve gossip.  The most unconscionable element to the book is its pseudo-psycholanalysis of the Clintons' respective childhood "traumas" and their relationship with one another.  It's a ridiculously one-sided and negative interpretation of one of the nation's smartest, most charismatic, and most effective couples 
 This movie was awful. Madeline Stowe deserves better, and Mischa Barton should stick to the O.C Dumb premise gets even more muddled when the mother (spoiler!) finds her daughter, the daughter still behaves like a total brat. I would have left her with the bloodsuckers. 
 Oh my! The positive, glowing reviews you will find initially posted here must be inventions of some publications relations firm! Read on and you will shorter, pithy, but achingly accurate reviews of what is a tortuous read. The character are well developed although the Schizophrenia, John Hardin, is over the top and just plain ludicrous.  Except for engaging chapters in which a priest eludes pursuit by his father and Interpol the remaining chapters are like walking barefoot in sand with a one hundred pack. (no idea how I came up with that simile!)  Read The Great Santini or Prince of Tides.  This novel will bore you beyond tears 
 I have been reading Cornwell for about a decade now and in the 1990's I thought of her as one of the very best of the best writers out there. Her first 5 or 6 novels were tremendous but since then she has slowly tapered off into mediocrity and this book - Trace - represents an all-time low.  The thing that got me was the level of the writing, it just seemed so flat and lifeless. I found it repetitive in the first chapter when Scarpetta is saying to herself that "she should have been told....". It just seemed so ordinary, almost as if someone else was writing this book and not a talented novelist like Cornwell. 
 Gail Griffith writes very well and this is indeed a gripping story.  Lots of compassion is demonstrated for suicidal and depressed teens.  Nevertheless the book is very one-sided and misguided in its presentation of the benefits of antidepressant therapy.  This is particularly surprising in light of the fact Will so clearly demonstrates adverse side effects, even the beginning of serotonin syndrome, well before his suicide attempt.  This is not surprising in light of the enormous doses of three different drugs that he had only been taking for a relatively short time - enormous for someone only 17 years of age, 6 feet tall and reputedly less than 150 pounds, very thin for that height.  He was nauseous, vomiting and had significant memory loss.  In addition his suicide notes are examples of a dissociative state, in which one feels one is watching from outside oneself with no real sense of the consequences of one's actions, that has been reported repeatedly by survivors of antidepressant harm.  The fact that his own doctor and the doctors who endorse the book do not recognize this is a sorry testimony to the influence of the pharmaceutical industry over the psychiatric profession.  The other endorsements come ironically from Andrew Solomon and Paul Raeburn who have themselves inadvertently described adverse events dramatically in their own writing.  I hope readers will examine more critically the differences between underlying depression and the adverse effects of mind altering drugs.  
 Unfortunatley, I am not very techno savvy. I purchased this thinking we could use it on the original hyperscan unit...wronge. My boys told me otherwise, when they opened up the unit and hooked it up, this, being Ben 10, and the original unit being X Men, did nothing. I felt so bad for my son, he loves Ben 10 and could not even use these cards 
 "Highest quality, wholesome ingredients" my Aunt Ida.  Seriously.  HOW do companies get away with this nonsense??? The first ingredient is corn syrup, followed closely by sugar.  That the "Harmony" line would even consider masquerading as a "healthier foods" company and then try to pawn off this rubbish...  it's revolting.  I say don't buy from them just on principle.  Yours, The Food Zealo 
 Ever since Adobe bought out this small operation, customer service has been severely lacking.  Software will NOT work on Excel 2007.   The promise for additional POWERLOOKS has become dead.  Granted that the program makes presentation more interesting, the Powerlooks that was in production are no longer on the website.  This is highly disappointing as I purchased this program in anticipation for further development on the Powerlook templates.  
 the mic's quality is okay but i tried using it with my iriver mp3-player and my computer and i get that really annoying white noise in the background all the time (it's really loud). before you buy it check out some sample-recordings on the internet if you are interested in high quality 
 The first two Betsy Taylor books were short but packed with humor and action.  I've re-read them both several times, and still love them.  This one? It seems like she whipped it off in less than a month, and didn't put the care and craftsmanship into it that she did the others.  The plot is thin, the characters far less developed, and the book is overall a disappointment, especially in light of how excellent her first two Vampire Queen books were.  Sadly, the fourth book in the series, Undead and Unreturnable, is even worse.  I advise anyone wanting to read either Unappreciated or Unreturnable to get them from the library--they are not worth buying.  Try Kim Harrison's Dead Witch Walking instead, or Katie McAlister's You Slay Me if you want something lighter, and hope that MJD gets her act together and starts writing well again 
 Dr. Dolittle has fallen afoul of the PC police, well before they were so named.  This edition is heavily adulterated to maintain political correctness.  Unfortunately, you must read the afterword to understand this.  A great story, a bad edition 
 Fiona Mountain had a good idea for a mystery with Bloodline, but she ruined it with her ham-fisted way of telling a story.  She seems never to have heard that the cardinal rule of good writing is "Show, don't tell", but repeatedly hits the reader over the head with the points she wants to make.  She insists on calling attention to the parallels between Natasha's life and the mystery she's investigating, as if she (the author) were afraid a reader wouldn't be clever enough to notice them on her own.  For example, in describing a scene that takes place in a garden, she says, "The exposed and tangled roots of the weeds were pale through the covering of dark soil", and then feels compelled to add, "The analogy of roots being ripped up wasn't lost on her."  Trust me, if you make it to page 262 (where this passage appears), the analogy wouldn't be lost on you either, even without the authorial intervention.      In my review of Mountain's previous book (Pale as the Dead), I commended her for not letting her research get in the way.  Unfortunately, that isn't the case with this book.  Too often, reading it felt like reading the author's research notes.  She even has one character -- an elderly woman who isn't an academic -- say that, in a conversation which took place many years ago, another character "quoted J. Hooper Harvey's Heritage of Britain".  I find it hard to believe that the character would have remembered not only the title of the book, but also the author's full name, right down to the "J. Hooper".  Sounds to me more like the author, fresh from the library, speaking.   The Natasha Blake mysteries are a bit like Sarah Stewart Taylor's Sweeney St. George mysteries (O' Artful Death, etc.), in that both series are about a young woman with an unusual job that causes her to get involved in solving mysteries from a different angle.   If that concept sounds intriguing to you, I would recommend that you spend some time with Sweeney St. George.  After reading Bloodline, I can't say the same for Natasha Blake.  
 Immigration acts, facts and proposals for the present US are surely important. However, we need a better job done on it than this book does. To be fair, this style of "semi-reporting" is popular and does sell; but, it's not what will do the job. It is full of the author's "we shoulds" when what we could better use would be "given A, if you want B, and are willing to do C then do/support E". The book is full of anecdotes, that we are not sure are representative, and of "opinions", of many "non-government organizations" and "advocacy groups". Read it to learn what is typical of what is out there. Otherwise, use your time more productivley to think and research the problem yourself and you will come out better off 
 This is a good book for people who want to learn more about the great  Italian luthier, but it definitely has its flaws. The book was written  around the turn of the 20th century and its style is very stilted and  convuluted. I often had the feeling the authors could have conveyed the  information they give us in two pages in one paragraph. Also, their worship  of anything related to Stradivari gets to be a bit much after awhile.  Still, this is the book to turn to for information on this great violin  maker 
 I was a subscriber to the New Republic for several years, but in the waning years of the Clinton administration and the beginnings of the Bush II administration, the paper seemed to take a real rightward turn.  Now, I have no problem with so-called liberal hawks, but the magazine's slavish support for the war in Iraq in the face of questionable evidence did it for me.  In addition, the magazine spends more time bashing Democrats for not aligning themselves with the magazine's professed centrist/liberal slant than it does with presenting true progressives ideals that create thoughtful discourse among its readers.  The magazine has forgotten its roots of progressive intellectualism and dissent in favor of safe, "New Democrat" rhetoric.  There are better magazines our there 
 I bought this book when I was first starting the guitar in the mid-80s. Even then I knew it was horrible. No solos. It really does suc 
 Its November 2004, and I just read this book. And what I understood firstly is: I should shift my paradigm that there are business classics, which was written several years ago and stil valid. The best example of such a book, so called "business classic" is Competitive Strategy, from Porter, but the book is so outdated that, when I read "Mind of Strategist" from Ohmae, I said yeah this is strategy book, so simple, so clever.  By this book, I swear that I will never give money to the books which are not written in last 2 years. (I just guess 2 years, no magic).  First of all.. all the books tell about Swiss vs Japan watches, history of TQM, kaizen, etc. etc... I re-read them again with a headache and in a very old format.. (believe me that I really felt not good reading so many "paradigm" words in the book)  Secondly, after reading this book I believe that there is no paradigm, there is only Strategic Thinking. In the book it is written that us (United States) have found lots of things.. I could believe even the writer calls that origin of Kaizen had been found by US... So what? Are the japanese people just copy and execute people? What about Toyota? Mitsubishi? Malezian economy? etc. etc. Are they only getting the pardigms shifts from US and just pionneering? I just laugh by now -2004.  As a person working in a US company, as I wrote above, and I have written in several comments, please read "Mind of Strategist" by Ohmae, and its over. You know how to think, you will not need such a book called as paradigm, since this book is an old pardigm.:) If you want to shift your paradigm in life, please read the "Flashes" by Said Nursi. 
 I loved Suede's debut album, it's a true classic. I even bought their b-sides compilation "Sci-Fi Lullabies" and loved a lot of that as well ("My Insatiable One" might be their best song). But let's be honest, this album is pretty awful. There are maybe 4 or 5 solid tracks on here but even they don't touch the weakest tracks on the debut.  The theatricality has been amped up tenfold (if that's even possible) but the songwriting has taken a huge dip. If you want memorable hooks and melodies, look elsewhere. If you want slow, pseudo-romantic dirges that go absolutely nowhere, then this is the album for you.   Sure, maybe I just don't "get it" but I don't see how anyone could say with a straight face that this is a masterpiece, let alone Suede's best album. This album is just boring. I wanted to like it but in the end it's just not worth your time. Avoid unless you are a completist 
 Oedipus was a weird book to reab, because the plot was all twisted. The characters in the book are nasty. Oedipus kills his father and has two kids with his mother.... 
 In this short book, Wolfe purports to tell us that the entire American art scene (ie ALL abstract art) of the post-WWII years is nothing but verbiage, a creation of a bunch of second-rater critics. I find this kind of generalization absolutely breathtaking in its arrogance and facile dismissiveness.  By what criterion does Wolfe make this judgment?  By the fact that there were a bunch of high-falutin' critics who explained it to those who wanted to be taken by fashion.  While this is a common enough phenomenon in a nationalistic sense (pride in the output of one's country), I think it only applies to individuals rather than an entire scene.  Afterall, the astract artists like Pollack belonged to a continuous milieu, which runs the gamut from Bob Dylan and John Coltrane right through the Beat Generation writers and Pollack and his cohorts and even TV like the Outer Limits and Twilight Zone.  Were all of them and all they did first rate?  Perhaps not, but I wd argue that there area a lot of wonderful things there as well, reflections of a time even if they don't quite measure up to the earlier generation of modernists like Picasso and Matisse.  I wd not dismiss them so cavalierely, so cynically, as if you can emcompass all they stood for in a single argument.  This book is for those who want to appear as glib smartas*es 
 I don't care how great this book would have turned out to be if I had finished it.  Within the first 30 pages, Stephanie recalls the sex she had with the guy she's hunting down when she was 6 and he was 8 years old; and her Grandpa Plum shooting a grossly neglected family pet to end the animal's pain and suffering. If I had known about the distasteful elements in this book, I would never have purchased it 
 I am a big fan of the regular CliC reading glasses. I own several pairs and think they are great. However, the Sport Goggles DO NOT get my vote of confidence. They have three problems which make them unusable for me: 1) on all CliC products there is an all important stem adjustment that adjusts the length of the stems to properly fit the glasses onto your head. However, unlike the very cool regular reading glasses by CliC, the Sport Googles do not adjust properly and so the Goggles run very tight if you need even a slightly above average stem legnth, 2) there is also extra foam padding on the Sport Googles that make them very snug, but because of the tight stems the foam padding makes these glasses far too tight to enjoy and 3)the maker doesn't make it as clear as they should in their description ... the Irridium (Red)colored lens on some of the Sports Goggles are far too intensely tinted and dark for any kind of regular light conditions or applications like morning driving ... or even safe walking on a rocky path. Sorry Clic, but your success with the Reading Glasses went to your head ... you needed to do more user testing for comfort and vision with the Sports Goggles. I would like to return them for a larger size and lighter colored lens ... too bad for me! 
 As ridiculous as I found this book, upon reading reviews from so many men who loved it, I am filled with horror.  Granted, I am a female college student, so I completely missed the abused-male-baby-boomer boat, but I cross my fingers and wish like crazy that not all men have this sort of deep psychological complex. I find hope in a few reviews written by men who are still confident that they can be men without a self help book.   Everything that can be said about Bly's methods has been said.  He is not a psychologist.  He is not a folklorist.  He is a poet (that's what the two stars are for).  Folklore is dynamic, and to suppose the "Iron John" folktale is the same today as it was before the Grimms collected it is purely blind.  The Grimms slashed and edited and put in cute morals.  If you think the Granny they collected it from would have told the exact same "Iron John" tale as the woman two houses away, or ten years earlier, or two days later, you are a stranger to folklore.  Society holds on to the tales that mean something to us.  Isn't it curious then, that "Iron John" dropped from our stock of folktales until ressurrected by Bly, who suddenly claims it is a reflection of modern America? 
 Motion picture messages are so smoothly constructed and mass produced today, audiences would hardly bat and eye if they were seeing anti-intellectualism presented to them in a form that also imputes witchcraft, telekinesis for example.  Big ideas must mean something from outer space has infected the brain; or anything intelligent, resourceful or efficient.  Also foreign language acquisition is held suspect by this piece of government propaganda, we're better off being mono-lingual and ignorant of others around the world.  While not as mudslinging and rife with judicial malpractice as the Salem Witchcraft Trials, movies still libel segments of the population the state has deemed unwanted or suspect for reasons of their beliefs, attitudes and intellectual pursuits.  Then the mudsling is that intelligence must be unnatural and under alien control, that it means something is organically wrong with the brain; of late it has been more popular for the exercise of state oppression to simply label people as mentally ill (without all the cosmic conspiracy angle).  What it really means is that the tireless efforts the government has put in place to destroy the public education system, and to weaponize the culinary water supplies everywhere with a vectored chemical incapacitant wmd, fluoridation, must now jealously and suspiciously interdict any signs of its ineffectiveness at rendering the population functionally illiterate, subaverage in memory, language, logic and mathematics skills.  There is no big important secret cipher system at risk, that the government needs to keep a secret in order to subjugate unwanted populations of chemically inundated citizens; it is plain to see and requires no algorithm to decode.  The pattern is obvious:  exploit, lie, poison and insult the residual intelligence of the population they haven't yet completely wiped out.  This movie is a highly revealing sick statement of an insular, autocratic technological empire crumbling under its own inconsistencies and open acts of war, mob violence and vigilantism on America; a foreign policy of isolationism attempting to disguise corporate colonialism as our outreach, when the overstatements of xenophobia for international languages couldn't be more apparent or reflection of the decline in the U.S. education system.  Demonization of intellectuals is old fascist whining and scare tactic.  It is making more movies than sense because its only card to play is hypnosis in order to evade fairly simple identification of its ideology and modus operandi.  Other than the large dimensions of psychological film project objectives for mass populations the psycorps or planning and budgeting of the Pentagon designs, this film also has latent suggestible side effects that could be harmful to young people prior to the age of disillusionment with the establishment.  The film could instill phobias in young people that academic achievement or the strengthening of their intellect is somehow a demonic or alien compromise, that smart is bad and that dumb is preferred.  Use this film if anything to make a fool of the corruption that thinks we take it seriously.  Who is the more alien-invasion insidiousness anyway?   There are these people out there who think they have big ideas, something to contribute.  They believe in direct democracy, energy conservation, environmentalism, alternative forms of power extraction and won't learn from the coy ridicules of cinematic revisionism not to see others equally, or not bother to learn to speak some of their language.  What's to be done with them?  Perhaps they'll die naturally from the progression of their disease, as they so should.  It seems that would be in keeping with this film's sick prescription.   Oh, and in case you're writing in the newspaper oped style that can't make an argument without  telling people what to think verbatim, remember to begin with the polemic:  "That's what's going on here!..."   
 I used to have this same unit under the brand name "Emerson Research"  It's a pretty good unit, but it's a very old model.  For the price, you can get a much more modern one from Emerson Research at a local store 
 it says it's an A/V dock for video ipods but it only would transmit audio to my tv. i'm really pissed about this product.what a waste! A/V cables that sell for 20$ are incredible. they sinply plug into the headphone jack of my 80 gig ipod and into the a/v inputs of my tv 
 So far I've seen 67 out of 68 positive reviews for this book, and I say "Hurrah" for Richard Russo for all his positive praise. However, I disagree. The book has a flimsy to nonexistent foundation, that being backstory which takes circuitous twists and turns, and those turns take further turns.. So far I'm averaging 3 to 4 pages a night, and I'm a prolific reader. Why is Russo so fearful of forwarding the plot? Why the back and forth, the past histories upon past histories of every minor character? Just too much "muchiness" as the Brits would say 
 This book is terrible.  RaH takes a perfectly good murder mystery and turns in into...well, I don't quite know what.  Halfway through the book, it seems as though he had set it down for several years, came back to it to finish it off, but had nothing but nonsense on the brain.  I've seen authors pull an ending out of their hat before, but this book absolutely takes the cake.  It's not even my book and I threw it in the trash so it won't waste another person's time ever again 
   I think the Linda Howard who wrote White Lies, Sarah's Child, Duncan's Bride, MacKenzies Mountain, Diamond Bay,etc. is one of the most talented current romance writers.  Unfortunately, when she gave up the genre romances and turned to the "big Time", her writing started to decline. She is clearly in over her head now.  What a shame she couldn't stick to a format in which she excelled and warmed the hearts of millions of readers.   This just goes to show that one should figure out where one excels and stick to it. This is pure "Peter Principle" in action. Too bad 
 I have a mini-cuisinart and a full sized one, but since I received this herb processor as a gift, I thought I'd give it a shot. Well, after a day of trying to chop herbs and mince garlic with it, I'd rather spend the extra time setting up and cleaning the mini-cuisinart. I found that most of the time, this herb processor just mashes everything up, or crushes it, no matter what blade I use. Juices from the herbs or garlic just leak out, weakening their overall flavor and limiting their usefulness. If I need to quickly chop some herbs, I'd rather just do it by hand or by cuisinart 
 This was a very annoying and boring flick thats barely watchable and throughout the film I kept looking at my watch, the film is not a historical drama nor is it an autobiographical film about William Shakespreare infact it is a romantic comedy disguised as a historical drama. My girlfriend insisted that we watch this film together but I wasn't in the mood she forced me to watch this, the film was about a struggling young writer Shakespeare played by Joseph Fiennes who falls in love with Lady Viola played by Gwyneth Paltro who also happens to inspire his famous play Romeo and Juliet, this film also won a couple of oscars including Gwyny for best actress but I felt like the film was just not that funny because all the characters seemed to talk in an old English style thats hard to understand. Overall the film was just O.K. I think that some of the sets and costumes were fantastic and Judi Dench was great as Queen Elizabeth but I never want to watch this film again, if your a Shakspeare fan and like romantic comedies then you might like this film more than I did. 
 Dobson has it wrong. Children's susceptibility to God and the attributes of God has to do with rearing them with the love of God in their hearts from the beginning, praying and relying on God, and being taught to please God. Violence begets violence. To spank and be violent toward children is proof of the perpetrator's ignorance of modern scientific evidence that spanking is detrimental to the emotional, physical and spiritual evolution of children. Ignorance begets ignorance, and if you're in charge of children, feeding your mind with ignorance is no benefit to your child 
 I truly wanted to like this book.  After years of avoidance I had just finished Moby Dick and found it not only more readable than I'd feared but downright enjoyable.  In addition I'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me, and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature:  "Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last."  Alas, it was all down hill from there; overall this is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish.  This came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack.  Author of two other published novels and a short story collection, director of a university level creative writing program, long-term teacher of writing, and holder of a Ph.D. in same, all to considerable critical acclaim, she should be correcting and grading (failing) garbage like this not producing it.  So what went wrong?  How did this novel end up so awful?  The answer is brick by brick and piece by piece.  There is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things.  LENGTH: If "brevity is the soul of wit", this novel's witlessness is easily explained.  At 666 pages (interesting number that) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been.  It would seem that, to some extent like Melville before her, Naslund confused Length with Importance, but Melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is.  IMHO this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing Naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody.  Somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel, but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing... with a meat axe or a chainsaw.  THE NAME DROPPING: One of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures, but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend.  They are badly handled here.  An almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of Kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century New England and those she doesn't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with Naslund's peculiar imagining of Nathaniel Hawthorne.  One or two of these, developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude.  As it is, it is a Zelig or a Forrest Gump without the humor (or the self-awareness).  THE POLITICS: Even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century New Englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel, so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing.  However, Naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having Una espouse the Politically Correct view on every single controversy of the day (and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day) from slavery to whaling, from feminism to free love, from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled, all without consequence or even criticism.  This latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves.  Una espouses them with all the negative consequences that Naslund receives for espousing them today, which is to say: none.  THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIGOTRY: There is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time, but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted.  It is even sillier to portray Christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish, the bigoted, the future apostate, or the mentally ill.  It tells us more about the author than anything else that Una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time EXCEPT Christianity.  THE FARFETCHED SCENARIOS: I sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which Una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter....  After this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic.  After her crazy Christian father threatens to kill her (a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand), Una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle, encounters two young men who both fall in love with her, disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them, successfully avoids detection, is sunk by a whale, survives by committing cannibalism, marries the surviving young man after he goes insane, and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the Indians, leaving her free to "marry" Captain Ahab (Una never really "marries" anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes).  Things don't get more realistic in the second half, which includes Una's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale.  Riiiight.  THE MARY SUE: However, the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a "Mary Sue" that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader.  A more realistic main character might have saved it.  Una never learns anything from her life's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything.  She doesn't change because she is already perfect.  She doesn't have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn't receive any, and she doesn't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides, Una had her reasons (and they were very good ones you can be sure).  The only thing I can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone WITHOUT anyone ever reading it.  I feel like I've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading Moby Dick in her bedroom... with the door locked. 
 Yes, nothing quite like giving one's friends good reviews on amazon!  isnt is nice when  people with too much money can build tree-houses when so many americans must live in dumpy apartments or are  homeless?   Its nice that those who have trust funds can build tree houses, while the rest of us are worrying about even having housing, especially with illegal and legal immigration saturating the rental  market and drving out legal american citizens.  Come to think of it, how many people who build treehouses have rental properties in slum areas ? I know of one who does 
 I too am horrified that this author is capitalizing on her first-hand expereince as a murderer.  Would you want to support Charles Manson or other murderers by buying their books? Buying a book written by a murderer is condoning their activities and agreeing they should profit from their crime.  I can't support that.  This woman manipulated her friend into helping her murder her friend's murder and then used her own wealthy family's lawyers to get a light sentence while her friend wasted away in prison 
 Don't waste your time or money.  What she wrote in the First Theme Gardens is enough.  If you can't find the first one then this is a good book, but as a REVISED and UPDATED Edition the changes were very subtle 
 Bought this crockpot from a local dept. store hoping to enjoy it's nice size and color and the good crockpot name. Nope... As another reviewer stated, the lid is poorly designed. Moisture boils and sprays around the outside of the lid and causes the lid to bounce around. Drives me and my dog crazy. No way would I feel safe throwing something in it and going away for even a few hours much less a whole day. In this day and age it seems cheap products and profits are more important than long lasting quality and craftsmanship. Shame shame on CrockPot!  
 Two problems have surfaced using the TIVO unit. The first is the lack of a 5 pin serial port for connection of the tuning cable which causes the use of the funky light attachment at the front of the unit when hooked to a Direct TV box. Sometmes the tuning is inaccurate causing misfires when programs are recorded. The other problem is that internally the TIVO unit looks for a basic cable signal erratically for the second tuner. I have replaced all of the cables with new shielded cables so I know that is not the problem. I am replacing it with a Direct TV DVR. When the TIVO works, it is great, but it is not reliable enough for me 
 It is an axiom of nature that for intimacy, impression, or insight that both a male prong and a female receptacle are necessary. Such technical utility is carried over into even our electric plugs and wall sockets for illumination.  Which is why poignant critical works and reviews of President George H.W. Bush's presidency are the more useful volumes to turn to, for Rebel-in-Chief: Inside the Bold and Controversial Presidency of George W. Bush pierces nothing. This is a flaccid, feeble, vapid work.  Rebel-in-Chief is of the orifice-pressed-firmly-to-the-sphincter class of hagiography, and fails both on its merits and its mission. Barnes holds himself out as a suburban Republican everyman intellectual of the not-too-deep variety. Perhaps this is the most telling dimension of the work, for if Barnes and his doppelgangers are either seeking to understand Bush's vision with this critical appraisal, or are his last wall of apologetic defence it is a sure sign of a failed Presidency. Everyone remembers from college that at the first siren of real trouble the smiling and backslapping Future-Salesman-of-America disappear leaving the trash and evidence pinned on the dim, the confused, and those who arrived late. When the centre does not hold, a rough beast indeed slouches toward Bethlehem to be born, and then it is brutes who must clean up the mess 
 Mr. Barber was apparently so taken by the idea of putting together a collection of his favorite maps that he forgot that: 1) there are already more map books on the market than you can shake a compass at and a bigger book of maps is not automatically a better book, 2) his book, like all the others, was inevitably going to suffer from the same defect, namely reproductions of maps so reduced in size as to be unreadable, and 3) putting the primary focus on maps relating to the defunct British Empire may be patriotic to his countrymen but only serves to amuse the rest of the world.  Oh, and the proofreading provided by his publisher leaves much to be desired.  That is unless the Japanese actually DID attack Pearl Harbor on December 3, 1941  
 This DVD is edited from the original version.  This movie is HOT, the cut DVD is NOT 
 This book has an over-reaching title and at best is a catalog that describes toys.  Placing the words "special needs" in the title implies that it would provide specific pointers for helping children with all sorts and degrees of disabilities like CP, visual impairments, hearing impairments, deafblindness, mental retardation, etc. and might at least have a section on augmentative communications.  It offers VERY LITTLE on these topics.  As for the dialogues, I found them to be of poor quality and contrary to other stuff I have read.  Some of the dialogues for a child who hasn't begun to talk have tons of words and lots of adjectives yet later the same book suggests that teaching the concepts of 'up' and 'down' in the same play session might be too confusing for the child.  I don't know what the author's Ph.D. is in but I hope it isn't in speech and language pathology 
 The only song I like on the album is "For These Times"...the rest of the songs are crummy. Her song "Anyway" just gets on my nerves. The album sounds like pop/rock/opera/ONE BIG MESS!!!! Martina can't sing a damn note and this album sounds terrible! What the hell went wrong here? Don't waste your money! Buy Kellie Pickler and Carrie Underwood and Dolly Parton 
 I got this as both a book and an audio file.  I had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author, but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts (e.g., I gasped when he suggested Christ went to Hell...what Bible passage evidences this?).  I agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and keep us asleep...but wonder if I go further how much more Eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical misintrepretations.  Where were his editors when this was being written?  Why take sensible good sections and mar them with oddities?  I havent read all the reviews here but as one of those "conservatives" frequently mentioned in them I have to admit I may not even finish this book for fear of what else Eldredge has slipped up on.  I did appreciate his story about Daniel and the "delayed" angel...but am left wondering if I need go deeper into researching that as possible misintepretation too.  What a shame this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me.  We are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source material well..the Bible well.  So far...I may join others and ditch this valiant attempt to energize Christians and return to the Word itself.  I wonder if I can get a refund 
 Messenger has a very thin plot. A messenger of Satan is seducing postal workers in a small Florida town, getting them to graphically murder as many people as they can before killing themselves. It isn't so much a plot as a device for the author to write one violent, gory scene after another, all leading nowhere. I think he must have gotten paid by the number of times he wrote the word blood, bloody, blood-soaked, blood-covered, etc.  This is a bad novel. Violence and gore are no problem if they are integral to the story but here, they are the story and nothing else. The dialog is so over the top it makes you laugh, the characters have no depth and no one behaves or reacts the way a real person would. The author bio says Lee has 15 novels in print. I hope they all aren't as useless as this one 
 I received my new Fossil watch just a few weeks ago.  At first, I was pleased with the watch.  The overall appearance is nice, its very dainty with a thin band.  The green dial is a pale lime green, not too bright.  Everything was going good until yesterday when I noticed the watch seemed to have stopped working (and this is only after 2 weeks of having it!!).  I reset the time and it started ticking again, so I thought it was just a fluke.  Now it is working sometimes but is generally running slow (the time keeps falling farther behind).  If this is a battery problem already I am very disappointed that amazon would send out a new watch with an old battery.  I expect to take this up with them, as obtaining a new battery isn't very easy because there isn't a fossil store nearby.  In the manual it says to mail in the watch for a new battery, which costs $15!!  How inconvenient.  I am not impressed 
 just really not that funny.  i ordered it to bring my total order up to 25....  should've paid for the shipping 
 Book info             : I read the 1st English edition that was published in 1992.  Pre required knowledge: SMED Purchased price       : USD 39,90 General               : The book is not very easy to read, the information you need is there but the text could be much clearer. Also the writer must like abbreviations, because he uses them a lot. In the end they were starting to get annoying.  Book content:  The book has got 2 parts. Part I handles the basic theoretical part (44% of book) and has got exercises (12%) The first part gives an unclear overview of the theory and then continues using the theory in case studies. Part II (44%) gives 4 applications:  1 Colour Changeover Improvement at a plastics company 2. Establishing one-piece flow at the oriental motor company 3. Single delivery at Mynac clothing company 4. Reducing waste on printed circuit board component assembly lines at Kumamoto Electronics  Because I work in the food processing industry I found the case studies and the applications in part two difficult to understand.  Two other things I would like to point out are: A. If you maintain the same level of production but decrease the lot size you get more setup time / changeover. Therefore the book can't avoid SMED en Zero changeover principles; actually quit a lot of the book is spend on this topic but I found Shingo's book on this topic much better. B. While transforming the production process into U cells the writer adds new equipment to the lines / cells, sometimes up to twice as much, as if equipment is falling out of the sky! 
 Amazon is NOT an authorized Samsung dealer and the manufacturer's one year warranty on this TV will not be honored by Samsung 
 The only thing positive I can say about this movie is Barbara Hershey looks good naked. But who goes to a biblical movie to check out naked babes?  In this movie, "Jesus" puts his carpentry skills to work building crosses for the Romans. He whines to Harvey Keitel's Judas that he (Jesus) never tells the truth, is afraid of everything, needs forgiveness for his own sins--in other words, he fits the the description of half the actors in Hollywood. Before the movie was halfway over, I wanted to crucify this phony "Jesus" myself!  I rate this piece of garbage a negative 10 
 One might imagine that the whole concept of vacuuming-flip-mopping is progressive in some way, but it really does not make the job of cleaning the floor easier.  Especially when the product is heavy and hard to maneuver with poor pickup.  I'd much rather go over the floor with a good vacuum, and then follow with a functional, well-designed good mop (like the old SteamMop they discontinued). These things function better as seperate units, which is why there's no washing machine that's also a dryer.   The Flip-It is a very loud machine--so loud, that I didn't hear my phone ring in the same room.  This makes it difficult to listen for my 3 children, too.  It's difficult to push and feels like it's gripping to the floor.  It doesn't fit into any tight places or under any low chairs/cabinets with it's big fat part-vacuum head.  And, when you're finished, it's a pain to clean out the nozzle and the filter(which you're supposed to keep dry somehow) so you can look forward to a second job once you've finished the job of cleaning your floors.  And, because of the "flip it" back and forth design, the thing has no equilibrium...it fell to the floor at least 3 times, even when I was so careful to rest it against something...once when this happened, the "dirty water" recovery tank hit the floor, fell off the machine and spilled the dirty water all over my just-cleaned floor.  A true nightmare.  I bought this product because I could no longer buy replacement filters/pads for my Bissell SteamMop, and I thought I had better give the latest and greatest a try, but, sadly, I was disappointed.  I don't review things often, but I felt a responsibility to warn others out there who are shopping for a good mop to keep their homes clean.  This contraption is not your answer.   On a side note, I wrote to Bissell to bring back the SteamMop (what an excellent product), so I'm hoping that they will one day 
 This might appeal to fans of E!, Entertainment Tonight, The Insider, et. al.  I'm not a huge fan of gossip-lit, but was looking for a light-weight, fun summer read.  This book made me tired, as it was, for the most part, a never-ending To-Do List of menial chores for fake celebrities ("Jock Staupman" or... Jockstrap Man, yeah I geddit.) Seems like a real foolish way to make a living, without so much as a 'work-for-hire' agreement or contract. After 20+ years in the business, you'd think Heather Howard/Corki Brown would know better.  Plus, I can't imagine readily accepting abuse, assault and criminal activities--and having to haul heavy stones around a backyard.  The ending was weak and a bit far-fetched.  This book would have been so much more enjoyable if it had some depth to the job (as in, how did she get hired, how does she get clients), a true sense of the twisted, or real insider scoop about "the business."  I've read this sort of "weird celebrity requests" expose in various magazines.  If you're really keen on celebritry-assistant madness, you'd be better off renting the movie "Swimming With Sharks" (1995) with Kevin Spacey.  That said, if you're not expecting a whole lot, this book is fine to take to the beach, as it doesn't require much thought 
 Maybe it's the teacher, perhaps it's the book. But this is one of the most difficult classes I've had in my life. All I feel like doing is pulling out my hair. This book is so unclear. If you're trying to learn math, this isn't the book for you. If you want to be confused, I highly recommend it 
 Our protagonist is over his head, and below my serious consideration. The book ends on a "Aren't we great" theme (hardly surprising) and the protagonist really in over his head.  I got tired of Jake's continual self-effacing comments, which makes the ending even more implausible. He's a nice guy, which seems his total claim to fame. I cannot seriously recommend this book to a friend 
 First of all, I can't believe Trace got better reviews than Predator.  Predator was 1000 times better, but that's still not saying much.  Trace was just awful.  The worst in the series.  I can say with the certainty of the Great Scarpetta, that Patricia Cornwell did not write this book. One of her ghostwriters, who probably hates Scarpetta, wrote it.    This book is incomprehensible.  The story lines are disjointed, disconnected--just plain bad.  There is no follow through; the reader doesn't get the satisfaction of having everything tied together at the end.  What happened to Pogue?  Dr. Paulsson?  Mrs. Paulsson?  Dr. Marcus?  And what about Fielding? All of a sudden Fielding has a horrible skin condition and he's no longer in great shape and good looking.  Is this all because the Great Scarpetta was fired and moved away and the stress of life without her has ruined his physical appearance?  That's pretty riduculous. And the motivation of the killer is so weak and SOOOOO absurdly stupid, that I can't believe that Patricia Cornwell approved this awful imitation.   I'm so SICK to death of Lucy and her bad relationships, and I just can't stand Rudy. Also, in this book Lucy's father is now Cuban, instead of Brazilian, like he has been in the 12 previous books.  This ghostwriter has obviously never read any of Cornwell's Scarpetta novels.  Cuba and Brazil are two totally different countries and cultures!  To me, this is a huge oversight.  A good author takes note of every detail of the characters s/he creates, and I'm pretty sure that Cornwell isn't careless.  I digress...And then there's Benton and Kay, back together and back into the swing of their passionless, unfulfilling relationship.  Do they even like each other?  There's such tension and animosity between them.  Especially since Benton was never really dead; he was just undercover.  That whole story line was never explored in this horrible book. Even more evidence of poor ghostwriting--that was the greatest oversight. There's no hashing out of feelings and talking things through. All we're left with is Benton's five sentence explanation in Blow Fly. And Marino...I was horrified and acutally felt embarrassed when I read the part of Scarpetta taking pictures of Marino's injuries.  I don't want to give it away, if you haven't read the book.  That part is humiliating.  If you are a Scarpetta fan, you'll read this book despite the bad reviews.  In fact, you have to read it because you have see for yourself how truly terrible it is.  Just don't buy it.  Borrow it from the library 
 When your infant is crying because he's hungry and you're only thinking about how you want to be back in bed, you will not necessarily hear the very quiet "click" another reviewer mentioned unless you are right on top of this unit.  Did it already cycle through once?  Twice?  I don't know.  I never could catch it since it was in my kitchen and I was usually trying to soothe my child in the living room when the light went out.  Yes, it was in plain sight, but that doesnt mean I caught it at the right time.    What I do know is that leaving the bottle in there, reagrdless of it being 4oz. or 8oz., makes the formula very HOT. Even if you have it on the proper setting according to the instructions.  Then you have to wait for it to cool down before feeding your now screaming hungry baby.  This went in the trash.  The only reason I gave it two stars is because it did heat the bottle faster than if I waited for water to boil.  Otherwise, I just started giving my son formula made with room temperature water and had not one problem 
 Very disapointing.  No where near worth  $12.95 Maybe .25 cents at a yard sale if you happen to come by it.  I suppose someone has to pay for the cost of printing it! 
 As an amateur trying to learn more about canine agression, I was actually quite disappointed with the content of this book.  Overall, there is no significantly new or insightful information in this book, and frankly, much of the information about specific types and symptoms of agression problems in dogs can be had for free, often in better detail and more scientifically presented, on the internet, particularly if one searches for information generated by professionals in the field of canine agression, such as scientific papers presented to veterinary journals. I DID, however, find the chapter on agression testing to be helpful -- I haven't seen this type of testing recommended elsewhere, and I did find it interesting and helpful to see the results of these tests on my young puppy.  That being said, I am working on canine agression issues from more of a preventative than a curative or treatment basis, and I would have to give SERIOUS second thoughts about trying some of the suggested tests on a large, mature, and seriously agressive dog.  To be fair, the authors also suggest a great deal of caution when performing these tests on older dogs. The vast majority of the book is merely a recycled basic obedience course book -- sit, stay, heel, come, etc..  And, while I certainly would agree that a firm command of obedience is especially important to a dog with behavioral issues, I alread have several good books on the subject, such as those by the Monks of New Skete.  Had I known that most of this book was just a rehashed obedience manual, I would have saved my money and skipped it.  Based upon the title, I just expected a lot more out of this book than I got.  For someone who really wants a good, in depth book about canine agression issues and their treatments, I'd say to spend your money on a copy of "Clinical Behavioral Medicine For Small Animals" by Dr. Karen L. Overall from the University of Pennsylvania.  Although this is a very expensive book (it is a textbook for veterinary students and also a reference book for clinical veterinarians), it had the answers I was seeking and was definitely worth the money 
 I have to disagree with the reviews above and say that I watched this movie on dvd having watched it as a kid twenty years ago. Unfortunately I couldn't find anything about this film I remember enjoying. It's a cross between The Blob, The Thing and a really crap detective movie. Moriarty's character is pretty smooth but the film culminates in a farce reminicent of an 80's kiddy movie. This film is definetly not for intelligent adults and you'll lose interest halfway through I guarantee it. No suspense, few laughs, and way to hokey to watch twice. If you love this movie you need to get out more. 
 The book was ok.  If you're a Couples fan you probably know most of what you're going to read already.  In some regards the author made Deborah out to be a little more "cartoonish' than she probably was.  Would've like  a little more depth rather than just remembrances of golf tournaments past 
 What is with this trend of good kid's books being followed up by seemingly rapidly produced, poorly thought out sequels?  As bad as sequel's are in American cinema, I think sequels in children's books are even worse.   We loved Five Little Monkeys Jumping on a Bed.  Cute pictures, the fun bouncy lines of the old kid's song, plus an opportunity to practice counting.  And there is a lesson there.  Kids:  Don't jump on the bed.  The book legitimizes the temptation, especially at the end when we see the mother taking her turn to jump on the bed.  But the monkeys fall off one by one, Momma calls the doctors, and we see the monkeys lines up with there ice bags on their heads in their post-concussive stupors.    But we recently got "Five Little Monkeys Sitting in a Tree."  The helpful everyday lesson for kids in this book is don't taunt a crocodile.  Okay, perhaps one could generalize this and interpret it as a useful aphorism for navigating hierarchies, but doesn't quite live up to the standard of the nice, concrete "no more monkeys jumping on the bed."  But beyond the pointlessness of this book, it's terrifying.  Although, in the end it is revealed that the monkeys do not get eaten by the crocodile (and on subsequent readings one spots them hiding in the tree, which is slightly clever), we spend 16 of the 28 pages thinking that some or all of the mischievous monkeys have been eaten by Mr. Crocodile.  We see nice colorful illustrations of distressed relatives including the frantic mother sobbing inconsolably.    I know, I've been told I take these books too seriously.  Maybe your children won't be as traumatized as I was, I don't know.  Maybe it's a good way to teach math.  And, I suppose, also an opportunity to teach about the cruel, pitiless realities of the animal kingdom.  And to teach that the inherent nature of life is suffering.  Ultimately these are important lessons for the toddlers.  Just a bit heartless and harrowing for my taste. 
 I thought the patterns were fun and was anxious to make many of them; however, the patterns sizes were no where near what I needed for my Chihuahua.  Even so my Chihuahua is of the portly/chubby type, the sizes were still too big. I consider myself an intermediate knitter; yet in all honesty, having to re-guage a pattern, change the cast-on, the measurements, the inc's, dec's, etc etc etc is too much of a bother. Don't get me wrong, I always gauge my work and if I have to adjust a few sts here and there and/or change ndl sizes, I'm ok with that... I just don't want to reinvent the whole pattern 
 There is not much to say about this book except that it is often extremely confusing for the layman. The examples skip steps, there is usually no explanation as to how to apply the theorems and one is often completely clueless as to how to do the exercises, or much guesswork must be done on how to apply the given formulas.  If you are already knowledgeable on the subject of numerical analysis this book might be a good reference for refreshing your memory but for the beginner it is for the most part going to be a frustrating waste of time 
 I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department.  THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.    This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together.  Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.  THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one).  The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so.  The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony.  The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.  I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots.  There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable.  But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.  If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead 
 Good DVD, but I did not feel it is worth the selling price.  The DVD primarily concentrates on 12 basic striking movements starting from the seated position.  There is a bonus feature from one of his seminars.  This feature was helpful because he gives additional tips on the movements and points out common mistakes.  I would have preferred sections of his live seminar edited into the main instructional section.  One has to refer to both the seminar and the instructional section to gather all the information provided in the DVD. 
 I was intrigued by this book because of the glowing reports I read about it on several homeschooling websites.  The entire text is available online, so I thought I would read a section to get a feel for how it is written.  I chose a subject that I have done a great deal of research on, and was amazed that hardly a sentence in the entire section was correct.  It was full of misinformation, long discredited theories and even character slander.  I am very disappointed both in the book and in the websites that are recommending it 
 Even though this is a "popular" version of the theory, with the considerable advantage of being by Einstein himself, it is not so easy as the presentation may imply. Einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than a high-school knowledge. It might be true in his time, but nowadays the book demands a longer study in Physics. I offer myself as an example: I'm a literature student in post-graduation level, and simply couldn't grasp the meaning of many mathematical demonstrations he uses to make his points. His reasoning is also obscure in many passages (what are really those 'galilean coordinates'?). Perhaps these details seem self-evident for professional readers, but they are not for the general public (the implied target of the book). In brief, Einstein didn't succeed completely in his attempt at popularization.  
 I bought two of these based on a 2005 customer review saying they don't have automatic shutoff, but now they do.  I guess this is considered an improvement, but I bought them for an elderly cat, and she can't reset the control every hour.  They are a good value if you don't mind the auto shutoff 
 nowhere in the description does it mention the mA rating of these batteries. i bought them thinking i was going to receive the most current sanyo offering. to my sad surprise i ened up with the older 800mA version.  my research indicated that sanyo makes the very best AAA rechargeable battery today. just be sure to get the newer 1000mA version, not these 
 Anthropomorphisation is only funny to a certain extent and when an animal's original character is preserved. In this movie, you see some mutants that you can't even guess what they are (neither from their appearance nor from their behavior). A good animated movie about animal life (e.g. Over The Hedge, Ice Age, etc.) involves thorough observation of fauna prior to attempts of recreating it on screen. Poor, poor plot line.       
 Only works properly if you are not moving AND in a zero-gravity environment 
 Very disappointing. The only interesting bits are the correspondence section and the chapter written by a survivor of an late 60s-early 70s Canadian experimental psychiatric unit. The rest I found to be an unstructured shambles. The author seems to be have over-stretched himself and there's no kind of any narrative thread. He also seems to be a bit paranoid, making statements like "By definition, all intelligence agents are liars." Also, he seems to dismiss the work of Peter Duesberg by claiming that the publisher of one of Duesberg's books is an "Ultracon".  For what it's worth, I thought that the book Duesberg co-wrote, "Why We Will Never Win the War on AIDS" was excellent, so I guess that may make me an "Ultracon" too?! Also, there's very little about what it says the subject matter is on the cover: "CIA Mind Control Operations in America" and there's no proper bibliography and no index. I would recommend books such as The Search for the Manchurian Candidate or The Men Who Stare at Goats instead, or maybe even just enter "ELF waves" into a search engine 
 I found this book is poor quality and an inappropriate gift for a six-year-old boy (who loves stories about ancient China). The paperback format is flimsy. The illustrations are all black and white, and have the quality of a photocopy. And, the text talks about burying laborers alive 
 So sad to see that this was "Manufactured in China," otherwise I would have given this heart-tugging nostalgia-waxing book 5 stars. Sigh, is nothing sacred anymore? Apparently not 
 This book is a big check-list.  Do not buy it if you are actually looking for building code information.  However, it would probably be useful to contractors who want to be sure they have covered all bases.  (I gave it two stars because it was not useful for me. 
 Literary critic should have titled this little guide `What to Read and Why,' seeing as he devotes only a few paragraphs to why reading might be valuable. That said, Bloom is a terrifyingly accomplished reader, but he isn't much of a thinker or a critic in the way Benjamin or Derrida were. Bloom's incessant propensity to judge all literature from the `how is this compared to Shakespeare' lens is foolish and lacking in any insight. At times his criticism seems almost amateurish and rushed. He doesn't seem to be a very good reader of Hemingway, for instance. At the outset of a review of `Hills Like White Elephants,' Bloom writes that "Hemingway's personal mystique-his bravura poses as warrior, big-game hunter, bullfighter, and boxer-is irrelevant to `Hills Like White Elephants' as its male protagonist's insistence that `You know that I love you'" (47). Yet later in Bloom's review, he writes [on `The Snows of Kilimanjaro']: The irony is at Hemingway's expense, insofar as Harry prophesies the Hemingway who, nineteen days shor of his sixty-second birthday, turned a double-barreled shotgun on himself" (49). Bloom seems to have reversed tactics here. Never the less, Bloom is an undeniably great reader of poetry; in this volume he tells you all about his personal favorites: Stevens, Whitman, Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, etc. Kind of fun, but far from great criticism.  
 I bought this book from Amazon recently, they have been great about getting it resolved but from what we can tell after having replaced twice the serial number that they mention on the book is not included in any of the books Amazon has in stock 
 Knowing I would be forced to study this work for my A Level in English Lit, I was sure I would enjoy it due to the comedy and satire involved.  I was wrong.  As the first reviewer claimed, The Way of the World is just like a soap opera!  I appreciate the intention of Congreve was to satirise the follies of the upper classes at the time but this does not make the play any less tedious.  The plot is unnecessarily complex and rather difficult to follow at times.  It all boils down to romance and infidelity in the end, as one might expect.  Granted, it is fairly well written, but if there's a stupid plot and irritating, useless characters, no amount of creative flair in writing can compensate.  As well as that, the language, while not difficult, is different from that of modernity so makes it awkward.  OK, we expect this from an 18th century piece of literature, but it still causes problems for a modern audience/reader.  The worst thing was being told by the teacher when we were meant to laugh - that obviously kills any comedy value in the play.  Exam boards should add some more modern plays to their syllabus!  Not to mention ones with meaningful, interesting plots and characters.  This is not worth the paper it's written on, in my humble opinion 
 I picked up this book in the best-seller section and read the blurb: "Katie Wilkinson has finally found the perfect man - but one day he suddenly disappears, leaving behind only a diary written by a new mother named Suzanne for her baby, Nicholas.....As Katie reads on, she realizes that the man she loves is Suzanne's husband.  Now, filled with terror and hope, Katie must struggle to understand what has happened - and find out if her new love has a prayer of surviving."  Well, DUH.  It's a romance and Matt is the "perfect man."  OBVIOUSLY Suzanne and Nicholas are dead, and once Katie reads the diary her deepened love and understanding will help Matt to recover and they will live happily ever after.  But wait.  The quote at the top from the New York Times says, "The idea is to curl up and enjoy....you haven't guessed how this story ends."  Well, that's interesting.  If a New York Times reviewer didn't guess the ending, I must be wrong.  Then the quote on the front from People says "A love story as suspenseful as any thriller..."  Not as good a source as the NYT, but usually pretty reliable for beach reading books.  And although I had never read James Patterson, I knew he was more of a mystery or thriller type author.  Well, I thought, a love story/thriller with an ending that the NYT didn't see coming?  That sounds pretty good.  Well, if you love gushing romance, I guess this is pretty good (although I think even Harlequin's most romantic author would blush to submit some of this hogwash).  If you think there is the slightest mystery about the ending, there isn't.    Well, yes, there is one tiny surprise near the end, but it's a surprise only because the author unfairly manipulates the reader into believing that a certain fact is true.  Skillful manipulation of a reader is fine.  I have enjoyed many mysteries where the author has cleverly but fairly led the reader to jump to the wrong conclusion.  However, this author blatantly shoves the reader to the wrong conclusion.  Therefore, it is a surprise when you realize the truth, but FAR more annoying than moving or sad or whatever it was supposed to be.  However, I think even if Amazon allowed zero stars, I would give this a one, because I do like The Five Balls metaphor 
 I thought the album was boring.  I didn't watch Nashville Star but I'm a big country music fan and I like to listen to new artists.  I bought the cd and loved the catchy song "I Break Things".  The other songs really didn't grab me, even after several listens.  I was disappointed in her cover of "I'm Not Lisa"- although Erika Jo has a beautiful voice, I found the rendition lacking emotion.  She's a good singer but I hope her next album has some better material 
 DON'T BUY... It is terrible as a matter of fact two of the DVD's in the collection are the same..A total let down and I can't believe they are selling the DVD like this.A total waste of money.. 
 I thought this book was boring and too drawn out. It took me over 3 months to read simply because I didn't want to pick it back up! The plot was good...it was different but as with all of Ms. Steel's novels, it is centered around a beautiful rich, successful woman, Isabella, who has some sort of tragedy and we read about her sadness and depression for most of the book until she finally meets someone to help her pick up the shattered pieces of her broken heart. This book is very, very slow and I found myself falling asleep every time I read it. I would not reccommend it. She has better novels out there 
 Well written and interesting, but very outdated.  You're better off with Keen's new _Medieval Warfare_ or Verbruggen or R.C. Smail (Crusading Warfare) or France's new book 
 I purchased this item and it did not work in two 2005 dvd players. It freezes everytime after the first category. It only worked on the computer. I emailed the company (MGA) and they knew about it. They told me, "yes", that this dvd does not work properly in some dvd players. Unfortunately, this information is only listed in the instruction manual. If you want to play this on your television, I would be very hesistant to purchase it. Maybe it will work in 2006 dvd players, but my two 2005 dvd players, it did not work properly. [... 
 Avoid this review book.  I am a teacher of Calculus, and I am going to teach AP Calculus next year.  Unlike most students who need to review, I already know the material 100%.  I was SHOCKED by the amount of errors and misprints that are in this book.  If you are a student who doesn't know Calculus that well, you are going to think that YOU are the one making errors, but it is the book that is wrong.  I contacted the publisher, and they have yet to give me a decent response.  I feel this book should be pulled from the shelves.  They should title it "1 Step to a 1", and the one step is to buy this book 
 I actually bought this film without seeing it first, so overwhelmingly positive were most of the other reviews found here.  After watching about the first 15 minutes, both my fiancee and I were asking ourselves, "How could ANYONE think this film is good?" This is one of the WORST films I've ever watched. The opening sequence is great, but the rest of film moved at a snail's pace and the plot was absolutely pointless.  Yes, Mulcahy's style is great as in his other films, but he should have become a Director of Photography, NOT a director of people.  While Dolph is as good as Dolph typically gets in a film, the other actors were grade Z cast-offs (although it was fun to see 'Psycho' from "Stripes" working again, as a security guard), who delivered their lines as if they had memorized them five minutes before shooting.  There is BARELY ANY ACTION during the remainder of the film, and the flashback sequences show a plot which is just as lame as the story currently unfolding.  The female lead was simply not believable as a sniper.  I don't know how anybody was able to receive financing to film so stupid a story, but I guess the direct-to-DVD trade is only interested in making a profit of $-- the same amount of money I paid for this film at Wal-mart.  I was very disappointed, because I was all set to see a great Lundgren movie -- and I'm even madder at all the Amazon.com reviewers who whet my appetite with their great reviews.  Jean-Claude Van Damme's newest flick, 'Derailed,' is even better than this piece of ... -- and I HATED that movie 
 Straight off - when this printer detects that you've re-filled an ink cartridge, it refuses to perform any further head alignments.  Even though there is plenty of paper in the tray, and you've been printing ok only seconds before, it throws a NO PAPER error when a head re-alignment is attempted. Yet, if you try and print again, it suddenly thinks there is paper in the tray.  Not only that, but once it detects a refill, it automatically un-aligns your print heads to teach you a lesson for not using Canon ink!  Putting it simply, if it detects you're filling up the ink yourself, it un-aligns your print head, and refuses to try and realign them.  That, in anyone's book, is a DIRTY TRICK.  You'll find that most printer manufacturers are now pulling tricks like this, as a response to a growing number people choosing to re-fill their own cartridges, purely for financial reasons.  They sell the printers cheap enough, but my word, they make the price of the printer back over and over again with the price they charge for the ink.  A study has shown, that if you actually remove the liquid from the ink (which is basically cheap solvent), the remaining residue costs the user more than Gold, weight for weight!  What a con!  Appart from that, it prints very well indeed 
 Based on other customer reviews of this book I was expecting quite a bit more.  The humour is unintelligent and repetitive.  There are a small number of jokes that are over-extended in order to fill a book.  There is probably only enough original, unrepeated material to fill one chapter 
 I love cheesey horror films from the late 60's/early/70's. With that being said I was very dissapointed watching this movie. It's bad. Not bad in a good cheesey way, but bad as in almost impossible to watch. Here are my reasons why:  -The music. My god, I have never heard such wrong music for a movie. When I see people getting killed I know that I want to hear soft James Taylor type music. It added nothing to the atmosphere of the film, and in fact hurt it.  -The editing. I have never seen such bad editing. One moment one of the victims is across a large creek from her attacker, and the next the attacker is on the same side chasing her again. I could go on, but there are so many editing goofs that I would be here all night describing them.  -The screenplay. The situation itself could have been believable if the dialogue , and scenes, had been better written. As it is the entire situation seemed really unbelievable. It makes me wonder how this film ever got made.  -The acting. None of the story was believable because the acting was so awful. As I said before I love cheesey movies. Sometimes that includes bad acting, but when it is combines with the above stated faults it makes it a horrible thing to witness.  The reviewer who said that this is an important horror film has got to be kidding me. Hammer horror films from the same era are important. AP horror films from this era are important. This film? It should be forgotten and avoided at all costs. I knew that there was a reason why I have never liked Wes Craven's movies 
    Early movie apperance by the lovely (but somewhat underwelming) Laura Harring sees her and cast of dancers performing numerious music numbers in this Spanish musical that tells a story.  While the music and dance is impressive.  It sort of floods the story up too much, so that at the end,  YOU say "What was that about.?"  I guess it was supposed to be a romantic comed 
 Well, I read somewhere in a review that this movie truly was meant for women. Myself, looking at Kelly Brook, I can't see how that remark is justified. In many ways it might be true since the concept and story is almost something you find in the typical cheap and dirty romance novels.   How is Kelly Brook's character, the heroine? Granted she plays the character of a beautiful slightly-dimwitted wife of a rich insecure jerk, stranded in a deserted island with an attractive Latin jack-of-all-trades. Typical and expected, the wife has an illicit affair with "Manuel" the Latin hard-throve. What bothers me really, is that the husband is made to be the villain, when his insecurities and suspicions where in fact correct and justified. He may have initially being a jerk, she married him anyway, perhaps for his ability to provide? Then again, maybe I am looking too much into this one than what it deserves.   To be really honest, I was channel browsing and had a sudden glimpse of Kelly Brook, so I put the remote control down. I only missed about 10 minutes of the whole movie. The dialog was horrendous and unnatural, in my opinion. Kelly was made to be really dumb and overly demure, and the couple doing the dishonorable act was made to be the victim and heroine, or survivor.   The concept and acting was shallow, vain, and superficial. The scenes seemed inconsistent. For example: a Tribal ritual is introduced at the end without anything ever leading to it.  This flick reminded me somehow of those old 1970s B movies of women in jail, etc. Where the acting was not of high priority. Again, two stars for Kelly's obvious "Talents" if you know what I'm referring to. 
 I give it two stars for the Snorkel, the mask and the fins are just JUNK!!  The Mask: The mask is a purge mask...meaning it has a small disk that, in theory,lets you blow any excess water that enters the mask by just blowing. The problem is this, any speck of debris that gets caught between the disk or a simple malformation will cause water to constantly enter the mask. AND if you happen to suck in via your nose you'll definately get a mask full of water.  The Fins: The're a strap type fin which is good BUT they are so tight you can't wear any dive booties or dive socks which comes in quite handy if you're walking over coral, rocks or any other sharp objects. The biggest issue with the fins is the strap comes off while swimming. This set was for my wife and hers came off I didn't think to much of it until mine did too. You might say, buy smaller fins but they run in a Size x to Size X so you can't buy any smaller.   The Snorkel is ok, It's a little short but it works 
 I am sure some people would find this DVD useful, but it wasn't at all what I expected.  This may be attributed to my not being familiar with yoga, and have nothing to do with this particular DVD, but I wasn't even able to watch the entire thing 
 I am sorry but I cannot give this book a good rating. It claims to have life lessons on raising a girl and all I found was a collection of sayings. Some of them were good suggestions, but most were just sentimental "warm fuzzies." Maybe this is all that some guys need to help them raise their daughter, but I have four and I need much more help than this book was able to deliver. Also, before you buy check the dimensions of the book. It is really small and each page contains about a sentence. It is really not worth the money you will spend on it. Sorry, but that's how I see it 
 I, like other reviewers, admire Ms. Turnipseed's effort in writing a novel that shows young, black professionals in a positive light.  I especially like the fact that her characters possesed backgrounds that are not typical of the average African-American.   The main character, Noire strongly disliked 'high-flautin' black folks whose main goal in life is living a flashy lifestyle.  Though she respected their educational accomplishments, she didn't respect their need for living the high life.  Noire was supposedly a bohemian...a hippie, a creative, free spririt.    It was during a book reading (given by a high-flautin brotha) that Noire met Innocent, an African born, French speaking banker who was gorgeous and polite.  Turns out that Innocent was a friend of the brotha who gave the book reading.  At that point, the book went down hill.  Ms. Turnipseed contradicted herself several times.  She introduced us to many characters, but we never got a chance to really 'know' them.  Several times I was confused by Noire's attitude towards Innocent.  In many cases I had to re-read the previous page because I thought I missed something or skipped some pages.  To be quite honest, Noire got on my nerves.  She was wishy-washy and whiny.  Noire was in school studying for her Ph.D.  But what was her final goal?  We never found out.  She liked studying languages in foreign countries, but ultimately what did she want?  Was her plan to go to school for the rest of her life?  She spent a lot of her early college years traveling abroad studying languages and was blessed enough to travel during her Ph.D studies. How many 'average' black folks get to do that?  She dispised black folks who grew up with a privileged lifestyle, but yet she had several opportunities to study and live abroad.  Noire seemed to 'hate' anyone who was trying to better themselves, but wasn't that what she was doing?  If she truly disliked the expensive life, why didn't she refuse to wear the expensive outfit and shoes that Innocent bought for her?  It was a scene straight out of Pretty Woman.  Innocent received an invitation to attend a party at the last minute so he had a stylist bring over a beautiful dress along with make-up for Noire.  I was expecting her to go off on him for doing that, but she didn't.  Again, contradicting and confusing.   And Innocent's character lacked the depth that we thought he possesed in the beginning of the book. He seemed like a really nice guy, but we never really got to know what made him tick.   He had a sensitive quality about him that was really attractive, but out of the blue, he would snap or get angry.  That attitude never quite fit with the overall personality that Ms. Turnipseed tried to create for him.    Not only were the contradictions distracting, the story itself became boring.  It dragged on with a lot of stuff that was unncessary (was Noire in a bi-sexual 'relationship with her friend Arike', or was that just self-discovery? And where did it fit in with the overall story?)  We met Noire's father, mother, ex step-mother, half-brother (who had dyslexia) and her creole grandmother who preferred 'light-skin' over dark skin.  Noire traveled to New Orleans to visit her father's family, but I still can't figure out the purpose of that trip.    Bottom line, I was sooo bored with the book I wanted to cry. I just sort of skimmed the last few chapters just so I could say that I finished the book. And the ending was vague, but I guess we're supposed to come up with our own ending.  I hope that Ms. Turnipseed doesn't give up.  Maybe her next book will be more indepth. I really wanted to give it a 2.5 since it wasn't quite a two and definitely not a 3.  I bought this book at Half-Price Books for $6.  I'm really glad I didn't have to pay full price.  I would have been very disappointed. 
 The book is very well written. It is the detail description of somehow mysterious pop group, which is placed just after Elvis and Beatles, as far as the number of sold records is concerned. You will not find here something completely unexpected. Insteed, you will find a lot of details which are not easly available. So, for anybody who is a real fan of ABBA - this book is a must !  
 I think my title says it all. It was directionless and pointless. The only character that elicited any sympathy at all was Doug, and even he seemed to be drifting without any purpose. Even the gay issue failed to elicit any tension between the characters. I kept wondering when the plot would start, but it didn' 
 Much is made of dyson's intellectual prowess; this just goes to show you that all things are relative. There are organisms shuffling down the street to whom dyson's intellect would, one assumes, seem impressive. But that don't necessarily make it so. You may, at some point, have heard the term pinhead. The term signifies that the owner of such a head has a tiny little brain, a "peabrain" if you will. This, in a nutshell, is dyson. He meanders around offering weak commentary and observation that appeals chiefly to the MTV and BET crowd. This is to say, he offers nothing of value other than allowing Penn to make their quota. Do yourself a favor and avoid at all costs 
 In the early going, I thought the choice was between four and five stars.  As the movie progressed, my rating dropped to somewhere between three and four, so clearly the first half of the movie is better than the second.  The ending was so disappointing that I had to drop my rating to two stars.  It is about a Polish man in France who marries a French girl but is divorced by her because he is unable to make love to her.  He returns to Poland without her, manages to get rich, and comes up with a plot to get revenge on his beloved Dominique.  The problem with this writing is that he loves her, so why is he plotting revenge against her?  It is senseless.  The ending is utterly surreal.  She should hate him for what he has done to her, but she is smiling to him.  He is looking at her and crying.  He has betrayed her in a cruel way.  He doesn't have the right to be crying for her.  That is like Hitler crying for the Jews.  He is still in a position to help her out, but he won't.  It's really pretty sickening.  The story becomes unclear enough as it is, without adding some fantasy scenes or memories about a wedding and a kiss.  It left me angrily saying "What the hell is going on?"  I really hate it when a director becomes unclear and plays with the audience.  I don't find that cute at all.  Tell the damn story and tell it clearly.  Besides, the ending sucks 
 Complaining, whinning, mumbling, beer drinking, bathtub soaking, unattractive Alison and her overgrown, teenage hairstyled, beer drinking kid of a husband and their apy middle daughter.  The most horrible series I've seen on TV, in the end Alison seems to "solve" whatever the problem is but it's not worth the watch. No one in my family enjoyes this show 
 Reading this book was like driving the interstate from point A to point B, exiting every ramp, driving around the countryside and then on-ramping again only to wonder when the end-point is reached why the journey was begun at all. I admit, I'm not a fan of half-page sentences, and there were far too many for me in this slow-moving, tedious misadventure. I admit to feeling some sympathy for Jackson Brodie, a sad plodding investigator who even his ex-wife beats up, but had little feeling for the other characters. Ms. Atkinson writes well and can turn a phrase, but for me, most of the phrases weren't worth turning. This book read much longer than its length and only sheer determination caused me to finish it. If you're looking for a well-written work of literary fiction where the journey means more than the plot, this may be a book you'd like. But if you're looking for a gripping mystery taut with suspense, keep looking. Maybe it was personal preference, but CASE HISTORIES just wasn't my cup of tea 
 I found this book to be flat, dull and boring and the authour to be rather self-congratulatory.  The author travels from one small Sicilian town to another trying to ... do what?  I dunno.  I read every word, and she didn't have much to say about Sicily or her people except that she likes them.  She really likes them!    As the series of vignettes progressed, it became difficult to follow any kind of time line. What happened when and with whom?  Dunno.  I am still unclear on how this book of little stories was organized, if indeed it was.    Finally, I don't know that I gleaned anything from the book except that the author really likes Sicily and she's really glad that she got to live there and she's really lucky that anyone would publish her book 
 This thing never worked out of the box.. not worth trying to RMA it for the low cost of it, but dont recommend it. 
 What a disappointment!  Every time it gets hot, it cuts straight to the end.  The movie is entirely foreplay!!  
 This game looked so crazy I couldn't resist it.  I mean Disney and Squaresoft trying to merge Final Fantasy and a load of Disney cartoons must have seemed like a cool idea in Japan since they love cartoons so much, but in the USA it's just insane.  On top of that you have voice talents from Mandy Moore to Lance Bass, and as production values go you knew you had to be in for one of most ridiculous games in history.   Hardcore fans were bothered that this looked like a kids' game but aren't games supposed to be aimed at children and teens anyway?  I was ultimately disappointed with Kingdom Hearts.  The world and characters of Kingdom Hearts is not really about a Final Fantasy Disney crossover it's just a place for the kids you control to have out their little melodrama.  It's like the idea of Disney meets Final Fantasy just takes a back seat.  Once you get past all the hype Kingdom Hearts is boring and frustrating.  A nagging issue is the tiny areas in this game.  "Planet Alice in Wonderland" consists of four small rooms of course you will spend a great deal of time in them fighting off monsters.  The combat is a blend of chaotic button mashing and watching your party members act like total fools until they die.  The worst of it is respawning monsters, you can't take a step without having to fight and re-fight hoards of shadow munchkins that you had just defeated.  Because of this you'll spend the majority of your money on healing items.  Bosses are a nightmare since they are hard to survive and take forever to kill (30 minutes is normal.)  Since combat is so simple it really makes the drawn out battles beyond boring.  After beating 2 bosses I was done with this game.  I know that Kingdom Hearts 2, Mushashi Samurai Legend, and Final Fantasy 13 all have the same combat woes.  I wish Squaresoft would learn that respawning enemies and bosses with 9 million hit points are a thing of the past 
 I don't want to waste a lot of time reviewing this book, nor do I recommend you waste yours reading it.  I must admit, I couldn't get any further than the introduction, but when I hit the end of the introduction where it said, "The book (China Streetsmart) can be summed up in a single sentence: "The biggest secret of doing business in China is - there is no secret; it's just plain common sense," I realized I had also come to the end of my interest in this book. I agree with other reviewers who note there are much better guides out there to doing business in China 
 If you are in search of an autobiography of a dedicated and intrinsically emotional scientist, then this is the book for you.  However, if truly interested in the actual neuroscience this book claims to teach, search for a more nonfictional and scientific work.  Pithy factual information of such molecules of emotion is obstructed with unnecessary personal dramatics and stories loosely tied to the intended subject matter.  While the book provides insight to the life of a cutting-edge scientist, the autobiographical nature obscures the supposed purport of the book: to teach the neuroscience of emotions.  
 I stopped reading after 150 pages. There are three interwoven tales. The first of a serial murderer who wanders around trying to evade a supernatural monster, and his half-crazy ex-wife who seems to get off on the prospect of being killed. The second of a high-tech pirate ship that wanders around, kills a few people, tries to find out something about a mysterious device. The third about two men who only seem to wander around aimlessly. And the prose, which initially felt interesting, seems to wander around aimlessly, too. A pity, since a nice SF world shines through 
 This book describes Cameroon as the armpit of Africa. Seriously. It said that. At least 1/3 of the book is on all the different types of diseases one is sure to catch being there. It says that Cameroon is unique in that there is a type of malaria that will KILL you in 24 hours of the first symptom. This book scared me so much that I went to Egypt alone instead of going with my friends to Cameroon. There arent really any books just on Cameroon. Lonely Planet has one on West Africa which I should have gotten. My friends went and had a wonderful time. The book should have talked about the good things this country has- which as it turns out there are other things there that Malaria! Perhaps if I would of read a different book then I would have not canceled my flight to Cameroon. 
 This is a five CD book.  The author does not actually begin discussing the battle until well into the FOURTH CD.  Need I say more 
 When the truth about 911 is known he must not escape justice. He is a criminal and must be treated like one. Christian Peper  
 This feeder only worked 1 out of 3 times, and left our cat hungry for 2 whole weekends while we were away.  After the first use, the feeding mechanism broke, the timer no longer worked, and the time of day reset itself the second it was set to feed.  I do not recommend this item 
 This book is the typical fake statistics written by political scientists who do not know that they are talking about to political scientists who will never know about the true statistics. Do not waste your money and time on such junks. Another book to avoid: unifying political methodology by Gary King. Spend your money and time on books written by real statisticians instead.

 The Civ name has been tarnished.  Analogously, one thing I have been learning is that just because Sid Meier's name is on a product, it doesn't mean the product is good.  In the case of CivCity: Rome, unfortunately, it doesn't just come in at "modestly good" - it comes in at "dismally poor."  I've tried hard not to let this influence my beliefs about Civilization in general, but after Civ4 came out, I am starting to believe that Firaxis Games and Sid Meier are on their way out.  And now this...  I regret to inform that the great Civ titles were made a long time ago.  The offerings of today have a simple pattern: the production was rushed and the title came out with major bugs; the games add unnecessary features designed to justify the overall cost; and the consumers are often abused with ridiculous expansion packs containing features that should OBVIOUSLY have been included in the original release - they take advantage of our love for the franchise.  This pattern is so evident that the whole Sid Meier and Civ franchise is degenerating.  It almost seems, especially with the release of CivCity: Rome, that we are once again expected to simply drop cash for new products based on our love for the old.  But the developers are not living up to our expectations for producing great games!  Stay away from CivCity: Rome.  Besides the obvious blunders associated with all the bugs, you will see that even the best patch cannot make the graphics look good, the narration and sound effects better, or the interface to work properly.  The game is a dismal failure, and I am sorry to report that.  It seems like Firefly Studios had an idea and got the license from Firaxis, but they just cheesed it.  Watching what Maxis (The Sims and SimCity franchises) and Firaxis (Civilization franchise) are doing to their most loyal fans is like watching your dad get drunk 
 This book offered very little new information other than the basics that any of us who have ever done process improvement already know. Although the authors mention how Lean works in non-manufacturing environments, their examples are almost purely manufacturing.  Not a bad read for a college student, but a waste of time for practitioners. Totally an introduction 
 The definitive book about Bill is "No One Left To Lie To", by Christopher Hitchens.  He knows how to take a scapel and wield it to reveal the core of a maggot. This book is way too soft 
 WARNING: Look carefully at the title listed above before ordering.  Amazon is listing the same reviews for both Maier's "The First Christmas" and his children's book "The Very First Christmas."  "The First Christmas" is NOT the children's book "The Very First Christmas" as suggested in most of the reviews and Amazon's own description.  It is actually a book for adults.  It is an interesting archaeological study of the story of Christmas, but it is NOT a children's book 
 There is nothing I could add here that wasn't already said by the other 1 star reviewers that preceeded me. Just a couple of generic trends: 1. Lots of books get published (and unfortunately read) based on the author's name. Although Moss Cnater has never belonged to the senior guru league (in my opinion and I have read her revious works - tedious and uninspiring), Harvard Business school still carries some weight, although one has to wonder why, based on many distinctly ordinary, even bad books they publish through their Press. And if you read Harvard Business Review, you should have realised by now how mediocre and way overpriced that publication is.  2. One reviewer wonders how could she, a professor at already mentioned uni write so badly. People erroneously associate things together. Just because somebody teaches at a university does not make them good writers; heck, it doesn't even make them good teachers. How many truly great teachers do you remember from your uni days? Zussamenfassung (a weird German word for Summary): Avoid like a plague 
 Andrew Weill is perhaps the most well-known of these type of practioners.  Unfortunately, some of what he has to say has been clinical disproven. For example, in study after study, large amnounts of Vitamin C given orally do absolutely nothing more than a   placebo for cancer patient.  Yet he still preaches this.  Given intravenously, actually, there is some evidence that it may work for some people..but it does not work by stimulating your immune system..it works in a different way.  The book How To treat and Prevent Cancer with Natural Medicine is far superios in my opinion, even though it was written by four naturopaths in 2002.  Even then they admitted that clinical studies were showing that there was no advantage of taking Vitamin C orally over a placebo,  and the authors freely admitted it. But much of what the discussed in that book..Eight Magic supplements to take when you have cancer..has actually been proven. I am a cancer patient with myeloma.  Maitake D fraction, curcumin (it must be taken w/bioperine an hour before meals), selenium, and some other things they mention have all been proven in clinical studies or are being worked on.  They do not promise that they have a cure of anything..they only say it may help in the context of complimentary medicine. They do not claim an organic diet will cure cancer or that medical science would hide it if they have a cure.  The book by Quiallan I think claims that an organic diet will cure you, and there is post after post that this has actually worked.  Maybe it has..but as a myeloma patient..my immune system is overstimulated, so I cannot take most immune system supplements..and some like Vitamin C are actually antagonistic In Vitro to myeloma treatments..this usually translates to the same thing in the body..unlike positive in studies that often do not pan out.  Anyway, I am not saying Dr. Weill is all wrong, but do not pretend he has a cure.  I have known secondhand two people who have been cured by long fasts of only carrot juice, another two by healers (I  am not religious), and one who claims that barley juice and lowering his PH totally got rid of his cancer.  I believe these people all may have gotten rid of their LOCALIZED tumors this way. For blood cancers, such as leukemia and myeloma (a cancer of blood produced in the marrow), we do not exactly have localized tumors.  But with the addition of supplements mentioned in Dr. Murray et al's book, my response to medications has been phenomenal and I have went into remission. Unfortunately, at this time, myeloma always comes back from remission. There is new understanding why this may be so..that just came out December 2005.  There is even a drug available..but it will not be available to myeloma patients for a long while 
 The story of this book does not hold up to the suspense of the rest of the series. I could not finish this book as the story simply wasn't interesting enough. The dialogue bits 'policeman vs psychologist' are simply ridiculous. 
 I've been wanting to see this movie and I finally did on LOGO. I'm just happy I waited untill It came on TV. I though it was going to be way better considering what reviewers everywhere said about it. The romance was slim to none. I thought the other guy on the cover was going to have a bigger role. Well, I won't say too much without destroying the movie for those who have not seen it. Anyway, I would much rather watch Beautiful Thing, Get Real, All Over the Guy & The Incredibly True Adventure of Two Girls In love 
 Peter Lorre's ,"The Black Cat",is charmingly done.Yet,the other two are stinkers.I'm a Corman fan,but this was boring and silly to watch.I think they had a good idea ,bringing the trilogy it to the big screen.But,this version and interpretation of Poe's masterpieces didn't translate well at all.So ,beware of the dog 
 I suppose you will enjoy this if you really like Yo-Yo Ma at his most boring.  This is glorified elevator music and about as interesting 
 I read this book out of interest in South-East Asian culture which from the back sounds like what it addresses. However I have read few books that were more Euro-centric then this one. Very little of this book goes into information about the river or the people predating the French. I was also disappointed that almost every source that the author quotes is a minority, catholic, exile, political elite, European or mixed Chinese. The book is rather slow and the author seems to wish the return of the French and their "Charm". I wouldn't recommend this reading this book unless you're studying French colonialism.  
 I'm Italian (born and raised there) and I grew up on cappuccinos.  This is in absolute the most gorgeous way to make a terrible cappuccino. I have constant better result with the cheapest model made by Krupps.  Pros: Beautiful to look at Espresso is good  Cons: - It takes 15'-30' (minutes, not second!, and this is according to the manufacturer) to warm the machine up - The cappuccino is always watery - You need a stop watch to time exactly how much water you want in your espresso.  You get distracted, and suddenly your espresso looks like any 'American' style coffe 
 You can hear from the Windows Media samples that the tracks have been filtered to death.  A much more vibrant transcription of the same recordings is the wonderful "King Oliver's Creole Jazz Band: The Complete Set" 
 Teen Love on Relationships cannot even begin to compare with the Chicken Soup books.  There were too many questions and not enough stories.  And the questions that were asked are not usual questions that older teens would  ask.  Stick to the chicken soup 
 I'm sorry, but these just weren't for me, they have somewhat of a stale taste. I recommend buying a single bag before buying a case if you are at all hesitant 
 The fact that the author concludes her book with an "Apologia," where she apologizes for failing to meet the stated objective of the book, says everything. If only she had apologized on page one, I might have saved myself the money for this dud. I eagerly bought this book to learn more about my favorite Paris quarter, but I was very disappointed. The book lacks focus, direction, organization. There is some history, but it is as shallow as a high school theme paper. The author's frequent musings are painful, and she must believe that every thought entering her head is bookworthy (My voisine, that means neighbor in French, has beautiful auburn hair, but lately the roots have been showing and when I saw her on the street she didn't say hello. Is this something French or am I just prattling on again about boring, pointless details?) And, her musings on American public policy are equally painful, especially where she likens the treatment of alleged terrorists at Guantanamo Bay to the French Revolution, with its beheadings and children starving to death in prison. Even the descriptions of this beautiful, energetic quarter are weak, rambling and lacking any depth or emotion. What a disappointment. Quel dommage! 
 These noodles have a terrible, squidy texture and a wholly unpleasant smell.  They cook strangely and taste odd 
 The hope and insight that Dr. Meier gives those who have struggled with chemical imbalances is inspiring. His acceptance of people who are dealing with mental & emotional health issues is wonderful and necessary. Unfortunately, even in our modern culture, there are still stigmas attached to people with mental health problems. Dr. Meier and his co-authors truly understand the physiology of these problems. They have worked with thousands of people and have a real heart to help others. Their compassion and understanding are desparately needed in our churches and in our culture. However, this book does not have a healthy balance for Christians. It speeds right past encouragement and solid advice into some wild extremes.   According to Paul Meier, medications can be your savior and not much else is needed. Dr. Meier takes any and all responsibility off of the individual and places it squarely onto our brain's chemical imbalances. It's a shameless endorsement for medication and the Meier Day Programs. The end of the book reads like a corny science fiction novel (Benefits of Stem-Cell and Other Research, Computer Chips in Treatment, and Cloning p. 185-191...it's an entire review in and of itself). It's surprising that Dr. Meier dropped several names like Chuck Swindoll and Focus on the Family's Dr. Dobson in his book. Did either of these men take any time to read it? Do they realize what they are endorsing in this book? This guy is on the edge and going over fast!  The book speaks for itself....again and again. The first few pages begin by explaining to us that the key to happiness is found in taking medication. Dr Meier, himself, has found happiness and productivity in taking medication. He explains that he can't write books or even practice medicine without it:  "I have rather severe ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder). Before taking ADHD medications, I would sometimes make impulsive decisions that affected my family, such as blurting out negative comments or making impulsive financial decisions that hurt the family budget.  By taking ADHD medications every day, I can stay focused and organized and do a better job of being a family member and practicing psychiatry with my clients. They also help me write more articles and books. 	In my practice of medicine, without these ADHD meds, I could make multiple mistakes, such as leaving dates off prescriptions, losing focus while clients are sharing extremely pertinent data, and so on. Moreover, I write about two or three books every year whole on medications and could write only one book every two or three years without them. So if I were too prideful to admit that I had any mental dysfunction, and I refused to take psychiatric medications, I would hinder God, Who gave me that biochemical disability for a reason, using my books, radio talk shows, and TV guest appearances to influence millions of people for His cause. I would be taking the "all natural" route to impress my "new-age" neighbors and legalistic believers, but accomplish one-third as much for Jesus and for my family." - Paul Meier, M.D. p 10  And this happiness is intended for over half of the world's population. Does he really believe that it is just for the few who are really struggling and have tried all other alternatives? I don't think so. Dr. Meier believes that the answer to most all of our problems is found in taking medication.   "The January 17 Time magazine articles estimated that up to 50 percent of the world's population [3 billion people?] might have an underlying genetic propensity for mental health problems. That means that 50 % of those of us `lucky enough' to have blue genes often suffer from more psychiatric problems than the other half of the population. We are prone to depression, sadness and anger, especially under stressful circumstances...About 20 percent of the population [over 1 billion] either requires lifelong psychiatric medications to avoid depression and other mental disorders or they would enjoy great benefits from modern-day psychiatric medication." p. 9   "Tom Patterson was a good, godly, creative loving family man. He was active in a healthy local church. He spent a reasonable amount of time with his wife and children...But Tom inherited a `blue gene' illness: Bipolar I, with psychosis, that had never shown up all his life until age 36. No one would have ever suspected that a humble, godly, loving man like Tom could lose touch with reality within a couple of days... Godly people, when manic, do ungodly things and have no control over them. Their brain chemicals are imbalanced and they do not know what they are doing. Therefore, they have almost no control over their behavior. When Tom Patterson flipped totally out, he went to a large topless restaurant, bar and strip club in Houston and bought it from the owner on the spot, paying an exorbitant amount of money. Tom went on to have sexual activities with several of the dancers that night... Tom had to file for bankruptcy and sell his house and his business to pay for his purchase of the strip club... Tom had also given huge tips to everyone, from the strippers to the Mc Donalds waiters, to whom he gave a fifty-dollar tip for a hamburger. He was really grandiose when manic and the worst person on the planet when depressed. 	After a week at the state hospital, and three weeks at the Meier Day Program, where Dr. Clements or I saw him daily and adjusted his medications, Tom was doing better than he had ever done before - even before the illness appeared. He was bankrupt and embarrassed, but relieved when we told him it was not because of any sin in his life, just a chemical imbalance." - Paul Meier, M.D. p. 192-95	  "If you have the right amount of serotonin in your brain cell synapses, you are filled with love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, energy during the day, great sleep at night, and so on." p. 21 "Within ten weeks [of taking Lexapro] the serotonin level gets high enough again for you to experience love, joy, peace, gentleness, meekness, and patience instead of bitterness, depression, anxiety, irrabilitity, arrogance, and impatience. The latter are all the result of low serotonin levels caused either by genetics or by stress or by sin." p. 199  	"In dozens of years of treating thousands of people for bipolar illness, we do not know of a single case that God chose to heal. But a large number of them are having a huge impact on the world for Christ while taking medications to balance their brain chemicals." p. 197  I admit that I was tempted to try medication that works to bring about the fruit of the spirit in my life and that would heal me from my habits, sins as well as my emotional problems. This book explains in detail exactly which medications will work and gives the names and all the information needed to talk to a physician. But something just didn't ring true to me; I still believe there's something to be said for relying on the Lord and the Holy Spirit. I guess Dr. Meier would call me a legalist believer, but I still believe in the sovereignty of God and that His grace is sufficient. Dr. Meier would call me a masochist, but I'm not quite ready to trade in biblical confession, repentance and relying on God for the poppin of the pill. My depression and bouts of anxiety are not bad enough for me to exchange my faith for a manmade savior. For some, their issues may be that awful...and they must make the choice.   Unfortunately, I picked this up in my church's small bookstore. There is some good information here, but Dr. Meier's views are way too far-fetched. I would steer clear of Blue Genes and look for something a little more biblically balanced.  
 I just finished this book, and I wasn't too impressed.  I was expecting something more about the current conflicts between red states and blue states, an analysis of such conflicts, and what can be done about reconciling them; or even approaching the idea of citizenship through "branding" and fostering something similar to "consumer loyalty."  (That was the impression I got from reading the book jacket, anyway.)  Instead, the main point I got from the book is that "countries often contain different groups that disagree and might want to secede someday; no borders or nations are permanent."  Coming off a century in which the U.S. gained two states, Eastern Europe fractured, and many other international borders shifted, all I can say is a sarcastic, "imagine that."  Some people say that the formatting makes it easier to digest; I found it distracting.  Open up this book and you'll see an odd mix of formatting - some sentences are in large type, some are in small, some are oddly indented, and some even cascade down the page.  It reminded me of my friend's blog - she used to post song lyrics in that same format, with some lines given more emphasis than others.  As a result, I had a very hard time taking this book seriously.  Content-wise, I'm not sure how to judge it.  There were many citations and statistics and anecdotes and facts, but there wasn't an in-depth discussion of anything, and there probably aren't many readers who will go to the endnotes and evaluate each source.  (I sure didn't.)  I got the sense that it wasn't as well-thought-out as it should have been, with Enriquez citing a Yahoo! message board posting to back up his case about racism, coming to the simple conclusion that it's ironic that many liberals oppose No Child Left Behind because they traditionally love education reform (he doesn't acknowledge that there might be legitimate, non-political reasons for anyone to disagree with NCLB), and seeming to play games with statistics without any discussion of the studies/polls he took them, the methods with which they were gathered, or what their implications are beyond the obvious.  The book as a whole seemed too oversimplified.  There were some interesting passages - for instance, one chapter I found interesting described the different regions of Mexico and how they might split, if such a split should occur.  Enriquez says that we can look at what happens in other countries to see how future splits might occur in our own country.  The big statement of the book is that divisions are possible in any country; in a book titled "The Untied States of America," though, he should have focused more on the problems specific to the U.S., and what can be done about them.  When he does discuss the U.S., he spends a disproportionate amount of space on the periphery (such as U.S. terrorities abroad), and not enough on the red state/blue state polarization that seems to be sweeping the nation.  In short?  Some of it is interesting, and with the bizarre formatting and pictures, it's probably the shortest 275-page book you'll ever read (352 pages, if you include the long list of endnotes).  However, I don't think it's worth the price of admission - there are probably books that discuss this topic and do a better job of it

 I can't follow the bandwagon of congratulations for Joe Dante's MOH episode; this is unfortunate because Joe is one of my heroes. I respect that it sets out to do exactly what Joe and co. wanted it to do, but in the end it comes off as more of an indictment of Anne Cultor than it does the Iraq War. But it isn't the politics that left me wanting in this particular film, it was the fact that Dante was able to make a balls-to-the-wall horror movie again (THE HOWLING being a particular favorite of mine), but that isn't at all what we get. In some ways it seems silly to complain, given that the war is true horror; but Dante is a monsterkid, and I was really hoping for something else. Again, I respect his decision and his choices with this particular story, I was just hoping for something a little more fun. Shallow perhaps, but I'm a B-movie maven all the way. I'm happy that he has received good notices for this episode (Dante is super underrated), and definitely recommend it to those who are not really horror, or B-movie, fans, who are looking for something with a little more substance. The film is well made, and very humorous (only Dante would crank the gag of having famous "zombie" directors names' littering a group of headstones up a notch by adding Del Tenney!), and I recommend it to those not looking for a "horror" movie 
 Where Macworld is bad, Addict is dreadful. It is dumbed down to the level of Teen Beat, and the "reviews" don't deserve the name. The extent to which it drools over Apple is embarassing, leaving no pretence of independence. Like its competitor, it exploits the crummy support that typifies the computer industry, so we get articles about the "secrets" of such and such product. A "secret" in the computer industry is a feature or defect that has not been properly documented by the manufacturer. This should be blasted, not applauded. But Addict is happy to exploit readers by selling them the information they should have gotten when they purchased the product 
 Most everything included here is common sense.  There are a few important concepts included here, but they are better covered in other texts 
 Words simply do not express the waste of time this book is.  I cannot believe I even looked at it 
 This book was boring. It had a lot of boring, dry pages. It took place back in the days of the Titanic 
 Peter Breggin, Md, and his friends may benefit from misleading naive and desperate people.   Squiggle 
 I really loved his movies. Back when there was actually a budget of more than six figures. I have tried to stay a true fan, and have watched all his films. Now they are coming out every 60-90 days and they are trash. He is nothing but a ghost of his former self. Direction stinks, production quality stinks, plot stinks. I'm sad he can't get a film done in the US anymore, with a major studio. Where have all our action actors gone? They are all retired or making third rate direct to DVD trash like this. I'm finished. I can't take it anymore. I thought Submerged was it for me, but I kept coming back....hoping. Seagal has another movie coming out in a month or two (Romania again, ugh). It'll be the first I ever missed. Bye Steven, and good luck 
 I found myself after reading the book. Sincerely hoping the movie will have a different spin. This is an unsatisfying sequel to the novel Get Shorty. I love Elmore Lenord novels but this is a dud 
 and not in a good way; in the BS philosophy way. This movie tries to delve into new activism and the circle of political life, but it goes nowhere and explains nothing. One could say that perhaps the theme of the movie is futility. OK, fair enough, but maybe rearranging furniture is not the best course of action for political and social revolution. Just a thought. Stay away unless you are majoring in liberal arts. 
 The writer has such talent for making everything truly convincing, that I was very disappointed to realise, as I read, that this was really fiction. Too many inconsistencies and oddities. Kokopelli in Manitoba? boy, he's a long way from home! I've travelled in the South-West and known Navajo people, and Lakotas in South Dakota, and I've lived in Canada, though not Manitoba, and the points made by those who describe that western province are very convincing. No way do Andrews' descriptions ring true.   The clincher was where at the end Andrews is strictly enjoined not to tell anyone of her experiences: she asks "what should I do" and is told "Write a book!" I think Andrews is almost slapping the more gullible readers upside the head!   And it's sad, because on its own terms, it does in some ways convey a quite meaningful view of the world, and encourages us to be open to the deeper meanings and the spiritual connections and resonances of the natural world.  So I wish it were a real account, but as it isn't, I have to feel that such transformations of reality must do more harm than good. What happened to a medieval Christian when it was proved that the famous saint's relic everyone had revered was the bone of a dog's hind leg? Didn't it hurt the faith that had sustained him, and damage the good that was in that faith? Other reviewers have mentioned more accurate, reality-based reports of the shaman's world: I'll have to follow some of those up. 
 Robert G. Allen is a notorious and relentless internet spammer.  If you should happen to somehow end up on one of his email lists like I did, he will send you several junk emails a day.  Unsubscribing doesn't work, and trying to block the sender's domain is useless because the emails are sent from a different domain every time.  The funny part is that the emails aren't even coded properly.  They always show up as just a bunch of html code.  Would you really take internet money-making advice from a guy who can't even code html properly?  Anyway, his spamming practices are completely illegal and it's only a matter of time before the law catches up with him.  But that shouldn't come as any surprise considering that mister Allen has been in trouble with the law before.  He's had several run-ins with the IRS, lawsuits against him, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy.  I would also stay away from his Nothing Down real estate methods.  Many of those practices are illegal, and the president of the Nothing Down club in Atlanta wound up in federal prison because of it.  For more info on Allen, visit johntreed dottcomm, click on Real Estate Investing, then click Real Estate Guru Ratings.  Bottom line, don't trust this guy and don't buy his books. And if you're reading this Mr. Allen, take me off your @%#&*$ mailing list!! 
 Reading this book was like driving the interstate from point A to point B, exiting every ramp, driving around the countryside and then on-ramping again only to wonder when the end-point is reached why the journey was begun at all. I admit, I'm not a fan of half-page sentences, and there were far too many for me in this slow-moving, tedious misadventure. I admit to feeling some sympathy for Jackson Brodie, a sad plodding investigator who even his ex-wife beats up, but had little feeling for the other characters. Ms. Atkinson writes well and can turn a phrase, but for me, most of the phrases weren't worth turning. This book read much longer than its length and only sheer determination caused me to finish it. If you're looking for a well-written work of literary fiction where the journey means more than the plot, this may be a book you'd like. But if you're looking for a gripping mystery taut with suspense, keep looking. Maybe it was personal preference, but CASE HISTORIES just wasn't my cup of tea 
 While I  liked following the new perspectives of an old favorite, it seemed like Tennant was trying too hard to write as a classic. I was often confused by what she was writing. The wording/descriptions were awkward, difficult to follow, and not completely confident (or competent) 
 I read this book when I was in grade school, and I have to say that it is pretty warped. This isn't just about children playing with toys that come to life when they are not around. Despite the impression you might have gotten from other reviews, this is NOT like "Toy Story." The dolls have their own personalities, yes, but they are not all nice. Marchpane is not just spoiled and "delicate" she is evil. She is a sociopath who goads the little boy doll into literally playing with fire. The boy's mother, Birdie, sacrifices her own life to save her son. The book plays it up as some great moral maternal thing, but for all intents and purposes, Marchpane murders her. The death is gruesome, with Birdie burning alive into a pile of dust while her husband and son look on with horror and Marchpane remarks remorselessly that if Birdie had been made of more quality materials, like Marchpane herself, she would not have died. This book really affected me as a child, and not in a good way. I scarcely remember the rest of the plot, but Birdie's death is an image that will always stay with me. If I could rate it with zero stars, I would. DO NOT buy this for a child 
 Unlike other reviewers, I found this book to be muddled and the metaphors to be over-used to the point of uselessness. At one point, the author compares early human migrations to "...squeezing toothpaste from the tube, where climate is both the carrot and the stick in the scenario." I'm not kidding. These two completely different analogies in a single sentence exemplify the superfluous use of metaphors that bogs down the text. Wells would have done better to spend more time on explaining genetics and human prehistory directly, rather than using metaphors to excess. I also question whether this book is truly accessible to the average science reader. I have a doctorate in molecular biology, and I sometimes had to fill in gaps with knowledge from my own education.  From a scientific perspective, Wells includes genetic results from studies of both the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA, as well as anthropological findings. This is important, as no single angle will tell the complete story of human evolution. He seems to forget this, however, when he claims that the Y chromosome provides a more accurate view of human migration and evolution. This really only holds true for human males, despite what he says about "sexual politics".  I cannot in good conscience recommend this book to anyone. Nevertheless, the use of genetics in understanding human prehistory remains a fascinating topic, and if you are interested, I would refer you to the many works of Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza and Brian Sykes 
 I believe Ms.Krentz has forgotten the meaning of the word variety.  This book is boring.  Don't waste your money her Plots are the same in just about all her books.  If you have read one of her books you have read them  all the only things  that seem to change are the names 
 I have just read the other reviews of this book. I am sorry Cammie Jo could not find the wonderful book I bought last year from Amazon on this subject. "THE TRADITIONAL IRISH WEDDING" by Bridget Haggerty. We followed many of her ideas for our daughter's wedding. From what you state, this book sounds like a repeat of the Haggerty book.We had found it to be so complete. Perhaps it is worth a try to compare Shannon's receipes. Never can have to many books on Ireland 
 I bought this movie because of the "Name" Stars - They could have filmed their parts in 2 days and all Cate Blanchett had to do was lye still - no acting required. Brad Pitt's  yelling obscenities at the police and turning his back and running away was the only acting necessary. This movie is decidedly against men  - moreover it has no substantiating connectivity. For example - segments end in one type of terrain and startup again in another very hospitable type of terrain solely to play on one's political 'mind' and to further the 'idea' all men are rotten 
 Professor Gumerlock makes an excellent point in the introduction of his book, in summing up the LCD of all the soothsayers and so-called "prophets" throughout recorded history.  Very good arguments are also made in the opening to set the "actual time" certain prophecies were made.  But then, and even by Professor Gumerlock's own admission, this "book" carries on in the manner for which was its' main purpose; to gather in one end-all publication all of the prophecies made - and the prophets who orated them, in chronological order.  Great if you're doing an essay or report on the subject at hand...pretty dry material if you're on the outside wanting a provocative read on the subject.  Amazingly well-researched, footnoted and referenced, but again - very dry material.  I got the point after the introduction.  
 The West Wing is my favorite television show of all time.  Period.  Nothing else comes even close.  I could go on and on about the show, but others are doing an excellent job on that score, and that's not my point here.  My point is the awful, awful DVD.  No English-language subtitles (for the second year in a row).  Only two special features, both about the debate episode.  No insight from the actors about their take on seven years of ground-breaking television.  No tribute to John Spencer.  I feel as if the folks at Warner Brothers Television knew they had their market well in hand, so the quality of the product really didn't matter.  "No bother, we'll sell enough anyway."  I'm one of those that bought it anyway, but I feel as if I got ripped off.  
 I had this toy for 1 day and it leaked, so I returned it.  My daughter really didn't seem all that interested in it anyway.  She seemed the most interested in the water part, and you can buy much cheaper water filled mat toys.  It's really not worth the money, and it does tend to leak 
 As long as its on, it will prevent scratches, but its tough to get off, and that act can scratch your laptop.  It scratched my Macbook when I pried it off.  The guy at the Apple Store who snapped it on a Macbook beause I requested a "demo", couldn't pry it off, and after 10 embarassing minutes, he called a colleague over, and they pried it off together.  And, to be honest, this makes the MB look ugly - kinda like putting a veil on a supermodel.  ;-- 
 Luckily this book is only 160 pages, so I didn't waste too much time. It merely says Islamic countries used to be world-leaders, and now they're pretty backward. Very few examples of why and how this happened.  I thought it was going to be a history of Islam, but it's more a history of Islamic nations. It's sketchy, it's theoretical, and there's little filled in the middle of the ideas.   It'll say things like, "Modernity came from Christendom during the 18th and 19th centuries and changed the very way life was lived in Islamic countries." Then it gives no examples of what it means by that.  I applaud people who want to learn about Islam, but I recommend they buy a different book than this one 
 The studio should have invested more in the film to dvd transfer, the colors are a real disaster especially in "The Gang's All here". I whish I could ask for a refund. You know now what to expect.. 
 Works OK lights up the page a little, but not great Doesn't work well enought in the dark 
 Insane. That anyone would ascribe to these ideas...let alone actually trying to apply them. I've listened to the tapes, read the books, became more incensed as I went along. Yes, there are differences between the sexes, but this guy doesn't come close to getting it right, and if you're a man following his advice, then you can write off having a long-term with an intelligent woman. This fool creates "escapes" and excuses for sheer bad behaviour of some men, claiming that it's innate to the male gender,  and would suggest that their women forgive them for it! Sure, forgive them....but expect them to grow up at some point! I support equal respect for men from women, and vice versa. If I catch you flirting with other women, and expecting carnal favors rather than gently soliciting them, then supporting your bad behaviour with this garbage book, I'll shove MISTER, (not Doctor)Gray's book where the sun don't shine. For those looking for a better appraisal than mine, please google The Rebuttal From Uranus, they really capture the truth 
 I don't know what type of Italian/American family other people grew up in, but I grew up in a loving family with wonderful warm traditions, holidays filled with love, humor and great food, songs sung in Italian, stories of the old country and a door that was always open with the coffee on the stove...I found none of that nostalgia here.  What I did find was the stereotypical pictures, sayings and gestures that unfortunately television portrays Italian/Americans to be.  If you are looking for a book that not only will translate swears from Italian, but will show you pictures of the gestures as well, or teaches you the correct Italian response to someone farting, this one is for you 
 In reality, it's not an awful book.  In fact, there are quite a number of things which can be filed under the "good to know" category.  However, I'm so bitter at paying such an outrageous price for this book that I simply cannot bring myself to give it anything more than a very poor rating.  Don't bother, there are better (and more reasonably priced) sources 
 I might be an idiot, but maybe this thing should have come with some instructions on how to put it on! Haha. So many velcro straps and what not. Neither me nor my father who's been on the police force for 30 some odd years could figure out how to put this thing on properly. Again....maybe I'm just an idiot.... 
 the young actor is great in this movie, but the film itself is non-exciting and a bit boring.** 
 What a disappointment. I truly enjoyed the first two thirds of this book, but the story dropped off so steeply at the end, that the whole book was spoiled in retrospect.   It was a great concept, and Mansbach deserves praise for creating believable and three-dimensional characters. But as soon as the story moves beyond New York City, grotesque stereotypes emerge.  Macon Detourney was a great character. His imagination is wild, and he tends to interpret the goings-on around him through the lens of TV and popular culture. Unfortunately, the same can be said of Mansbach's relationship to the America outside of New York City. He has seen imagery on TV, but doesn't have the same sense for real and imaginary.  The hip hop writing is great 
 ** The ties between mother and daughter are as intricate as those between the future and past. Thirty four years ago, two armored car guards were killed during a robbery perpetuated by four people who escaped unscathed. Now, one of them has been caught, however, for all those years, she has lived an exemplorary life. Therefore, no one is more shocked than her daughter, Liz Connor, when Sarah Jane Connor, a woman who is said to love well, is arrested for robbery and murder. Liz does not know what is more baffling, the concept of her mother being what the Feds claim or the lack of shock displayed by her father. Joining her in a quest for the truth is the son of one of her mother's victims, though she knows this not. Murder is a strange basis for love, but the truth is not. Unlike most of Ms. Potter's works, this one was hard to get into. The real action seemed far removed from the present. Ripped from the headlines or not, it lacked credibility. **   Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, freelance reviewer

 The other reviewers will tell you about the book.  I've read most of Preston and Child's works, including the other two books in this trilogy, and they are a good read.  What gets very old and nauseating is the continual saps to modern feminism.  I guess it's a necessity to get published today, but you'd think that at least SOME male authors would get tired of grovelling just to get published.  I guess most people will sell their souls for money.  Just about all the men in P and L's books are either wimps, effiminate, weak, bumbling, stupid (or liars or murderers), cry-babies, scared of their own shadows, and thoroughly unlikable (even Pendergast has his moments).  The women, of course, are, without exception, tough, brilliant, shrewd, fearless, always right, on the rise to the top, always outsmarting the men, able to knock out a 7 foot, 300 pound man with a single karate chop to the neck (forgive the slight hyperbole), totally unfeminine, and just as unlikeable as the men.  The stories are very good; it's unfortunate Preston and Child couldn't have come up with better, more realisticly human, less insulting characters.  This slop may play in New York and California, but in Texas we still want our men to be men and our women to be women.  So this is just a warning.  If you're a MAN--and those of you who are know what I mean--you'll get sick of the characters in these books.  
 I don't like these radios becase they only go about 1/2 the mile. The battery doesn't hold full charge. I would recommend going with motorola model or midland that will give you better range 
 As much fun as sitting in your accountant's office with your lap full of tax receipts. Of course, there are worse things in life, but please, remind me of what they are. Better yet, don't remind me! 
 The information provided inside this reference book is ok; however many of the phone numbers and web site links are outdated.  I noticed some info was provided with a notation at the bottom that "As of such and such date, this is no longer available" Why even print that info in the first place, if not to just fill in useless space. As a PI, your better off getting usufull info on a PI site.  Just my $.02 worth 
 This book was difficult to get through.  The writing felt very, well, written.  Imagine an FBI agent talking for fifteen minutes while apprehending a bad guy.  Imagine this same agent uttering such phrases as "this weapon should evidence your homocidal intent" and other such phony and cacaphonic tripe, and you will only begin to understand how silly this book is.  Baldacci comes across like a librarian in an argyle sweater trying to write tough "zingers" on every page.  He has no idea how real people might talk in dangerous circumstances, so he tries to overcompensate with embarassing results.  I personally blushed or groaned nearly every page at his feminine rage being spewed out in dialogue and descriptions that miss the mark in every conceievable fashion.    Add to this the idiocy of the main character--acting in ways both too stupid and too intelligent to be any real protagonist, and the contrivances of plot needed to milk this meager theme for hundreds of pages, and you see the frustrating experience it is to read the work.  I shall regale you with one more fine example of the action scenes--when Sydney has met with a "deadly" [Baldacci's thesaurus apparently has only two words: deadly and murderous] intruder in her home, Sydney has a weapon trained on him at near-point blank range when he suddenly catapults into a swan dive behind the couch!  "Milliseconds" before she can fire, he launches himself behind the couch.    Is this "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?"  No, just Baldacci sipping cups of cocoa on doilies trying to make up action sequences before returning to his needlepoint 
 If you can endure Franken's cycle of hilarious writing to crap to writing about how crappy it is before finally getting back to the good stuff, go for it.  "Oh, the Things I Know" takes great pains to steer clear of incindiary comments so that lots and lots of people who don't know a college graduate well enough to get them something they really want will buy this book as a graduation gift.   Unfortunately for Franken, he's playing to the right audience - the over 35 buyer of the gift for a college graduate - who will likely flip through a few pages and chuckle before setting it back down. Because the book isn't comforting, uplifting or even really that funny for the market.   [... 
 This telplay is supposedly based on the possibility of an asteroid hitting the earth. That possibility is real, and many people take the issue seriously. One commercial film, Deep Impact, also included some real effort to "get it right". However, there is nothing in this film that relates to the real concern about asteroid impacts. This is pure fantasy and thus a turn-off to anyone who has thought seriously about this issue 
 I hate the fact that this "group" has "made it" simply because some a-hole at the record company never heard of "Massive Attack." I swear I gave this album a good-hard listen: just me and a pair of headphones hoping for something new.  What I heard was a girl who has a good voice, but lends that voice to some of the dumbest recycled lyrics that I keep hearing over and over on the radio. (now, the radio isn't bad, but aren't you tired of hearing the same lyrics re-arranged to a different peice of music?) It also wouldn't be so bad if I didn't already love Massive Attack and never heard of them. SERIOUSLY go listen to "Mezzanine" From Massive Attack and tell me that Evanescence isn't HEAVILY influenced and to a point copying them. Don't just rip my review just because "I LOVE THAT SONG THEY PLAY ON THE RADIO" go get Mezzanine, sit in a dark room and just listen. You'll see that I'm right. also, the album cover? please. come up with graphics, or something. I hate ego maniacs that put their damn face all over their cover. 
 While I disagree with much of the content of this book, that is not why you shouldn't buy this book. The reason not to buy is that this book is greatly out-dated. It was from before 9-11, and the neo-con perspective and focus on the world is now quite different 
 I purchased this flour a few weeks ago and just baked with it the first time yesterday. I was very satisfied with the taste and texture of it. However, I cannot tolerate gluten or rice and after eating some of what I had baked, I had an allergic reaction. I called the company and they could not tell me anything in regards to their mills nor if there could be any cross-contamination. The lady on the phone seemed to think that the mills are shared equipment and that no precautions are taken to avoid cross-contamination. If you're buying it for low-carb prep only, it should be a good flour at a great deal. Please beware if you are using it to avoid gluten or other allergenic grains 
 While this book does have a few pictures, they seem quite old.  The one or two items I liked didn't have any instructions for.   If you are not a sewer, than this book is not for you.  I found the book very confusing - definitely written for the person with sewing background. Sorry 
 This book is completely not what I expected and hoped for after reading its description and reviews.  I had been looking for a book that is a guide to how to buy, and more importantly, how to cook the many vegetables that are out there that I didn't grow up with in my meat-and-potatoes family.  I've been branching out to include many many more vegetables and much more variety than what I was raised with, but there are so many vegetables that I see at the store that I have no idea what to do with.  I wasn't looking for recipes so much as techniques and information.  The description of this book seemed to fit, and all of the other reviewers loved it, so I bought it.  I thought that this book would have detailed instructions on how to cook all of the different vegetables that he describes, but in fact, for most of the vegetables the cooking descriptions are limited to "boiling," "grilling," etc.  How long?  How hot?  What size should you cut the pieces to to ensure throrough cooking?  No idea...the author certainly didn't bother to say.  I've got more information in the 2-or-so page cooking chart in the vegetable section of an old cookbook I have lying around than this author includes in his entire book.  What I had hoped for was a book that told me HOW to prepare each vegetable and what sort of foods each vegetable complements.  I thought that the 350 recipes were simply an added bonus.  Unfortunately, it turns out that the recipes were by far the focus, and the vegetable descriptions are almost useless.  I gave it 2 stars instead of one since it does have recipes for many unusual vegetables that other cookbooks neglect.  That is a definite positive.  But this book is definitely no "Definitive Guide" to anything 
 Like Hayek's Road to Serfdom, this book was written during the Secon World War when Keynes was busy crafting the post war peace. It is infused with the 1930s' corporatist ideas and tends to favour the Communist version more than the Nazi/Fascist version. Keynes is indisputably the 2oth century's most important economist but why does Schumpeter and his creative destruction occupy position #2? I put it down to the same reason as Marx' Theory of Alienation gained such sway. As there was little else to salvage from Marx' writings, they hit on that to make him apear relevant. Marx was a dangerous idiot and the fact that Schumeter heaps measured praise on him suggests that Schumpeter should also join him in the intellectual trash can of history. I see little relevant in his work which I feel has gained prominence simply because economics has lost its intellectual direction. Unlike Gary Becker and other recipients of the Nobel Prize, Schumpeter tackles big issues. But the big issues shrug him off. Nothing here to ponder over 
 This book is horrendous. A class I took required it. I hope I never have to review another book from HBS or these authors. This book belongs in the garbage, not taking up space on a bookshelf. There could not possibly be a more poorly written textbook on the topic 
 I enjoyed the book but the author's errors occurred in areas that I'm very unforgiving of.  In one place he mistakes semi-automatic firearms for fully-automatic firearms.  Even if the author doesn't feel obligated to do much research for light fiction like this, the editor should have caught something so blatantly wrong.    I enjoyed some of the ridiculous characters that always show up in his books.  But, like Stephen King, I'm beginning to notice that he has certain characters that he uses again and again.  The hermit in the woods that knows everything.  State troopers are always perfect and dedicated but feds and city cops are dummies.  Throw in a scene that involves a complicated sexual position.  It just seems a bit lazy.  I know it's light fiction, but I like a bit more flesh to my beach reading.  I should mention that I didn't actually "read" this book, I listened to the unabridged audio version 
 This product didn't work for me, as described.   First of all, it does smell nice, which is different from the usual fumes nail polishes give off! Smells lemony!   Its also easy to use - you brush it on over nails and surrounding area, let it set for awhile until it gets dull and then gently buff it off with a tissue.   That was all fine and dandy, but it didn't leave my nails all that dry, nor did it leave them shiny. In fact, they were less shiny than the shiny topcoats I use.   I also had the worse case of bedsheet wrinkles embedded in my manicure that night after using this product - could be unrelated, but I've never seen so many creases and smudges in my nails when I woke up and I let them dry for a few hours after painting them!   I wouldn't recommend this product. 
 Yes, my review is one star, only because Amazon doesn't have zero.  This is the type of book you would expect from some internet self-publishing site.  The fact that St. Martins Press greenlighted this project casts serious doubt on their judgment.  The factual errors are mind-boggling.  Sorry, Ken, Hans Conreid did NOT narrate Fractured Fairy Tales on Bullwinkle.  Actors Gaillard Sartain and Richard Moll are NOT dead as of this writing (August 2005), so they were probably alive in 2004 when you wrote this book as well.  Actress Jane Curtin does not spell her last name as in the "curtain" you hang from a rod.  Johnny Carson did NOT do the Tonight Show for 31 years (it was 29 and a half).  Jack Benny's famous reply to "Your money or your life!" was "I'm thinking, I'm thinking!"...not "I'm thinking it over."  Michael McKean did NOT participate in Spinal Tap before Laverne & Shirley.  You only missed that one by a decade.  Batman did NOT premiere on ABC in 1964.  You're getting closer, it was 1966.  The word "forgotten" is spelled with an "e" at the end; not an "o."  The detective on Miami Vice was Tubbs; not Stubbs.  And is an "informercial" the same thing as an infomercial?  These are factual and grammatical errors I found by reading perhaps HALF the book.  It is categorized  by stupid "love-hate categories, so it's easy to skip over shows or genres you don't care about.  But I now know that Mr. Tucker, who somehow manages occasional employment by respectable magazines, LOVES Ricky Nelson, "Full House," Aaron Spelling, Simon Cowell, Richard Hatch, "Silk Stalkings," Lisa Bonet, and "Welcome Back Kotter," but HATES "M*A*S*H," Johnny Carson, "The Price Is Right," "Mystery Science Theater," "Family Guy,"  and PBS.  Talk about being out of touch with the reading public.  He bounces all over the place, flinging his mindless meanderings toward the wall, but in the end, nothing sticks.    This book adds nothing to anyone's perspective of TV.  There's no depth, or new information here.  Apparently Mr. Tucker spent a couple weeks spewing out a like/dislike list, and a gullible publisher sent this one to press without editing, fact-checking, or apparently any regard to buyer appeal.  I get the feeling someone got called on the carpet for this one.  It's inexcusable 
 I wasted too much time on this book thinking there must be some great ending.  Wrong.  The main character narrowly escapes two evil men in her life to instantly blow her cover and fall in love with someone else almost as soon as she meets him.  I'm sorry, but I don't think the woman would be thinking ANYTHING about love and romance at this point in her life and I don't think she would trust another man for a LONG time.  This book has too many ridiculous, unbelieveable twists and turns.  If they were believeable it would be OK.  It just seemed like it was written by someone with no experience with the attitude "now what else can I make happen to her?"  Ridiculous, boring, and down-right stupid in my opinion 
 This book is about a ung boy named bud and is liveing with a bad family that is mean to him after a while and they lock in a shed one night and he desides to run away.When he runs away he sleeps under a tree in front of a libary that serves beakfeast and so on.Then after a couple nights he leaves the tree and trys to find his father.after hours of walking a man picks him up and helps him try and find his father 
 Although I'll admit I didn't read the entire book, I did read much (or, better put, enough) of it to get the jist.  I think Juan Gonzalez's views are very prejudiced and inconsiderate towards non-Hispanic whites.  Like all too many Hispanic leaders in this country, he urges Hispanics to adopt a chip-on-the- shoulder attitude and wants to make them think that being Hispanic in the United States is a crutch.  Mr.  Gonzalez fails to realize, though, that one-hundred years ago there was an influx of millions of immigrants from southern Italy.  Just like todays Mexican-Americans, they tended to be short, dark-skinned, with dark hair and dark eyes.  In other words, they looked different from the previous immigrants from central, eastern, and norhtern Europe.  People complained that the Italians didn't want to speak English.  Sound familiar, Mr. Gonzalez?  People called them ethnic slurs such as "guinea", "dago", "wop", and "greaseball" just to name a few.  Sound familiar, Mr. Gonzalez?  People said that they all carried knives and were in gangs.  Sound familiar, Mr. Gonzalez?  In the South, between 1891 and 1911, over 30 people of southern Italian descent were lynched for crimes they did not committ.  They weren't even allowed in white schools for quite some time in many areas of the South.  In the North, they took dangerous factory and construction jobs, while being grossly underpaid and working in horrible death and injury prone conditions.  In California, they worked in the fields, again while being underpaid and working in bad conditions.  Sound familiar, Juan?  And yet today, the Little Italys (or Italian-American ghettoes, if you will) that once abounded this country are all gone but a few, such as New York's and Boston's, which are disappearing as well.  What happened to them?  They've become successful.  Their community leaders know that just because you don't speak Italian or Sicilian doesn't mean that you've lost your cultural backgound.  Their community leaders know that it is absolutely stupid and ignorant to hold a grudge against Anglo-Americans living today that had absolutely nothing to do with whatever went on 100 years or even 50 years ago between Italian-Americans and Anglo-Americans.  If Mr. Gonzalez is going to say that it is all the Anglos' fault for whatever problems Hispanic communities have today, then how does he explain the success of Italian,Japanese,Chinese,Asian Indian,Pakisitani,and Arab-Americans?  Mr. Gonzalez could definitely take a few lessons from Linda Chavez, whom I admire very much.  She wrote a book called "Out of the Barrio" which I recommend if anyone wants to get both sides of the view of the Mexican-American, Puerto Rican American and Cuban American experiences.  Its too bad that these great communities don't have more leaders like Linda Chavez instead of corrupt ones like Mr. Gonzalez who hold them down 
 I read the first chapter and though this book might be enlightening. I advise anyone who buys this to stop after the first chapter or at least skip 2,3,4. The author doesnt offer much in the first several chapters of the book he simply glorifies him self and doest stop talking about himself, "I did this, i did that, i am this,.." When he does finally quit floating his own boat and start to talk, he gives the impression that all modern medical practice is a conspiracy. Oh you have cancer!, dont go to a dr. there evil, get some ginsing and meditate. Im not saying alternative medicine is bad but it has its place along side modern medicine, and should not be considered a complete replacement 
 My god this is so bad and could have been good if it had a plot. The bad dude looks like something off H.R. Puff and Stuff and about as dumb as the smiley face at wallmart, witch is were I bought this P.O.S. for $5.50 and that was $5.40 to much. Stay away. Barr 
 First, as always, the disclaimer. I am a regional author (Suomalaiset: People of the Marsh; ISBN 0972005064) and, like all authors, prone to fighting fits of envy. So, take what I am about to write with a grain of salt. I loved "Cold Mountain". Loved the premise,the historical truth, the characters, the setting, and the writing. I looked forward to the much hyped second effort by Mr. Frazier. The good news is that his writing is still exemplary. By that, I mean the man certainly knows how to turn a phrase. But that's about all I can say, in terms of positives, about this effort. The plot seems overblown and quite frankly, totally preposterous. The main character, Will, is thrown into wars, and disasters, and inclement weather, and every other kind of malady, only to survive, essentially unchanged and unscathed, while all those around him fall or fail. His ability to amass a fortune and hundreds of thousands of acres of land seems, given his humble beginnings, to strain even my vivid imagination. The descriptions of the landscape are lovely but lost in a plot that has no point. The first quarter of the book, the beginnings of a love affair between Will and Claire, the love of Will's life, has promise. Then, for the greater part of half of the novel, we are immersed endlessly in tedium surrounding Will and his adopted Indian tribe, the only point of which seems is to convince us that Will's greed isn't selfish, but done for the good his Red Brothers and Sisters. Far too late, and in a strained and surrealistic manner, the story comes back to Will and Claire. But by then, my patience was worn thin and the return to the real story, the interpersonal struggle between the lovers, had lost its appeal. Two stars might be a little light but that's how I see it.  
 This book is about a man named Ray Atlee whose father has just died, leaving $3 million in unexplained cash.  Someone else knows about the money.  The three major questions for the book to answer are:  1) Where did the money come from? 2) Who is the mystery person (or people) trying to get it? 3) What will Ray do with it?  I have reached page 261 in this book, and NONE of these questions have been answered.  Ray has moved the money around, been vaguely threatened by person or persons unknown and had many conversations with side characters that all led nowhere.  261 pages in, all I know is where the money DIDN'T come from.  This is a legal thriller that does not thrill.  The pacing is deadly dull and I keep waiting, waiting, WAITING for something to happen and nothing does.  Finally I threw the book down in frustration an hour or so ago when I realized how close to 300 pages I'd gotten with nothing happening.  I don't know why I even gave the book this much of a chance.  Nothing bad has happened to him, and even though three million is at stake, none of the bad guys have taken any but the most harmless ways of trying to get it.  If they were really following him as much as it's alluded to in the book, they could have easily put a bullet in his head any time and taken the cash.  He spends half the book carrying it around in the trunk of his car, for God's sake!  I may finish it one day, but as of now I just don't care about the money or the characters who are after it.  Not Grisham's best, by a long shot 
 This book constantly asks reader to jump back and forth between chapters.  It failed to present a general picture of financial accounting. The author  did not organize his ideas well. Do not choose to read this book if you are  new to accounting 
 Mine got unsuspended with the second boyfriend's death.    I am a great fan of Nora Roberts and really looked forward to this book.  Believe me, it is not one of her best.  I started off admiring her setting and characterization of the Hale family, but, then, this went on way too long.  It also took way too long to get to the real story. The middle of the book bogged down to the point that I had to make myself keep reading, which is very unusual for Nora Roberts.  Much of the plot was over the top unbelievable.  How many boyfriends of one person can be killed?  The 20 year mystic connection with Bo doesn't quite come off, either.  I'll certainly remain a great fan of Roberts, but no one's perfect, I guess.    
 This wasn't actually a card game. It was more of a book of 88 tear out sheets with one game each. They is no way that this can be played as a card game. The box doesn't even indicate that it's a card game. I thought this would be a fun card game for my husband & daughter to play together. You can purchase magazines with more games for less price. I wouldn't recommend this product unless you would like an overpriced book of sudoku games. I'm returning it & buying an electronic version for husbands PDA. The price is about the same. 
 Oh how I wish for a balanced view.  For all of his past credentials as an investigative journalist, Mr. Hersh is no biographer. The network of sources and investigative attention to detail that exposed the horrors of My Lai and made Mr.Hersh's reputation become nothing more than a platform for a commercially-motivated thrashing of a flawed man who happened to be president for less than 3 years, forty years ago, and whose greatest claim to fame is that he was assassinated in highly suspicious circumstances - thus entering a uniquely American form of popular-mythology. Mr.Hersh contributes nothing that is substantively new to our knowledge of JFK. His book produces a litany of "evidence" to support the well-known view that Kennedy was seriously-ill for much of his life and often resorted to heavy drug use, was a political animal who made much use of the often dubious network of contacts that his super-ambitious father had developed and was an insatiable womaniser behind the veneer of a "respectable marriage". The book makes no serious contribution to anything other than Mr.Hersh's bank account (and that of his publisher) because it seems that anything that is written about the icons of American popular culture, whether good or bad, is destined to be a commercial success - all the more so when it is written by a "respected investigative journalist" 
 Like one of the previous reviewers, I am also amazed at the positive reviews this book has gotten.  I think the authors did a terrible job in making their case, and the fact that many people are favorably disposed towards this book reflects frustration with education in America, rather than the merits of this book.  Anyone who advocates gifted education has to come to terms with two embarrassing facts:  that children identified as gifted are disproportionately white and overwhelmingly from wealthy families.  This is noted here, but the authors state that negative judgements on giftedness based on this are unfair.  That's because some minority children are gifted too.    The fact that some minority children are also gifted in no way really answers the question:  why are you serving the children of privilege, and ignoring everyone else?  African-American does not equal disadvantaged:  many black children come from wealthy families and have many advantages, cultural, educational, and social.  Therefore simply stating "we serve black children, too" and making an emotional appeal that gifted poor children really need the help, without providing the data that show that gifted poor children *are* in fact helped, really gets us nowhere.  To circumvent this argument, that it's wrong to focus on privilege and ignore everyone else, the authors state (over and over and over) that gifted children will amply repay society's investment in them by producing the novels, the symphonies, the scientific breakthroughs that will "save" or "enlighten" us all.  Therefore, serving the elite is of benefit because we all will reap the rewards, including the middle-class and the poor.  This is a feel-good supposition for the parents of gifted children, but it has three major flaws.  The first flaw is that it is untrue.  It has been conclusively disproven by Terman's and Winner's research, among others, that identifying and focusing on gifted children will produce breakthroughs in society.  Terman did this for decades and his "genetic studies of genius" filled volumes.  To the chagrin of gifted researchers, however, he found that gifted children, almost all with IQs over 140, became happy successful professionals (and for many of the women, housewives and mothers) and not much else.  In fact, one truly exceptional child who applied for Terman's study, William Shockley, was rejected due to an insufficiently high IQ.  Shockley won the Nobel Prize for his invention of the transistor radio.  This accomplishment was matched by *none* of the children in Terman's study.  The plain truth is that many children have strong aptitudes which, for one reason or another, are not recognized and nurtured in childhood, or else their presence, while recognized, does not lead to a declaration of "gifted."  There are also "late bloomers" who catch up to the gifted children.  Ellen Winner found the same thing.  She states that creativity produces important inventions, and not rapid learning.  She says that over an IQ of about 120, creativity and IQ are not correlated.  Secondly, we also now live in "the information age."  It is stated in this book, for example, that Rachel will probably write outstanding novels.  I hope she will.  Many people are writing outstanding books.  Even if Rachel is a wonderful author and develops a large following, she is unlikely to really advance American literature, as is implied here, because there are so many other gifted authors out there who are producing books of equal merit.  Finally, the burden this book puts on gifted children is, in my opinion, monumentally unfair.  Let's say it were true that the children identified as gifted composed the symphonies and made the breakthroughs that bring culture, light, and healing to the rest of us, the "unwashed masses."  It is a monumentally unfair burden to put on children:  I will call you gifted, tell you many times that you are much smarter than other children, and nurture you; you better come through by dazzling me and the rest of the world with your gifts.  I think that is actually extremely selfish and goes against the principle of UNCONDITIONAL love for children.  I certainly believe that there are some children who are profoundly gifted and need accommodations, sometimes extreme ones.  I believe there should be some special schools for the gifted.  I also think they should be allowed to skip grades and participate in competitions and other enriching activities.  I believe their aptitudes should be nurtured.    But, I believe all children's aptitudes should be nurtured, all children should be enriched, and all children should find school a positive, nurturing, challenging learning experience.  I believe this is far from the truth for the vast majority of children, whether they are called "gifted," "average," or "slow."  Some few children are exceptional in their abilities and they need exceptional nurturing.  They should get it for their own sake, to provide optimal development, and NOT because they *may* "repay" us by dazzling us someday.    I believe all children, to quote Mara Sapon-Shevin (an enemy to this audience, I know) have unlimited, or at least unmeasurable, potential, and should be nurtured and supported on that basis 
 Do not buy this book if you want to learn anything meaningful or "real world" about game theory.  The author's examples are irrelevant and in some cases not applicable to game theory constructs.  
 I don't mind an occasional smooth, sweet fiddle tune but that's about all this is....even the upbeat tunes have no real feeling to them. Not a knee-slapper in the bunch and not all that Celtic sounding either 
 As a senior management exec, I'd have to say that this book was of no help at all. Although it has helped the supposed top ten companies with purchasing, I have used a completely different strategy using simple purchasing techniques. I suggest you read, "Managing and Purchasing Problem Solvers" by Jonathan T. Monczka. This book is much more efficent describing management principles clearly. I do not reccomend "The Purchasing Machine" at all. 
 I have read many of James Patterson's books and have never been disappointed.   This book however, was a big let down.  I almost didn't finish reading the first few chapters because I had difficulty following it, they were choppy and confusing.  After the shaky beginning, it was much better and I found myself enjoying the storyline until the end.  The end was 'stupid' for lack of a better word. Twist, yes, it was a twist, but in a direction that made NO  sense. WHY??  I thought he would give some insight into the purpose of the ending, but he didn't.  
 I've been a Timothy Dalton fan ever since I saw Jane Eyre, but this movie is difficult to take even for the most devoted.  Please do not  waste your money 
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 I liked only the tracks 1 and 6. The songs have good banjo picking but are not beautiful enough to keep me listening more than one time 
 The Ramones meet AC/DC. A live record with the song covered by Pearl Jam. Not a great recording. The songs are good, would rather hear studio versions. If you are looking to buy cause of the Pearl Jam song.. don't waste your money. Otherwise they are a good band but the production is no good 
 Unfortunately the book didn't uncover any "secrets" whatsoever as the title alludes to.  The information contained in this book is very basic.  I found one major problem with the text in that it encourages "component depreciation".  My research and understanding is that this was clearly outlawed in the US in the 1980s.  When I contacted the publishing company for clarification, no one would answer this simple question.    If this book was filled with high quality ideas, I would have overlooked an error or two and given this book 4 or 5 stars.  But that wasn't the case as I've only been in the real estate game for a short time and already knew most of what is contained in this text.  All in, this book isn't even worth the $5 +shipping I paid for it used... 
 Good if you have lots of time to kill, because it has some pages devoted to useless information such as the stupid poem on page 1022 that has  nothing to do with accounting. It appears the authors placed lots of  "real world" trivia that is boring and useless. Entire page of  964 talks about the reason why Coca-Cola will not do business with Lakers  because they signed Pepsi spokeman Shaq O'Neill, it has nothing to do with  the subject but  the extra pages makes you think you got something for the  high priced book. If you absolutely need this book, go borrow it from your  public library and save your money.The book manuscript was NEVER approved  by a CPA or business owner but a long list of college instructors. It does  cover all the basics 
 I was very disappointed in this book because I felt like the title itself is very misleading. The title of the book is called "FREE MONEY From the Federal Governement for SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS" By  Laurie Blum. The book description clearly states that there are hundreds of  millions of dollars available FREE!  to small business and entrepreneurs,  when in fact the only thing that I found in this book pertaining to small  businesses were LOANS and ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, and the last time I checked  LOANS are not free. This book description needs to be more clear as to what  kinds of grants are available and the title "FREE MONEY" should  not be used when this book is filled with mostly loan options. From reading  the book description I was under the impression that this was a book filled  with nothing but grant information!  I was very disappointed and  unsatisfied with this book. If I'm wrong or misunderstood this book please  fill free to correct me and direct me to the pages where the business  grants are supposed to be located 
 Had this book been the work of a novice Sci-Fi author it would have never seen print.   The story follows the life of one Lazarus Long, a character who is easy to see is only a thinly veiled cover for the author himself.  Lazarus is a character who is so convinced of his own personal superiority that late in his very long life he travels back in time so that he can father himself.  As further example of his self superiority he had himself cloned into twins of the opposite sex.  Twins that he later has sexual relations with.  Even the conscience mind of the artificially intelligent computer that controlled his space craft transferred itself into the engineered body of a woman so that it too could have sexual relations with Lazarus.  To make it further insulting the sexual advances of those characters is not of Lazarus' choosing but rather of their free will.  Indeed Lazarus fends off the sexual advances of his cloned twins until they reach the age of consent.  This reveals how shallow the author feels the drives and motives of others to be.       The story follows the life of Lazarus Long through a series of 'flashbacks' as the character struggles to find a reason to continue his existence.  Most of the flashbacks deal with how the character traveled about the Universe starting colonies on untamed worlds.  Each of these mini-stories is an equally self aggrandizing yarn about how Lazarus fathered virtually every child on the planet while single handedly delivering the worlds he founded from lawlessness, ignorance, and barbarism.  Among these 'gems' are such classic lines as 'there is only one way to comfort a widow' implying that the answer was sex.  Yes, among these stories there are a few meaningful bits of wisdom such as Heinlein's list of what things a man should be able to do.  To save you the grief of reading the book just to get to it I'll quote it for you below. . .        "A Man should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently and die gallantly. Specialization is for insects."                 - Robert A. Heinlein    Certainly I can agree with that.  These are abilities that every man should endevour to have to make himself complete.  But they are not the exclusive domain of men. Unfortunately this bit of wisdom is so embedded in mounds of garbage that reveal Heinlein's low esteem for women it is not otherwise worth excavating.  One comes away from this book knowing that the Author felt that women are worth nothing beyond serving as receptacles for a man's sexual needs.  Throughout the book examples are given of how a man should be able to do all of the above while women, conversely, are scarcely credited with the ability to do any of those things.  That this book was ever nominated for an award is a blemish on human history

If they were really following him as much as it's alluded to in the book, they could have easily put a bullet in his head any time and taken the cash.  He spends half the book carrying it around in the trunk of his car, for God's sake!  I may finish it one day, but as of now I just don't care about the money or the characters who are after it.  Not Grisham's best, by a long shot 
 The writers used the character names, and the book name, but nothing else The explanation of the 3 laws was ridiculous The art work of the robots was good Will Smith did his usual fantastic job as an actor, but the writers gave him poor material and where comedy was called for it went over like a lead balloon. I Robot is part of a series of Asimov books resolving around both human and robot characters.  The human and the robot both evolve and explore the meaning of life and humanity.  None of this appeared in the movie 
 I love these bars, they are high in protien, and are good supplements, How ever The 3 boxes I got were all expired. Beware of sale items on bars like this 
 i'm tired of all these bands that come out and they think they sound good. this is another example of how dumb music is sometimes. RJA has copied every other band i've heard of and i'm sick of that. "Face Down" is there first single and it sounds like a rip of MXPX. so yeah not even that song.  "Guardian Angel" or whatever sounds like Copeland, or Lifehouse or something like that. i mean every song on the cd is a copy of other bands. no originality what so ever. i wish bands that are trying to make it big use their own skills in writing instead of others. one star is the least i could do, and that's sad cause i enjoy music, don't waste your time on this cd 
 I was very much looking forward to reading this. I'm approaching my 40th birthday, and wanted to hear how others had dealt with this transition. In all fairness, Ms. Braun does interview many women on their transitions. However, the language is superificial, sometimes to the point of being annoyingly "cutesy". For example her term "Fertile Void" which is defined once, is used as a critical thread throughout the work, as though it's a sociological phenomena. If the book had been written about that term specifically, maybe things could have been interesting.  OK, there is a period of time where one doesn't know which path to take, but I hate labels, especially cute ones, especially when applied to grown-up women facing serious challenges. I need to lead myself into new terrain, and find my own voice, and I don't need cheerleading and labels. I found the "rah-rah" attitude really lame. Worse still, the term "F-You Fifties"...I'm sorry, but I got over that language a long, long time ago. I don't think it's amusing.  One of the "success stories" was from a woman who, when she lights up her joints (marijuana) today, has much more pleasant trips. Frankly I felt offended and patronized, and I am no prude...I grew up on Ms. magazine, I went to a Seven Sister school, and I'm from NYC.  I was truly expecting More, as in that wonderful magazine for which Ms. Braun works.. 
 This was our only reference guide to 6 weeks in Spain. We tried to use it for Hotels and buses and trains and all of the things a traveller would need to know. Instead of useful information, we were assaulted with so many adjectives and adverbs that bordered on stupidity, we almost threw the book away. It does contain some information of value if you can get passed all of the pompous verbiage. We did use the book for some things, but important information could be a great substitution for many adverbs and adjectives. 
 The photography is poor at best, obviously done by an amateur.  Many photos are blurry or seem to have been manipulated.  Unfortunately, the window treatments are just as bad.  The same design is repeated over & over and with the same fabric.  Skip this one. 
 Had the professor who wrote the book.  the book is just as  haughty and arrogant. what a waste of time the whole situation is... 
 I received my book a few days ago. I must say I was kind of disappointed. To pay $23.95 + shipping for a small paperback book with mostly black and white pictures. I think the book will be a good read and provide me with some good tips, but I think most of the pictures should have at least been in color to really get the ideas across and easy to see. I guess I thought that even though it was a paperback that it would be a larger book with better pictures. 
 I must agree witht he reviewer who commented about the book being written by committee.   The narrative is choppy and lacking not only key details, but also historical background.   Because it's an autobiography, I don't necessarily think that it's fair to damn the book for being self-centered; it IS about him.   I do feel, however, that the book needs better editing and a bit more self-examination.    It's an okay addition to one's list of books about Everest expeditions - which I must admit, I've developed a morbid fascination with after recently re-reading "Into Thin Air".   I wouldn't, however, use it as my primary source for information or impressions 
 I don't need "MISFITS" wannabe's in the good ol' united states so I definetely dont need some woah woah ooh crap sung in japanese! Buy Earth a.d., Static Age,Walk Among Us,Legacy of Brutality or hell even Evilive to see what these losers wish they were. Just cause your songs are like fater than hell doesn't mean their good 
 While I enjoy Greenberg's radio show, I was extremely disappointed in this book.  Throughout the book, Greenberg relays the same banal stories he repeats ad nauseum on the radio.  Unfortunately, unlike on the radio, when Mike Golic is always available to slap some sense into Greenberg, this book is purely 100% Greenberg.  I am always amazed by those people who have lived extremely privileged lives, yet try to act like they have "struggled" in life.  Greenberg has had to "struggle" thru a cushy upbringing, going to exclusive schools such as Northwestern and eventually landing his gig at ESPN.  For those of you in the Chicago area, I hope that you caught Debra Pickett's article on Greenberg in the Chicago Sun-Times.  While Greenberg professes to be a family man, the article notes how he spent 2-1/2 hours talking about his favorite topic, himself, while forgoing the opportunity to meet his wife and children at the pool.  Keeping with his privileged existence, the pool was located at the East Bank Club in Chicago, yet another privileged club to which Greenberg belongs.  I should receive a refund for slopping thru this "book."  Hopefully, this review will prevent other people from making the mistake I did.  ESPN should fire this wimpy "meterosexual" for writing this book.  
 When you're watching a documentary and you know more facts about a particular subject then they do, you're in trouble. AND I'M DEFINATLY NO EXPERT ON THE SUBJECT! This pathetic excuse for a documentary is little more than an excuse to plug that horrible remake film. YES they interview most of the original cast, but for a grand total of 5 minutes total! The last 20 minutes were wasted John Laroquette talking to "THE ROBOT" and Bill Mumy and Dr. Smith reinacting a new scene. BUT if you liked the pathetic extras on the original Fantasia on Laserdisc where the rambling fat guy went on about "cherry tarts" or the Laserdisc Star Wars box set which ended with the host talking to R2D2, this Lost in Space Forever is for you 
 After reading countless poor reviews of the Dolce desk and hutch, I was quite skeptical about ordering it online. ... I gave in and ordered the set from target.com. The desk arrived in almost perfect condition (a few smudges in the stain); however, only half the hutch was in its box! The entire drawer (left side of hutch) was missing, the hardware was missing, and the assembly instructions were missing. ... I recommend calling your local Target store to check the Dolce collection's availability (and the parts inside!) before you waste the time and gas to get there. Aside from the missing hutch, the desk looks really great in my home office. 
 This CD sucked plain and simple. There is nothing about this band that makes them stand out from all the other radio-friendly bull**** spewed out today. I remember hearing about this band through a music video set to scenes of Legacy of Kain : Defiance and the song was Wake Up. I think the people making the music video realized this band sucked because they took parts out of the song and re-arranged everything to make it sound like a pretty cool song. So, when I saw the music video I was duped and bought their horrible CD. I immediately listened to the "real version" of Wake Up and was sorely dissapointed. Then, I listened to the rest of this boring and uninteresting debut. I wasted my $15. The worst part of this band is their ego too. If you see the enhanced video included on the CD...you will wonder how people making such bad music can have such a bloated ego. I hate this band and I hope they fail at everything they do. The funniest thing is the band's official website doesn't work anymore. So, I think they have failed already. This band won't be remembered or missed and that's a good thing.        
 It was flat after one night of sleeping.  We had to blow it up to capacity every night and would be sleeping on the ground by morning.    Also, be aware that you need an AC outlet to pump it up ... it's NOT for camping 
 Too bad that I didn't read the review of this product before I bought. The size is smaller than described and it's not handmade. will not buy anything from Greenland again 
 Why did they even bother transferring this movie to DVD?  Seriously?  The [...] child of a masterpiece, "The Vanishing" sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90's.  This isn't a matter of comparison.  This movie, all by itself, just sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, "what a brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended) with everything else in the movie". Jeff Bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie.  Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the movie.   And the ending.  Oh, the ending.  We've been cheated.  Totally cheated.  All the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of "It has to be upbeat!" Hollywood cornball syndrome.  Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit with a shovel, and everything is A-OK!  Even though Kiefer Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated.  This is [...]of a great movie.        
 I just ordered this cookbook and can already tell I'm not going to get my money's worth out it. There are very few recipes that call for ingredients you can buy at a typical supermarket. Most necessitate a trip to a specialty or gourmet market.  Also, make no mistake: this is not easy, leave it in the slow-cooker type of cooking. It's not a good sign when a recipe begins, "take the first 20 ingredients and marinate the meat overnight."  
 Hello to all those who have read this book.  After reading your reviews abour this book i felt i must say something.  WHy are you so set against God and Christianity?  One of you said this book was what made him rejest Christianity.  Christianity is not some weird religion,  it is the faith that Jesus Christ died for all humans, who He loves so much.  Where are you going after you die?  Christ is waiting for you to call to Him and ask for eternal life.  The Bible isnt some whack job scribbling stuff down, it is God inspired.  There are more manuscripts and texts to prove the Bible is real and written by those who claimed to write it.  there are more manuscripts than that of Homer's The Odyssey, yet we regard that as true.  So the Gospels werent written right after the disciples were with Jesus, but they were written at a time when those people could still remember their times with Christ.  I am going to wrap it up now, but if you want to hear the real TRUTH, read God's Word.  If you don't believe that, there are so many books that so the incredible evidence for the Bible.  The Age of Reason was written by a man who hated Christianity.  PLease do not just accept his writing without looking at the BIble.  Jesus Christ loves you, and he longs for you to accept Him so He can change your life and give you the awesome gift of eternal life with Him.  Thank you 
 I love Mr. Koontz and have long read his novels...Watchers, Intensity, Odd Thomas and so on but this was dissappointing, not to mention just plain depressing. And come on with the corny slap-stick banter between the characters! Okay okay, we know the 9 year- old Leilani has a high IQ but REALLY! She speaks like a 50 year-old rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence? These characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into. Therefore, I put it down after 350 pages of this twattle. Koontz has done much better in the past.  Lastly, let's keep dogs out of your next few novels, please? It's getting a bit old. How about a smart cat or raven for your next novel, maybe mixed with some more down-to-earth folks that speak like real people do? 
 Purchased the 418 Elliptical 5 months ago now.  Reviews after a week or two may not tell the whole story.  After 3 weeks the clicks, squeaks and clunks wouldn't go away by just tighting bolts so I called for service.  It took 4 weeks to get a tech. to look at it, he had to order parts which took another 4 weeks.  Replaced one of the main flywheels inside and the track rollers under the pedals.  It's not as noisy now but still makes a clicking noise on every rotation and intermittent squeaks and clunks.  Thought by spending a little more on this machine than the cheaper competition these problems would have been avoided, not so.  The heat rate monitor is not accurate but the rest of the electronic features have been working fine, unlike many other reviewer's comments 
 This book was easy enough to read, it just wasn't what I expected from Quindlen.  I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating, in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out.  The back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing, and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past, whereas the previous paragraph was present time.  Although I got used to that writing style, I always found it annoying.  The storyline itself never sold me either: a typical, young "sew-your-wild-oats" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the "perfect" father. I just did not find such an occurrence likely.  And, as a mother myself, all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm. Anyway the whole story seemed far-fetched and disjointed to me, and a disappointment especially since I have been a Quindlen fan for many, many years 
 'A Different Universe' really is a complete waste of time. Most of the anecdotes are dull. The book has no direction, and you can find all of the 'science' and more in the three and a half page article:  Laughlin and Pines, PNAS vol. 97 pp.28-31 (2000) 
 As a Maiden fan for 20+ years, I've spent many an hour singing along and banging my head to one of the best bands that metal has ever offered up. I don't even consider this a Maiden album, but it is so I have to compare it to the rest of the catalog. Blaze's voice is so flat and boring that it's amazing nobody questioned it during the recording/mixing; just listen to him saying "Falling down" on Man On The Edge. Paul Dianno didn't have half the range as Bruce, but he pulled it off just fine. The other thing I've noticed is that the compositions aren't up to the normal Maiden level. It seems like Steve just really wasn't into it or maybe he just lost inspiration. I'm not going to rip this album apart because it's just a small blip on the the legacy of a band that I couldn't hold any higher regard for. 
 In my opinion, this book reads like a school book report. It is a disappointment, considering the reputation of the source -- Stephen Ambrose. Maybe I expected too much because the author is well known. On the other hand, I didn't expect too much from the not well known author Norman Thomas Remick and his book "West Point", and was most pleasantly surprised. But there you are, then. It's not what you do, it's who you know that counts 
 As a JD PhD who teaches and researches American slavery I can say two horrendous things about this work. First, it is considered a classic and required reading for anyone who wants to understand the institution of slavery in America. Second, it is condescending, racist and continues to contaminate otherwise intelligent thought on the topic. Genovese contends that slave control was maintained through Hegemony, a concept developed by Gramsci to explain how the ruling class under capitalism uses ideology to persuade workers to consent its own moral, political and cultural values to their own detriment, a concept that can have no meaning in a regime of physical coersion. Genovese also claims that slavery was paternalistic, where slaves and their owners had reciprical rights and obligations. For example, according to him, slaves would "consent" to whippings that they saw as "reasonable." If you want a nice, pastoral portrayal of slaves singing while they cut "massa's" cotton, well this is the book for you 
 Creates a stream of oil rather than a spray. I found it impossible to completely clean the internal parts, causing the oil to eventually go rancid and ruin the sprayer 
 Jerry is one of history's great stand up comedians, no doubt. That is why this is worth listening to. Be aware that yes, there is a lot of material on here that is old. Basically stuff you might have seen Jerry perform on an HBO special back in like 1982. I think since he regrettably never released a stand up record before he decided to use a lot of this to preserve it on a CD. That in conjunction with the fact that he might not have had that much new material. I wish he had vintage stuff of him recorded from small comedy clubs back in the 80s. I always prefer on a comedy record that it is performed in a small club as opposed to a huge arena or hall. You definitely lose all of the intimacy that I think makes for the best stand up comedy experience. All in all since this is Jerry's one and only comedy record it is certainly worth checking out, let's face it a mediocre Jerry output is better than a lot of comedians best stuff. 
 This book is more of a long essay (100 pages?) mostly concerning 'Blood Meridian' which I think is the least interesting of the so-called 'Western' novels. It does contain interesting material and a lot of research went into it 
 Is there substance?  Yes, not a lot, but there is a brief overview of history here.    Is there fluff?  Oh hell yes and way too much of it.  There are just way too many asides and way too much focus on kings rather than conditions.  For example, he explains that Caesar may have had a homosexual escapade in Spain.  NOT PERTINENT and a little offensive to boot.  Remove such things and you have about 50 pages of worthy reading and I have to question some of his findings in those 50.    He goes to great lengths to brush over Spanish atrocities in the New World and at Home, claiming they are basically English racism towards the Spanish designed as a PR campaign against.  I have no doubt that such existed as the two countries have long had problems, but that doesn't mean the Spanish Conquistadors weren't brutal (and downright evil at times).  And the Inquisition should never have detractors.  The most telling moment of the book happens, after detailing this "racism", he then goes on another aside to tell how the Irish sold out the Spanish for a bottle of whisky. Holy crap is that the pot calling the kettle black and how any editor would let that slip through, calls into question the entire book.  So I learned a little from it, but it's not worth your effort.  Seek other books.  
 Just repeat the following several times. 1) Draggy plot 2) Uninspired acting, especially Allen, who almost sinks it 3) unimaginative (story, direction, etc) Then get a Hitchcock film 
 I found The Whole Woman more antagonistic and needlessly controversial than enlightening. Greer makes it quite clear that there is exactly one feminist left on the planet, and she is it.  I'm hard-pressed to think of any third-wave feminists who live up to her standards. To do so, you would have to be an earth-mother living in a separatist commune with her lesbian lover. There's nothing wrong with that lifestyle, but it's not one to which most feminists would aspire. It's not one to which I aspire.  Also, it's as limiting a construction of womanhood as the patriarchal one she deplores. What do you do if you are heterosexual? It's all very well for her to say that you can reconstruct yourself as a lesbian, but that's as insulting as the implication that homosexuals just need to try hard enough and they can be heterosexual.   In a similar vein, I found her views of men particularly unpleasant. She suggests in no uncertain terms that they're all potential adulterers, rapists, child-abusers, wife-beaters, misogynists, etc . . . etc . . ., and that any woman who wants an equal, non-exploitative relationship had better become a lesbian. It's hard to see it as anything but pure slander, backed up by the flimsiest of anecdotal evidence. Just because you can cite a few cases of sickos who get turned on by their baby daughters in their nightgowns does not mean that all fathers will inevitably turn to abuse.   The rest of the book is no better. It's very poorly researched and argued, and parts of it verge into the insane. She seems particularly taken with the idea of "primitive" women as whole women, because they aren't bound by Western concepts of femininity. What she doesn't mention is that those women experience the same oppression that Western feminists fought long and hard to overcome. They might not wear bras or high-heels, but that doesn't make them any less oppressed by patriarchy. It seems obvious to me that women from tribal societies do not generally have much real political power, but are doomed to bear lots of children and die young. When she does look at the appalling aspects of those societies, she puts a positive spin on them. There's even a section where she seems to defend female genital mutilation.   Also, I can imagine that some of her ill-informed views are extremely offensive to people in those situations. She describes IVF as patriarchal appropriation of and interference into the process of reproduction. Similarly, she suggests that women who don't opt for natural childbirth (without anaesthetic, of course) are allowing men to remove them from the process. It's utterly disrespectful of the choices women may choose to make, not because they've internalised their oppression but because inseminating themselves with a turkey-baster seems vaguely ludicrous or because they don't want to experience agonising pain.  It's been a while since I read a feminist book that made me angry and this one does so for all the wrong reasons. It makes me embarrassed to call myself a feminist. 
 There are only three short films on this DVD. The Wooden Clogs With The Red Straps  Regeneration Last Day as a Teenager   If you like classic ghost stories/legends, the first one might be for you. Don't however, expect to be scared. These aren't even remotely creepy. A man stays with a family and meets their reclusive daughter with a limp. She is mysterious and warns him to stay away from the temple. The family has a secret- and there are no surprises here. Regeneration is a quick tale of a girl who can grow back body parts that are cut off. She gets married, gets dementia, again no scares and you can guess the rest. Last day as a teenager - This one is another classic ghost story about a boy who makes a deal with death- and then tries to get out of it while he tries to protect his girlfriend. 
      I had high hopes for this book since I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed out loud while reading Bryson's 'In a Sunburned Country'. I was more than a little disappointed after finished `Lost Continent' I came away feeling more than a little disappointed.      Before I bought this book I was puzzled at the contrasting reviews here and I initially took the most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I figured these were written by people who mostly just took offense way too easily and were unable to laugh at themselves as Americans. I have to say though, after reading the book I find myself agreeing with some of the negative reviews of this book.       First off, as an American that has lived overseas for 3 years now, I feel I'm more than capable of looking at America with an objective eye. I'm completely aware of America's many shortcomings - ie.  the propensity for urban sprawl, the seemingly declining interest in it's rich history, the ever growing dependence on technology and increasing laziness that invariably comes with it etc. etc.     Having said that, I still regard this book primarily as just one endless, tiring, repetitive rant by an unhappy man. One would be hard pressed to find more than a couple instances where Bryson spent more than three of four sentences at a time describing anything he found ENJOYABLE. As one reviewer pointed out, Bryson comes across as being exactly like the kind of people he constantly complains about in this book...rude, ignorant, and, just like Bryson himself, overweight (apparently he hasn't stepped in front of a mirror lately). One has to wonder why someone would put out a book that is so consistently sour in tone. If I had just finished such a thoroughly unsatisfying and unhappy trek as this, I would be hard pressed to come up with a good reason (other than a quick buck perhaps) to actually write a book about it. Let me get one thing straight, if this were a book about Canada or anywhere else outside the U.S. I would feel the same way. Yes, there are a few funny passages in his book, but his air of superiority along with the overuse of metaphors pretty much dampen it at times. As demonstrated in `In a Sunburned Country', his strength lies in sharing facts and history of the places he finds himself in, and the humor is always much more engaging when it isn't over the top and written as if he's trying to impress himself.        There was a span of about 12 years between the writing of `Lost Continent' and `In a Sunburned Country', and it shows. This is a younger Bryson, a man who seems to have a problem with every little detail, and it becomes increasingly tedious and irritating as the book goes on. He rarely displays anything other than contempt for the places he finds himself in. A couple of other reviewers also made valid points when they found it curious that (with the exception of his Iowa drug buddy) he never manages to engage anyone in anything resembling a meaningful conversation to actually get a handle on their mindset (as he did in "In A Sunburned Country' for instance). His interactions with locals are mostly limited to ordering food at local restaurants and asking for directions. He seems perfectly content coming to conclusions about entire groups of people based on no real substance and communication whatsoever.       In this book, sadly, he comes across as nothing more than a sarcastic, anti-social loner with a bone to pick with just about everyone and everything. Any remotely kind words he has about anything (and they are few and far between) are all but smothered by the sour tone of the book as a whole. I SO wish I could recommend this book for others to read, but I'd be lying if I said it's time well spent 
 I looked through the excerps in the hope that this book might be one I would like to add to the collection, and it seems to me to be a waste of money...even though it only costs $5.  Invest that amount into "Uncommon Grounds" by Mark Pendergrast; if you are serious about coffee, I fear "Higher Grounds" will be misleading, or at best, quite vague.   Example: a quote in the book says that one coffee tree produces one pound of coffee.  True, but it should say that one tree produces one pound of roasted coffee...operative word being "roasted".  A layman might not guess at the importance of that fact.  One roasted bean is only about 15% of the original weight of the fruit that the coffee seed/bean is contained in.   Another example that will rub any person with any biological training and one which I noticed immediately: "Coffea arabica" should be typed as such.  This author capitalizes the "a" in arabica, and the first letter of the species name is never capitalized.  I know I'm being picky here, but this is the first impression I received from the book...and I knew my opinion of it would be downhill from there.   The book seems elementary and not worth the money.  Please try something else.  I cannot recommend Pendergrast's "Uncommon grounds: The history of coffee and how it transformed our world" enough!  You could also try "The Devil's Cup" for coffee's influence on global societies...just do not buy "Higher Grounds"!  Libraries exist for a reason.  
 WICKED COOL SHELL SCRIPTS is a collection of pre-made bash scripts for various tasks similar to one of O'Reilly's "cookbooks". All scripts here use bash--the author rejects csh because of Tom Christiansen's classic essay "Csh Programming Considered Harmful" and the Korn shell because he considers it fine for interactive use but not so good for scripting.  The basic format of each entry is first the problem--what the user wants to do--then the code, followed sometimes by an explanation and advice on hacking the code. The book is not really an introduction to Bash scripting. If you want a systematic primer I'd recommend O'Reilly's LEARNING THE BASH SHELL or any of a dozen libre tutorials.  Some of the scripts are useful and solve problems I've occasionally faced. For example, the GNU units program can't do temperature conversions, but a script is given here which uses bc to provide a solution. Quite elegant is a script with which the user can find the time anywhere in the world by querying in a friendly manner the system's zoneinfo files. In spite of some neat gimmicks, however, I don't think I can really recommend the book unless you're someone about to take a voyage on the south seas and won't have Internet access. Many of these scripts can be found on the Web, and far too many scripts here solve problems already long solved by available programs. The author describes a secure version of locate, when slocate is already easily installable on most *nix systems. A script for rotating log files is done when metalog and other common log programs do this automatically. Take out all these unnecessary scripts, and the amount of useful content in the book turns out to be very low indeed 
 David Irving, for those who read his books and read the Trial Transcripts, makes it quite clear that   1. The Jews were killed by the Nazis  2. Hitler as Head of State is ultimately responsible.  3. How this happened is not as clear cut as made out to be and at any time things could have turned out differently and that everyone shares responsibility for these atrocities and no one came out of this war with clean hands.  This is why he is hated. 
 The idea behind this toy was a cute one, but it stops there.  Within five minutes of playing with this toy, it broke.  The dog halter broke off the wire leash and could not be repaired.  The whole thing ended up in the trash on Christmas Day! 
 Sorry, this one gets added to my pile of books with titles such as "How they faked the 1969 moon landing" or "Curing cancer with Laetrile."  Written in 2004, the book purports to lay the blame for disasters, locusts, and plagues of any and every decade (both in the 1990s and 2000) on one or both of the Clintons. Obviously of a partisan nature, it will only be enjoyable to folks of the extreme right. Those wanting a more probing view can choose from more reputable and well-written titles which explore the same topic 
 In his untenable book of mysticism, Jameson proposes that works of literature express the collective political unconscious of the age in which they are written, and that they are thus complicitous with power. While he allows for some complexity in this relationship between hegemonic politics and aesthetic production-works of literature, for example, express the deep history of class struggle-he ultimately collapses these categories: dominant politics and literature are one in every age, collapsed into a vague "ideology of form," and literature inevitably sides with the masters.  To forward his argument, Jameson adopts a Jungian definition of the unconscious from Northrop Frye while ignoring some of Frye's more poignant distinctions. For instance, in Frye's work, political, institutional language acts as a controlling commentary on the more profound and radical voice of literature, and they are thus at odds (Frye calls political language literature's "antipode"). However, Jameson's adoption of the Jungian unconscious for his model allows him a slippery, quasi-religious definition of the political unconscious-you cannot see it directly, but, like the wind, like God, it's everywhere, and we all believe in it all at once, whether we know it or not.   Equally "faith-based" criticism generated from Jameson's work has argued specifically that "canonical" authors such as Emerson and Thoreau expressed the political unconscious of the Jacksonian age, and that the critics in the early 20th century who canonized them expressed the political unconscious of the Cold War years, unconsciously underwriting American globalism. A twisted path leads to these conclusions (for example, we have to accept the untenable proposal that an ideology of American individualism lay at the heart of Cold War political ideology). However, the whole path could have been avoided if Jameson had taken Freud's version of the unconscious as his starting point-the place that holds taboo thought and images that have been traumatized out of the individual by a society of repression. This political unconscious would have given us a valid explanation for why activists, radicals, and everyday dissenters go to works of literature to remind themselves of what the political conscious of the age-with its outright, unsubtle, unliterary chatter-has buried in them.   
 Yet again, a book by Daniel Ladinsky rides on the coat-tails of other, much more gifted writers. Ladinsky doesn't translate these poets, or even provide new renderings based on previous translations - as he himself admits, he writes poems which he believes to have been divinely revealed to him by various famous writers and poets from previous centures, revelations which bear no relationship to anything these writers produced while actually alive. Funny how they all come out sounding like a twentieth century American 
 As a child, I loved the first book of short stories. When, in my post college years, I found The New Adventures, I loved those too. The Big Kerplop was pretty good. This one, however, should have stayed unpublished. The Professor is irritating, and gives a horrible view of science. The girls are ok, if dated. The boys in the club really don't do much of anything. Where's the cool techie toys (ham radio and so on) that were in the short stories? Where's the adventure? The only sense of wonder in the entire thing is when the boys are finding the passageways in the castle.  So again, give this one a pass. There are reasons it wasn't published 30 years ago. It is the Mad Scientist's Club, so I won't give it only one star, but .. 
 I was really looking forward to this book as a fan of some of his earlier books, especially five dysfunctions of a team, which is one of the most elegant frameworks i've seen on team dynamics.  lencioni's solution to silos and politics?  a shared goal with supporting objectives and metrics.  it's a lot more complex than just that, and i'm surprised he didn't bring in some of his other work related to team dynamics and leadership, which must also be significant levers to help combat this problem.  if you're looking to solve your problem with silos and politics within your own organization, keep looking.. 
 These types of movies are becoming quite the trend in Hollywood. Fight Club started it (which was an awesome movie). Then the Sixth Sense (which was also pretty good). After that, it all went downhill. The Brown Bunny, The Machinist, The Others, Hide & Seek, etc. Surprise endings with a twist, characters that don't exist that are only in the main characters imagination, daed characters that don't know they are dead. These movies are all about surprising the audience with the already overused plot twists. I predicted that John Torturro's character was a figment of Depp's imagination within the first 20-25 mins of the film. Why would an actor of Depp's status take part in a movie of this substance 
 Even though I am a fan of the Calphalon cutlery line (I really think they beat the pants off of the German competition), this block leaves a lot to be desired. The block that came with my 15 piece set was pretty nice, and I ordered this block to house the additional knives that I bought. It appears to be the same design, but the quality control is awfull. Several glue joints were split open when I recieved the block, and the finish was not quite up to par. Given the low cost, I chose to glue and clamp the block into submission, rather than to send it back, but you  might be better off buying a more expensive block to start with 
 This book was terrible!  DON'T waste your money!!!! There are many other good parenting books out there by people who are MUCH more credible than Ezzo.  Even though some say this book works for them, there are many more who know that it is a slippery slope. Visit www.ezzo.info/ BEFORE YOU BUY THIS BOOK!!!  Parents Beware. 
 Have you ever read a book wwhose plot was so convoluted and whose characters were so uninteresting that by the time you got to the end you just didn't care?  "Hour Game" was like that for me.  The promise displayed by the pairing of Sean King and Michelle Maxwell in "Split Second" isn't realized here.  If they became romantically involved, all the chemistry would be lost, but "Hour Game" suggests that, with that option closed to him, Baldacci doesn't know what to do with them.  If you're looking for a good Baldacci read--heck, a good thriller/suspense/mystery read, period--try his "The Camel Club" 
     I was very disapointed with the smoker cover.  It is made of a very THIN plastic that is simular to a medium guage garbage bag material.  This type of cover needs to be able to be resistant to some heat, weather, and also some general scratching.  Just taking the cover off requires real tender care or you will get a quick split in it.  The company needs if necessary to charge more for the cover and make it more durable.      Sincerely yours,  Allen Vest III 
 I have nothing but respect for someone who learns enough art and enough physics to write a proper book on the topic.  Unfortunately, this author has not done so.  Put simply, this text contain information that is downright misleading.  Physics can be quite difficult, especially if one is trying to understand the esoteric worlds of relativity and modern (quantum) physics.  That said, there is no excuse for misleading a reader, when an educated layman's understanding of physics would reveal correct and useful information.  Dr Shlain states several things that would mislead a lay reader.  For example, his understanding of the way lights add is just plain wrong.  This might not harm a painter, but would harm a digital artist or someone building light sculptures.  Were said painter to think that their flawed understanding was supported by relativity, they would resist learning how lights differ from pigments, making it very hard to move to interior design or other light-based domains.  This complete failure to get the physics even close to correct makes me worry about the art history.  Again, he does not have to be an expert, but proper due diligence would suggest sending the drafts to a working art historian and a working physicist to get their feedback before inficting it on the general public.  Again, I am not claiming that one needs graduate level work to write such a book.  I do claim that one should have at least an educated layman's exposure to the feilds before taking pen in hand 
 Paul Johnson's History of the Jews seems to start well: to a layman, at least, there is a sense of balance - but then it is hard to take the uprising against Zedekiah personally, and while of course it could, under duress, be made to read as a trope for various political tendencies, the author wisely shows little interest in giving the incident a partisan colour. Modern history, however, gets a far different treatment.   The Ashkenazim were often characterized by anti-Semites as "cunning"; recent scholarship shows that, in fact, the isolation and other unusual conditions to which they were subject over generations inclined them not only towards certain diseases (almost 60% of Ashkenazi suffer from genetically-linked alleles) but also towards higher intelligence than other European males: almost 15 IQ points above the average verbal and mathematical scores, although they tend to have visuospacial scores slightly below the average (see "Natural History of Ashkenazi Intelligence", Journal of Biosocial Science, June 2005). Little wonder, then, that Jews were enthusiastic participants in the explosion of new ideas that followed the Enlightenment.   These Jews, from Spinoza on, are given increasingly heavy-handed treatment. While it is normal for an author to have his personal preference - in Johnson's case, for the religious over the secular, the moderate over the radical, and the conservative over the progressive - Johnson's Jew is the product of a dangerously nostalgic mis-remembering. Can it be anything other than deeply and insultingly patronizing for a Gentile author to engage, albeit from some supposedly philo-Semitic motive, in the taxonomy of Jews into self-hating and non-? It is a meaningless exercise at best; would anyone ever think to call Luther a self-hating Catholic? Or Galileo?   At worst, it belies the very philo-Semitism it supposedly characterizes. Why is Rosa Luxembourg a self-hating Jew? Because her politics don't match Johnson's own? Or, more disturbingly, because she doesn't match his image of the meek and dutiful Jew, happily occupied with his scrolls and his flat bread? This stereotypical Jew is sometimes known, in my (admittedly assimilated) circles, as the Williamsburg Jew because, although people imagine they will find him in Brooklyn, in fact he is unlikely to exist outside the implications of the Virginia tourist attraction of the same name.   Luxembourg's statement, on which Johnson hangs the self-hating epithet, that she is only as concerned about the troubles of Jews as she is about the troubles of all oppressed peoples, is obviously Communist in its inspiration - and therefore anathema to the author - but it is nonetheless completely rational and, it should be pointed out, not incompatible with the Jewish mission to serve as an example. Why is a rational Jew self-hating - because he might make trouble for the Goyim? There is something of the minstrel show about Johnson's model of the modern Jew, something that undermines irretrievably the book as a whole 
 I'll never forget how much I hated this book, a miserable read that stands as a yardstick to measure everything I hate in fiction. Because my first Atwood novel was the masterful "A Handmaid's Tale", I eagerly sought out a replay of that unforgettable book by reading her first really acclaimed work. Reading this thin volume felt like a lifetime's penance for every novel I have ever enjoyed. Some self-conscious, dated, impressionistic, terribly indulgent rumination on the injustice of life for the modern woman, by finishing it I learned a valuable lesson, namely what it is that I hate in a novel. Read "A Handmaid's Tale". 
 Sonny Barger's tales are Slurs of Confabulations, False Recollections, Fuzzy Logics, basics of "FMS" (False Memory Syndrome). Sonny Barger demonstrates a "Limitless Capacity for Denail" therefore Distorting His Own Statements from Yesteryear. Mr. Barger was evidently under the impression, by placing his name upon a book that the reading public would be sensationalized into the Illusion Barger's some sort of an American Hero, Hardly. Mr. Barger speaks of Brotherhood & Freedom; Never Defining either. (Brotherhood was betrayal of silence after the RICO Trial. Freedom was before Barger's First Conviction, since he has never known real freedom.) All too-much in Barger's Book can be refuted by its mere statements. This book was obviously just put together for money and cover-ups. Publisher should have included an airsickness bag with each book. 10% of a book that covers over 40-years of Hells Angels History was spent taking cheap shots at the Government, over the RICO Trail 1979/1980. This was a Gamble by the Publisher, too-many have known otherwise. Publisher changing the title would help. (Hell's Angel: The Lies and Crimes of Sonny Barger and the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club) 
 First five chapters are on Dell's configurator "Choice board". This one is a total waste of time. Not technical, not re-invent the business. What is the audience here 
 The book is in black and white print on cheap paper, images are small and low quality, it's almost only text, text, text. The info might be good, but the PATTERNS aren't. DON'T WASTE YOUR $$ 
 Everything is fine, everything is OK. The simplest answer is the most likely.  Conspiracies are made up by left-wing wackos with nothing to do.  Did Iran-Contra ("Ask about the cocaine!"), Tuskegee, MK-ULTRA, Latin American germ warfare, Bay of Pigs, Allende overthrow, CIA LSD research of the 50s, '66 NY subway experiment, and the Arbenz coup in Guatemala all happen?  No they didn't.  Oliver North acted alone and was deranged and crazy.  E. Howard Hunt was a deranged loner who tried to kill Castro.  Uncle Sam was a crazy deranged lunatic that give African Americans syphilis in 1932.  He acted alone.  God bless America.  I love our leader.  The more than fifty people that died after the Kennedy assassination all committed suicide.  They were distressed by Oswald's murder of Kennedy and could not go on living.  Shame on you Mr. Oswald.  I love you Mr. Posner.  You're a lot better than that Oswald guy.  Mr. Posner: would you please write a book debunking the claims of The Chuch of the Sub-Genius?  JR Bob Dobbs is a nut and must be stopped.  God bless you and your people 
 I've been using Apple's Macintosh systems since 1984 and have seen some great improvements in system stability, which I consider THE most important aspect of an OS.  First off Tiger is a smooth running system (when it is smoothly running), and has some of the nicest bells and whistles around. The best dog-and-pony show around. That being said, WATCH OUT!  This OS is capable of completely hosing your user settings, all your software registrations, bookmarks, email settings, etc. The whole enchilada. ANY OS that can do that at the drop of a dime isn't worth the time. Since I use Disk Warrior, Cocktail and Disk Utility regularly, this should never have happened. I waited until the OS was at the 10.4.3 stage before upgrading from 10.3.9 -- apparently it is not yet ready -- best to wait another year before upgrading. Hopefully these bugs will be fixed 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 I remember hearing about this book by the great patriot Sean Hannity sometime in 2001, then it was a mere idea. From that time on, until August 20th 2002, I waited for what I thought would be the greatest book of all time. I remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title: "Let Freedom Ring" with not just a picture of Sean Hannity on the cover, patriot that he is, but also a flag. I loved it, couldn't be more happy.  Well, the day of the book's release, I took a day off work (i've never missed a day of work before in my life), and rushed to get this book. It looked better than I ever imagined.  With the flag on the cover and the title of "Let Freedom Ring," I thought, finally, technology has caught up to our patriotism. I expected a book filled with flags, flags with sound effects. Maybe some firework sound effects.   Boy was I wrong. I opened the book only to the colors black and white. No red. No blue. No stars and stripes. I quickly turned the pages, looking, searching for flags. I found none, no sound effects either, no fireworks.   At that point, I went into a 4 year long depression. I nearly committed suicide at several points. It's only now that I can bring myself to review this man's book, patriot that he is.   I say this so you know what you're getting yourself into. There are no flags, no stars and stripes, no fireworks, no sound effects.   I have since recovered, but only because of old stars and stripes. I went back to teaching last year, not fully recovered, and my colleagues, knowing how much I love America and the STARS AND STRIPES, suggested I have my class do a research project: find the most patriotic book ever made.   The methodoloy was simple: A book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high, a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest.   We found some very good books and they did cheer me up. The one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called "President Jesus: How Jesus Wrote the Constitution, Freed the Slaves, and Won World War II." Its published by a small church in Texas. I was very proud of my students for finding it. It has brought countless joy to my life. Along with the book, made entirely out of a flag, with flag pictures, and written in blue and red ink, you get a giant flag. I'm not sure of the dimensions, but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck. I've draped it over my house and it covers it completely. People even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house.   Now I often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time, smiling. 
 First off, I purchased the book and was really excited after finishing it. I began to research where to buy "Country Mallow", a specific type of ephedra, that the doctor recommends. After countless unsuccessful hours of searching for the product by itself and not part of a mixture,I decided to e-mail the doctor and ask where I could purchase it. After all, he did say that he perscribes it to his patients. I found it very disturbing that he not only does'nt have a e-mail address, but further research led me to his medical profile...He is just a internal medicine doctor, not a specialist. Yes, he does have a phone number and address to contact him, however, after working directly with doctors and their staff for eleven years, you most likely would need to make an appointment to speak with the man. I'd bet my last dollar that he would'nt "consult" with you over the phone.I work as a phlebotomist and most doctors will NOT give any info over the phone without seeing you as a NEW patient first. So, in my opinion, and thats all it is, I wouldnt jump to follow an Internal Medicine doctor but one that does have a degree in Holistic Medicine, or one that has a Bariatric degree. I cant stress the importance of blood work first to find out if its something else and not just a slow metabolisim. I have an appointment with my doctor this Wednesday to have a thyroid screen as well as a hypo-adrenalism screen 
 As a lover of all things glacial (with Antarctica holding a particularly special place in my heart), I was thrilled to come across this book in my local library. The book promised to deliver an enjoyable blend of history, science and culture in an entertaining travelogue format. Sadly, I soon found myself disappointed. By the time I was halfway through, I was struggling to make progress through what should have been an engaging read.  Wheeler suffers for the most part from a lack of direction. Her "travels" consist of spur-of-the-moment helicopter rides to various locations on the ice that fail to be distinguishable after the fourth or fifth trip. Indeed, at times the book reads more like segments of a blog interspersed haphazardly with snippets of polar exploration history or the odd fact about glacial ice or penguins. This is further muddled with somewhat contrived musings on American culture (they're all depicted like they're ex-cowboys from Texas), or anomalous personal asides that try to be meaningful but come across as undeveloped filler material.  Individual chapters have no particular structure or purpose, and so the finished product feels a bit like slogging along through the variations of the same thing: funny anecdote, helicopter ride, historical bit, description of another station's toilet facilities or the food they eat, personal aside. After several chapters of this jumpy, disjointed writing style, following the narrative stops being fun and feels more like work. This is unfortunate; Wheeler's writing isn't necessarily poor, but seems to suffer from a bad editing job and a lack of planning.  The anecdotes are amusing, the history fascinating, but when it comes to the science and the researchers themselves Wheeler largely fails to make a case for their relevance. Instead, they come across as slightly eccentric guinea pigs with odd-but-quaint obsessions. Still, perhaps the book's greatest crime is that she largely fails to capture the beauty and utter wildness of this last frontier on Earth, and in the end I felt no closer to Antarctica than when I first picked up the book.  ~ Jacquelyn Gil 
  The "Claude Glass" sounds like a very interesting topic, but the handling of this topic by the author A. Maillet is out of the limits of professional academic research. The very short chapters filled with heterogeneous thesis and arbitrary pictures and diagrams evade a clear art-historian or philosophical approach of the Claude Glasse's use for artists in the 18th century. The first interesting thesis, that you expect normally in the introduction, is presented on page 163 (of 221 pages main-Text): "The Claude Mirror... is... an apparatus that enables one to transpose reality into a melodious harmony." In the internet you find articles that give you more insight for free.  
 They say all the major characters come back in `Stitch the Movie,' quickly made direct-to-video sequel to the hugely popular `Lilo and Stitch.' For me, the original film's most appealing part is, and will be, Lilo and Stitch, one of the most delightful characters Disney created in the last decade. Do we still need Pleakley when we have Stitch? How about Cobra? Or some alien whose name you have forgotten? Do we need them? No, I don't think so.  But `Stitch the Movie' crammed all these characters into this small film of which running time barely exceeds one hour, together with a weak story that repeats exactly what the original was doing. The original's idea of `Ohana' or `family' is changed to `cousin' this time, but for most of the viewers this is literally a twice-told story, no longer attractive enough.  What makes us feel short-changed is, however, the lack of music and scenery, the impressive parts of `Lilo and Stitch.' Instead of Elvis songs, they have thrown in parodies or homage to other films and TVs like Monty Python and Ed Wood, completely missing the target audiences who would buy this DVD to experience the joyful sound and rhythm of this great singer.   Moreover, the charming, water-color Hawaiian scenery is reduced to the generic, unimaginative backdrop which is barely OK even by the lower standard of the Disney's cheap sequels.  The only saving grace is the presence of the actors who provided the voices to the characters. Except that, and the funny but brief scenes about the lovely pair Lilo and Stitch, `Stitch the Movie' looks like a pilot film for the original. Or perhaps it is. 
 This upgrade is a disaster. First of all, in Word, the view markups function is the default now, so you have to go through and change all the settings to hide markups (most people in my department do not want to see those distracting colors and balloons and do not need to edit the doc in any way). However, if you want to send a document that does not have the tracked changes embedded -- because you don't know which version of Word the recipient has, and you can't take the chance of them seeing all those comments -- you have to go through the document again, view markups, reject the comments, Accept Changes, and resave. It's kind of difficult to explain, and frustrating too. People think that if they can't see it, then the recipient won't be able to see it either.  This is a good explanation from a Microsoft help forum:  *Not displaying* tracked changes isn't the same as *not having* tracked changes. Even when using Word 2002, the changes were still in the documents, and anyone could see them just by turning on the display. All that has happened in 2003 is that the display is automatic. The way to have documents in which changes are not displayable is to remove the changes from the documents entirely -- and to do that you must *accept or reject* all the changes. Nothing you do with the view will be sufficient. If you need to retain a record of the changes, you'll have to maintain two sets of documents: one with the changes, which *never* leave your office, and another that has been "scrubbed" and can be sent out.   Still, it's a big problem and more unnecessary work than 2002's version. Also, Outlook's new default view is quite different than before. The panes are set differently, so you have to go to View/Reading Panes to change the positions. And then you have to ungroup items (the breaks in between the weeks are very annoying...most people don't like that, although I guess some people think it looks more organized).  Oh, Microsoft - can't live with it, can't live without it.  Almost forgot...the buttons/icons are prettier in this version, and we all know that that makes a huge difference. Yessss! Pretty buttons! I can die happy now.  
 Besides pretty much knowing the ending shortly after the beginning, the movie is just dumb. The characters for the most part are flat, the twists are unbelievable, and everything in the story lacks any reality. The incredibly high tech bank is run on a rack of pc equipment, but somehow is now run remotely and all of the maintenance terminals are missing. As if the full rack of gear needs some green screens in order to work. Sorry. Then of course the hackers need to do a home invasion in order to get physical access to the system. Hmm. And then they take several days, only to stumble when the maintenance terminals are missing. So, in a flash of brilliance Harrison Ford rips out the scanning bar from an all in one printer and plugs it into an ipod. And then tapes it to the screen so that they can capture the screen output. Because everyone knows most people like to watch numbers scroll on the screen and there is no such thing as cat or pipes. But, if you believe you can pull some stuff out of a printer and click it into your ipod and suddenly have a portable text capture device, well i guess the rest of it makes sense. but then, the wireless video cameras all had fisheye lenses. which makes sense because there is a wireless toy car that takes all of them out temporarily, since it obviously uses the same frequency. which we know because in the beginning of the movie it causes huge interference on a computer screen. since after all, most computer screens connect to the pcs using a wireless transmitter. that cable you plug in the back is really just an antenna. and you will believe that only bad guys get hurt when automatic weapons spray buildings and older computer guys can beat the crud out of younger armed psychopathic criminals with british accents. And that there is great wireless coverage throughout the empty areas of washington state, so that you can drive in a car with your laptop and have constant internet access.   so, what was there to like in the movie? hmm. it was consistent. nothing made much sense from the start to the end. oh, and one of the computer guys looked like he actually could be a computer guy. but of course he was killed for being nice. or in the way. or whatever.  watch bladerunner for the 15th time instead. 
 I've been using this shaver for almost a year, and am disappointed with it.  For years, I've used the older style Remingtons shaped like a rectangular prism. I suppose this new shape is intended to fit the hand better, but I never got used to it. I find myself supporting the shaver with my other hand because I feel like I'll drop it otherwise.  The big problem is with the screen. Try very hard to avoid letting your skin come in contact with the edge of the screen. Otherwise, the blades will bite you and sometimes draw blood.  To clean, it is easy enough to remove the screen assembly, but getting it back on is tricky. If not very careful, it goes on unevenly and gets stuck. With practice, it usually works the first time.  The funniest thing about this shaver is the plug that plugs into the wall. It looks like a cutting-edge state-of-the-art plug from the 1920s 
 What a horrid little film. This is hardly surprising given that Richardson has made a career of horrid little films. (He can thank Olivier for his one passable effort.) The lead is a ranting crybaby of the sort now familiar. He knows how the affairs of the world should be run, but can't be bothered to treat people with civility and maintain his own life with responsibility and dignity. He is, in short, the model enfant terrible of the post-WWII Left, whose battle cry was aptly put by Jim Morrison (himself in the same mold), "We want the world and we want it now."   There should have been a sequal in which the lead becomes prime minister of such-and-such country and turns it into a squalid, barbaric socialist paradise. Or he could have morphed into Ernesto Guevara and taken on Che's job of master of the death squads 
 Why is this movie in print, but the far superior "Pirates of Penzance" with Kevin Kline out of print 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 I thought Keegan was a "serious" historian.  This book contains little to do with the actual war itself - you would have picked up more on how it was fought on a 2nd rate cable news channel - indeed I beleive thats where he did all his research for this poor excuse for a "serious" miltary analysis of the iraq war 
 Fifty-five minutes into this film, after Freya (Jane March) listens to the Beast's explanation of his current condition--it is the punishment of Odin for killing a bear--she says, "What does it mean? It makes no sense."   Although there is still half an hour yet to come, these eight words pretty much sum up this low-budget variant of "Beauty and the Beast." The very title BLOOD OF BEASTS (plural) makes no sense. The film shows us only one beast--a kind of man-bear--and he is a revived and metamorphosed version of Odin's pet bear, blended or fused with the man who killed it. Academic scholars might argue that swaggering-but-cowardly Sven (played by William Gregory Lee) is a kind of beast as well (thus giving us TWO beasts), but we have no way of knowing what the writer and director intended. Most likely the title was devised by somebody in the marketing department who had not seen the film. Surely the blurb on the back of the DVD's hard case was written by another marketing person who never watched it either; e.g., it is untrue that Freya "must undertake a deadly battle when her father and fiance are captured by a tormented monster . . . cast out by his people." Nor is it true that "the Beast [singular] . . . battles with Freya for his redemption." Further, expect no truth in these grand-sounding words: "Prepare for the ultimate tale of love and sacrifice, damnation and salvation." BTW, the front of the hard case has a fake sepia picture of Jane March/Freya shooting an arrow in an impossible manner: the arrow's shaft is two or three inches ABOVE her hand that's gripping the bow.   With one exception, the acting is a perfect match for the script: laughably poor. The exception is the Beast (played by David Dukas). One is tempted to quip that only this role has "teeth"; the fact is that only his role permits audio engineers (or whoever) to enhance the actor's voice electronically, only his role required serious make-up, and only his role required a "special effect" (his morphing back to Agnar, which every semi-conscious viewer, by a third of the way into the film, knew was coming).   Other viewers have commented on the comical tropical setting of this Viking saga and the laughable "ships." Most preposterous is the tiny skiff that Freya and Ingrid (Candice Hillebrand) use to rescue King Thorsson (Greg Melvill-Smith). On the island, the Beast possesses an iron cage (which clearly has been welded together using 20th- or 21st-century equipment); when the king is confined in it, it can only be secured from the outside--and yet, when Freya is put inside it for her own protection at night, only she has control of its locking device. How convenient.   The costumes are also anacronistically interesting, but only Ms. March's deserve extended comment. When we first see her, she is wearing a little black Viking bikini as she swims with friends; then, besides flimsy chain mail, we see her in an array of gowns that seem to be fashoned from finely woven or knit fabrics--the final one being most noteworthy for its sequined molded push-up bra-top.   Lest this review seem too harsh, a few individuals connected with this film deserve special mention for their outstanding contributions: Mark Thomas, who composed the Viking music; Rob Bishop, one of the focus pullers; Ryan Lotter and Steven Ndlovu, two clapper loaders; Andrew Gribble, a grip; Ben Phiri, the generator operator; Guy Bonner, transport manager; Johannes Sithole, fabrication assistant; Kirsty Taylor, prosthetics; Maxmillian van der Merwe, standby set dresser; Dirk Knoesen, stand-by [sic] carpenter; Sally van der Merwe, scenic artists [sic]; Janine Wyatt-Mair, stunt performer; Grace Sibiyo, seamstress; Diane Allen, hair supervisor; Bianca, trainee make-up assistant; Ian Thysse, medic; and Mark Ferda, who did double duty as both dialogue editor AND re-recording mixer.   Oh, one more thing: after coming out of her cage in the morning, Jane March SEEMS to have a nude swim in the sea, which the poor Beast views from hiding, far-far-far away 
 Definately only a book to use to look up names.  not to actually help you find one. You can find this type of alphabetical dictionary set up of names many places online for free 
 After reading the Oprah Pick, "What Looks Like Crazy on an Ordinary Day, I was very disappointed in "Some Things I Never Thought I'd Do."  It took me two long weeks to finish this slim novel and I lost interest after about the first fifty pages.  I don't think Pearl Cleage is a paticularly talented novelist; I think she can write realistic,sometimes dynamic dialogue between her black characters, but the story is lacking.    I loved the very first part of the book where Regina Burns has just gotten out of rehab, is losing her anscestral home, so she goes to her aunt Abbie for help and comfort and Abbie introduces Regina to the notion that life is not a lost cause--that is the story I wanted to read.  Instead, what I got is a very political story infused with the author's belief that black men especially need positive role models.  I believe we ALL need to be and have positive role models, that it is not just a black thing.    I wanted to read more about Regina and Blue.  I felt as if that part of the story was horribly under developed.  I hope that Pearl Cleage's next novel is better than this one, but I'm sorry to say I don't hold out much hope 
 My Wife got Me this soundtrack a few years ago and I took it straight back. The problem is  it's missing about 50 songs that were in the movie, and the B.o.c. song Godzilla (from the album Spectres) is NOT sung by B.O.C. If all songs were included this would be the coolest soundtrack ever, but it's not 
 Some readers may be interested to know that the setting of this novel -"Sambuco" - is actually Ravello, on the Amalfi Coast, until recently the home of Gore Vidal.  The movie being filmed in the village was Beat  the Devil, directed by John Huston and starring Humphrey Bogart.  (In the book Bogie is the obnoxious drunk Burnsie.)  Cass Kinsovling's household seems to be in the ground floor of the old Caruso Belvedere.  The atmosphere of this book is not unlike the film version of The Talented Mr. Ripley, another tale of Americans in Italy in the 1950's.  For all of Styron's fine writing, this is something of a period piece.  The moral crisis that is at the heart of the book - the "fantastic going to pot" of  Americans in the post-war period - is not of much concern to anyone today.  Nat Turner and Sophie's Choice are Styron's masterpieces.  May he rest in peace.        
 Section One of this book makes the observation that humans and other animals don't only have a flight or fight response during crises; we also have a freeze response (playing possum).  The author suggests that trauma symptoms persist if we humans, unlike other animals, don't let the freeze response play out in a flight response, namely running away.  The energy remains trapped in our bodies (and, therefore, our emotions).  At the end of Section One, my husband (a science teacher) and I had high hopes for Waking The Tiger, despite the fact that Levine uses his own "registered" expressions and insists that we are all traumatized, even if we don't know it.  Section Two is so redundant, rhetorical, and seemingly unrelated to Section One, I couldn't understand why it was even in the book.  Section Three was worse.  In both these sections, Levine gives us a couple of examples of people who worked through their frozen traumas, both in his presence, and both by going back through the traumatic experience and then shaking and trembling their way back to health.  Odd, because all through the book, the author tells us, in no uncertain terms, to avoid reliving or visiting the past trauma.  He then goes on to tell us that the way to heal is to work our way between two vortexes; the vortex of the trauma itself, and the vortex of a pleasant experience.  He does not make any solution clear, but insinuates that we go back into the trauma (which he'd previously told us to avoid at all costs), and attach something pleasant to it.  I've studied enough psychology to know this approach is dangerous, questionable, and highly unlikey to effect a cure.  At the end of the book is a section on first aid for people in traumatic situations, so we readers can help people in situations such as auto accidents.  If you're suffering from PTSD and looking for a way to heal, you will not find it in this book.  Try one of the breathing books or tapes by Gay Hendricks; he addresses trauma therapy head-on, with compassion and wisdom.  Levine makes an interesting observation, but as a physicist has no clue how to resolve the issue of frozen trauma.  He should have stopped after Section One.  
 This story follows a young athlete as she trains for the new Olympics, which include intellectual competition and a de facto death sentence for the those who fail to take the gold. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? Ah, well.  I have read of number of Larry Niven novels, and I understand the premise  that maybe a book can be just a ripping good adventure, and not a  contribution to world lit. But, ack, this was horrible. You will find the  characters cliched, the plot "twists" too easy to figure out, and  the ending is  either a cop out because the author had filled the requisit  number of pages, or a cheap way to prep for a sequel 
  This film is pretty much the biggest waste of time and money possible! Don't buy this movie it's horrible! You work hard and you deserve alot better, buy the godfather trilogy!. Anyway the film is based on four friends who become gangsters and thats basically it, the reason this film sucks is because the plotting; the direction is good as well as the astmosphere of the film but the casting is horrible! This is the kind of film you can buy for 5 dollars in the walmart bin so don't waste 15 dollars buying it on here. The cast sucks! Christian Slater was good in True Romance but other than that he's just a pretty boy actor that never made it, kind of like Richard Grieco who also stars in this. But anyway this might be the film that killed oscar winning  F. Murray Abrahams chances of ever becoming a big actor in the 90s. Maybe if the script was written better or if the cast was picked better it might not be buried in the walmart bin as we speak.  0 out of 5 stars 
 We were expecting MORE of a cushion-feel to this seat, but all its really made of is a mesh fabric with little wires inside it to keep air flow moving.  It would be okay to keep your butt cool maybe, but for a cushion, its flat and cheap feeling.  As for "king size" it barely covers our car's seat...we ended up returning them...not worth it.. 
 We have a lawman who for no explained reason starts to investigate the cause of death of a man with 500,000 on him and it all goes down hill from there. There is no rhyme or reason to the story. I gave it two stars because the landscape is great 
 I can't think about any other explanation for this silly, stupid thriller if you want to call it that. I can't believe that the writer is doing so badly. I am most certainly disappointed with this book. In the last couple of years, I think he had lost his steam. Plus, why does he have to come up with 15 books or so a year? Why does he not read his own book before he sends it to the publisher? It's time for me to move on to another writer....  I would advice readers to not to read this book 
 Liking Kenny Loggins' music growing up, I was glad to see there was finally a comprehensive anthology assembled. Finding little fault with the Loggins & Messina sides (except that there weren't enough of them), I soldiered on to Loggins' solo material. It didn't take long to realize most of it has not aged well, particularly the '80s material and beyond. The production is dated and, with few exceptions, the songs are horrid pieces of sap and drone. The entire second disc is unnecessary and demonstrates only that Loggins began making music for money (i.e. the soundtrack songs). There's nothing wrong with that, per se, but that doesn't make it worth hearing. For a guy who wrote from his heart in the early days, it's a sad decline and letdown. Ultimately though, a Loggins collection with "Angry Eyes", "House at Pooh Corner", "I'm Alright", "Celebrate Me Home" and even "Don't Fight It" can't be all bad, but you're better off getting it from your local library. And by the way, what was up with those sweaters? 
 This book and the author are ridiculous. It's almost a fraud that Mr. Bilardillo wrote a book on corporate credit analysis - he never followed industrial companies as an analyst at Standard & Poor's. He did however, have customers such as Enron and Worldcom that he was glad to take money from. The material itself is pretty useless - but what can you expect from a marketing person who attempts to comment on credit theory 
 I contacted the program's customer service department when the cards in this program printed off center no matter what I did. I received an email saying that this was a known problem with the program and a fix would be available by the end of January. Mid-February I asked again about it as there had been no fix. That time they said it would be fixed by the end of February. I've used their previous programs w/out problems, just wanted more variety so added this one. Apparently not a good idea..... 
 O'reilly has a grudge against CBS and Dan Rather. After, GI -Joeing it, standing eye-to-eye with the "bad guys" in El Salvador and Argentina, he gets no airplay. Then  with moral righteousness, he goes to a gay vacation place in Provincetown, convinced a "showdown"  was in the making between gays and het families. He gets no airplay. Too bad. Good for CBS.  O'Reilly's "morality" is psycho anachronistic. (e.g. Hollywood directors & celebrities, unless you look like Halle Berry.)Does a Johnny Depp movie really have to have a *moral* message?  He glosses over social and racial issues, and suggests that Al Sharpton, Susan Sarandon and Puff Daddy are misguided &/or dangerous,dishonest rabble rousers. Aside from the Tawana Brawley debacle, I'd have to disagree. The tone is turgid. The writing, junior high. The book is arranged so that O'Reilly always gets the last word after each interview--which is kind of sad-- especially when he interviews his intellectual superiors, like Mario Cuomo. Bill can't play a game without fixing the odds in his favor.  He fantasizes about Hilary Clinton & that's even sadder: "Each night while lying in bed I visualize the interview. At last we are together in the Zone. Her pansuit is peach, her hair is perfect. . ." He tells the reader he has this dream over & over . . .(Quick someone notify the secret service!)  He dares to invoke Jefferson in one sentence, and then decry "secularists" in another. He reacts violently when he thinks someone is not telling the truth, but he doesn't even give credit to his cowriters, or even acknowledge what's shady an dishonest about himself. 
 Jet lee was dorky in this film, and the cholos he was teaching were just as bad. This film was made in a desperate attempt to relaunch his career in America. After seeing the light, Jet returned to Hong Kong and completed the historical Once Upon a Time in China series. The rest is history 
 I like Bryan Peterson's other books (Learning to see Creatively and Understanding Exposure) and I was guessing that this would be a combination of the two with some additional tips towards digital photography. I expected a lot out of the book, and it didn't come out. First of all, the 'photography' part of the book is good. Many examples and tips on how to make better pictures. But the 'digital' part of the book is bad, really, really bad. Virtually every advice Bryan gives is wrong, or given for the wrong reason. You get the idea that mr. Peterson wanted to jump on the digital bandwagon without knowing anything about digital camera's in the first place. I bought the book to give it to a friend who just got his first digital camera, and I wanted to see if it would be a keeper for myself. I'm keeping it, but only because I'd be ashamed to give it to somebody. Again, the photography tips are good, and if it wasn't for the author, I would have given it three stars. But I was expecting something better 
 Simple ideas.  Was not very useful for my work environment. I was looking for something that was a little different or unusual that we haven't tried 
 Terrible.  A waste of money.  This comedian just yells everything.  Very similar to Sam Kinnison.  If you liked Sam, you'll like Lewis.  I prefer humor that requires a better sense of humor to think up.  Just screaming 100% of the time isn't my idea of a funny act 
 I haven't listened to these yet, and I'm sure the sound quality is great. However, trying to get the grilles to fit on the speakers after installing them in the ceiling has just been the most frustrating job of my entire kitchen rehab. 
 It pains me to write it, but this book was bad. I thoroughly enjoy most of Douglas Adams' work especially the Hitchhiker's series. Unfortunately, he missed the mark with this book. I personally believe Adams wanted this book to be very funny, ala, the Hitchhiker books (others disagree), since it was: strike one. The storyline was quite complex, which would be fine, but I'm not 100% certain this is what Adams was trying to do: strike two. Finally, Dirk Gentry just is not equal to Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect (Hitchhiker's main characters) in terms of full, colorful characters, the final strike. Maybe it was my high expectations after reading the Hitchhiker series, which I found incredibly entertaining at 14, 24 and 34 years of age (for different reasons) 
 This is the only Robert Crais novel I ever read that I didn't like.  I had to push myself to finish it.  It features all the minutia about bank robbing --it's like the author read a book on the subject--  and the least likeable characters he's ever created.    Spare yourself the annoyance of reading this and read "The Watchman" instead.  
 i'm not exactly sure why i bought this book.  something about the blurb and first couple paragraphs caught my eye... not to mention the vintage photo on the cover.  but, ultimately, i'm disappointed.  the story plays out in the first 75 pages and consequently drags through another 225 until it finally ends in glazed-over, lamely symbolic scene that involves a doe serenely staring down the main character across the snow-covered Vermont campus.  The authors use of question marks in her younger characters' dialog was mildly amusing the first time, but quickly grew old with over use.  And she had lots adjectives that didn't add anything but ambiguity to otherwise clear and concise descriptions.  I'd like to get her address and mail her this horrible failure of a novel... so I don't have to look at it on my bookshelf and be reminded of the time i wasted reading it.   i give it two stars only because it kept my disgusted attention...  just like a multiple car crash on the highway 
 DVD would be great without narration and interruption. Navigation from track to track is sketchy at best. C'mon Paul I paid over $240 to see you live in concert and it was worth every penny. This DVD barely justifies 20 bucks. Get back to where you once belong, Paul 
 Steven Pinker lost me as a buyer of his thesis with the very second sentence of his book:   "For you and I belong to a species with a remarkable ability: we can shape events in other's brains with exquisite precision".  It you take that for granted, Pinker's book will seem compelling and not especially controversial. Steven Pinker clearly takes it for granted, perhaps because he can't conceive of how we could possibly communicate effectively and coherently if it were not true.   Consider the following, which I think perfectly encapsulates the world view Pinker can't conceive of, by Ogden Nash:  Caught in a mesh of living veins, In cell of padded bone, He loneliest is when he pretends That he is not alone.  We'd free the incarcerate race of man That such a doom endures Could only you unlock my skull, Or I creep into yours.  To my way of thinking, it is the very fact that we *can't* "shape events in other's brains with exquisite precision" - or with any reliable certainty at all, that describes the human condition. The frisson created by precisely that ambiguity underpins all communication; it is the source of irony, tragedy, comedy, invention and imagination. Any theory of language which denies that fundamental contingency of human communication (as this one does) is going to have to prove it, and displacing that onus is a heavy task indeed.  Pinker's psycho-linguistics makes precisely that denial, by holding that all human communication - every language - shares an inate, evolutionary programmed Universal Grammar, precisely because Pinker can't conceive how else human communication could be possible.  I'm no academic, and certainly I have no background in linguistics. Given that this theory - which is from the same tradition as Noam Chomsky's - has been the ascendancy amongst academic linguistics for the best part of the last thirty years, Steven Pinker being one of the leading "normal scientists" within the paradigm (if I should be so bold as to use that word), and that The Language Instinct is considered fairly widely to be his magnum opus, I was expecting to have my naive relativistic assumptions carefully and systematically dissected, then annihilated, one by one.  So imagine my surprise to find that in the place of carefully drawn arguments and compelling statistical data, one finds a tissue of anecdotal arguments carefully selected to fit the theory, arguments from authority ("Chomsky is one of the ten most cited writers in all of the humanities"), dubious suppositions in place of statistical data (the "it is difficult to imagine the following grammatical construction being used" sort of thing),  begged questions, non sequiturs, and Roger Penrose-style irrelevant scientific waffle - especially as regards evolution - and a decided absence of any consideration of competing theories of linguistics - and straw men versions of those which do rate a mentioned.   In short, Steven Pinker employs just about every illegitimate arguing technique in the book. His theory completely fails to account for metaphor (metaphor is barely mentioned in the book), nor the incremental development of language, the evolution of different languages with different grammars and vocabularies. At times Pinker is forced to argue that the grammar of our language is sometimes different from the words we actually speak and write, containing unspoken "inaudible symbols" representing a word or phrase which has been moved elsewhere in the sentence, so the sentence "The car was put in the garage", according to Pinker's Universal Grammar should technically be rendered as: "was put the car in the garage", and the construction we use can only be explained by movement of "The car" and the insertion in its place of an inaudible "trace":  "[The car] was put [trace] in the garage".  Now, again I am no technical linguist, but this has all the hallmarks of pure bull manure to me.  Finally, Pinker is at pains to point out that Universal Grammar is only ever applicable to oral language: written language didn't arise for centuries after oral grammar "evolved" as a phenotype.  But this hardly helps Pinker, since (as he himself points out, with reference to a transcript of the Watergate Tapes) when people talk in ordinary conversation they almost *never* use complete grammatical sentences: they interrupt themselves, they rely on physical gestures, they break off in mid stream and start a new thought, they don't punctuate (there's no unequivocal punctuation in spoken English), all the time.   As is fashionable amongst the "reductivist" and "evolutionary" set these days (a set I would otherwise, in general terms, consider myself in agreement with), relativist arguments are scorned. But Pinker's paradigm implies that, provided we are competent in constructing our own sentences, we should all understand each other perfectly, all the time: there should be no ambiguity; no room for miscontrual; no possibility for evolution in ideas or language. It is difficult to see how anyone could believe such a thing. But neither the structure of language and grammar nor its practical use needs to be perfect for effective communication *at some level* to be possible, and surely that is all that is needed. The beauty of the contingent view of language, which Pinker seems unable to appreciate, is how it can account for the missed margin of communication which might explain the everyday cultural and interpretative problems we all face, and the figurative and metaphorical power we all find at our disposal. Ogden Nash's dilemma is our dilemma, however much Steven Pinker might wish it were otherwise.  An earlier reviewer has mentioned Geoffrey Sampson's "the Language Instinct Debate" as a compelling antidote to Pinker's world view. Having recently read it (on the strength of that recommendation), I would firmly agree. In perhaps an ill-advisedly grumpy tone, Sampson - whose position at the University of Sussex inevitably means his academic profile is lower than Pinker's or Chomsky's - systematically and convincingly annihilates many of the arguments (such as they are) in Pinker's work.

 I've found this to be a very poorly written book, particularly if its intent was to provide information. Its organization, or lack thereof, made it nearly impossible to construct a chronology of events in the administration's evaluation of intelligence information. A chronologic presentation, perhaps starting with 9/11/01, would have made a much more lucid story.  Unfortunately, Drumheller's descriptions of CIA interactions with the administration come across less like statements of fact and most like whining. The book has been a disappointmen 
 It's not great music to dance to 
 I think that one of the things about our society is that nowadays, if you do so much as rate a book regarding homosexuals (or a movie, such as Brokeback Mountain)-- if you give it a bad rating, people will call you a homophobe. I mean, come on. A bad book is a bad book. This book is a bad book. It was extremely short. The characters were virtually unlikeable and one-dimensional. You knew what was going to happen right from the beginning. It really just wasn't worth my time 
 A dear friend recommended this book to us. Upon receipt I immediately turned to the section on pregnancy and birth control as I am an avid supporter of the protection of the unborn babies in our world. I was HORRIBLY dissapointed at the presentaiton of the material in this section. This is supposed to be a 'Christian' book yet they used terms like 'fertilized egg' instead of baby to explain the way that birth control pills can prevent the implantation of a baby into the womans womb. They even say that if that occured it wouldn't be an abortion of a baby. Any basic sex ed class teaches that fertilization occurs BEFORE the egg reaches the womb; actually occuring in the fallopian tubes. Needless to say I CANNOT recommend this book for any person seeking Biblical teaching on planning a family.

 Although these editions change little, this review is based upon AGS 10th Ed. & AGSRC 2003.     Negative: This is bascially a regurgitation of the more complete Architectural Graphics Standards, distilled to a "residential" focus but appears as volumous because some details have been photo-enlarged (in poor-average quality).  Few, if any new residential details/information has been provided.  Positive: Those ONLY interested in residential construction and NOT requiring a full brace of ALL details will find this quite a good value - compare its price to Architectural Graphics Standards.  Recommendation: Anyone in construction should have one, but not both of these books as a prime resource.  The content does improve every year, although some years it's like watching grass grow.  Challenge: IF there are numerous portions of the Residential version that are unique and new to it, exclusive of passages in the larger AGS version - I would really appreciate a review that contains how to locate these passages, as I've spent enough time trying to find them.  If enough of these exist, it would give thought of updating this resource once in awhile 
 Many reviewers on this site read TLGPE in the 70's, when we were young and impressionable. (I happened to be 13 when I read it.) If one could be sued for intellectual forgery, Lindsey would certainly be found at fault.  Most of us, thankfully, have gotten past our fears that plagued our teenage years. After all, when we read TLGPE, we were young. We were searching and seeking. We didn't have all of the facts. There were wolves who knew this, and they preyed upon us. Many people who were older, yet still intellectually undeveloped, read this book and were moved to 'believing'.  For most of us, our minds matured. We began to see the vast chinks in Lindsey's pompous Christian armor. We began to realize that fear is a weapon brandished by madmen, by people who use a subtle, gentle cloth of manipulation to control others.  This is beyond dangerous. It is beyond extreme, as most of us have now found out.  I love a good horror novel. I love a good 'true crime' thriller. But the fact that people read Lindsey's books and take them at face value is, perhaps, one of the scariest notions I have ever imagined.  That, dear reader, is beyond horrific . . . and far more terrifying than anything you'll find in the bible or any of Lindeys 'books'. The only thing scarier is that Mr. Lindsey is still receiving royalties from an outdated, silly, contradictory and completely barbaric book penned over thirty years ago. Please don't be the next sucker. Please don't add this one to your cart.  
 I thought I'd give this author's second book a chance even though I found her first one ("Chasing Vermeer") rather disappointing. I like her Hyde Park setting, I like the way she works art into her stories, I like the way the teacher in the book runs her classroom as a place of exploration rather than a lecture hall. So--I thought, thought I--maybe with all these strong elements in place, the author will improve her plotting abilities in her second book.  Alas, no.  The story has so much potential that is never met.  Once again, coincidence and "intuition" play a huge, way too huge, role in the resolution of the storyline. The Scooby-doo type ending (wherein the bumbling adult bad guys are "unmasked" and supernatural events explained at least in part by their stupid criminal plans) is disappointing and unpredictable from the things we've seen earlier in the story.    The pentaminos storyline has grown wearisome, the bibliomancy one of the kids performs using "The Invisible Man" is irritating and irrelevant, the coded messages simplisitc and unintriguing.   The relationship between the three kids is nicely portrayed--their jealousies of one another, and their attempts to reconcile differences and balance individual needs with group needs. I also liked how the kids in the story work for a cause--saving the Robie House--and I found their demonstration in front of the house in which they "destroy" works of art by chopping them up to be the most interesting part of the book, far superior in terms of action and emotional content than any of the so-called mystery elements.  This part of the book is worth reading, and worth having kids read, both because of its philosophies and because it shows how actions by individuals can make a positive difference.  Hope the author's next book moves more in this direction and away from the pseudo-mystical, pseudo-supernatural, pseudo-mystery lines the first two have followed.  
 This is jazz writing at its finest?  Alive and kicking?  If so, we need to kill it.  Don't be bamboozled by the mostly silly, misleading "advance praise" on the back of this volume.  Mansbach does not riff like Coltrane.  He does not flow like B.I.G.  In fact, Mansbach is just the kind of writer (or, more precisely, this is just the kind of book) we DON'T need.  Shackling Water is a labored, spoken-wordy blend of pseudo-Baraka rhythms that boasts several failed attempts to emulate Paul Beatty's humor.  The story itself is trite trite trite, a dull retelling of the old jazz-musician-addicted-to-heroin bit.  Can we PLEASE get past this?  Most of the characters are uninteresting (The protagonist is said jazz musician.  Then there's the older white woman painter girlfriend of said jazz musician.  The legendary jazz hero of said jazz musician.  The cutely named but paper thin drug dealer.  The homophobic piano player whose individual story seems to be a facile riff on Baldwin's classic "Sonny's Blues."), and one wonders if the author truly understands them.  The book has an occasional pleasing sentence, but it is mannered beyond belief, the work of one who seems to be feverishly, desperately trying to write himself into a culture that he obviously has a lot of information about; but then again, facts do not constitute truth.  Several scenes go beyond the bounds of believability.  One post-coital scene finds the inter-racial lovers deconstructing race and the master-slave dialectic.  Another ridiculous one has the protagonist playing his horn while the local dealer freestyles (wowing the white painter with a mention of Flannery O'Conner.  Wow.).  The protagonist and the local dealer (ingeniously named Spliff) also share a dull word or two about jazz and hip hop.  Earnest?  Forced?  Long-winded?  Yes.  What a coincidence!  It seems (based on relatively thin but compelling evidence) that the author himself struggles with these very qualities.  On the recommendation of a professor friend, I had the, um, pleasure of attending a recent panel discussion on jazz and hip hop in the hallowed halls of Columbia University in which Mr. Mansbach was one of the participants.  Q-Tip (aka Kamaal), Olu Dara, and several other (male) jazz musicians made up the rest of the panel.  I say "panel," but, oh, if only it were actually that!  The "panel" proper was actually a brief series of promising but ultimately unconnected comments of which Mr. Mansbach, in that spoken word tone and lilt I find so annoying, made many: both lengthy and self-indulgent.  The "panel" then became even more of the Adam Mansbach show, with him reading from his work over live jazzy tunes.  Ah, but here, perhaps, is a chance to praise Mr. Mansbach's book.  You see, read pretentiously over jazzy tunes Shackling Water sounds great - well, better.  With sixty percent of the actual prose obscured by jazzy noise, words like "soul" and "cascade" and "Latif" and "horn" sound cool!  But outside of that context this book (and here I will now insert, loudly, according to Mansbach's writerly technique, the appropriate hip hop reference) gets the gas face.  Is there any wonder that the author is book-touring with his band?  In short, being Elvin Jones' roadie and an emcee and living in Fort Greene do not make one attuned to the pulse of a culture.  Nor is this the stuff of a good writer.  Whatever potential Mr. Mansbach has (and I do believe he has some, along with a fair deal of bravery and hustler's brio) will require him to interrogate more carefully his relationship to (black) cultures and (artistic, novelistic) traditions before it is fully realized 
 This quesadilla maker makes a very colorful addition to the kitchen counter--but that's about it.  It doesn't allow you to put in enough filling to make it worth the trouble! You can barely taste the thin filling layer of chicken, cheese, or whatever--mostly you just taste tortilla. Too bad, because it is a great idea, it just needs to be redesigned 
 I actually saw the advert for this work on Sean Hannity's home page - "The Turth about Hillary" (sic). The spelling probably tells you all you need to know about Mr H and the book. If you seriously wish to learn about real politics, the issues or US political system, this book will not be of use. If you believe that Elvis is still alive, then it is possible you may think it a worthwhile read.  It does however show the appalling state to which US politics has fallen. Most debate is at playground level and this book shows that in clear detail. Free speech is a privilege, not a right, and I will defend Mr Klein's privilege; but that does not mean that I think he is accurate or that I agree with him. I would ask if he would allow me the same courtesy? He certainly would not allow it of Mrs C 
 A real mess.  Anyone who has followed Ms. Mitchell's career will easily pick out the numerous and frequently gross errors.  Not much more than a compendium of "fanzine" and other magazine and newpaper articles printed about Ms. Mitchell during the past thirty years.  If you have a computer, don't bother with this book: just go to the Joni Mitchell Homepage where you'll find accurate and well-written information regarding everything you ever wanted to know about Joni! 
 I have to say I am a huge PKD fan, and have read just about all of his books.  And before you dismiss this review, know that I read and enjoyed Valis and The Divine Invasion, precursors to this book, the third in the series.  But, sadly, this book just was not the vintage Dick classic that Ubik, or A Scanner Darkly was.  In fact, I was disgusted with this book, and to date, I have loved every one of Dick's books, even the more obscure ones (Galactic Pot Healer).  Though Ubik and my personal favorite Now Wait For Last Year had a strong, cohesive plot littered with welcome digressions and departures, I can't help thinking that Transmigration was just one long digression lacking any sort of structure, and without the strong and interesting characters in Dick's other books.  With a slew of obscure references to various operas, epic poems, and other pieces of the impotent intellectual vangaurd, it seemed Dick was trying to prove to us his cultural superiority and sophistication.  And that is not the Philip K. Dick I know and admire.  I suppose if you feel compelled to read everything that Dick has written, then read this, but do yourself a favor and borrow it because it is not a book that you will want to re-read 
 I used this software to do a scrapbook for my mother for her birthday.  First of all the software takes up a HUGE amount of space! Like 1600MB. The program is so slow and I have a relatively new computer. After about 4 pages in one file it becomes impossible to work with and then crashes. I had two files - 6 pages - crash and the work was gone. All the work gone. The text editor will add typos and put in and take out spaces. Sometimes it works great other times you have to restart your computer. Once it added bright green lines where I had added all of the embellishments to the page - everything other than the background. I had to redo it. Piece of JUNK! but what does print on a color laser - don't try it with inkjet - looks great 
 I agree with the review that say it sound like a coffee grinder.  And we also made all the adjustments.  Our cat is terrified of it and has opted for drinking the Christmas tree water instead.  It was in a room several rooms away from our bedroom and it kept me up all night.  I'm throwing it out tonight 
 This book has a high "fog factor" and is difficult to read.  It uses academic jargon and long sentences.  The structure is complex and confusing.  That is not to say that the book is inconsequential; indeed, the subject matter is quite important.  It is simply difficult to access it through this book.  The back cover accurately describes the book as looking systematically at the families and offspring of the upper echelon of the Hudson Bay Company and the North West Company.  Unfortunately, this was a male-dominated business and a male-dominated period in history.  Men kept the written records.  The author of "Strangers in Blood" relies heavily on anecdotal accounts of individuals, complete with many direct quotes.  Thus, this is a book that follows the men of the fur trade.  Their wives and offspring become adjuncts.  The book partially compensates for this by providing information on societal pressures within the fur trade, as well as in Canada and England at the time.  It also addresses the policies of the fur companies relative to dependents.  The book characterizes and contrasts family connections in the Hudson Bay Company and the Northwest Company.  The presentation is roughly chronological from the late 1700 to the mid 1800s.  The 1821 merger of the two companies is a focal point.  Chapters and subchapters move back and forth between the two companies; as well as between various topics of gender and types of family relationships.  The focus is on individuals, with every page containing a confusing array of proper names.  The names of key individuals (men) reappear constantly until the reader longs for a wall chart to keep them straight.  The author has even provided a few small pieces of such a chart and they are helpful.  One comes away with the feeling that the men of the fur trade took more responsibility for their families than one might expect.  They usually tried to place their offspring, both male and female, in a position to start a life of their own.  That included at least some education; an apprenticeship for men, and marriage for women.  Fewer men stayed committed to the mothers of their children but some of the relationships were life-long.  From the early 1820s on, one man, George Simpson, had great influence over the fur trade and the people involved with it.  He directed the Hudson Bay Company through the merger with the Northwest Company and for forty years afterward.  He influenced the tenor of the fur trade and everything connected with it.  Ms Brown shows his impact to be more negative than positive.  Simpson, the clergy, and English women all arrived on the scene at about the same time.  The result was increased racism, emphasis on class, and moral disapproval of "country marriages."  These semi-formal unions with Indians and mixed-bloods were prevalent in the fur trade up until that time.  The problems of integrating the descendents of the fur traders into society continue in Canada today.  Finally, I even want to complain about the title.  "Strangers in Blood" is an English legal term for relationships that exist "in blood" but the law refuses to admit as legitimate.  This book is about a much broader range of relationships.  The author recognizes the problem in the final chapter.  Someone in the publishing process should have insisted on a better title. 
 I've bought the Predator Absolion TRXFG before and it is a great shoe. However, in this case it is clearly advertised as having a leather upper -- and the pair I received yesterday (blue with red and silver) is synthetic.  Make sure that if you order a leather shoe at the advertised price, you receive a leather shoe! You are not "saving $50" if it's synthetic 
 I was hoping for a good read from this author but I will not be reading this latest from Ms Miller.  I am offended by the storyline.  Molestation of a teenager ?  Disgusting.   No thank you. 
 THE FOUNTAINHEAD has been described by one of its many followers - yes, followers, not readers, for the book is essentially unreadable -- as a "passionate defense of individualism [that] presents an exalted view of man's creative potential."   This is a fair description, although it points unintentionally to the book's main flaw:  it is not a novel, but a tract posing as a novel.      Traditional progressive novels tend to be suspicious of the exalted, especially of those who occupy exalted positions based on birth or social class. In the case of Ms. Rand, the exalted are those rare individuals who, like herself, must be allowed to work their will upon the world because they believe themselves exalted.  A circular argument at best, a bad faith argument in truth, this tacit nod to the slow ascent of the common man and woman since the Enlightenment spares Ms. Rand from plumping for monarchy which, even by today's repellent neo-conservatives standards, is universally seen to be repellent.  Because her main character, Howard Roark, architect extraordinaire, is an argument and not recognizably a person, he not surprisingly suffers from a lack of inner-animation.  Sensitive readers will chafe against the underlying and predictable framework that ultimately treats characters as props for Ms. Rand's objectivist philosophy, an anti-progressive stew of prejudices posing as a critique of the welfare state and its "leveling effects."    Here's the problem with her "philosophy:"  for every Howard Roark it raises up as Hero, it writes off millions of people as unworthy of our interest, our sympathy and our compassion. Unkindness is not a philosophy most find acceptable.  With THE FOUNTAINHEAD, Rand attempted to make it so and has managed to fool many.  Because she has, she is therefore lauded by her conservative followers because her apologia absolves them of any responsibility for the fate of their fellow men and women.     Regrettably, this book and her other tendentious work, ATLAS SHRUGGED, have found their way into the backpacks of idealistic college students.  One suspects that many, because their relative youth causes them to see themselves as unique individuals, are seduced by the notion that they, too, are slated for Heroic status.  I have nothing against people having heroes; young people especially should have them.  But Howard Roark is no hero.  He's a stick figure that represents a hero.  I suspect too, that because of their general unreadability, students think the books are "deep."   In retrospect, it seems true that those people whom I knew in college who didn't finish this tract-posing-as-a-novel were people who tended to be relatively reasonable in their social and political views.  Those who did finish it, on the other hand, tended to be immoderate and dogmatic.   Judging by some of the reviews posted here,  this probably remains true today. 
 I'm afraid that I was not as impressed as the other reviewers.  The book failed to mention that you need to have InfoPath installed to run some of the exercises.  There is little of how a real world configuration might look.  It does give some "click the screen" simulations of what the program might do.  But then, you could get the same thing by installing it yourself.  It would have been a worthy effort by discussing the structuring of a business collaboration project, then explaining and expanding business information storage, retreaval and search to tie it all together 
 This film has some good actors in it but the plot is pretty shaky and hard to follow at times.  It is not comparable to other great Westerns made during the sixties.  Eli Wallach is good but confusing--who and what is he after?   The color is good and it sounds like a Sergo Leone picure but it isn't.  What a shame!!!  It could have been made better--less comedy and more plot and of course --action and suspense!!!!  Buy or rent on your own if you dare----I wouldn't 
 "Autopsy" has a few things going for it that sets it apart from the many other giallos competing for audience attention in the 70's: first, it has a great score by the equally great Ennio Morricone.  Second, it has  an intriguing element of natural phenomena woven into the plot (the heat of  the Italian summer supposedly driving citizens to commit suicide, in fact,  the film's Italian title is "Sunspots").  But the natural  phenomena element is not explored enough to be satisfying and refreshing,  and it actually seems like it was an afterthought.  Adding to the faults of  the film is the flat and innefectual performance by Mimsy Farmer.  Her  performance recalls Deneuve's role in REPULSION- cold and sexually  repressed.  The problem with the performance is that her bland aura simply  doesn't allow her to convincingly reach the emotional plateus that the  script demands.  As a result, her sudden changes of heart and her  motivations seem ludicrous, even absurd (for example, she suddenly becomes  infatuated with a priest whom is a prime suspect in a murder case).   Unfortunately her bland performance affects the rest of the film.  The plot  of the film is depressingly susceptible to common giallo trappings (red  herrings, confused dialogue and nonsensical characters, not to mention poor  dubbing).  Perhaps the true problem with the film is the opening sequence:  we are treated to a stunning (and disturbing) montage of suicides of  various citizens of Rome, juxtaposed against footage of the burning sun.   This opening effortlessly pulls the viewer in and tantalizes with its  promises for the remainder of its 100min running time.  But the result is  far more pedestrian.  The film unfortunately peaks during the opening.   Most frustrating of all is that the angle of the "sunspots" as  the motivator for the suicides IS NEVER EXPLAINED, and the real motive for  the killings is depressingly derivitave.  On the plus side though,  Morricone's ecclectic score does add atmosphere to the sometimes dull  goings-on, and the photography and direction does take advantage of Rome's  splendor, and thankfully there is not a tremendous amount of zooming (a  common giallo affliction).  But even these tasteful technicalities cannot  overcome Crispino and Battistrada's bland and unremarkable script coupled  with Farmer's uncompelling performance.  "Autopsy" is never quite  a bore, and it does dabble in a handful of fascinating ideas, but the real  tragedy is they are never fully developed, and the film remains a mere  shell of what it could have been. OFFICIAL RATING: 2 1/2 star 
 This was the WORST rendition of Rumi poetry reading I have ever suffered through-it was painful to listen to what sounded like a Native American Hick read in a monotone unemotional manner this beautiful poetry.   I even shared it with three other very enlightened spiritual people because I thought it might just be my personal opinion, but they asked me to turn it off!  It was Like drinking sour milk 
 I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed with this one. I have been a big Bee Gees Fan since 1977, and also love to read Biographies, so I purchased this book as soon as it was released. It is an extremely disjointed read - there were a few different contributors, and it really shows - it seems like, as each writer finished a section, they just added the pages to the rest, with no thought to continuity or to the art of storytelling. Also, there are so many different names being thrown around constantly, that I had a hard time keeping track of who was who. It reads more like an encyclopedia than an artful biography with a story to tell. I consider myself a diehard Bee Gees fan, and I had a difficult time making it through the entire book. Definitely not for the "part-time" Bee Gees fan 
 I am an organizational psychologist, and I have been reviewing a lot of bibliography about positive thinking, optimism, depression and related concepts. The very apealing title of Ventrella's book moved me to read it, but I dindn't find what I expected to find. From my point of view, this book by Scott Ventrella has three importantan weaknesses and one strength. First, it adds nothing new or different from the original book by Norman Vincent Peale "The Power of Positive Thinking"; second, during the reading I felt, many times, like I was hearing a preacher and not a man from bussines administration arena; third, in spite of the etimologic analisys of key words used to nominate the 10 traits, Ventrella has a very low conceptual precision. He makes some reference to some cognitive psychologists, like Ellis and Seligman, but the book is far from having a suond psychological foundation. The only strength I found in this book is the style to write: Ventrella has a light, entertaining way of writing. The stories and anecdotes he tells in his book make it easy and nice to read it. Books like this, that attempt to show the efficacy of an approach only based in some "succesfull" cases, without empirical support are not very usefull for changing nothing. From the time of the first edition of the Vincent Peale's book, a lot of literature has been published in the same line. If the subject (to be positive)was so simply and easy as this books say, we couldn't explain why depression continues growing up in the world. I think we need instead a better diffussion of more scientific solid demonstrated concepts and technics to really help people 
 First must say all the raves you see are from professionals that have used other systems and maybe good friends of the author, as some of the reviews said, mistakes, no clear definition of way to go, confusing, believe the author once sent me an answer to a question stating he has condensed a book of 950 pages into this, Well unless your an photographic, or layout person, this book too confusing for someone starting out, I would not recommend  this book to first timer 
 I use a variety of sugar free products including others by Wisconsin Cheeseman.  How they missed so badly on this product amazes me.  Normally I like the items from thier list but this fudge sent me into a severe bout of bathroom time after eating 2 small pieces.  Don't know if it was a batch with the ingredient mix off but once was enough to have me tossing the rest of the package in the trash.  No way would I recommend this for ANYONE.  Try the cherry cordials or the peanut butter cups but leave this off your list.  
 I found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time.  It's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning.  The ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion. Denzel Washington did a great job playing the detective and John Goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted. My recommendation is to stay away from this movie and save your money. Buy somthing that has a good plot. D- is my ratin 
 I had high hopes for this novel as a fun summer distraction. The advertised story line seemed to promise a "Flim-flam Man" type plot with some spooky doings thrown in for fun. In fact the story quickly turns into a substandard mystery whodunit. Most disappointing is the author's failure to really develop what could been a very rich assortment of primary and secondary characters. Half way through I realized I just didn't care what happened. The older I get the less willing I am waste time on bad books- there's just too many good ones waiting to be read. 
 How Amazon could rate this as a benchmark is beyond my understanding.  This movie is so far removed from the reality of the episode that it is an insult to the troops who endured the events.  Perhaps it would be best if Amazon relied on combat veterans to critique war movies 
 As the mom of a 25-month-old late-talker, I have been searching high and low for information to help my child with his delayed speech.  Sure, this book was entertaining; these kids are indeed fascinating.  But after reading the Einstein Syndrome, it was clear that my boy is not one of the children Sowell is describing. Overall this book left me with more questions than answers on the subject of delayed speech.    If you actually want to do something to help your child, and not just read about other kids who turned out to be super-intelligent engineers, buy "The Late Talker: What to Do If Your Child Isn't Talking Yet" by Marilyn C. Agin, M.D., Lisa F. Geng and Malcolm J. Nicholl.  This is a book that gives parents real answers about how to help their speech-delayed children 
 Just because it was written by a woman and in the past, does not make it good.  There were plenty of women writers during this time period, who we seem to forget today manage to outsell the men every time.  In the case of Nate Hawthorne, we can clearly understand why.    In Hope Leslie, Catherine Sedgwick's main goal was to persuade the readers that what they were doing to Native Americans was wrong, and that the English descendants were just as wrong in 1800 as they were in 1600.  Unfortunately, although her puritan characters, all stolen from history, are narrow minded, they are very kind.  This was not the case people.  They hung and pressed "witches," all right?  Do you really think they wouldn't punish Hope for breaking two Indian women out of jail?  And her little "the devil did it, maybe," excuse wouldn't have flown.  Also, this is not a feminist text.  I do not care what anyone says.  Simply because Esther realizes she doesn't have to get married does not make it a feminst book.  Esther would have married Everell in a heartbeat if given the chance.  Remember how she tired to sleep herself to death after he rejectd her?  If you must read this for a class, I will give you a short summary:   Magawisca:  Oh, you evil, white men.  You have killed my family and rained destruction on this land.    Hope Leslie:  I am pretty and my eyes change colors, but I will save you from jail Magawisca, while still believing in my heart that you are inferior, but a really nice girl.  [Stuff happens.  A ship blows up.  Everell and Hope help Magawisca escape.]  Everell:  Live with us, Magawisca, and teach us to be pure, like you!  Magawisca:  Thanks, you guys, but you have hurt my people so badly that the white man and indian can never be friends.  I will go to the wild woods now, and live in peace with God.  Esther:  I will go away and pretend it is not because Everell likes my best friend better.  When I come back, everyone will want me, but I learned my lesson with men.  My havishhaminess will be attributed to feminism for generations to come.   
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 The only amusing thing about this collection is that Dean Koontz fancies himself a children's author.  The premise is a clever idea gone horribly wrong. Much of the rhyme is unoriginal or forced and some of it goes on and on and on so that we feel we are stuck in one of the author's horror novels.  Stick to what you do best Mr. Koontz and leave quality children's writing to quality children's authors, please 
 At one point in time I considered myself to be LKH greatest fan.  I've been reading her books since junior high school.  I own everybook she's ever written, the entire Anita series, Meredith, Nightseer, Death of a Darklord, Strange Candy etc... I sat and read alot of the comments about her and I decided to add mine.  LKH is seriously slipping.  I mean honestly.  I have never been so dissapointed in my life as when I read her last book.  What happened to the old Anita?  The kick a#@, chick who saved the day and slaughtered the bad guys?  The Anita that mad you wanna drop everything because you just had to find out what was next? LKH's books used to be awesome they were perfect but somewhere she lost it.  As Anita progressed she just became sluttier and sluttier and then on top of that she's falling apart.  I mean Jesus does she have to sleep with everyone in the book?  A little sex is good, but when it completely takes over leaving no room for plot, it becomes ridiculous.  As for LKH and her snooty comments, the sex crazed Anita is not what started her fan base.  The smut she's writing now did not get her where she is today.  Maybe she should remember that.  I strongley recommend that if you want good reading buy her earlier books.  If you must read the new ones, go to the library because they are not worth the money 
 I am a homeschooling mother, and this is my first year teaching my sons American History.  As an immigrant, this has been a learning experience for me as well.  I bought the Children's Encyclopedia of American History as a pictorial supplement to the excellent curriculum we are using. It took just a few minutes of glancing through this book to become very disappointed with my purchase. There is little or no reference to key African-American figures in American History.  The discussion of the Spanish exploration of the South and West mentions every member of the party except Estebanico, the Moorish slave who actually led the expedition to what is now California.  We are currently learning about George Washington Carver, and were surprised to find not even one sentence dedicated to this man's great contributions. Booker T. Washington is mentioned in one sentence, and shares a brief paragraph with W.E.B. DuBois.  The entire Civil Rights movement is summed up in one paragraph.  Surprisingly, a significant amount of space is dedicated to a picture of Bill Clinton hugging Monica Lewinsky, and a discussion of their relationship. The book is packed and ready to be shipped back to Amazon 
 I usually really enjoy Jayne Ann Krentz and her alter ego Amanda Quick, but I actually returned this one to the library unfinished. I found it boring and the whole dream reader concept to be unbelievable 
 This book is garbage.  Absolute garbage.  I think Glannon's Civ Pro is great, and I have read many others that I can learn from.  I am in chapter 8 right now, and I have been searching the internet for a way to tell the company or the authors that this book sucks.  I visited the Aspen publishing webpage, but they don't give a crap, they just want to sell books.  THIS BOOK IS PATHETIC.  Wherever you are, Mr. Burke and Mr. Snoe, thanks a lot.  40 bucks for this crap.  I just hope I can resell it to somebody who didn't read this review.  
 i hated this book, i finished it only under the circumstances of boredom. I can't believe this book made top book lists, who are these people?!!!!  The author's style of writing is very adolescent and annoying. The plot was predictable so therefore the book dragged out when this book could probably have been a short story. The narrator kept on directing rhetorical questions to the reader which really put me off about the  book as well. All the "philosophical" or thought provoking comments ridden throughout the book shouldn't be new ideas to anyone who has ever had any deep thoughts about anything.  Don't waste your time picking up this book 
 After having read Baldacci's "Camel Club" this one came as an utter disapointment.... the book starts off describing the assasination of a US senator and how the lead secret service agent in charge of his protection ended up out of the service and discredited for having lost his charge.... sounds like an interseting way to start the book; the main problem is Baldacci never takes the time to introduce any of the characters.... after a while i couldnt keep reading the book because i felt i didnt care for the characters enough... i didnt really care to know what happened next to them since i didnt really "know" any of them... it was like reading a newspaper article.... a way too long newspaper article.. 
 Did not work with my Palm T|C right away. I've not used this for any other purpose. I expect either Palm or SD to release proper software to have it work with Palm T|C 
 What a disappointment this book is. For one is very poorly written. Blair Jackson is simply too much of a fanboy and too little of a writer with this particular book. Its presents itself as a biography of Garcia and far too many times it drifts off into a simplistic Deadhead's review of Garcias various tunes. Way too many pretentious references to Hunters lyrics and really his put downs on Weir and other members (thinly veiled but non the less put downs) reek of Garcia worship. He finds no faults in any Garcia tunes and plays up his ballads (which were often low points of Dead shows) like they were the shimmering representation of all that is the Grateful Dead.  He also glosses over many aspects of Garcias personal life, which is silly for a biography. There are more reviews of Hunter and Garcia tunes then there are facts presented about the man the book is about. If its something that can be said without bringing up anything critical then Jackson carries on about it, but if its a low point then he will place a sentence or at most a paragraph. Garcia is a complex man and his biography should have been more complex. I dont want to read another book chiming in with English 101 poetry reviews, I wanted to read a book that chronicled Garcias life in an unobstructed manner. Jackson turned out to be way too much of a fanboy of Garcia to make an effective book. 
 why should anyone else???  Her own daughter says it is filled with inacurracies and indeed, the author makes it a point in every page to make himself the ONLY friend Lucy ever had.  As Lucie Arnaz herself said, "skip this one".  
 The low-fat craze that was the rage in the 1980s and 1990s is continuing to wane, due in part to the increasing obesity and the realization that "low fat" doesn't necessarily mean "more healthy."  This complete cooking light cookbook has recipies that, by and large, result in less flavorful and less "competent" cooking, with (in my opinion, at least) minimal "health" advantages vis-a-vis any reasonable cooking practices.  Take the chicken pot pie recipie in this book, for example.  Following this recipe results in a bland, very watery mess -- toped with hardened chunks of crust made with flower and butter.  Neither the filling, nor the crust, will leave you satisfied.  (Don't they test the recipes?)  Anyway, I gave it two stars for some low fat desserts that were not terrible.  A quick look through the Amazon.com collection of cookbooks will result in many better alternatives 
 For the first two months, this rice cooker was just everything I had asked for. But after two months, the water started to drip from all corners of the rice cooker.... I first thought I was putting high amounts of water/ or may be the rice isn't good. I changed everything and its still working same way.   Before returning it I thought I should try contacting Panasonic customer service and guess what....I was kept on hold for more than 30 minutes and then the customer rep says...its the amount of water thats causing the leak...I told him that I put 1.5 glasses of water per glass of rice...he says I should reduce it to 1 glass of water....this is absurd....I should as well eat raw rice...   I am from Asia and therefore rice is our staple food. I have had Black and decker and salton rice cookers before...and never had any problems what so ever....the only reason for buying this panasonic rice cooker is that my previous rice cookers are not non stick....Well...I am going to return this one and buy some thing else...  I found a similar non stick rice cooker (Hamilton Beach) in Kohls and I am going to buy it...   
 This book, How the Other Half Lives by Jacob Riis, had several very distinct themes.  First, the life of immigrants to New York City in the late 1800s was deplorable while housing for others was splendid.  "To-day three fourths of its people live in the tenements, and the nineteenth century drift of the population to the cities is sending ever-increasing multitudes to crowd them" (Riis, p. 6) Sections of tenement houses were divided by streets and alleys which divided the nationalities.  "As emigration from east to west follows the latitude, so does the foreign influx in New York distribute itself along certain well-defined lines that waver and break only under the stronger pressure of a more gregarious race or the encroachments of inexorable business." (Riis, p. 21)  Each nationality had some very distinct characteristics but they also had some very great differences as well. 	The next theme to emerge was that of work.  In some sections of the city, it was acceptable for everyone to work while in other sections, only the men did physical work while the women "kept house" or there was even mention of the men just standing in doorways, streets and alleys.  "The men sit or stand in the streets, on trucks, or in the open doors of the saloons smoking black clay pipes, talking and gesticulating as if forever on the point of coming to blows." (Riis, p. 49)  Money was earned, at very small rates throughout the tenements, by someone in the family, if not multiple people.  "Often there are two, sometimes three, sets of sweaters on the job.  They work with the rest when they are not drumming up trade, driving their `hands' as they drive their machine, for all they are worth, and making a profit on their work, of course, though in most cases not nearly as extravagant a percentage, probably, as is often supposed.  If it resolves itself unto a margin of five or six cents, or even less, on a dozen pairs of boys' trousers, for instance, it is nevertheless enough to make the contractor with his thrifty instinct independent.  The workman growls, not at the hard labor or poor pay, but over the pennies another is coining out of his sweat, and on the first opportunity turns sweater himself, and takes his revenge by driving an even closer bargain than his rival tyrant, t his reducing his profits." (Riis, p 94) 	Finally, the third theme centered on bringing about change via real people, real stories and images of real life in the tenements.  "Riis made maximum use of photographs, however, not only to illustrate six of his books, but also as lantern slides to illustrate lectures he began giving in 1888 and continued until his death." (Riis, p. xvii)  People are drawn to real life situations to which they can relate.  The accounts, photographs and images of Riis bring real life accounts to the reader, sparking more interest, creating a deeper relationship between the characters in the story and the reader.  And by doing so, Riis encourages others to take action to remedy the sad situation.  	As the previous themes are analyzed, connections can be made between them and education and society of today.  It is important to first note that in today's society, there are still sections in certain towns and cities that are divided predominantly by ethnic diversity.  Not only is housing situations but also in educational systems the divisions are found, although it is encouraged that the lines be broken down.  "The many philanthropic efforts that have been made in the last few years to render less intolerable the lot of the tenants in the homes where many of them must continue to live, have undoubtedly had their effect in creating a disposition to accept better things, that will make plainer sailing for the future builders of model tenements.,  In many ways, as in the `College Settlement' of courageous girls, the Neighborhood Guilds, through the efforts of The King's Daughters, and numerous other schemes of practical mission work, the poor and the well-to-do have been brought closer together, in an every-day companionship that cannot but be productive of the best results, to the one who gives no less than tto the one who receives." (Riis, p. 207)  Obviously different locales call for difference measures of tolerance and defend certain levels of intolerance but the lines exist nonetheless.  "The experience of this landlord points directly to the remedy which the law failed to supply to the early reformers.  It has since been fully demonstrated that a competent agent on the premises, a man of the best and the highest stamp, who knows how to instruct and guide with a firm hand, is a prerequisite to the success of any reform tenement scheme." (Riis, p. 205) 	Secondly, work was important in this book. Riis did an excellent job of documenting the working conditions and who was responsible for certain jobs in the tenements in each section.  Just as Benjamin Franklin valued an honest day's work, so did the people of the tenements.  The biggest difference between those two accounts of work was who was actually responsible for the work.  Depending upon the culture of the area sometimes it was the men, women or children, or all three, that completed work to earn money or keep house.  "Men, women and children work together seven days in the week in these cheerless tenements to make a living for the family, from the break of day till far into the nights.  Often the wide is the original cigarmaker from the old home, the husband having adopted her trade here as a matter of necessity, because, knowing no word of English, he could get no other work." (Riis, p. 105)   But how did people in this situation become educated to work?  "The old question, what to do with the boy, assumes a new and serious phase in the tenements.  Under the best conditions found there, it is not easily answered.  In nine cases out of ten he would make an excellent mechanic, if trained early to work at a trade, for he is neither full nor slow, but the short-sighted despotism of the trades unions has practically closed that avenue to him.  Trade-schools, however excellent, cannot supply the opportunity thus denied him.  Home, the greatest factor of all in the training of the young, means nothing to him but a pigeon-hole in a coop along with so many other human animals.  Its influence is scarcely of the elevating kind, if it have any....With no steady hand to guide him, the boy takes naturally to idle ways." (Riis, p. 136)   	Finally, it is important to note the third theme of bringing reality into the lives of the reader.  In education today, it is important to show real life application of concepts and ideas for learning to take place.  Riis was a pioneer in bringing photographs, real images and valid data to people to create a felt need for change and response.  Most photographs in the book are very dark and only add realism to the stories told.  For example, the photographs on pages 93, 104 appear very dark and the subjects unhappy.  The fact that Riis was probably standing, himself, in the darkest part of the room and photographing the lightest part of the room, near the windows, only tells the reader that even in the lightest part of the room, the darkness and dreariness ruled over the tenements.  "Riis's use of photography to point his words and flesh out his anecdotes is no less important, endowing an entire legacy of its own." (Riis, p. xiii)   	I believe the intent of the author was to simply bring a big picture view to narrow minded people.  He very much accomplished his purpose.  By using stories of families, shocking details and everyday photographs of real people, he was able to bring people to understand the reality of life in their own city and encourage them to help make changes.  It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and Riis is a prime example of this.  Not only are his accounts vivid and horrific, but also his images leave nothing to the imagination.  The reader can not be left to imagining a rosier picture than was intended.  The illustrations both verbal and nonverbal are graphic and moving. 	The appropriate audience for this book would have to be very broadly, mature, adult citizens of our world.  The language used in this book can be, at times, a bit complicated to comprehend; this is why I believe it appropriate for mature adults.  I also believe very firmly that adults are sometimes the most difficult to convince to take action to help those less fortunate or those in need.  When we read real life accounts and see pictures of people just like us in deplorable conditions, it is difficult for us to sit back and take no action.  I also believe it is important for citizens of our world to understand the underlying message of helping those less fortunate or those in need who may be right in our own back yard.  This book is a stunning example of one man giving factual accounts of events to produce concerned citizens ready to take action to improve conditions for fellow human beings.  
 I love Mr. Koontz and have long read his novels...Watchers, Intensity, Odd Thomas and so on but this was dissappointing, not to mention just plain depressing. And come on with the corny slap-stick banter between the characters! Okay okay, we know the 9 year- old Leilani has a high IQ but REALLY! She speaks like a 50 year-old rocket scientist and cracks jokes with every sentence? These characters were too unbeliveable for me to get into. Therefore, I put it down after 350 pages of this twattle. Koontz has done much better in the past.  Lastly, let's keep dogs out of your next few novels, please? It's getting a bit old. How about a smart cat or raven for your next novel, maybe mixed with some more down-to-earth folks that speak like real people do? 
 some stories date really badly, and this film based on a major broadway hit of a few years before is one. all the social satire of looking back is predicated on a 1970s POV, and that view is in itself so skewed that practically none of it is either funny or relevant. decent enough work by alan alda and ellen burstyn, but the writing and directing cant be compensated for. 
 This is a difficult review to write, because I so rarely write average reviews. I was excited to have a look at this book after reading the fantastic reader comments, and because the author is from my hometown. What I read disappointed me. I found the writing choppy and difficult to understand in some chapters. I was looking for beautiful artwork to compliment the written pages, but did not find any. This book read as if the author threw the pages together in one weekend. A disappoinment 
 Ever read a newspaper article to find half of it is taken up by useless information? e.g. "Dr Kenith E. Browner (MBA, BAS, winner of the 2002 SoandSo award, local Environmentalist, Graduated from Northern SS University with honors) says to bundle up this weekend."      ...     You just can't help to skim past it all.. Which brings me to Death Valley by Keith William Nolan. Half of this book is filled with useless info! Once in a while you get a little hint of a story, but then it jumps back into naming so many battalions, sergeants, lieutenants, soldiers, weapons, equipment, points...etc   You just can't visualize anything happening with all of this... well.... I don't know what it is. One thing I'm sure of is that I totally regret setting eyes on this boo 
 I don't read a lot of mysteries, so I'm hardly qualified to review one.  But reading this one helped me clarify what I want out of a mystery  novel.   I want all the necessary and relevant facts presented to me to solve the mystery, and I want the detective to be so brilliant that she  sees what I can't and solves the mystery in such a way that I go, "Of  course!  It was right in front of me all the time, I just couldn't see it!"  That's fun reading.     Maybe that's rare, I don't really know.  This book doesn't have it.  When the mystery  is solved, the culprit turns out to be a minor character, and the conclusive bit of evidence was gathered by Wimsey outside of the story.  It's really  more police work than detective work, and it ultimately feels anticlimactic to me.    What Sayers does do well is explore her protagonist's psyche and her complex relationship with Lord Peter.  Rarely have I read a better account of grown-ups trying to figure out a relationship; this is not flowers and romance love, but it is love, and I enjoyed the complexity, subtlety, and seriousness of it. In the end, Sayers (in this book, anyway) is really more like Jane Austen than  Agatha Christie, and I guess I just wish I'd known that going in.  
 I borrowed the audio book set of this book, not knowing anything about its author or his political views, hoping to get a greater insight into the minds of the founding fathers.  Unfortunately what I found to be the most prominent subject matter of this work was the anti-Bush/Republican propaganda.  Now, I do take exception with many of the policies and stances of the current U.S. presidency, however, if I wanted to research the effecacious practices of the current presidency I would have rather borrowed from my library a politically motivated work.  I, for one, find no place for such subjectiveness in a work on what is supposedly historical truth.  I prefer my history books to simply contain history, not political commentary 
 As a beginning to intermediate beader, this book was a disappointment to me.  I guess I should have taken the title more seriously!  The projects lack inspiration and the photographs are of poor quality.  Many of the pictures are repetitive.  I also felt that the book is not organized in a logical fashion and, although it covers wirework, it does not even mention wrapping a donut or a pendant or a basic rosary turn.  If you are looking for a really good basic book on beading or you want to find some fresh new projects, this book is not for you 
 I have laughed and shed tears over all of the authors books. Im am completely dumbfounded as to what he was thinking when he wrote At First Sight.  Like me, you probably loved all the characters in his previous books.  He makes every character in this book NOT loveable! I kept asking myself, who am I rooting for?  Do I care if things go well?  The best part were the medical issues but only a few pages in the book - could have been a story in itself.  I miss the old spark. 
 CD album not what I thought it was....Of course PB plays a mouth harp.....of course, the songs sometimes all sound alike...that is why he's not a ZZ, BB or whatever. One maybe two songs on these 2 cd's I like.....the rest go in file 13. There's nothing wrong with this style of music but it falls far short of Buddy Guy, BB King, Albert King....I am/was relunctant to negative any musician and this is not the case....Many of his good songs are missing and "fillers" placed instead. Unless you are a whipping Paul Butterfield fan, keep looking..... 
 it would be a very irritating and unbelieveable read.  I read this book after knowing it is mostly fiction to see what all the hype was about.  The writing style of this book is annoying and difficult to read.  I ended up skipping over much of the content because it was repeated over and over.  I know this is supposed to be for emphasis, but I just found it indulgent.  The lack of correct punctuation was distracting, too.  Had I read this when the book first came out, before everyone knew he lied, I would have found it hard to believe that most everyone in the book relapsed but he was completely fine without the help of AA.  Although I have not attended AA or any similar support groups, I feel that this book sends a poor message to people with addictions, that they are perfectly capable to handle their recovery on their own, which in most cases I am sure they are not.  I found the other characters in the book to be much more interesting than James Frey, and I can't say that I felt any amount of sympathy or connection to him as a character.  Maybe that is what he wanted since he supposedly feels so horrible about himself....but I am sure that now he has made a pretty penny pimping a fake story he isn't feeling so badly anymore 
 I Purchased this to replace my husband's favorite keyfob from American Eagle, which was almost identical (and lasted ten years, incidentally). This one fell apart after two months. Time for a trip to the local leathersmith.. 
 First five chapters are on Dell's configurator "Choice board". This one is a total waste of time. Not technical, not re-invent the business. What is the audience here 
 1. Let's Get It Started: D-. Why not start Now 17 with a bad song?  2. Lean Back: F. Continuing until futher notice...  3. Goodies: F.  4. I Like That: F.  5. Ch-Check It Out: C-. Beastie Boys aren't that good anymore.  6. My Place: F. Starting to continue again...  7. Sunshine: F.  8. You & Me: F.  9. Why?: F.  10. Locked Up: F.  11. Baby It's You: F.   12. Angels: F.   13.

It's just ok.  19. Here For The Party: F. Eww!  20. Days Go By: F. Country sucks!  Another Now futuring only 4 good songs, "Cold", "Take Me Out", "Pieces Of Me", and "1985". Skip this one 
 I just finished reading this book, and I am so glad I got through it finally.  The daughter of Sandra, LaShawndra, was so irritating to me that she just grated on my nerves the entire way through the book.  Also, the book didn't really have that much direction.  I had a hard time understanding the point of the book for some reason.  I was just happy that I finished it, so I could quit reading.  I loved her other books, but this one just didn't do it for me.  
 If you read between the lines on the other reviews here, I think you'll see that everyone thinks this thing is junk. And their right!!! No matter how small the job, it won't do it. It's just one more "MADE IN CHINA" piece of junk that I've wasted money on. It won't suck anything off hard wood or carpet floors. I don't get how any company, let alone a well known vacuum company, could sell such a usless tool. My only question is how could anyone give this thing two or more stars?? 
 Amidst all the tirade and rhetoric, cold hard truths emerge: the way IPRs are framed, especially those pertaining to the biotechnology field, is biased towards the interests of multinational corporate entities, and that the current mechanistic gene-centric paradigm in the "life" sciences ignores holistic perspectives of lifeforms and nature which are useful in their own way. While the urgency and potency of the message is not in doubt, the presentation of the content, with all the sidetracks and rambling discourses, leaves much to be desired. Read this book with an open mind, don't take everything in it too seriously, and look up alternative sources of information as well 
 The songs are boring, the lyrics are plain. I am so dissapointed. I bought it without listening to it first thinking I would at least find one song. How wrong was I to find out that not even one track speaks to me. Andrea's solo album sucked. Now this! I think their creative days are over and if I see them in concert again, I hope I am not tortured with the music from this new album. Instead I hope they play the oldies but goodies that characterize them as the band I love so muc 
 I wonder if anyone tried to edit this book.  You would think that after 86 years of no championships, this book would be flawless.  O well, at least the Boston Globe tried and I'm sure the ring is more important than a book to Red Sox fans 
 I normally enjoy the Cussler books, especially the Dirk Pitt stories.  This one, however, is especially contrived and very confusing.  There is virtually no character development, so keeping track of the various pieces of the plot is difficult.  I felt like I was in the "fog of war", seeing hundreds of snippets and just hoping it all came together in the end.  Will the real Clive Cussler please come back?  
 I chose this book because it had a lot of practice tests and I didnt really need the review because I had a strong background in math from school.  If you want to practice for the SAT II dont use these tests.  THey are much harder than the actual test.  I ended up getting an 800 on the SAT but considered not taking the day of because the night before the test I was still getting 550s on the practice tests.  Luckily I chose to take my chances anyway but this book only made me nervous and did not help at all 
 This is an unbelievably bad book. The story, including the identity of the villain, is obvious within the first chapters. The characters, dialogue and situations are so unbelivable as to be ridiculous. If the protagonists in this story graduated from medical school, I might consider sending my hamster, because they seem to have about an equal intelligence level. David and Angela should have figured this whole mess out even before I did, but they were too busy listening to their daughter's improbable dialogue, answering her with trite, cutesy nonsense, and putting her into situations that should have made them lose their parenting privileges. Cook should leave polemics about HMOs to the analysts and concentrate on basic writing techniques - plot, character development and dialogue 
 While the premise of this book, Rachel Block's decision to drop out of rabbinical school and pursue a relationship with an older man, is an interesting one, the book never lives up to its promise.  I found the writing to be so-so, the storylines to be a little hard to believe, and most of all, the characters to be extremely underdeveloped and one-dimensional.  The story is neither character-driven nor plot-driven and so the book can be a bit of a chore to read.  I must say I was also disappointed with Rachel's relationship with Hank, one of the main parts of the novel.  What kind of a woman would stay with a man who treats her so horribly?  Since there is so little set-up on the Rachel character, it's impossible to fully know.  Hank is arrogant, utterly disrespectful, and downright mean, but Rachel simply accepts his rotten behavior and continues to pursue Hank despite his obvious lack of interest in her throughout much of the book.  If we are supposed to believe that this is how women in their 20s approach love and romance, that's a pretty sad state of affairs - has Rachel, have women, no sense of self-respect?  I was disappointed by this book, but for someone looking for a short, snappy, easy read with dialogue that is occasionally interesting and very graphic sex talk, this might be just the thing 
 I am not a Christian, but I do share Calvinism's belief in -- to use standard Christian terms that I would not otherwise use -- the absolute "sovereignty of God" and the inseparability of "law" and "grace." Moreover, the issues discussed in this volume bear generally on philosophical questions of freewill and determinism. Thus my interest in learning whether "open theism" raises cogent alternatives to the traditional view.  That view is easily stated; it is that everything, but absolutely everything, occurs by the will of God. According to Calvinism, any _other_ view detracts from . . . well, the Godness of God, so to speak.  Now, I could certainly criticize some Calvinists for failing to take this point seriously enough. (For example, there seems to be a foundation here for a sort of "Christian satori" as one realizes that one simply _can't_ do anything that is not the activity of God -- that, a la Paul's yet-not-I-but-Christ-in-me, one is simply part of the divine activity oneself. I suppose the claim would be that, as one comes to realize and accept this fact fully, one "enters the kingdom," conforms one's own will to God's, and tends to stop sinning. And this "satori" would, of course, be entirely the work of God: some will come to it and some won't, some will like it and some won't, these things all being determined ultimately by the "good pleasure of the Father." Now, doesn't that look a lot like salvation by grace through faith?) But short of atheism, it's hard to find reason to disagree with the claim that, ultimately, God just _does_ everything that happens.  Nevertheless our authors try mightily to find such reasons. Unfortunately, most of them are not terribly well-founded.  Some of the objections are simply raised against the wrong target -- for example, the claim that theistic determinism detracts from God's goodness/love in holding that He consigns people to hell. If I were a Christian, I'd have tried to mount scriptural arguments in favor of annihilationism and/or universalism before I attacked divine sovereignty. But our authors here are neither annihilationists nor universalists; they do think that some people will go to hell, and that they will suffer there eternally.  So how does the Arminian position improve on Calvinism? Have we "gotten God off the hook" by contending that He created both human beings and hell even though He _didn't_ have the power to keep people from eternal punishment? If there is a legitimate target here, surely it is in the doctrine of hell itself, not the doctrine of theistic determinism.  The scriptural arguments are not impressive either. There is quite a bit of assertion that certain scriptures seem to show God repenting and/or changing His mind; fair enough. There is also some minor criticism of the view that these passages are analogical or metaphorical; also fair enough. Yet there is no attempt whatsoever to reconcile them any other way -- for example, by arguing that an eternal God, being ultimately outside of time altogether, can perfectly well be timelessly wrathful-toward-Jones-at-time-t1 and merciful-toward-Jones-at-time-t2 without actually undergoing any change _in_ time.  Nor are the philosophical arguments much better. I find persistent confusions about what, exactly, "free will" is supposed to be, together with largely emotion-based "arguments" that human choice is a sham if we don't actually have such "free will." But because nobody bothers offering any account of such "free will," it is not carefully distinguished from plain-vanilla _volition_; the casual reader therefore doesn't notice that a form of volition operating outside the causal network altogether would amount to sheer randomness. (Nor is the possibility raised that human volition -- or at least the volition of Christians -- just _is_ the outworking of the divine will. Partakers of the divine nature, indeed! These authors don't seem to take their New Testament very seriously.)  Perhaps the best of the bunch is William Lane Craig's piece on Molinism as a possible rapprochement between Calvinism and Arminianism. But even here, Craig seems not to notice that in the relevant respects, his "Molinism" is not a rapprochement at all; if it is presented consistently, it is Calvinism, plain and simple.  There are other errors as well. For example, here as in other "open theism" writings, our authors wish to persuade us that the idea of an impassible, unchangeable deity comes from Plato and Aristotle _rather than_ from the Bible. This is a false dichotomy; it may well be that Plato and the Bible teach these points in common, and our authors have not successfully shown that the Bible _doesn't_ teach it too. (Moreover, this argument -- including the idea of the "divine pathos" -- is lifted wholesale from Abraham Joshua Heschel, but as far as I can tell, not one single author in this volume has given him proper credit for it.)  Pretty unconvincing, then. Although there are at least a handful of good _expositions_ of the Arminian view, for the most part there is merely a good deal of bandying about of such terms as "relational" as though these terms (a) have clear meanings and (b) are at somehow at odds with Calvinism. I found the volume disappointing at several levels, and I can only imagine that Christians will find it much more so 
 I've found this book to be poorly documented, full of unsuported radicle claims and circular arguments. Souri makes no effort to explain what he calls Japan's inherent military and industrial suporiority afer other Asian nations but meerly accepts it as an axim and proceeds to explain it. Add to this a translation that fills to book with convoluted sentances that don't seem to fit well where they are and I found it to be an unplesent experience. 
 My parents have a set of Chicago cutlery that they got for their wedding decades ago, and it's still a great set for them.  I bought this set as a starter set until I could upgrade to a better Chicago cutlery set, but I'll never buy another Chicago cutlery set.  The chef's knife rusted after a week.  Now three months later, their all rusted.  The serrated edge is dull and doesn't cut, it tears.  If your thinking of buying this set, regardless of price you would better served spending your money elsewhere 
 If you're like me, you got into Boo Radleys during the shoegazer era.  I loved the discs preceding Wake Up!, especially Giant Steps.  This is as far away from shoegazer as you can get.  The first reviewer here is right on as now Carr is totally doing the Beach Boys sunny harmony thing.  Sorry, no my thing.  They could have evolved more like Catherine Wheel whom I recommend highly.  Also try Ride (of course) and Slowdive 
 I had to see the movie for some odd reason. I agree with the last review on many points. The film makes it sound like the Jewish people were the sole inventors of film. It is horribly cliched, and makes etremely odd, partial points, like that "My Fair Lady" is an example of the jews trying to fit in. It plays out like a script written by the moguls themselves. Waste of time 
 Prior to reading the book, I've learned a lot about the history of the movies and the stars and whoever else associated, but when reading this book, it says nothing new or anything particularly fascinating. Feels like I am reading stories of incredibly forgotten stars. Fathom that word "fogotten," and I stress it. Actually, the book makes a great read when crapping in the toilet 
 After Frostburn, which is a very similar book which I liked, I expected this one to be good too. I was wrong. Let's face it, we buy the supplimental DnD books for feats, prestige classes, spells and a few quirky magic bits. Most of the rest of these books are pretty poor. Once in a while the author takes the theme to another level, which I think they did with Frostburn to some extent, and Libris Mortis too. Sandstorm is almost a waste of time. The races, prestige classes and quirky magics are horrible and almost useless in any campaign. A good part of the feats are the same. And there isn't much mentioned on desert themed campaigns to complain about. "sigh". I'd recommend buying something like Heroes of Battle instead. 
 	My opinion of this book is that it would be better off in the hands of a nine year old.  In a way this book was a bit too juvenile for me.  The hardest word was "hernia".   	The story took place in Moon, Texas, where the roads hadn't been paved yet.  Grandpap becomes ill.  He moves with the Jaynell's family.  Gradpap buys an emerald greed Cadillac.  He teaches Jaynell how to drive.  Grandpap passes away.  They sell the Cadillac.  Not exactly my idea of an interesting book.  This book was very vague.  I couldn't even find the climax.  I would not recommend this book if there were others. 
 I am sorry but this book, after 5 years did not help my fiance at all. Infact, it just made it worse.   Some people don't realize that being "nice" is a personality trait, NOT a "disease". On top of this this isn't a "disease".  It's absolutely disgusting to call a personality trait a "disease".   Who am I to say such a thing causing such a paradigm shift in thought?  I am a social studies major, in the middle of getting my graduate degree.   and I think that this book, plus going to her outrageous seminars in L.A. was just another great way to pocket some cash by preying on victims who are convinced that they are bad for being nice.   This is all simple common sense people. Although I am not a huge Dr. Laura fan, I would suggest reading her books to get your thoughts straightened out on what is right and wrong and how it is OK to say no. Don't waste your time with this book. If you have a problem netowrking, go read Dale Carnagie's book "How to influence people". Great timeless classic. 
 I remember when I was first introduced to the "Cat Who" mysteries; my High School French teacher's bookshelf was full of them, along with the Mrs. Polifax mysteries and some Inspector Maigret. I enjoyed them, even though they were a little cutesy and it was hard to suspend disbelief at the cats' antics, but I wasn't really driven to keep up with the series.  Now, seeing the book in a cheap pile at Wal-Mart, I figured why not try it--and wow, what a disappointment. It seems to me that the "Cat Who" mysteries actually used to be mysteries, but judging by this one, now they're just cutesy.  It's a sad state of affairs when the blurb of a book is more exciting than the actual book itself. Talked Turkey's blurb implies Qwilleran has to solve an execution-style murder on his property, and somehow the mysterious reappearance of wild turkeys thought long-gone from the area has something to do with it. Well, it doesn't (nor is it ever explained at all, in fact), and the murder is barely even mentioned in the book; the fact that it gets "solved" in the end is more or less coincidental. In actuality, the book is by and large a slice-of-life story about Qwilleran, his cats, and the community. Which is fine if that's the sort of thing you're looking for, but not all that great when the book is being advertised as a "mystery. 
 I ordered this sight unseen while in Iraq. As bored as I was, I don't think I got one iota of entertainment out of this book. I try not to take chances like that anymore 
 I bought these discs at CompUSA because I needed a few before I got the ones I ordered online. Well, I just wated a good 25 bucks because out of 5 discs, I got one that burned good. Not much bang for the buck. I have burned many discs but never Memorex, usually Verbatim or Ridata or MAM. Very disgruntled with these discs making coasters. Maybe my burners don't like them but whatever the case, I won't buy them ever again. I thought Memorex made good products 
 Would be 5 stars but for his rhyming about the Jews controlling the media on the track propaganda 
 I'm an espresso/cappucino only drinker, and have owned a variety of machines over the past 20 years. I've had this one for less than a week and it's going back to the store for refund. After having read all of the reviews, here is exactly what is correct and what to expect (p.s. if you're not a cappucino conniseur, please don't bother writing a review):  Pros:  1 - built like an absolute tank. Beautiful style and construction (this does not mean excellent engineering... just means not 'flimsy'). The thing weighs like 40 pounds). 100% durable.  2 - short wait time for water to get hot. Like this really matters compared to a boiler-type machine (this is thermoblock). A boiler takes what, 7 minutes and this one takes 4? Are you that much in a rush for a cup? Takes 20 minutes at Starbucks.  Cons:  1 - I have a $1,100 Pavoni, the best boiler/manual pump machines in the world. You can't come close with the Breville. At best with fine ground espresso I can get slightly rich coffee while the machine pumps for 5 minutes.  2 - The filters stink. The double-wall on them is only there because the machine does not produce enough pressure/temperature. The filters leave a soupy mess and not a dry puck (a puck is indicative of a boiler system). Makes you want to drill holes in the bottom of the filters (as is, there's only a single pinhole that gets clogged).  3 - What steam? When you first switch to steam mode, it spits out a nice 2-3 second stream of water. And whatever you call the air pithing out you can put your hand up to for a bit without scalding. You're better off making foam using your lungs and a straw, then nuking it in a microwave. It hardly produces any foam.  4 - The hot plate on top is not a hot plate. It's a luke-warm plate. My heating pad for my back is warmer.  Overall, if you're an inexperieced cappucino maker who thinks Dunkin' Donuts hung the moon, get this machine. Otherwise it will end up being returned or being a workshop anvil 
 This is a very capable program that has too many nuances. For just a simple DVD burn it is far to complex. Definitely for the advanced user, I am sorry that I spent the money 
 I travel 2-3 weeks a month for work and I needed a hairdryer that was better than the 1000 watt hotel dryers, so after some research I decided to purchase the travel-size T3.   During the first time I used it, it started smoking and the coils in the back flared up and caught on fire. (There were actual flames -- although they quickly burned out)  I took the dryer back to Sephora and I was quickly given a replacement.  While I had dryer #2, I noticed that it took 15-20 minutes to dry my hair, when it usually takes 20-30. However, I have the full size T3 at home and it takes about 10 minutes when I use that one.  I was expecting this to offer the same power as the other T3.  The bottom line is that I didn't notice a big difference between the travel T3 and the hotel hairdryers that are built into the bathrooms.   After 6 months, the handle broke on the 2nd hairdryer making it rather challenging to use.   If you want a great hairdryer, buy a full size T3, Elchim or Chi Pro -- if you need something to travel with, you're better off with finding space for the full size model. 
 What rubbish.  Ridiculous situations, and poor writing doom this boring, stupid film.  Probably, the worst film that starred either Lee Marvin or Gene Hackman.  A real hack job that was meant to snare unsuspecting theater goers who liked the stars 
 Never would have bought them if I'd realized they looked like switchblade knives.  Poor choice on my part... 
 This book started out promisingly, and the first part of it is an interesting introduction to American law.  Unfortunately, the last half of the book is almost exclusively about politics and administration.  He spends whole sections on things like New Deal agencies and Great Society programs.  Certainly, these were "laws" passed by Congress, but they don't tell us anything about the justice system.  If you want to learn about the American legal system, I'd suggest Law 101 instead.  It's not historically based, but you'll learn a lot more about how the system functions, and the principles on which it is based, than from this book 
 To be honest, I've owned this book forever but after seeing someone ask about it on another forum, I just wanted to log in here and write a quick review of it as a warning to potential customers because I found it so poorly executed. This book basically consists of Rooksby very quickly presenting a topic in overly simple terms and then citing hundreds of examples of existing known songs that are supposed to illustrate his idea. This sounds like a great idea in principle but in execution it all falls apart. The examples read like pure fluff and do not cover any detail whatsoever, he does not even go into high level things like chord progressions, etc, from the examples. I presume this is due to copyright restrictions, etc. It would have made much more sense to license a few decent examples and really show how they illustrate the point. Or heck, the book is about song writing, why not actually WRITE a few over the course of the book??  The CD that came with the book is literally content-free, too. There's almost nothing on it. Again, this is in spite of all of the external music cited (some of it obscure) and due to the lack of specifics in the book. The CD can literally be thrown away without harming use of the book. It appears to be included in the book as reassurance that there is something there... i.e. a marketing move more than a useful resource for the customer.  So, really, in spite of the hundreds of general examples cited in the book, there is not a single specific detailed piece of information I can remember off hand. Ie. almost no tab, chord diagrams, or sheet music style content. Almost nothing specific about the guitar's interaction with the rhythm section and the specifics of writing for the rhythm section or vocal melody are covered either. And of course, the tell-tale item: nothing is composed/written by Rooksby for the book.  Looking at the presentation, its very slick. The book looks nice, the layout is great, the writing style is enthusiastic, its easy to WANT to like it but when it comes down to it it's good looking book that doesn't achieve its objective. I regretted the time I spent reading this book hoping for it to get better... Thankfully it's extremely short too, but I won't even bother going there at this point. ;)  So, basically, this book is just flat out not useful and the time spent looking for a different, more suitable, book on the topic will be rewarded many times over.   Also, avoid Rooksby's "Riffs" book as well, it suffers nearly the exact same set of problems as this one 
 Not as good as "Entre Nous" - less fun and more acedemic. But even then it is not a well written essay. The few good salient points are repeated too often, and with not much creativity or development 
 First things first.  The most important thing to recognize about this book is that the majority of it (about 2/3) was not actually written by Jesse Livermore.  It was written by Richard Smitten, a man who tries (and fails miserably) to create a sort of monologue of Livermore, complete with phony quotation marks, in which the great trader outlines his system.  Having said that, Livermore's actual writings are very interesting.  The first few chapters of the book is a word for word transcript of Livermore's original text, and contains much in the way of useful insight and helpful tips and information.  The Livermore Market Key at the end of the book is also Livermore's creation, and it, too, is useful in its own way. 	 The rest of the book is cobbled together by Richard Smitten, a man who seems to have made it his life's work to piggyback on Livermore's success in order to make a name for himself.  Smitten took letters and interview transcripts and pieced together a phony Livermore monologue.  It is unconvincing and a complete waste of time.  The writing is abysmal, and Livermore's concise points and techniques (from the first part of the book, the part Livermore actually wrote) are repeated over and over and befuddled to the point that you have to remember that it is not actually Livermore speaking.  Smitten's attempt to adopt Livermore's style of conversation fails miserably, and the whole of his work is tedious to the power of ten.  I couldn't even get through it-I had to skip to the Livermore Market Key at the back.    The book also contains some shameless self-promotion in which Smitten attempts to peddle his biography of Livermore onto the reader and also his trading system, which he shamelessly claims will help you trade like the great legend.  Smitten's writing is so awful I would never even consider anything else written by him-his seeming inability to create a concise sentence without a run on and his ineptitude at using question marks when necessary waxes tiresome in a hurry.  The best book about Livermore's trading style is Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, and that book will get you closer to understanding the real Jesse Livermore than this drivel ever will.  Aside from Livermore's own words (the only redeeming factor here), this book is utterly useless 
 I am rather disapointed, the first few chapters are interesting, but later on it gets really boring when it gets into simple enumeration of facts and linked theories... That book indeed gave me lust to read the very other books it criticises 
    Reilly fans will probably find his latest novel to be quite a disappointment. For some reason, Reilly forsakes all the things that made his earlier books great.  Instead, this novel is a thinly disguised political statement which reveals Reilly's prejudices against various governments and religions. The plot is obviously borrowed from "The Da Vinci Code" and the characters are one-dimensional pawns whose main purpose is to verbalize Reilly's personal ideology.  For the first time in a Reilly book, I managed to finish the book out of sheer determination rather than out of any interest in the plot or characters. 
 i'm not sure that all the information provided in this book is truth. i will say that i believe some is inaccurate, and limited. hopefully you have better luck with it. i have noticed a rising popularity in shamanism and i hope there are better books out there than this one, regarding said subject. check out anything by thomas cleary for a great read. also i recommend tao te ching, the urantia book, and melchizidek truth principles. 
 Actually not going to be kind........... What a load of RUBBISH 
 I purchased this camera case for my granddaughter for Christmas to go with the camera her parents had bought for her.  This is the first time I have ever been DISAPPOINTED with a product I purchased from Amazon.  It was, in my opinion, not worth the price I paid!  The picture looked much larger that it actually was.  I wil continue to purchase through Amazon but I will be much more careful and definitely return it if I'm not satisfied.  In this case I did not have time to find another camera case.  Thanks for giving me the opportunity of expressing my opinion. Linda Sutto 
 I bought this for my SciFi class.  We read Bram Stoker and the reward was supposed to be this film.  It was like giving kids liver for dinner then rewarding them with canned spinach.  Everyone was so disappointed.  I kept waiting for it to get better and it never did. The history of the film with the lawsuits is really interesting and the clips you've seen are wonderfully scary with brilliant make-up.  The problem is that there is a month's worth of boring between the good stuff.  Fast forward or the students who expect CGI will fall asleep if they stay in class that long.  Bela Lugosi is a much better bet.  For a silent, Metropolis is much more compelling even to those CG fans 
 does anyone know the song thats played when Brian is chasing the guys on the dirtbikes near the end of the film? i would really apresiate it. = 
 On The Top Of What Game? DFB has no game whatsoever, they are atrocious and all their music is trash. I hope they ride their game straight to the bottom, because thats where they obviously will find themselves in about a month. "White Tee" "lean wit it, Rock wit it" have the same beat and same motion with the lyrics, if no one else notices that then u have to be a no-nothing psycho idiot.

 The only good thing in this movie is Jolene Blalock as a femme fetale. The problem with this film, to paraphrase an old quote, is that there is a lot of nice scenery but no engaging story put in front of it.  Truly only Wilbur Smoth knows how to pull off South African Grand Guignol and have you care. Unfortunately Wilbur Smith has nothing to do with this. And it shows 
 I received this as a Christmas present.  This digital camera works fine for still shots, pictures of my family, etc, but for action shots, kids playing outside, basketball games, etc. it is a BIG disappointment.  I took 47 pictures of my son playing basketball in our school gym and only 5 of them were worth keeping. I've taken to several games/activities to try it out. I've tried using the different functions, adjusting the manual setting, and playing with the zoom but nothing has worked.  Many of the shots are blurred, have shadows (because of movement), or are so dark the people can't be seen.  I wish I would have known this before I asked for this camera.  
 I've read nearly every one of Danielle Steel's vast collection of novels...and this is "hands down" the VERY WORSE piece of garbage she's ever written.  What a joke!  It was as if one of Ms Steel's enemies broke into her house and forced her to write this mess!  Don't bother 
 Heaven forbid that these three chicks invade the U.S. with their watered down hip-hop/techno/pop music. This CD was awful and sounds no different than the trash played on U.S. radio, probably even worse. There was not one single song on here that stood out and I was bored. The girl who does the lead singing- and I don't know which girl it is- has absolutely no range at all. I think in the last song she does this whispering thing, but I don't consider that any real vocal ability. Anybody can whisper. Anyway, this CD is not worth paying $17-$35 for. You definetly need to skip this at all costs. 
 I loved the first Carole Matthews novel I read, "For Better or Worse", and picked this up in an airport hoping to be entertained once again. It kept me entertained while on a three and a half hour flight, but only because I didnt' have anything else to do. I am the type of person who has to finish a book once they start but it was really hard for me to even pick this one up again after getting off the plane.    I totally disagree with the premise behind the whole thing and found it completely pointless. There were no redeeming qualities and few parts in the book even worth mentioning. To me, Matthews expects you to feel sorry for a woman whose married lover decided he needed to be with his wife and kids instead of leaving them for her. I think this is a horrible/unrealistic messgage.   If you want to read something good, pick up a Jane Green novel instead.  
 this album is and always will be an original gangsta album to the fullest with above its time production and hard real life lyrics.....no female artist comes close, NONE point blank..... to date that is.......they were the FIRST TO PUT DETROIT ON THE MA 
 The color of the actually received ear rings was quite light. A darker amethyst color would have been much better and the picture on the computer screen was really deceptive, since that showed a much darker colored amethyst. I won't buy jewelry from Amazon again when it comes to a colored stone. HSN depicts their jewelry much better on the screen and provides better stone quality products 
 After reading five of her novels, I have become a fan of Jodi Picoult. I will admit (and this probably proves that I am a sucker for marketing rather than letting the literature speak for itself) that I've deliberately read all of her best sellers before reading the books that didn't make it on the list.   Initially I liked the book and it kept me reading, though maybe just out of habit. I enjoyed reading about the Amish way of life and the Amish traditions - though it did make me think of that Harrison Ford movie, Witness (circa 1989 or something). I like that she used one first person voice as well as the third person narrative in a well crafted and varied way.  I like that her main character has a powerful job that challenges gender stereotypes by being the morally questionable lawyer. That being said, she doesn't explore this as well as she could. We sort of forget that Ellie has blatantly suppressed evidence and watched as little girls saw their rapist acquitted. Rape, she can defend, but infanticide creates some problems for the notorious defense attorney.   Something about the book bothered me. Maybe I am reading too many of her books too fast but I am seeing a formula here.  - Many of her plots include a court room drama.  - All of her plots feature romance or end with the obvious potential for one.  - Mothers and their powerful (all encompassing, self-sacrificing) love for their children are a theme in all of her books I've read.  - There is usually a "twist" at the end. She's becoming Koontz like in her formulaic predictability and I stopped reading his novels as a teenager.  Most of her books left me content, like I'd eaten a good, hearty meal. However, this book left me hungry and searching for critical reviews to see if others shared my dissatisfaction.   So: - I was unimpressed with the "twist" at the end of this one - I knew "whodunit" about 1/2 of the way through. I was getting bored with that part of the story. The red herrings are too obvious and her suggestions that Katie didn't do it were there from the beginning. She should've stopped the heavy handed attempt to make us question that and just made it known through the 3 person narrative exactly who did the killing or hiding. Then she could have explored that character in depth instead of hiding her and others she wanted you to be suspicious about. Just because we, the readers knew, didn't mean that Ellie had to know - or anyone else for that matter.   - The characters in this novel were a tad generic. I am sorry, I like her, but they were boring.   For instance, I was bored with Ellie's dilemma over Coop - to the point where I often skipped the interaction they had when they discussed their potential future together. Duh, I knew they were going to get together after a little drama from Ellie through which Coop - being the quintessential "sensitive ponytail guy" - would wait, albeit in pain. It was just too predictable.  Hannah's ghost; she has a ghost hunter in a later novel and I was a disappointed to see another one. But other than that, Hannah's ghost seems a bizarre and meaningless addition. Is it to suggest that she, Katie, might be crazy and a murderer? Is it to explain why she was so drawn to Adam? Katie being the good Amish girl could only fall for someone who could share her secret ability to see her sister... In a book that is so Amishly pragmatic and logical in every other way makes it so the supernatural element clashes with the rest of the novel. Maybe Hannah's ghost killed Katie's baby or hid it.  I liked the details. The Amish and their daily lives, those who assimilate and those who don't, and how the religion and way of life affect one's thinking offers a neat, un-scholarly insight into a different culture. I liked the culture clashes and I wondered how they would be resolved. But what I did like, doesn't measure against my dissatisfaction.  My most recent book purchase included three works of fiction; two by Picoult and one by Atwood. I think I'll shelve the unread Picoult for a while. I'll have some time to forget her modus operandi. I'll read the Atwood and then I'll buy a book by a different author 
 Some people complain that this book has no romance.  Others complain that the mystery is too dark.  My complaint is that I don't know what world Kay Hooper's characters are operating in but it isn't our world.  Never mind the fact that the major premise of this series is that there is a special unit of FBI agents who have psychic powers.  I can live with that.  I can live with them facing a host of otherworld nasties.  What I can't put up with is the failure of basic common sense.  For instance.  There is a maid at a fancy resort who is pregnant by one of the guests.  She is worried about her pregnancy showing because she knows she is going to be fired.  What!?!   Then what will she do to support herself?  What!?!  First, if they fire her because she is pregnant she gets a lawyer and sues their money out of their pocket.  She also notifies the father that he has another mouth to feed and had better get ready to hand over child support.    I've seen this nonesense in romance novels so often that I kind of expect it there, but this is not supposed to be a romance.  Now, as to the mystery part:  this special FBI unit would be far better off if they would stop depending on their psychic abilities so much and do a little gum shoeing.  A child is kidnapped and taken far from the place where she was last seen to a cabin in the mountains. Our dauntless FBI agents find her by psychic means (This isn't a spoiler, it's part of the back story)  and 1) do not take the child to the hospital for examination; 2) do not call in forensic people to search and process the cabin for evidence of the identity of the abductor; and 3) do not seem to follow up at all in a rational, FBI sort of way.    So if you want no romance with all the romance nonsense about the way the world works, a mystery that could have been solved briskly with a little digging into the circumstances and characters that are paper thin at best, then grab this book at once.   
 This book is important for the historian who wishes to get a glimpse into the workings of the mind of an important figure in American Revolutionary history, but it doesn't stand on its own. It is written almost entirely as a response to Edmund Burke's "Reflections on the Revolution in France", so I would not recommend reading this one until and unless one has read that one. Otherwise, it is impossible to judge the fairness of the rebuttals of Burke's points, as one only sees them through Paine's perspective, and Paine is far from a fair and impartial debater; he misses no opportunity to belittle his opponent's arguments, and even his opponent himself. I would not be at all surprised to discover that he gives an inaccurate picture of what Burke had to say, particularly given that history speaks rather better of Burke's misgivings than of Paine's panegyrics. Both books were written before the Reign of Terror that resulted from the revolution in 1793; the second part of this book came out in early 1792. Also, history shows us just how silly some of Paine's claims for a Republican, representative government are: 200+ years of representative government in the US have hardly banished wars, or the high taxes associated with them, even though the world as a whole is far more democratic than it was at his time. He makes some good points, and certainly it is hard to stand up against him in favor of hereditary monarchy, but it is apparent that he failed to see that not ALL "democratic" movements were necessarily benificent, even if it would be hard to have much sympathy for the autocratic regime that they overthrow 
 It claims to be "the saddest story I have ever heard". Well, it is certainly not the saddest story I have ever read. Usually, sad things happen to good, thinking people. It is beyond my understanding how this tepid book can have so good a reputation. No doubt, adultery and the passions that surround it can be a great subject to write a novel, but the problem here is that characters are at the same time plain and unsympathetic. The trick, in my opinion, is that they pass for profound people, when in fact they are void, useless and jobless persons. The florid language in which the book is written gives the impression of psychological depth, but the truth is these characters have not much to search for within their personalities. Edward Dowell, the narrator, is the typical cuckold, unaware that his hypocritical wife is sleeping with another man -his friend, to make it worse- under his nose. Fool. Florence Dowell is a typical hypocrite (funny, they all seemed to me to be the "typical" something, which may tell you how profound I found them), an emotional blackmailer. Her husband gives his life to her, devotes himself to take care of her illness, and she goes and sleeps with a friend. And she's not even sexy or wicked or nymphomaniac. She's just an unfaithful common woman. Pig. Leonora Ashburnham is at the same time proud, detestable, arrogant and fool. She devotes her life to mend the fences broken by her irresponsible, philandering husband, who spends all his money on other women and gambling. Leonora is always there for him. Dumb. And John, well, John Ashburnham... Lucky guy. Rich, seductive, idle, always generous to easy women, always losing money and depending on his wife to talk to creditors. Always with nothing to do but seduce other women, including friends' wives. Pathetic loser.  The funny thing is, everybody knows what's going on but no one does anything about it, and later they all complain and are perplexed. Boring and despicable lives make, in this case, for a bad novel, representative of the worst traits of XX century literature. The ending is exhilarating by way of trying to be tragic and moving 
 You can read all about the book just from what is included in the jacket. Unbelievable potrayal of a women cast off a ship by her husband. All she wants to know is did he love her when he married her? Why did he do it? I mean give me a break! I would not lay low and try to make him go insane. I would go to the police.   I read books from beginning to end to give them a chance. This was a waste of my time 
 I recently bought the Sibelius Volumes 1 and 2 in 2-in-1 sets. I wont comment on the artistic content as they are covered in others reviews of this page. The sound quality of Vol 2 is decidedly degraded - almost unlistenable - compared to the much much higher quality of Volume 1 (with magnificient artistry). The transfers are AAD on the Phillips label which, like DGG, of the 1970's are not meant for better quality music systems (even of that period) and unless remastered disappoint the listener. It is possible that reissues for this particular packaging could be faulty or may be that the repackaging is so cleverly done that all the goodies are on Volume 1 and the second-best on the second. Davis is redoing the Sibelius Synphonies with LSO and that may account for the rush to get this set out of the way 
 Yes, they do say "Yah" in Minnesota - but not every other word. And Yah is not the only word which is vastly overdone. It would violate Amazon's review guidelines to repeat it here. Despite some reputation as a comedy, I found nothing to evoke even a chuckle.  It is an excessively violent, bloody film.  The financial difficulties which lead a pathetic car salesman to instigate this reign of terror are never explained, making for an implausible plot. DON'T BOTHER! 
 First, grab some stock mystery characters off the shelf - a serial killer nick-named Little Jack, (as in Ripper), who has some "religious" issues, a drop dead gorgeous female homicide detective with an aging "seen it all" partner, and a "street tough" ruggedly handsome, up and coming attorney who takes it upon himself to pursue "Little Jack" when his law partner/old flame is brutally murdered, (much in the same manner as Little Jack's previous prostitute victims). Toss is in a few secondary characters such as the attorney's old "Irish" mentor from the streets, a politically motivated bonehead police chief  and the usual political cronies from the Governor's mansion on down. Top it all off with post 9/11 terrorist attack and conclude with a James Bondish finale and one might think this would make a great made-for TV movie, (there's even a cameo appearance from Whitey Bulger) which is exactly how this reads. Unfortunately it doesn't make for a good book. Everything in this book is predictable - the plot, the dialogue, who lives, who dies, good guys, bad guys. The major "twist" in this book occurs halfway in - not in a good Raymond Chandler way, more in an "I saw this 150 pages ago" way - and the "solution/resolution" plods along for another 200+ pages. There are also a multitude of scenes in this book that are not only irrelevant but force the reader to remove him or herself from any concept of reality. I hate to be so negative but with all the hoop-lah surrounding this book, (comparisons to Lehane for instance), I expected much, much more 
 I am not too happy with this item.  It has a handle, yet is heavy enough to hurt if a toddler drops it on their foot.  It is difficult to reach inside to get the shapes out.  And the vertical placement of the holes is difficult to use.  Other than that, it is attractive looking and constructed well 
 This book is an example of psuedo-intellectual overthinking of the highest order. It's dense, wordy and unreadable in every way. Why would any writer spend what appears to be LOTS of time and energy on this of all subjects: Ventriloquism's effect on CULTURE?!   The resultant product amounts to little more than an uninteresting mess.  Skip it.  
 THIS PATHIC BOOK MAKES NO SENSE ONCESOEVER!!! HOMER IS A HORRIBLE WRITER!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS!!! NOT EVEN WORTH ONE STAR!!!! 
 Don't waist your money.  From cover to cover Larry Sontag tells about who is watching and how these evil men will use this information against you.  I wouldn't mind that if he gave one useful bit of information on how to avoid the problem.  I would recommend "How To Be Invisible" by J.J. Luna or "Bulletproof Privacy" by Boston T. Party (although it is out of date, he still gives good advice.)  Also "You and the Police" by Boston T. Party is a valuable read 
 It's important to know in considering this book that it is pretty much Morell's thesis, so if you dislike dry, academic work, it's probably not for you. While the book addresses many of the issues that intentionally childless women face (especially the 'compensation' and 'regret' stereotypes), it really hesitates to delve deeply into the sociopolitical/psychological causes and implications. I felt the book was far too heavily reliant on extensive and repetitive quotes from Morell's survey respondents- as such, it really prevented the narrative from gathering speed or developing into something powerful or revelatory. The scope of the research and the profiles of the intentionally childless women presented by Morell are extremely limited, as she herself acknowledges: mostly middle-aged, Caucasian, heterosexual, and married/in an LTR. In short, this book is the first of its kind, and it is groundbreaking. But as a feminist reader and a happily child-free woman, I'm ready for the next step. 
 Ms Wilson needs to make up her mind whether to write a book of Literary Criticism or a biography.  The book suffers from too much critical analysis of Sassoon's poetry and not enough about his life.  Either he was an extremely boring and prosaic poet or Ms. Wilson needs to delve deeper into his intellectual and emotional development - really his cricket exploits and his hunting prowess does not lend anything to the very essence of his life.  Ms. Wilson's prose is turgid and repetitive. An extremely disappointing work 
 These were a sticky mess in the bag - the fruit juice leaked from the lollypops and leaked out of the plastic wrap.  They were also soft and seemed stale.  Great ingredients, but the final product was disappointing 
 The minute I took the monopod out of cover it broke. The mounting head fell apart from the leg. The glue they use is very bad. I didn't return the product because I think the replacement would be the same quality and it was not worth the affords. I just fixed it myself 
 I admire Leavitt but agree with the reviewers who say this is not his best work.  I have read all of his fiction and especially liked the earliest works--Family Dancing and Lost Language of Cranes. This novel, however, despite the easy flow of the writing, did not stir my interest. The characters weren't fully realized--and I could not conjure feelings for any of them.  The plot was quick paced, but to what end?  So much time was covered so quickly that I had trouble staying fully engaged. Also, credulity was often stretched to the breaking point--I never before sensed this as a problen in Leavitt's writing. I was ready to jettison at midpoint, mystery or no, but finished nevertheless. 
 This begins as an interesting work on the history of Jerusalem.  The first third of the book covers Jerusalem up to the time of the Arab conquest in 637 AD.  The book continues to discuss Umayyad Jerusalem, Crusader Jerusalem (at some length), Jerusalem under the Ayyubids, Mamluks, Ottomans, and modern Jerusalem.  A team of ten scholars worked on this book.  Unfortunately, there is a problem.  The final chapter, written by Michael Hudson, on modern Jerusalem, is like the thirteenth note of a cuckoo clock: not only is it manifestly wrong in itself, it also casts serious doubt on the preceding notes.   At the start of the twentieth century, Jerusalem was a Jewish oasis in the Middle East.  Jews were a big majority in Jerusalem (about 64% of the city in 1910) and a small minority almost everywhere else in Asia.  During the past hundred years, much of Israel went from having an Arab majority to having a Jewish majority, but Jerusalem's demographics changed relatively little.  But to Hudson, there has been a tragic loss of the Arab character of the city.  The way he deplores the existence of anything Jewish about Jerusalem today sounds incredibly racist and reactionary.  More than that, it renders his chapter far less than objective.  This misleading chapter alone makes it impossible for me to recommend this book as a credible source 
 I doubt if this random presentation of tones and sounds has any technical basis behind it.  It certainly did nothing for me.  Wasted money as far as I am concerned.  
 This book had some interesting tid-bit facts. Would have been nice if I had received it as a gift rather than purchasing it myself. I read through the book once a lot of the facts I had already known and some were very suprising. 
 [http://www.answersingenesis.org/home/area/faq/Genesis.asp] [www.answersingenesis.org] has numerous refutations of 'progressive creationism' and specifically of Ross' assertation of the meaning of the Hebrew word for day (yom). They clearly demonstrate the grammatical errors of his claim.  Also see the book "Refuting Compromise" by Jonathan Sarfati, Ph.D 
 This book is bad stuff because it doesn't emphasize eternal damnation in Hell.  Without Hell and eternal damnation, God did not have to take on human flesh to die in a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins.  John Stott really needs to read his Bible carefully.  How could someone who doesn't understand this be saved? 
 I bought this case for a Sony Vaio SZ140 after seeing a spotlight review saying that the Vaio would fit perfectly inside. I ended up returning the bag for a refund for two reasons:  1. My Vaio (13.3" screen) was just slightly too big to fit in the case. The case itself is very well padded with thick foam. I probably could have forced it in, but it would definitely have taken some forcing. I'd guess a Macbook would fit better.  2. The case itself is just too bulky. I bought it looking for a sleeve that would protect my notebook while carrying it in a backpack or messenger bag. This case is very large for a sleeve and would barely fit in my bags. True, it comes with a shoulder strap, but if you're going to use that you might as well go with a regular-sized bag so you can carry your power cords and other accessories.   This case seems to have trouble making up its mind whether it's a sleeve or a regular notebook bag, doing a poor job at either. It's too big for a sleeve and too small for a bag

 This book is more for the person who already knows the material that will be contained in the book. Each time I was excited to read a section, I was disappointed in its content. Don't get this book if you're looking for more of an explanation rather than dictionary definition 
 OK, I love the Rev and I hate to talk trash about the new album, but it is a huge let down.  Granted it's still better than most other albums by other artists, but it lacks the guts of the other Rev albums.  The song writing and performances lack the depth of previous albums.  It sounds like they were thrown into a studio and told to put together an album in a week.  There are some good songs on the album - Indigo Friends, Callin' In Twisted - but overall it's just weak.  I saw them play about a month ago and they played some of the new songs.  The live execution was great.  Unfortunately it just didn't translate well to the album.  I'm all for the Rev stretching their legs and exploring new sounds, but in the past when they have done that (Space Heater, Spend a Night in the Box) it still had the depth and feel that the Rev is known for.  It may grow on me, but I listened to it four times in a row the day I got it, and it just didn't do it for me.  If I put together a Reverend Horton Heat "Greatest Hits" record, I don't think any of these songs would make it.  Sorry to be so rough on the guys -they really are an awsome band - but I'm disappointed that the new album lacks the guts and soul of they are known for 
 I bought this CD title b/c I wanted to learn how to play the guitar again.  My decision to purchase this was based solely on all the Amazon reviews that I perused beforehand.  You can definitely learn to play the guitar with this, but there are so many other titles out there that are cheaper and more up-to-date.  Furthermore, there is nothing more annoying to me than hearing the instructor loudly singing the songs over the guitar strumming.  His voice dominants in many parts of the lessons, and it deafens the sound of the guitar which makes it very difficult to hear the chords being taught.  Again, the software is good but may not be the best on the market.  Then again, I've only purchased three titles, and this one offers a few things that the others don't include 
 I have used several Belkin KVM products (Omniport and Omniport SE) and was very happy with those units over many years. When I wanted a KVM to use with my new DVI video I thought this would be a good choice. Sadly it is close to a disaster on three levels:  SETUP / ERGONOMICS Setting up the unit was hard because my Dell DVI video cable housing just barely fit into the input connector on the Belkin base unit. The Belkin cables are quite nice, but have the smallest "footprint" of any cables I've seen and many cables that come with comuters or LCD displays will have a hard time fitting this unit. The compact neature of the KVM means that connections are hard to see if you do not have a VERY well lit area.  RELIABILITY: Next, the unit worked for one week and died. My first call to tech support was offensive as the Belkin rep wanted me to replace my USB keyboard to be sure that was not my problem. Since I did not have one, I could not get any return authorization. I did finally borrow a keyboard the next day, but when calling belkin again, the tech did not have me test the keyboard at all. His debugging was simple and in 5 minutes he verified that I had a defective KVM.  I got a new unit quickly and returned the old one (but see more on this below). That unit worked for 10 days and then began to malfunction. So far, I have been able to restore it, but this is only possible by powering down all the peripherals, unplugging all the cables into the KVM, powering down the KVM and reversing the process.  CUSTOMER SERVICE: To get your RMA # for defective equipment you have to provide Belkin with a charge card that they say they will only use if you fail to return the defective unit. I was careful enough to have my unit shipped with delivery confirmation because Belkin charged my account (for a tidy $234+, way more than the Amazon price). When I called customer service I was told they had no record of receiving my return. But when I gave them the tracking number of my shipment, the rep immediately said, "OK, that is all the documentation that we need, I will credit your account". She was so matter of fact that I believe this is a common occurence.  SUMMARY: Some Belkin products are great - this in NOT one of them. Belkin service is inconsistent and this issue on returns is one that makes me plan on avoiding Belkin electronic components. I am going to look at the IOGear KVM sold by Amazon as a possible alternative 
 Tonight I saw Mr. Chopra on television.  I was stunned at seeing a man who hardly looked healthy never mind younger or ageless!!!  Common folks, put two and two together.  Why can't he produce the effects he promises and makes you pay for such empty promises.  My Dr. friend was correct about Chopra finding a way to milk folks for tons of money!  The shocking part was the man who carries an air of such lofty spirituality displayed little spirituality on the TV.  He was not only bloated looking but so was his attitude, full of criticism for Western thought, Christianity, America's foreign policy etc.  I am not saying we are perfect or there isn't room for criticism but he was full of criticism with nothing good to say about what is worth acknowleging at the Western culture.  He had to set himself up as the one voice of enlightenment....it sells more books, healing appts, lecturers, etc.   I copied a portion of what another reviewer wrote because it shows the level of superiority in attitude and the traversty of such actions upon real dialouge, the kind of arrogance that came across by Chopra on tv tonight. Before finishing want to say,  It's ok to want to make a fortune only don't wear false spirituality to do so. In the early 70's I went to the Marharishi (?) Meditation Center in NY where they charged $200 for the mantra, the same mantra they undoubtedly recycled a billizion times, asking the initiate not to share the secret mantra!  I was so young and naive.  Then there was Baghwan (?) with the fleet of Roll Royces and a hefty bank acct. He had followers hand over the deeds to their homes for the price of enlightenment, of course they did so willing based on what they were made to believe! That guy feed into the human desire of some, to let go and feel it was ok to do whatever they want...endless sex, drugs etc...no judgment. All this done in the name of being more spiritual, enlightened than the rest of us! Chicanery comes in many forms, only in searching for the NEW often people ignore the obvious deception that is right in front of them. End  "Having worked with a large number of cancer patients through the years, following their fears and struggles, it seems like an insult to ordinary humble workers to say "Reprogram your quantum mind and get rid of the cancer". If Chopra could show one case of a person who could do this, including himself, I`d be willing to change my view of this as a condescending way to treat suffering humans who need compassion and good palliative care, not easy solutions that give the responsibility to the patient, whereas the doctor stands with no soil of the human factor on his hands. This is a travesty of the Hippocratic ideal, and will strengthen the view of alternative doctors as superficial, money-loving peddlers of false hopes. 1 star rating is inevitable, I hate to say. Luckily, there are many good sources of the same knowledge that Chopra embezzles. (Hope I haven`t been too harsh, I have no wish to attack Chopra, but I wish to strengthen a more substantial approach to the issues of aging, health and dying). 
 It seems to me that this author is trying to tell us he is tired of Lucas Davenport.  I feel that he wants to transplant the best of Davenport to a new hero.If so, he failed.  If that is the case, he failed. There are long stretches of boring reading and suddenly a spark of the old haro comes through to us.  Worth to read if you cannot fall asleep; after some half a dozen pages, you can. How sad.. 
 I can't believe how many people think this movie is a masterpiece. I had such high expectations of it and was extremely disappointed. When the film began I was interested for about 20 minutes, but then as it went on I started to have doubts. After a while I was debating whether or not to turn it off, but towards the end I decided to leave it on just to see how bad it was actually going to get. And it really did get bad! The ending was so predictible and hackneyed. It was just another crappy cops and robbers story, but with a high budget and an all-star cast 
 As I've been looking for a book on the subject of "Unexpected Pregnancy", I was interested in reading this book. But after some of the reviews describing what's in this book, while I'm sure this is a good book, I get the feeling that this book is not what I'm looking for. I wish there was a book (if anyone knows of one, please list it here if that's allowed) about married women with unexpected pregnancies who wish to adopt out the child. For the woman who knows her own mind (when the trite sayings of "Oh, it'll be alright," or "You'll love the baby anyway," or "You'll just have to live with it" don't work) and doesn't approve of getting rid of the baby through abortion, what choice does she have left? Instead of having to adapt to the idea of having another person around the home, why not allow an adoption. I've talked about this to so many other women, and while some of them look at me like I'm trying to start WWIII or I'm coming from la la land or something, there's some women who have told me that what I say is what they have thought of but were and are so afraid to mention. One woman told me that to mention adopting out her and her husband's baby would have made her family & in-laws totally turn away from her forever, and another said she was so very sick of being told that she was just suffering from post-partum depression that she could have screamed. (I've often wondered if a carpenter decides not to be a carpenter, if he or she would be labeled as suffering from post-carpenter depression, for instance, and relentlessly nagged until returning to the job as a carpenter against his or her wishes? - Just a thought.)  Anyway, if anyone knows of a book that covers this subject realistically, please list it here if you can. - THANX       
 This set was very difficult for my second grader to string on her own. The string is not durable and broke after wearing only one time. 
 I was looking for a book that would give me guidance to diet, not one that was meant to analysis my feelings like going to a head doctor. It was a  real disappointment and a waste of my hard earned money. Other books by the  Heller's are of more benefit 
 I remember the day I got the email alert from the ABB website announcing the formation of this band. As I read the line up I couldn't believe my eyes, just a few weeks before I had been having a conversation in which some friends and I were imagining the perfect band and I described a lineup almost exactly the same as Frogwings.  The only difference between Frogwings and my fantasy band was that Jaimo was in my group and rather than Edwin McCain, the singer would of have been Col. Bruce Hampton.    But I could handle McCain and as tour dates were announced, I made plans to go to see them.  Sadly time and money never allowed me to see the band with McCain, but I did manage to get some audience tapes that had terrible sound quality, but from what I could hear, the band was pretty good.    Later on when more tour dates were announced with John Popper replacing McCain, I was even more intrigued.  Although I wasn't the biggest Blues Traveler fan in America, (I did like the second and third albums when they first came out, but the third and fourth ones turned me off and I haven`t given them another chance since), the addition of popper did open up some interesting possibilities.  When the new group began touring the same thing happened again, but this time I was unable to get any audience tapes and thus remained ignorant of how the band sounded with Popper.     Then I heard that a CD was coming out and was pumped.  Finally I would be able to listen to what a band that I had been trying to hear sounded like.  I got this sucker the day it hit the store, tore into the package and threw it on.  After listening to Kickin' Bach, which I liked, I skipped through the next song.  Then I skipped through the song after that.  Then I skipped through the next one as well, at this point, I was beginning to notice a startling trend.  As much as I didn't want to admit it, the CD left me disappointed.    Not long after, I lost the CD and didn't make any effort to replace it. Derek Trucks new (at that time) CD had a studio version of Kickin' Bach on it and that was enough for me.  A few years later, six of them to be exact, a funny thing happened.  I was driving down the road and the song "Pattern" from this CD came on the radio and to my surprise, I liked it.  The same song that a few years before I had rejected had unexpectedly captured my delight.  Against my better judgment, I ordered a used copy from here and when it arrived,  I threw it on and once again I was disappointed.  Subsequent listening has done little to change my mind, but I must admit that the more I listen to it, the more I like it.   I guess to sum things up, this CD is at worst a sub par effort given the talent assembled and at best an acquired taste.  Not that it matters, but my friends that have heard it tend to agree with my assessment that it could of have been great, but is instead just barely good.  We all agree that it's a bit to hectic and could have showcased the Burbridge brothers a little more.   I do wish though that they would give it another try, but with Col. Bruce replacing Popper. 
 I'm a huge fan of David Bowie, Harvey H. and Wesern movies. SO this movie had winner written all over it from where I stood.  What a painful movie to watch. Both Bowie and Harvey looked as though they wanted to be somewhere else. With the notable exception of one tearful scene between Harvy and his Daughter in-law this movie was void of anything that could be remotely called acting.  Not surprising considering there very little story for the actors to leverage off of.  I wanted to like this movie.  Now I know why it was filmed in 1998 and not released in the U.S. for six years.  Save your money and watch it on cable. While it is interesting to watch Bowie try to pull off a southern accent (and he DOES sing Battle Hymn of the Republic) there's very little else going for it 
 I bought these shoes and they only lasted four months. The leather sole was REALLY slippery and never did make it easy to walk with them on. By the last month i had them, the sole had totally separated from the upper. I thought Florsheim shoes were good; maybe years ago, but not now. These shoes are NOT recommended at all 
 Katz comes across as sanctimonious & patronizing both in his books & on his appearances on NPR. He's really not a dog expert at all, but a dog-owner therapist for people who don't have enough sense of themselves (i.e. WILL) to deal with a strong-willed being in their lives day in & day out. He's a reassuring authority figure (to those in need of one), captain of the ship.  I find Katz's attitude towards dogs to be pretty mean-spirited. His solution to most "problems" dogs create in households is a mix of "crate it" & don't feel *guilty* about treating your dog like a 3rd rate being. It's OK to go off & leave it boxed up for 6 hours, don't worry about it. It's just a dog, after all.  I think what bothers me most about Katz & his philosophy is that he panders to a population that has grown increasingly alienated from their natural instincts, resorting to self-help books & extension courses in place of common sense & gut feel. It's a self-serving situation & will make a comfortable living for people like Katz, but pity the poor dogs.  Maybe his next book will be titled "Can dogs feel? 
 This book was the mandatory text for my Introduction to CS class, which focused on programming with java.  1. Concepts are not introduced in a logical order. 2. Concepts are often not given a context, which makes them difficult to remember. 3. Concepts are dumbed down in all the wrong areas. The result is a book that is a tedious, insulting and confusing read. 4. The programming style it teaches is not professional, and often includes poor practices. 5. Perhaps what I dislike most about this book, is that the teacher's version includes ready-made slides, assignments and tests. The slides tell you nothing that isn't already in the book, and the pre-made tests pose bizarre questions which quiz how well you've memorized the book rather than how well you've learned the material. Ladies and Gents, if your Professor is using this book to teach java, run away!  If you have the choice to choose your own textbook as a beginning programmer, I recommend Jeff Langr's Agile Java. Even if you have no choice but to use Cay's text, I recommend you pick up Agile Java anyway -- since you won't be learning how to program well from Horstmann!  I bought Langr's book half-way through my semester with Cay, and it was my secret weapon through to the end of the semester. You can see my review of his book on it's amazon webpage  
 After reading this book, I found myself disappointed with an author that seemed to miss opportunity after opportunity for insightful analysis and instead focused on the minutiae of, say, the banter between an M.C. and a pageant contestant in a decades old tape of the Miss America pageant. Unless one is for some reason in need of highly detailed information on the proceedings of past Miss America pageants, I would suggest looking elsewhere for a book about beauty pageant culture 
 I purchased this book hoping to find examples and interpretations from the Bible providing a positive case on us seeing our beloved pets in heaven. I do think that the author clearly cares about animals and feels they will go to heaven, but many times he tended to get off topic. I agree with 'The Pawsitive Pet Psychic "animal communicator"' about how he apologized too much. He takes three paragraphs explaining how what he is about to say is his opinion and that we don't have to agree with it. I don't see why he needs to do that in his own book. I also felt that he spent way too much time talking about how animals listen and communicate with us. That's fine and all but I thought I was reading a book about if animals go to heaven, not how good a dogs scent of smell is or how to choose healthy pet. I'll buy a book on animal care if I want to know that. All in all I felt a little misslead by the title and assumed it would be primarily about animals in heaven. I was wrong, though, as that didn't seem to be the primary subject. Finally, I don't see how a story about a cat nearly dying from a scorpion sting or a dog almost drowning from a goose is a "humerous" story 
 When I reviewed THE STREET LAWYER recently, I mentioned that I've never put down a Grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props. For that book, certainly. For this one, nope. I read four chapters, 41 of its 391 pages, and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot. I hope he just had an off day or something, and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable. 
 With so many serious perspectives available on "peak oil", there is no reason to waste time on this screed, which only uses peak oil as a platform to cast aspersions on everything the author hates (and he hates, of course, all that which he does not understand).  He hates: the American south and its culture, Wal-Mart, interstates, strip malls, the Arab nations, and most of all, suburbs and the people who live in them. He loves: Israel, the liberal Northeast as it was fifty years ago, Israel, hateful rants, and Israel.  Peak oil lets him indulge in wishful thinking about how the Arab states will lose their power along with their oil, how the suburbs and Wal-Mart will collapse without cheap motoring, and the greatest reach of all: how the South and West will, for some reason, suffer more than the northern tier states in an energy scarce environment that he is certain is inevitable. Despite the fact that it is the northern tier states that are most dependent on cheap natural gas and heating oil, and have the least access to alternatives: solar, wind, biofuels. This last is thus little more than a transparent rationalization that allows him to imagine the reversal of the loss of economic and political clout of the north due to the inexorable flow of the American population from the dying Rust Belt cities to the more pleasant climes of the suburbs and the south.  Of course, he said all the same things before he ever heard of peak oil; back then he was making the same arguments about how Y2K was going to destroy all those things he despises. As were a lot of the other peak oilers.  Everywhere Kunstler goes, he sees only ugliness. This is to be expected. The ugliness lies within him, so he will never escape it.   Give this one a wide berth and learn something about Austrian economics. You'll be glad you did 
 writes author and "renowned analyst of East Africa, the Horn, Sudan, and the Great Lakes of Africa," G√©rard Prunier in his explanation (Pp 155, 156) of why he believes that the situation in Darfur does not qualify as genocide - (because there was not an attempt to "destroy a racially, religiously, or politically predefined group in its entirety,") although he admits that it actually makes no difference how exactly it is defined. His explanation of this one point is clear; however, the rest of the book is extremely difficult to follow due to its concise, complex, research paper-like style. In the first paragraph, he states that the introductory chapter, "...aims at giving...an overview to enable the non-specialist reader to grasp the context in which the crisis developed." That may be the case, but this reader felt only minimally enlightened on the subject of Darfur after having read Chapter 1 (twice), and the remaining five, even having taken notes along the way. Prunier's attempt to explain the situation in Darfur to everyman types is no better than that of Julie Flint and Alex de Waal in their Darfur: A Short History of a Long War - an equally tough read. 
 The first chapter will pique your interest. The next two chapters will present interesting examples of emergent behavior. The remainder of the book will likely leave you feeling frustrated at the poor presentation and disappointed at the lack of follow-through on your expectations from chapter 1. The density of useful information drops precipitously as the book progresses, degrading to something at or below what you would expect to read in a blog (I'm serious). I must admit I haven't been able to finish the last chapter 
 This was so boring, i thought that it would get better after a while like most Buffy books, but it was just so repetitive. and the half-hearted attempt at Buffy and Ian's romance? That really got on my nerves. A few simpering glances and a kiss? wow, i'm sure that will get everyone's pulses racing. really don't buy this book 
 First off, I do not agree with Evolution, in any way, shape, or form.  However, I will say that Darwin, unlike most so called "scientists," esp. Evolutionists freely admitted that there was more to learn in the comming years, and that his theories, or hypothesis, might have to be seriously reconsidered if new scientific evidence was discovered that did not corroborate his views.    Most of what I see in scientific debates comes down to pure and simple prideful blustering, and hateful muddslinging!!!  It seems more favorable and a hec of alot easier to smear the opponant than to honestly, critically, and civily debate another person with whom you disagree.  Ego, Ego, Ego, and more Egomaniacal Monkeyshines!!!!!  I am new to this whole debate (Evolution vs. Creation / Intelligent Design), and I have alot to learn on both sides of the issue, but I can tell you this, I am honest, and civil enough to at least make an honest attempt at respecting the other side, as someone, who in my opinion, may be "wrong," but is also a human being deserving of proper respect, esp. if they have devoted years to honest scientific investigation.  All sides need to learn CIVILITY, and PROFESSIONAL RESPECT, WHICH IS SEVERELY LACKING IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY TODAY, MORE THAN EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1  This is a foundational work which started the whole Evolution landslide. Anyone who truly wishes to debate, refute, or otherwise understand the theory should read it carefully.  Just as one should read carefuly, and critically those foundational works on Creation Science (A real science) and Intelligent Design (A true Scientific Theory).   Be REAL SCIENTISTS AND INVESTIGATE FOR YOURSELVES WHAT YOU BELIEVE, OR DON'T BELIEVE.   I seriously doubt that Civility will ever come to the Scientific Community as a whole, as so few people are truly willing to lay down their Egos to search out truth, especially if the opposite of their own views is terrifying to them.   Yes, there is a God, and he is not you, Dr. Ego Monkeyshines 
 I truly enjoyed all of the other Rich Dad Poor Dad books, but this one is awful.  I have recommended all of the books to a number of my close friends and family.  I will have to warn them all of this book.  You know, you can knock them all out of the park though. I still will recommend that everyone should read Rich Dad Poor Dad at the very least 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 while i was watching this movie i thought to myself, "am i going to die?  have i gone to horrible movie hell?"  you see i was trapped in a theater.  it's like being tortured by some horrible nightmare but you can't leave cause B actors are pretending they can act just because they're fat.  the in crowd gives you that feeling like when it's grossly bright outside and it's a sunday afternoon and you're in a car and you've been sitting for 6 hours and you feel sweaty and there'a a football game playing on the am radio and you want to escape.  in conclusion, this movie turns me into melting snow.  but i suppose there are worse movies-- (see my review on gummo) 
 Charles J. Sykes reinforces every paranoid conservative American fantasy about American education in Dumbing Down Our Kids.  By confirming the fears of parents and the great mass of middle America what about the educational system, he tries to create hysteria about "educationists" (his awkward, politically-shaded word for teachers and administrators).  His book is something like the Pancake Feed Breakfast of educational critique: with some fake maple syrup, it tastes yummy going down but sits in your stomach as a kind of revenge by Aunt Jemima.  If the book sounds reasonable to you, then you should worry that your own thought processes are not particularly complex 
 What I learned in this book could have been placed on 1 page.  Sure, business life is a challenge and your competitors are not your friends, but this book did not deliver on facts and details.  I don't see much difference between this book and the guru-books 
 5 Secrets to a successful marriage, and sex, is not one of them.  Among the many idiotic writings you'll find in this hand book for ass-backwards 21st century religious nut jobs.  Read the parts about the lady on the airplane from the church of satan and about the son coming home from college with an earing if you want to laugh at how pathetic and blow hardy the idiot who wrote this garbage is, if their was ever an excuse for book burning, we've found it 
 Wow. I wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of NO stars. O'Reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. Fiction is clearly not his strong suit. His characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. Reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. If this trash is any indication of O'Reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed 
 If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well.I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to "Americanize" and "Control". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to "French version" or "Chinese Version" ~! This what Americans are doing~! Well, enjoy the cheap "American version" then~! LO 
 As a volunteer at an animal shelter, this was the book to read for our book club.  I was sorely disappointed.  Although I know Mr. Foster's heart is in the right place, the start of the book begins with his observations of dogs that he didn't help - which was quite disturbing.  Additionally, I found his writing skills poor.  His lack of explanation as to why, for example, his dog was vomiting blood, left you hanging.  The book just ends, no real ending to the story.  As I said, I was very disppointed 
 They don't hold very much for my very heavy wetter. I'm switching to cloth anyway 
 So little is written about the Nagas - Tangkhuls, Maos, Kabius etc living in the Manipur State, or elsewhere in the north-eastern states of India. So this book doesn't represent 'all of the Nagas'. The modern-day Nagas are  warm, friendly, very hospitable and peaceful folks. Music runs in their  soul and they've got the voice to match! Yes, they are indeed, beautiful  people 
 We received this as a employee gift and were so excited to have it.  Not only does it not fill anything pass 15 PSI, the 12V cord is very cheaply made where it plugs into your cig. lighter.  The plastic on the tip started to crack after pulling it out.  With the few more times we used it, I the tip completely broke.  At least it comes with 7 year warranty.  Save yourself the disapointment and headache 
 Band Camp was funny, but not as good as the first two American Pie movies. It was, however, on par with the third movie in the series. There were the usual silly, outrageous pranks and there were a few characters from the previous movies, but not the main characters. This movie was fun and worth watching, but probably not really worth watching again EXCEPT for the the language features. The movie comes dubbed in Spanish and French, plus you can have subtitles in several languages while viewing the movie in any language. SO, this movie might provide a fun way of developing or brushing up on your foreign language skills 
 Tamora Pierce is one of my favorite YA authors -- I own and have reread "The Song of the Lioness" series and "The Immortals" series countless times.  Let's be frank: I *love* Daine. I think she's creative, intelligent, compassionate, imperfect -- everything a person wants in a heroine, really. And I like Numair. I enjoy every aspect of that pair's relationship as student as teacher, as friends, and, I hoped, as lovers.  However. I don't know how, but Tamora Pierce managed to completely botch the entire "lovers" thing. "Realms of the Gods" is both hurried and plodding, both too detailed and too vague, both attentive and dismissive, and the dialogue is atrocious. The enmity between Daine and Ozorne is impossible to take seriously; the Daine/Numair scenes are trashy and trite; the battle scenes are confusing and too fast. Most of the standard secondary characters we've come to know and love -- all the humans of Tortall, Kitten, Cloud -- are almost entirely absent. We see almost none of the promising characters from Emperor Mage, like Lindhall Reed and Prince Kaddar. Daine's shapeshifting and Numair's magic are both unremarkable.  Tamora, Tamora, what went wrong?   Perhaps she was hurrying to reach a deadline.  Anyway, my recommendation is to read the first three books of the "Immortals" series, but just get someone to summarize "Realms of the Gods" for you, because it's not worth the time and disappointment it takes to read it. I've reread it several times over the last, oh, six years, each time hoping it's not as miserable as I remember, and it's always worse. Spare yourself and skip ahead to the first book of "Protector of the Small" 
 I am sad to report that this book is an inadequate and frustrating introduction to finance. Important concepts are buried; there are no derivations; there are few clear explanations of concepts; and definitions of terms are sparse at best. The many jokes come as a welcome relief from the generally poor writing, but provide no educational value. The book is rendered even more confusing because its organization is wayward, jumping unpredictably back and forth between topics. Overall, I find this textbook to be incredibly opaque, and I constantly have to supplement my readings elsewhere. If you have had prior exposure to finance, then I suspect this textbook will be far more digestible, but if this is your first exposure to the field you may wish to try an alternate text 
 We checked this book out of the library.  My daughter who is almost 6 began flipping through the pages and then came running, screaming, crying with tears saying the book is very scary and she did not want to even look at it, nevermind read it.  I read it myself.  The message is a good one - be yourself and don't worry about what others think, but the things that happen to Camilla are a bit graphic and scary for an impressionable child.  
 during the first ten minutes of this film an elephant is brutely killed--you can see the bullets smash again his skull  other elephants struggle to help their wounded friend before they are driven off. i stopped watching after that 
 The book is easy to read however, it is very hard to solve the problems. The author does not do a very good job showing which equation's are used. In the example problems the author bring's in values which are constant's  but does not indicate what the values are and the units. It is a very hard  text book to follow. However the derivation of the formulas are done very  well 
 I bought the Hardcover Boxed edition published October, 1988, by Houghton Mifflin Co (Trd); ISBN: 0395489326 -- and I have to say that this edition is a disgrace.  The books are hardcovered with brown cloth and are protected by a tannish yellow cover, each with different artwork by Alan Lee.    This edition is horrible because the ink and printing is NOT really well-done.  There are hard-to-read words, smears, blotches, etc.  The paper quality is grain and has a tint of yellow in it - not recommended for white-white paper book readers.  Each book has a "Middle-Earth" foldout map at the end of the book.  These maps are terribly glued on to the back flap and are stuck close to the binding.  If you try to take the maps out, which is intended to be taken out to hang on the wall, the brown flap paper will stick and tear along with the folded map.  J.R.R. Tolkein's trilogy of the Lord of the Rings is a true masterpiece, but keeping a set that I will read over and over needs to be well-made. I do not recommend this 1988 edition because of the quality that Houghtin Mifflin printed and bounded.  The artwork covers are beautifully done and well-designed.  Everything else is fair game 
 I myself is a Proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services. I also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase. (Mine in three months.) The strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself. (In one occasion, they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it's good.)These back-and-forth guessing games normally drag on for months, and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you, even though it's still within one year. I believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise, not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying: "this is our policy. 
 Before buying the album I only heard 1 song. When I heard the hole track list I was disappointed. They sound like a lot of other things that are out there, so If you like the "same" sound over and over again you might like it.  
 I am a Lisa Scottoline fan and have enjoyed all her other books, so I had looked forward to this one.  I was very disappointed. The heroine, a judge, is not only incredibly dumb, but extremely uninteresting. Her behavior was to hard to believe for a woman who had the professional job as a judge.  The cast of characters held no interest for me and frankly, I couldn't care less why she acted the way she did nor who committed the murder.  The writing was boring, too long and a very weak ending.   All of Lisa Scottoline books are usually are a fast read; not this one.  This took me forever to read and when I realized it was going no where, I started skipping some pages.   I do not recommend this book         
 This product must work for some people but obviously not for everyone. I started this 1 month ago, using it as directed with normal diet & regular exercise, & I've gained 8 pounds! On the up side, the price was low ordering thru Amazon, so I would recommend if you're really interested go ahead & try it, maybe it will work for you 
 The product was not comfortable; it is now in the spare bedroom for unwanted guests. Also perspired even with 2 cotton pillowcases 
 This is a very well designed light and works very well. You have better control of the light vs. snake neck light types. The quailty of light put out is good and is not so bright as to create glare. There is one major flaw in this light. It has a very short life span. It died after only two months 
 I have used MS streets and trips 2005 and 2006 for over a year. It has some map errors that I wish were updated. I read that The Delorme Street Atlas was far superior, so I bought it. It only took one day for me to find a mountain of problems. Not only is the mapping way out of date (Many years) Microsoft Streets and trips 2006 Maps are far more up to date. On many occasions told me to turn the wrong direction on roads even when the road doesn't exist in that direction. It doesn't even know the name of some very old roads Displays..."Unknown Name" While driving on very old established roads it tells me to turn onto a road that is actually an elevated overpass that I am driving 30 feet below. The program actually wanted me to get back on the freeway by making a U-turn from an off ramp to an on ramp. I have used Microsoft streets in all of these same areas and it is much more usable. The Delorme is very confusing and frustrating. I'm sending it back for a full refund 
 This blender is a piece of junk. I used it maybe twice, each time it smelled like it was on fire, which kinda worried me since my Cuisinart coffee maker did catch fire. Last night I tried to make milkshakes and the turning wheel broke in half (the part under the carafe which hooks into the base to make the blades turn). It broke because it was starting to melt in the center where the screw goes through. I will never ever buy another Cuisinart product as long as I live. I still have their toaster, so I am alerting our local fire department 
 Irving is one of my top favorite authors...but I was SO disappointed in "Until I Find You." I could not relate to any of the characters. I thought they were all miserable and just plain pathetic. I held out until about page 600 until I gave up and put the book down. I didn't even care to know what happened to the main character, Jack, at the end.   Jack's mother is a tattoo artist. The book goes into heavy detail about tattooing, which I found totally unnecessary and frankly, a distraction from an already convoluted plot. In fact, three quarters of the way through the book I still couldn't figure out what exactly we were supposed to care about with this plot.   Was the whole point that that people are misguided, confused and damaged? Who knows. The characters were just so annoying and unlikeable that I found it to be a real chore to read this book.   Read ANY of Irving's other books before this one. 
 This device has lots of problems.  The customer support was not very good either.  We had difficulty setting up the wifi access when we got it.  Customer support provided no help at all.  We finally figured it out on our own.  The software constantly freezes, often requiring rebooting.  The last straw was today when all of the applications disappeared from the desktop.  We'll take our refund and purchase a laptop 
 This more I think about this book, the more thought provoking it becomes.  First, I find it amazing that anyone could take a belief that's widely known (practically a cliche), add nothing of substance to it, and actually write a book about it.  Second, I find it even more amazing that it took 134 pages to make the Golden Rule applicable to business.  Third, and perhaps the most amazing of all, is the fact that I actually spent my own hard earned money on this book.  What amazing insights did I think would be uncovered?  I'll save you $9.72 (+s/h) and the 45 minutes it'll take you to read this.  Here goes... Unless you were raised by wolves, it's pretty likely you've heard of the Golden Rule.  Ok, now think about how this rule can be applied to all of your business dealings.  That's it - you got it!    Whew!  Now that you have an extra $9.72 in your pocket and 45 minutes of free time, go practice that Golden Rule by treating your kids/grandkids/neighbors to some ice cream 
 back and forth and back and forth.  im happy.  im sad.  happy.  sad.  love him.  dont love him.  love him.  dont blah. blah blah.  we're poor.  we're not poor.  we're poor.   a series of a series of a series of deus ex machinas.  malamud's writing style is easy to slip into, and the story is addictive yet annoying (any pulp novel can be addictive).    spoiler    he rapes her and and spies on her undressing and it's ok!  (no, don't try to sell me any of that oh the author's not giving this his approval, no no no.  when there is nothing to contradict something, it's the same as saying it's ok.  the same as if someone writes a book where everyone is racist and there is nothing in the book to say that being racist is bad.  in this book there is nothing to say that raping someone is bad and that irks me.)     
 I love historical novels.  I really like a good romantic tale woven into those stories. For that reason I read and enjoyed "Katherine" by Anya Seton.  I later tried "Green Darkness" and was disappointed... and then tried Seton's "Dragonwyck" and really didn't care for it either. I saw these rave reviews over "Avalon" and decided to try another republished Seton book one last time. People, it is a chore to finish. I am doing so out of a sense of obligation... this book can't hold my interest at all.  The writing is simplistic.  The "romance" is dull.  The story is painfully slow. The characters are FLAT. I just don't get it. There are so many wonderfully written historical romances out there - all I can think is that the reviewers who've raved about it aren't regular readers of this genre and therefore aren't comparing it to other books & authors such as Sharon Kay Penman, Nicole Galland, or even Elizabeth Chadwick (more pure romance set against history than a blend of the two). I just can't recommend this book 
 I don't know whether Seinfeld creator Larry David had A Nos Amours in mind for the mock Eurotrash film that appears in repeated episodes, Rochelle, Rochelle. There are so many French films that could be described as "a young girl's strange erotic journey from Milan to Minsk" - the sexual activities/awakenings of pretty young teenagers is somewhat of a national obsession. It's hard to pick just one.  Maurice Pialat is widely known as "the French Cassavetes" (or, if you are British, "the French Ken Loach") which is the shorthand way of saying he's French, made films on the fringe of the European studio system, imbued his pictures with unsentimental realism, and is well-liked by film snobs who see Pialat's lack of relative mainstream success on these shores as proof of their sophisticated taste. His feature length debut, L'Enfance Nue, was tendered the Francois Truffaut mark of approval (it was produced by the master) as well as a Prix Jean Figo. That award is given each year to a promising French director, generally a young one though Pialat was a forty-four when he got his. He cemented his reputation as un auteur with 1987's Sous le soleil de Satan, which not only won him the Palme d'Or but iconoclast status for life when he flipped off some booing audience members while accepting it. Sounds like a guy I could like.  If only A Nos Amours were a better film.  The picture stars sixteen-year-old Sandrine Bonnaire as the frequently-nude (not as titillating as it sounds) Suzanne, a confused French teenager wandering from one hollow sexual encounter to the next. She says she's only happy when she's in the arms of one of her paramours and we don't blame her: Suzanne's home-life is at best unusual, at worst fairly grotesque. Dad (played by Pialat himself) flies the coop early on, leaving his son, pudgy tyrant Robert (Dominique Besnehard) in charge of both daughter and half-crazy Mom (Evelyne Ker). Emotional and physical abuse relents only for short passages of awkward conversation, often hinging on some sort of inappropriately sexual subject that tinges everything in something akin to unconsummated incest. Mom calls daughter a slut who trades sex advice with Dad while fielding interminable compliments about her body from her brother who himself has become a surrogate husband to Mom. Everyone in this family (Suzanne included) seeks to make life miserable for everyone else, and in their own creepy ways they succeed.  Plenty of women seek the affections of too many men (or too many of the wrong men) to compensate for an absent father - such are the incontrovertible facts that clich√© is made of. It's the sort of unsophisticated platitude-masquerading-as-wisdom we've come to expect from daytime talk shows, peddled to prostitutes and cheating spouses. In his own quasi-verit√© manner, I imagine Pialat was seeking to subvert the clich√©, deconstruct it, transcend it - rarely does it actually come off. The meandering quarrels, beatings, and post-coital chit-chats all have the feel of work-shopping actors being put through an exercise rather than real life, even the life of a sexually-obsessed French person. Pialat never truly gets under the surface of these characters, frquently mistaking the bizarre and cruel for honest characterization (it's no surprise Catherine Breillat is such a fan of a the picture). One hundred minutes pass, and yet we still feel as though we do not know these characters - they remain only our acquaintances, obnoxious ones at that, and if it's all the same we rather wish we hadn't been introduced.  Interesting footnote: One of Suzanne's first sexual conquests is an American tourist - we meet him as his has an argument with some French sailors, whom he calls warmongers. This is probably the only time in cinema you will see an American character call a French one a warmonger 
 Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this book. Buy the XML Bible instead. It is much clearer, deeper, and nicer to read 
 This book was sooooo bad, I didn't even finish it.  Thank goodness I read a library copy, as I would have been very perturbed had I paid money for it.  I was hesitent about choosing this book based on the cover blurb.  Two elderly ladies with a valet? In Regency England? How shocking!  But I suspended my disbelief and decided to give it a try.  (I usually like Catherine Coulter's books) I wish I had just trusted my first instincts.  What didn't I like?  The conversations were just simply bizarre. There is absolutely no consideration given to the mores of the time period. (In one scene the "hero" bathes the naked heroine.  In a small country inn. Where the doctor who's been treating her knows she's a girl.  And he's told the entire countryside.  The local squires wife has donated her night gown for the "heroine" to wear.  The vicar has been by to give her last rights.  And yet, the young unmarried "hero" is permitted to nurse a young,naked, unmarried "heroine" who has been impersonating a boy, but everyone knows is a girl.  It is at this point that the book banged against the wall.  I did pick it up again...but I couldn't go more than a chapter beyond before I gave up.  This book was just inane.  Skip it 
 I have purchased (and returned) four, count 'em, four Green Mile soundtrack CD's because of numerous skips. I keep going back, hoping the problem has been fixed, but no luck. I wrote Warner Brothers about this and I have not received a response to date. Has anyone else run into this frustrating problem 
 My problem with the 2005 season, was that the NFL did everything it's power to give the Indianoplis Colts a superbowl win. Event though Peyton Manning found a way to loose. The next best thing give the steelers the win.  My 1st rant - the Superbowl was played in Detriot. Only an few hours from Indianoplis. So it's basically a home game. Why not host the Superbowl in the RCA dome ? I thought no team could home field advantage in the Superbowl, the Steelers did.  My 2nd rant - Superbowl XL was all about Jerome Bettis. I don't hate that guy, he a top 10 running back of all-time. He'll be in the hall of fame in 4 years. Why not talk about Shaun Alexander, the league MVP. He broke emmitt's record for rushing touchdowns in a single season.  My 3rd rant - The refs gave the steelers the superbowl. They didn't want to upset the home crowd. Big Ben's touchdown was not a TD, he was clearly a yard short of the TD. The TD they took was away from Seattle, was cleary not a penalty. Seattle should of won 17-14.  My 4th rant - I thought it was amazing watching the steelers who finished 10-6, who barely mad the playoffs, win three road games. In the wild card game against the Bengals, they had knock out Palmer in order win that game.  My last rant - How can you boo my man Tom Brady while he was doing the coin toss ? Their just jealous because he beat the Steelers last season in the playoffs.  I don't hate the steelers. They are one the most storied NFL teams. They are right there with the 49ers, cowboys, packers, and redskins. Only the 49ers have 5 superbowl rings. I don't like the fact that the Refs made so many bad calls in the game.  If you are wondering I am a die-hard New England Patriots fan. 
 This book wasn't a very good book to start off with and I didn't enjoy it. The book was boring and I couldn't stay awake to finish the first chapter. When writing a book like this it should be written by the actual people but  if not it should seem like they wrote it, which is the way  the excelent  author Stephen Ambrose does. My advise don't read this book unless you've  had at least 15 cups of coffee before you start 
 The title "Prefactoring" is of course chosen to get you to buy the book, because it sounds like the popular "refactoring". The first few pages make it clear that "prefactoring" = "good design" + "learning from your experience". The design principles the author chooses are abstraction, separation of concerns, and readability. A nice choice if you want to keep things simple. The rest of the book, though, is a worked example where the author takes you through talking to the customer and shows you all his design decisions based on the principles and the context of his example. The problem is that your context is not his context. (Author himself says right at the beginning that "context is everything" i.e. how you apply a design principle depends on the specific context of your project and code.) So skip this book, read existing books on good design and coding, and apply them in your own "worked example" -- your work. And get weekly professional code review by someone you respect 
 If I could give it less than zero stars, I would.  I don't know how anyone can say this works great.  Maybe they can tell me what I'm doing wrong because I can't get this thing to work at all.  I bought it for my daughter's birthday thinking she could have some fun with temporary hair color.  She has brown hair and nothing showed up at all.  I tried everything -- dry hair, wet hair, dirty hair, clean hair -- you name it, I tried it, and we couldn't even get a remote hint of color.  The picture on the package makes it look as easy and successful as painting your hair -- total false advertising.  I kept meaning to return it but never did -- now, it will end up at a garage sale for 5 cents and a note saying "purchase at your own risk 
 Really tried to like this book. Premise was grand; story bobbed and weaved; conclusion was flimsy. Discursive scientific literalizations distract & disorient. Crichton breaks the rule to never stanch the flow. I dislike the quartet of scientists who investigate the outbreak; they don't come across to the reader as likeable 
 It's no great feat to hold up a decade thirty years on and make easy sport of it when viewed from a contemporary perspective. If you agree with this statement, then read on:                                                             Tiresome and catty poster child for a mean-spirited decade/"American Idol" torturer Simon Cowell has already cornered the market on spitting bitchy observation while gleefully breaking the spirits of easy targets. Having been made painfuly aware of that, the author's snarky schtick of "Oh, just LOOK at the ridiculous tastes and norms of the past and aren't we able to see CLEARLY now how HIDEOUS and HILARIOUS such inferior things are from our superior position HERE in the Superior Land of Now" is a pale imitation, and grinds painfully, like metal against bone.   One read of the unfunny potshots levelled at the trappings of seventies style by the author of this book, and I felt like I was being subjected to one of the lamer episodes of tv's "South Park" where the show's childish writers take shotgun aim at the nearest slow moving pop icon in hopes of getting a cheap laugh.   While certainly there is much to giggle about in that funked-out, doobie-tokin', plaid and shag carpeted but still mostly sunny and optimistic decade, this particularly superior sounding and unkind take covers no new comic territory. Going after the bright and well-meaning but kinda dumb and clunky interiors the way a school bully singles out the sweet-natured but slow special needs kid on the playground (easy target),the author finds no difficulty spreading the hate equally among the book's sometimes surreal images which feature vibrant paint schemes, cheerful furnishings, and whimsical wall graphics.   If it's true that every bullying child's actions stem from some unresolved childhood emotional damage, then the reader may be left to wonder just what this particular schoolyard bully's seventies childhood damage must be.   And for the record, Mr.Lileks, if you were paying ANY attention as a kid in the seventies (as I was) then you already KNEW it was silly, was happy, was camp--hell, even members of the dorky/hip Partridge Family regularly exclaimed "campy!" to accurately describe a situation or concept, for God's sake--which made that time (interiors included) not unbearable, but alot of fun. 
 Cluttered phraseology, erratic prepositions, dizzying suppositions and a tendency towards compulsive terminologicalism seem to be the hallmark of Derrida's work.  The deconstructionist tact in Specters of Marx has resulted in a collection of nearly incomprehensible thoughts, taking the shape of misguided, a-structural and often unintelligible sentences.  The book does not seem to have a beginning, middle or end, nor does it seem to carry themes from what chapter to the next (except for the repeated allusions to spirits, ghosts, specters, haunts, spuks, etc.). With all of that being said, I know that this is Derrida's point, to deconstruct language from its privileged space that it inhabits, to disassemble text brick by brick and to break apart the philosophical mortar until there is no foundation left to build upon. However, this raises a few flags for me. From where does Derrida derive the authority, or the power to give voice to the deconstructive effort?  Doesn't the process of de-privileging a text require authority from which to speak from?  Does Derrida's elite position as a pol-literati allow him some privileged vantage to see things more clearly than others?  Granting him that he might hold this position (for the purposes of argument) wouldn't it behoove him to make his writings more accessible, to the masses and academia alike?  Considering my relative nascence to Derrida's nonlinearity, and to his verbosity, maybe I am missing the point (in fact I truly believe that I am missing the point).  I will admit however, that the excessive neologisms, the confused waywardness, and the aberrant writing of Derrida may be artistic, and sometimes charming. I have found the reading of Derrida useful in that it helps me understand that writing or other texts may best be understood if they are removed from their privileged pedestal, that writing is just a representation of reality, a simulacra of simulacra which may have no meaning by itself.  But at the same time, I found Specters of Marx frustrating to read.  There were several times in this book where I read a sentence, or a paragraph, or a several pages and had absolutely no idea what it is I just read. If you enjoy postmodern deconstructivist literature then this book is for you; if you prefer to read something that makes some sense, I suggest you stay away 
 Crying of Lot 49 Flat - Senseless - One dead accumulation of words - In,fact this book is, at times, so porely constructed all reviewers who herald it should be lead directly to the meat grinders. A book worthy of burning.  Has writing become a whim of the well read, a process of linking obsure facts only to then be skewed by prolix innanities as simple segways to streams of consciousness Poor Plot Poor Writing  Read - Umberto Eco's Foucaults Pendulum. If you are looking for conspiracy. Do not read this book (unless you have time to waste or have by some possibility exhausted every other option on earth)   
 Though evenly matched, the color of the amethysts are much lighter than the product image. Both stones are feathered in areas and have visible blemishes though these aren't apparent if you are wearing them. About the quality you'd expect from Mervyn's or Sears on sale. Not terrible, but not great 
 Overall the writers of this book are to be commended for tackling the "final frontier" in christianity, however, I personally need more scripturally based answers and less opinion or anwers based on experiences.  The account of the book of Song of Solomon is also incorrect, Solomon was not her intended lover, the king had desires for her, and she for another 
 There seem to be a lot of readers who enjoy Pavel's style of 'writing', or at least, are easily convinced by the prose of his ads. Of course, it's hard to separate the ads from the books, which are loaded with ads themselves. I'm convinced that all one needs to -know- about stretching can be put into one small pamphlet. Actually, Pavel proves this in his first book by putting in a pamphlet's worth of info , and filling the rest with blank spaces, un-humorous anecdotes, too-big pics, and ads! I bet even -he- was surprised that the public was willing to keep buying the same info over and over , each time for ten time what it's worth. Amazing.   
 I absolutely love Janet Evanovich and the Stephanie Plum series, so when I saw this new series of books with her name on it, I grabbed them up.  I couldn't even finish reading this book.  It was so bad.  The whole talking car concept was, frankly, just stupid.  This was like watching an episode of Knight Rider, but without David Hasselhoff.  The characters are flat, and the dialogue is stilted and contrived.  I can only believe that Charlotte Hughes did most of the writing, and why on earth would Evanovich attach her name to this?  Needless to say, I will not be reading the rest of the series.  Spend your money on something worth reading 
 One of my friend recommanded to me this album, as an introduction to Pat Metheny's music. He said it was a masterpiece, it seems that we don't have the same taste for music.  I am not telling that he is wrong or that I am right, I just want to say that for me, this album is a shopping center music, the kind you heard in a Wal Mart.  I am a music lover, I can appreciate almost anything but not this, I didn't experience any feeling or emotion while listening to it.  As always, almost every rating here comes from fans of the artist, well, I am not and this just make a good balance to the whole thing.  Thanks for reading 
 It seems that people either love it or hate it and  I belong to the latter category.  How did this become a classic???  Having forced myself to read to the end I'm not going to waste anymore time - just read the other 1-star reviews - poor kids forced by their teachers to read this over-rated garbage 
 This well-meaning adaptation of Graham Greene's novel about love,  faith and mysticism suffers from being a product of its time.  The sterile  conformity of the 1950s apparently did not allow the full glory of this  story to be brought to the screen.  While it avoids the central pitfall of  its 1999 successor, that of Sarah and Bendrix renewing the physical aspects  of their affair, the '55 version greatly plays down Sarah's great  desparation for love, understates Bendrix's jealousy and atheism to almost  non-existence, and completely removes the mystical aspects of Sarah's  conversion to belief.  This last omission is so glaring that it calls the  entire effort into question.  Why we don't hear  Sarah telling Bendrix  "Love doesn't end just because we don't see each other" or  "People go on loving God all their lives without seeing Him" is  baffling.  Not even one of Sarah's after-death miracles is depicted or even  hinted at.  In the end, this story about a woman's journey from adultery to  sainthood turns out to be little more than a 1950s soap opera--and not so  moving a one at that.  The talented perfomers who labored in this  straightjacket--Deborah Kerr and Van Johnson--deserved better.  So did  Graham Greene enthusiasts and movie-goers in general 
 I'de have never read Vibe in the first place, but i won a free years subscription in some online contest.  And i must also mention i'm a huge fan of hip-hop and hip-hop culture, so i'de think Vibe would be tight.....daamn, was i ever wrong.  First off, half the mag is Advertising....then what little reading there is....it's all bullsh**.  The interviews they have with artists are totally weak & watered down.  They never ask any worthwhile questions.  Vibe also contradicts itself constantly.  In one issue, they'll give an album a low rating & a poor review, then at the end of the year they name that same album one of the years best....what the f***?  Vibe has it's decent moments, but i def. won't be paying for it anytime soon. 
 I didn't make it up- it's on the book jacket. Only a complete dunce would be blind to this tome's innumerable inconsistencies. Tripe. Pure and Simple. You are warned. 
 King certainly lends a high-profile to this collection of latter-day noir writing and tough-guy procedurals, but I believe he created something a little too far outside the readership's expected genre for this series. The setting and characters are recognizable (now trite?) staples of his beloved Maine coast, and he works at bringing their "down east" mannerisms to life with language that rings of "Bert & I" lobstermen. I wasn't particularly caught up in the aged newspapermen's tale of their quest to identify a mysterious dead man found on the local beach. And the ending ... well, um ... the ending is definitely an open-ender. King cleverly covers himself by adding a disclaimer of sorts that the story won't appeal to many readers. Yep. You got that right, Stephen. No gunplay, no boozers, no saucy dames, no double-crosses, no slangy patter, no real satisfaction for me. I suggest Hard Crime afficionados skip this entry and look to some of the heavy-hitters from the past 
 umm how can a so called child of god put out a explict album and play it off as if hes some big christian with that song jesus walks  im sure if jesus was here to see this he would be dissapointed because it seems all that mr west is trin to do is use jesus as a marketing tool to the music its not good at all id advise you to listen to something else anything id rather listen to apples in sterio 
 Read 2 Timothy 4:3-5.  Read Mclaren's book.  Read 2 Timothy 4:3-5 again.  The Word of God is eternal. All else is deception 
 The story is OK, but this book is riddled with technical errors.  A few examples:  Submarine dolphins worn by enlisted personnel are silver, not gold which are worn only by officers.  The captain of the boat (not ship) would not address an enlisted man as "Mr."; that mode of address is reserved for a senior officer to a junior officer.  A yeoman would not be making notations on a navigation chart, as depicted in this book; that is done by quartermasters.  A Tomahawk missile was said to be traveling at 550 mph, or Mach 7; since the speed of sound at sea level is approximately 761 mph (Mach 1), there is something wrong here.  And the list goes on and on to point of distracting this reader from the story.  The author should have had better technical input and proofreading 
 this was the same literature but not the book that was pictured on amazon website.  very old version and took forever to get here 
 This book was not enlighting, alot of the information was out date. The phone numbers to the locations were disconected etc 
 As a child born to the same type of immigrants she bewails in her book, Malkin is a quivering mass of hypocrisy.  She and Annie Coulter would make a great couple 
 I've been strugging for a long time to describe The Decemberists in  one phrase in a way that suited me, but an issue of NME a few months ago beat me to the punch - "Like the Arcade Fire if they were from the Renaissance and rubbish". "...Architect" is a good song, but the rest is, for lack of a better word, ass-water. Avoid this album. Hell, avoid this band. 
 I can't think about any other explanation for this silly, stupid thriller if you want to call it that. I can't believe that the writer is doing so badly. I am most certainly disappointed with this book. In the last couple of years, I think he had lost his steam. Plus, why does he have to come up with 15 books or so a year? Why does he not read his own book before he sends it to the publisher? It's time for me to move on to another writer....  I would advice readers to not to read this book 
 There is nothing here that hasn't been written elsewhere, and better. But the biggest problem is the titular idea that "success is a choice." Hogwash! If success is a choice, why didn't Mr Pitino "choose" to succeed as coach of the Boston Celtics instead of failing miserably? It's abjectly self-serving to win a college championship and then write a huge pat on your own back congratulating yourself on having "chosen" to win. Where is the book after the Celtics fiasco? In point of fact, most of our successes or failures in life are determined by forces completely out of our control. In the words of the old adage, people like Pitino are born on third base and spend their lives thinking they hit a triple. Worse, such an attitude allows the haves to blame the have-nots for their own plight, instead of recognizing the systemic obstacles standing in the way of universal socio-economic enfranchisement 
 I LOVED the first movie...and I'm sad I can't say the same here.  As Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald put it: The worst kind of sequel - the kind that exists only to give you more, more, MORE of what you particularly liked about the first film, without ever justifying its own existence. Indeed, in my view, Dead Man's Chest was just that, and it didn't please me nearly as much as the first.  What the filmmakers did was listen closely to what audiences said about Curse of the Black Pearl. The audience liked the swashbuckling action, the audience like the humor, and of course, the audience L-O-V-E-D Capt. Jack Sparrow. The filmmakers took this feedback and tried to incorporate these things into Dead Man's Chest. Oh boy did they try - way too hard. It shows.  Swashbuckling action? Let's give them a three-way sword fight between the three main characters that lasts twice as long as it should. Swashbuckling action: check.  Humor? Let's bring back Pintel and Regetti, the comic relief of the first movie, and make them a bigger part. We don't have to explain how they got out of jail and why others of Barbossa's crew didn't. We don't have to explain why they both vow to help bring Jack Sparrow back when, in the first movie, they helped maroon him and almost shot him. They're funny, that's what the audience wants. And hey, lets have most of the cast on an island inhabited by cannibals. We can have Jack roasting on a spit, then have it become a shishkabob later. We can have the crew in hanging cages, swinging back and forth and rolling downhill in them. This whole scene of the movie will be utterly pointless, but it give them the laughs they want. Humor: check.  Jack Sparrow? We'll have plenty of him, but just doing these silly loony toon-like stunts. Not putting him in different critical situations that display his cunning and convincing negotiation skills and his quick-thinking. And what of the central threatening situation? Whether it was escaping from a sinking dory or fighting a ferocious battle with his former first mate or facing death by hanging, Jack was always calm, cool, and collected. Not this time. So what if it goes against him (as one filmmaker said himself) always believing that if he can just hang on long enough, that everything will eventually turn in his favor. Make him visibly afraid. Make him panic at the sight of a black spot on his hand. Make him cringe at the first sight of Davy Jones. Yes, Jack Sparrow's mannerism will be a bit different this time, but its Johnny Depp in the same pirate costume - it should satisfy the audience. Jack Sparrow: check.  But what of the other things that make a film good? Things like, say, a story? Aware that the film did need a tale to tell, the filmmakers decided the "plot" of Dead Man's Chest would be four individual dilemmas thrown clumsily together: Cutler Beckett wants Jack Sparrow's compass (why? we'll have to wait for the 3rd movie to find out), Norrington seeks to restore his now-shattered career to it's previous glory, Will and Elizabeth must get Beckett what he wants in order to escape the hangman's noose, and Jack Sparrow attempts to weasel out of a 13-year-old bargain made with Davy Jones. What does this all come down to? Only one character accomplishes what he/she set out to do in the whole 2.5 hours. Norrington brought Davy Jones' heart to Beckett - but Will had to steal the key from Jones first. That's the only thing that actually gets DONE in the movie. How could that have taken 2.5 hours to do? It didn't. Then what filled up the extra time? The pointless stuff I mentioned above. As Ty Burr of the Boston Globe put it: It goes absolutely nowhere and takes 2.5 hours to get there.  I'm not someone whom filmmakers can show three men sword-fighting and a group of savage cannibals chasing someone down a beach and expect me to be impressed. There needs to be a point, something to it all. As Dana Steven of Slate put it: Without a beating heart at its center, this chest feels empty indeed. One star for effort...and for Davy Jones' creative design (tentacles for a beard, nice) 
 I didn't like it, I was looking for some profound thoughts to be spilled into my lap but I didn't get them.  I am not sure if in the time that it was written it was completely out of the ordinary with its contraversial "philosophy" but I didnt get much out of it.  It seemed to be steared towards a more self loathing, unhappy and hermit crowd. I prefer something more thought provoking and honestly different.  But maybe I missed a lot, I was almost falling asleep through most of it. 
 I was willing to put up with this endless series and its hundreds of characters and the possession by the dead angle because I thought the future depicted in this epic was interesting and rather inspiring. That is until the author decided it was time to throw out the obligatory jab at the country of my birth... Early on in this incoherent continuation of The Reality Dysfunction he writes something to the effect of "He was actually born in the United States of America, a fact that no one wanted to admit then or ever for the matter"  What would possess Hamilton to write such garbage? Was it necessary to the telling of the story? Honestly, I put the book down and will not be finishing it or any other Hamilton work - ever. I don't need that. There are plenty of fine sci-fi authors out there. I'm sorry, it just absolutely turned me off. Call me over sensitive and reactionary, but I couldn't get past it, what's next, is Father Horst going to start buggering the little children in this book - I mean he is Catholic isn't he? We all know the only thing worst than being an American is being Catholic, oh wait, I forgot about Microsoft... And Coca-Cola 
 This book for the lack of a better word was cheesy. I read my first Danielle Steel book a few weeks ago (Malice) and was really impressed. I decided to grab another thinking it would be good as well. This book was slow and the brokenhearted story line dragged on forever. On top of that the main character was such a whiney complainer and that I couldn't stand even reading about him. This book was bad and extremely predictable. BIG DISSAPOINTMENT 
 Great idea for a story - but just an "ok" book that could have been so much better 
 This was horrible, I installed this and within a 24 hour period, I was slammed with pop-ups and SPAM....And good luck trying to remove it.  Very dissatisfied customer 
 This book tries to asses Islamic identity to non believers and tries to show the relations between Islam and Secularism which are not exist in either. To me, some truths have been modified to fit into a category. I do not think this book worth of buying for 50 bucks 
 I have always been suspicious of books that seem to spring from the author's need to settle a grudge against a person or organization.  This book reminds me why.  Its somewhat shrill and patently one-sided arguments do not do justice to the subject at hand.  While I'm sure that there are kernels of truth in this account, I believe that the topic would be best served by a more objective approach 
 An interesting thing happens when people write memoirs of terrible things that happened to them: readers are afraid to say anything bad about the books themselves, because it looks like they're being unsympathetic towards the tragedies described. I felt for Dani Shapiro when her father died, but without that incident, this reads like the work of a self-obsessed rich b*tch who epitomizes solopsism: nothing in the world matters to her but her own experience and what people think of her. It is very important, by the way, that you think she is beautiful, as she reminds you constantly throughout the book. That, to me, is the quality of someone who hasn't quite worked out her own problems--someone who is sadly aware of how she acts and says and what you think of her as a result--and someone who is probably not completely honest with you, dear reader, because the ugly parts of her--the ones for which you won't feel sorry for her--are most likely omitted 
 Tiresome, repetitive sexual descriptions, no character development, unexplained events, no plot, very little humor.  Ten years ago, Hamilton was doing interesting work, exploring some moral issues, having some character development, and humor.  Now both the Blake and Gentry series are predicable and sex obsessed 
 The author divides the books into sections by elements--good enough for organization of material.  She provides lists of correspondences.  Fine, could be useful.  What it does not do is provide any real information.  We get a lot of watered-down fantasy novel-style "vision quests" or "seekings," encounters the author alleges to have experienced.  These "experiences" form the bulk (and I do mean bulk) of the book.  Apparently, one is supposed to envision one's self in the author's role.  There is no explanation given for the structure of these pathworkings (the kindest thing I can call them), which are interspersed with commentary about the author's "Native American family."  (She claims to have been adopted into a Native American clan.)  She makes many references to possible Native American teachings, but offers no source material, how to seek out further information about topics she urges readers to explore more fully.  The terminology she uses is just authentic-enough to sound legitimate, but so vague they reveal nothing.  (An example:  the examination of a crystal the author has on a staff.  A tribal elder who is apparently one of her teachers examines it and gravely announces it used to be a Grandfather crystal.  So what, exactly, is a Grandfather crystal, and why is it mounted in a Wiccan-style staff?  With runes, no less.)  Even more suspiciously, many of her "Native American teachings" sound like something out of a Hollywood script than anything one might imagine being part of an actual oral tribal tradition, passed down from shaman to student.  Lastly, there are pages and pages of meaningless diagrams and a list of colored "rays" that will bring all kinds of good things into one's life if one meditates on them.  The entire book reads like a Wiccan primer with a glaze of pseudo-Native American spirituality as seen by Caucasians.  I have read other books on shamanism, and many stress their adoptive connections to the parent culture.  (A good experience for them if it actually happened, but one can hardly expect readersto stampede over and demand adoption.)  And yet this information, supposedly kept within these families and tribes for centuries, is now being set out in print for the mass consumption of the reading public.  Well, what was the point of being 'adopted'?  If these 'adoptive families' wanted this information public, wouldn't they have written a book themselves?  Some of the more honest books on shamanism admit they are witholding certain information because some knowledge *should* be kept 'in the family'.  They openly say they are creating something for use by people living in the modern age.  Wolfe has done none of this. Waste of time to read.  Waste of space on my bookshelf.  Waste of trees to print it.  Waste of *plastic* for the bag I carried it home in.  I'd be embarrassed to even turn this thing to a used bookstore for credit. 
 Those looking for a wife in Russia, here is word of advise to you. I know many man who went to Russia and ukraine looking for woman. Few of them have a happy marriage. Most (I didn't said all) men go there to find woman will not have a good marriage for several reasons, 1. Some men are pigs and going to find a woman in other country is an escape. They should change the way they treat woman. I know many Russian woman who had to flee from their American husbands. 2. Some American man will be deceived by Russian woman and think they getting into lasting relationships while woman want to get to US to get a permanent residency. Especially when age difference is more that 10 years. Why younger woman would mary much older man? Money and opportiunity most of the time.  I know christian man who was looking for a bride in post USSR country. He was in his 50's. Very religious man. But when it came to relationships, he is looking at 20- 30 year old woman. They (women) were disgusted just to think of being with him.  The are other guys who went to Russia. They were sitting on a curb in front of University. They weren't shaved and didn't look appealing. They would pick a beatifull young girl and would try to start conversation. Young ladies wouldn't even pay attention. Then old drunk lady came by and start talking to these american guys. And that's who would entertain these men. Russians don't sit on a flor and only drunkards sit on a curb. I think anybody who says that Russian woman better than American has never digged deep in the U.S.A. There are also many Russian woman who stuck up. How will you, comming from a different country will find out what is gold and what is not? Go there, learn the culture, language, live there for 10 years and then you might be qualified to mary Russian lady.  I'm sick of a man who goes to other countries for the purpose of marying someone just because they see problem with woman in their own country. These man has a problem that they need to deal with before they can have any relationships. They need therapy, counceling, they are bossy and they are the ones who stuck up. They need to learn how Jesus treats the church and even died for it. Will you give up your live for the one you love? Or you only interested to satisfy your selfish desires 
 Ok I bought this as the download version instead of the cassette because I thought I was buying the version that alan rickman reads. instead there is this awful robotic voice that you can hardly understand. I've read the book myself before and loved it and figured it would be that much more incredible hearing it read by someone with a brilliant voice but I was of course mistaken in thinking this was it. Buy the cassette version and don't waste your money on this download 
 Another reviewer called this CD "a shadow of what might have been". That is perfectly stated. Far from a die-hard Mannheim fan, I acknowledge Davis's frequent mastery of instrumentation. Perhaps it was my own expectations that led me to hope that there would be a better-than-average payoff between Davis & this genre. Despite a great deal of snobby classical music in my own background, I am not opposed to remakes when they add a new dimention or showcase a subtlty that has, heretofore, been overlooked. This effort doesn't even qualify for decent, party background music. Just when I thought, well, maybe I can play it at the teenage Halloween party for my niece (many selections have a reliable bass rhythm) out comes his version of The Sorcerer's Apprentice -- zero logic. Clearly this was just a cash cow attempt at capitalizing on the holiday 
 It won't let you print...  In other words, you have to be in front of a computer to read this book (I know it is an e-book, but it would be nice to be able to print out a few pages to read at the doctor's office or on the plane).  In additon, the layout is incomplete, there are no items associated with the index topics, the pictures are slow to load, and look third rate, etc.  Another little problem is that the book can only ever be read from two computers.  I travel for work, so I am "stuck" with the first two computers I read it on.    I am really dissapointed, and I will be contacting amazon regarding a refund 
 Should you be afraid of your microwave oven? This book discusses that non-issue for several paragraphs, before concluding that no, you probably shouldn't be afraid of your microwave. That embodies what's wrong with this book. It pretends to be reassuring while actually planting a bunch of paranoid ideas. It also assumes that you, the reader, are the mother-to-be, while having very little to say to your partner, in a way that I find subtly sexist. Overall, it has plenty to make you extra-worried. For instance, it advises posting pictures of healthy babies all around your house (on the door, in the kitchen, on the bathroom mirror, really, all around your house), in order to continually remind yourself to eat a very rigid diet -- as if the bump in your belly wasn't already making you worry quite enough. If you think that it would be helpful to post a nagging sign on your front-door to ask you daily, "Have you fed your baby breakfast today?" then you may like this book.   Personally, I found that _What to Expext_ left me alarmed about microwaves & air pollution & ambient noise & even exercise in ways that were not helpful. For a book so full of information, it also, curiously, failed to address any of my specific questions. How soon should I begin taking folic acid or other prenatal vitamins: as soon as I start trying to get pregnant, or only after the pregnancy-test comes back positive? Is there anything I can do to increase my odds of getting pregnant? What are those odds, anyway, for a woman my age? These seemed like reasonable questions to me, but to find answers, I had to look in the far-more-helpful book by Ann Douglas, _The Mother of All Pregnancy Books_ -- which also features a nifty week-by-week what's-happening-inside-your-body chart that I love. The other book I highly recommend is Armin Brott's _The Expectant Father_, which has terrific & reasonable advice you won't find elsewhere. By those two, not this one. 
 As usual, the atrophied intellect that is Allan Bloom successfully attempts to rape a classic piece of philosophy with his mediocre, lackluster, ogrish brutality, which is his norm, towards true academia, knowledge and wisdom. If Rush Limbaugh re-wrote the Constitution you'd get an idea of the ruse that masks itself analogous to Mr. Bloom's feebility towards writing and thought contained within this boorish tome.  If you just want to read the Republic as it was intended, to the best of our Anglo-Franco-Germanic understanding of the last two centuries, steer far clear of Mr. Bloom's literary abortion within these pages.   If you further care of preserving your ability to reason, unfiltered and unprejudicially, I suggest looking into Mr. Bloom's history and agenda towards the upheaval of education, truth and attitude(s) toward integrity and intellectually honest liberty before considering wasting your hard earned currency on his insidiously dishonest dribble 
 I definitely bought this thinking it was like the first edition which I had bought several years ago and which got stolen.  Now, I don't remember the first edition being ANYTHING like this.  All this has is a bunch of examples of what "famous" musicians' mixes look like.  It totally OVERDOES the colored spheres bit and there are large "Comment Boxes" with information that is neither useful NOR informative.  Makes many references to 808 Boom, which is most like the Roland TR-808 drum machine, the boomy sustaining kick drum of which is used in a a lot of rap and hip hop music.  I think the first edition was a more professional book aimed at SERIOUS mixing engineers, whereas the second edition only shows us what Christina Aguilera and other cheesy artists use as their mix.  I am totally disappointed.  The first edition, on the other hand, is very informative, uses the illustrations with the colored orbs positioning in the 3D sound field effectively, and I must say DID help me improve the quality of my mixes.  The second edition just LACKS ALL OVER what the first edition had.  What a terrible way to try to boost sales, i.e., delete all professional material and insert material that appears to teeny-boppers who know nothing about music.  What a letdown 
 I love the movie "One Eyed Jacks." I've seen it a dozen or more times, and had the good fortune to attend a screening in 1972 with the composer, who provided a lot of insight into the film's making, post production and history (none of his stories or anecdotes are included here).  I therefore had great anticipation for this book.  It turns out, the book is basically a padded-out excuse for the author to include a portion of his own unfinished western screenplay, as if anyone would care, and to vent about the critics that gave the film bad reviews.  The amount of information actually about the film would fill less than a chapter of a normal sized book, and this is NOT a normal sized book -- it's a slight whisp of a book, with double spaced type and lots of blank space.  There's not much new or unique in here about "One Eyed Jacks" that you haven't seen in a decent biography of Brando, Peckinpah or Kubrick.  So save your money and save your time -- this book is a waste of both. 
     Fullbrook(F)has edited a collection of essays written by a group of heterodox economists belonging to the American Post Keynesian,Institutionalist,and Cambridge Keynesian schools of thought.Underlying most of the essays is the explicit or implicit belief that the use of formal mathematical and statistical tools by mainstream(neoclassical)economists has been counterproductive because the models used by such economists are not relevant to the real world.I will concentrate my review on Part V of the book,titled"Misuse of Mathematics and Statistics".First,there are a number of problems with the way in which particular mathematical and statistical techniques are used and applied(misused and misapplied)by mainstream(neoclassical)economists.Both J M Keynes and Benoit Mandelbrot pointed out that mathematical modeling in economics must allow for interdependencies,multiple equilibria,and feedback effects,while statistical applications to economics(econometrics)must first concentrate on the analysis of the data.An example would be to use a chi-square or Lexis-Q test for goodness of fit instead of just  assuming  that the normal(lognormal,binomial,etc.) distribution can be applied.Unfortunately,the essays by S.Keen and D.Gillies on mathematical economics and the essay by S.Ziliak on economic statistics and econometrics contain many unsupported claims,as well as errors of omission, that have little,if anything,to do with the attempts made by  Keynes and Mandelbrot to convince economists to be much more careful and selective in their initial use of particular techniques .Ziliak(and his frequent coauthor, D.N. McCloskey)fails to realize that the problem facing econometricians is much,much more severe than just the apparent failure of most econometricians to  successfully differentiate between the concepts of statistical significance and economic significance.The problem is that econometric practice is founded on the a priori belief that practically all analysis of economic data can be based on the assumption of normality.In fact,the reverse is the case.In general,the normal probability distribution does not come close to being a correct statistical approximation of most economic data.This was the major point made by Keynes in his 1939-40 exchange with Tinbergen on the logical foundations of econometrics.It has been one of the major points made by Mandelbrot since the mid 1950's.Nowhere in Ziliak's essay will the reader get these points because neither Keynes nor Mandelbrot are mentioned anywhere.Gillies' article is marred by his failure to point out that the mathematics of field theory,electron spin theory,string theory and super string theory in mathematical physics ,like much of neoclassical economics,has little or no empirical and/or experimental support now or even in the distant future.Gillies' claim that Keynes's footnote on p.280 of the General Theory meant that the mathematical analysis in chapter 20 could be ignored  reveals Gillies' mathematical innumeracy and ineptness,since this chapter provides the mathematical proof of Keynes's claim that stable unemployment equilibriums, with associated involuntary unemployment levels,could occur due to the multiple equilibrium nature of capitalist economies.Of course,Keynes had explicitly provided his readers in chapter 19,pp.261-262,with the major result of his theory,that only in the case of a marginal propensity to spend with a value of 1(or if the mpc+mpi=1=mpc+mps,where the mpc is the marginal propensity to consume,mpi is the marginal propensity to invest,and mps is the marginal propensity to save)will a full employment equilibrium occur.Chapters 20 and 21 provide the interested reader with the formal mathematical derivation of the result stated by Keynes in chapter 19.Keynes successfully generalized neoclassical theory in chapters 20 and 21.Hence the footnote at the bottom of p.280.A reader who is not interested in the manner in which Keynes derived his result can skip this part of the chapter.In conclusion,Gillies' claim that the General Theory is a qualitative theory without any mathematical foundation is simply false(Gillies,p.197).Keynes's general theory is specified by the condition that w/p=mpl/(mpc+mpi),where w/p = the real wage.Keen's article claims that the theory of the perfectly competitive firm is based on a mathematical error.This claim is simply false.The theory is based on the subjective assumption by the owner of such a firm that it is impossible for him to raise or lower his price.Given this assumption,the firm's demand curve will appear as a horizontal line,which is the only way you can economically model such a firm.The conclusion is that he will receive the same price for different amounts of his output.Only after the basic economic assumptions have been specified will a mathematical representation consistent with the economic assumptions be supplied.The best exposition is in the third edition of C E Ferguson,1972,Microeconomic Theory,pp.123-124,251-253.Section 8.4,pp.255-270.Keen is correct that the 1957 article by Stigler in the Journal of Political Economy contains a mathematical error.Ferguson was well aware of this article(see Ferguson,1972,p.317).He correctly ignores Stigler's attempt to provide a purely mathematical foundation for the perfectly competitive firm without first specifying the economic assumptions that must go first.What is wrong with economics is the failure of the economics profession to grasp the mathematical proof that Keynes constructed in the GeneralTheory in chapters 20 and 21 or comprehend the optimality condition spelt out by Keynes on pp.261-262 of the General Theory. None of the authors in this book have the slightest clue about what Keynes did.It is better to go and buy a copy of the General Theory than purchase this book in its current form 
 I see all the people here like this book, but I don't get why.  The first half is unpleasant though intriguing.  Styron seems to think it is interesting for characters to rant eccentrically about whatever is on their mind, but I would disagree, and I soon started skipping all rants.  The story is intriguing, and for a while the book was kind of interesting, as we see the naive narrator come to see the truth of his pretentious friend.  Half way through, the book becomes fairly unreadable as it changes focus to a different character.  This begins with an entire chapter of the sort of rant that I found so unpleasant, and then proceeds through a tedious accounting of an unpleasant and dull tortured artist type.  I tried reading this for a while but it was so annoying that I just skimmed the second half to see how everything was tied up, which it was in a perfunctory fashion.  I suppose this is good for Styron fans.  I've never read any of his books before and certainly never will again 
 You get more indepth information reading the help files in a 3d program.  Save your money.  Also, someone reviewed it twice and gave it 5 stars, How bogus.  Price for the book is ridiculous.   BAD 
 The original story was one of wonder and terror.  This version is mostly wonder, where the good stuff from the novel went.  Where is the arena, or the silent and unmoving gods, or the end of the universe?   This is only the monster story of the attack of the swine things.  Yeah, the swine things are important, but they are NOT the most important part of this wonderful short novel.  Unless you are a real comics fanatic, or hate the writing of Hodgson, don't bother with this rip off.  It's okay for what it does, but compared to the original novel, this is a couple of mentally retarded children drawing scary pictures 
 I can't believe the audacity of Brad Steiger. It takes a lot of nerve, or very little honor, to publish a tome of obviously fake photos and ho-hum ghost stories that were admittedly lifted off various Internet sites.   Steiger has little respect for his sources: He rewrites their testimony into his own words, so that every single story and anecdote sounds the same. Not only that, but several phrases are used over and over--I lost count of how many times he spells out his wife's entire name instead of merely referring to her as "my wife" or "Sherry."   It's also frustrating reading about some spectacular photo his wife took, or that was given to him, that shows clearly some spectral phenomenon or UFO--and the photo isn't anywhere in the book. The photos that do appear are of the tired and debunked ilk of orbs, double-exposure photos, even one photo of a paper cutout head GLUED to someone's shoulder!   The only thing scary about this book is that it's supernaturally LAME 
 Unlike the Forge of God which really kept me on the edge of my seat, and had me caught up in the emotions of the horrifying ending, this left me cold. I could not relate to the characters at all and the plot was disconected at best 
 The author seems to have the need to applogize for the things he did as a rookie cop.  Sounds like a corrupt jerk that did not have the balls to be what any good LA cop is, HONEST!  This book is an uneducated joke of a look at actual police work in LA.  If the author feels so bad about the things he did, he needs to go down to the DA's office and tell them about it, or did he write it when the statute of limitations ran out.  You tarnish the badge for every good LA cop out there, just another whiny jerk that did not have any real respect on the street and within the divisions, no one I know knows this guy.  Must have worked West Valley.  Shame on you!  
 All the .hack games are short -- very short.  So why get the strategy guide?  Because "The World", where most of the plot in the game comes from, is vast.  So vast that a strategy guide 4 time this size might be able to hold all the maps, items and everything.  So why is it missing so much?  Because it focuses on only the plot related zones and boasts that it has a "secret" zone.  The fact is the combination of servers and keywords is unfathomable!  And after the end of the game, every last one should be available.  You might as the question, why would I want to go back to level 3 zones?  Well, for completionists, that is very important because the Ryu Books of 1000 log so very much, and most importantly, how many zones you have completed (unlocked all the monster portals).    Perhaps I have just been spoiled by books like Star Ocean's strategy guide, but I find this guide to be a joke, because much more "complete" information about .hack is available online for FREE! 
 I picked up this book expecting a nice, enjoyable historical fiction- what a dissapointment! If I had such a depraved mind I would certainly not advertise it.  This book is certainly not one to keep around if you have young children who are readers 
 No doubt the 4th turning was a refreshing revelation.  And the more dated predecessor Generations was a great secondary read.  From that I gathered there was a sort of synergistic relationship with each skipped generation.  Boomers relating to GI generation and Silent relating to the 13th generation, simply stated, a reciprocating bond of grandparents and their grandchildren.  Parents sure didn't like the antics and conduct of their children but they sure love those amazing grandchildren .  So it all makes sense that we get this tertiary and purely subjective read from Howe about what essentially are his darling grandchildren.  When I read about students turning in their teachers for espousing their pollitcal viewpoints I think millennial.  When I read about the yet to be calculated damages of Thimerosol in vaccines introduced in the 90's I think millennial.  Add ritalin and a V chip in the back of the neck and you get the ideal personae of a denizen of Huxley's Brave New World.  
 The Pet Shop Boys can no longer truthfully sing, "we were never being boring."  This is a very disappointing, very lifeless, attempt at being "adult" and topical.  When once they sang "How do you expect to be taken seriously?" mocking pompous artistes who assaulted audiences with a politically-correct "message," so now have the Pet Shops succumbed.  "I'm with Stupid" is such a brilliant and original insight to Blair/Bush partnership (not).  Even Tennant sounds bored and uninvolved singing the glaringly obvious "Sodom and Gomorrah Show," which is "It's a Sin" without the cleverness, the wordplay, the pop hooks and the drama.  Essentially, it's just anti-religious theme tied to a disco beat.  If you must have this record because you're a Pet Shop complete collectionist, get the extended version, which includes a few pure Pet Shop dance tracks that were not included on the basic version.  But do this only if you must 
 I would have preferred a text that merely reported employers' compliance obligations in an objective manner, rather than portraying employers as the enemy.  I generally found the text to be highly politicized and, to some extent, anti-management.  This book does little to bridge the gap between the business community and academia 
 After reading Robert Caro's masterful biographies (Volumes 1 and 2) of LBJ, I yearned to learn more about the background of Lady Bird--specifically what contributed to her not only staying married to LBJ but to singlemindedly propelling his career forward.  Well, Russell's book certainly disappoints.  It is very poorly and awkwardly written and edited.  The only new information that I gleaned from this book was gossipy.  If one  wishes to learn substantive information about Lady Bird (and of course about LBJ), Caro's biographies are a far superior source 
 I was looking forward to the issuance of this set because I remembered the Cavett interviews as insightful. However, what the set showed me was how inaccurate memory can be. Cavett was the darling of the "intellectual" set because, to his credit, he was interested and willing to give his guests more time than to just promote something. But what the interview set showed me was how really terrible Cavett was as an interviewer. When the guest was talkative, like Hepburn or Brooks, the shows were a delight, but when the guests were more reticent, like Hitchcock or Mitchum, then its almost worthless watching. Nothing new is revealed. In truth, Cavett was decent and an apparently nice man, but he doesn't really know how to open up his guests. The thrill here is that he had these guests for an extended time and since all, except for Brooks, are no longer with us, they do have some value. The other thing these interviews showed me was that Charlie Rose is a much better interviewer, although he has his own problem in not knowing when to shut up. I'm not really sure I'd recommend this set to anyone 
 This book was awful.  I read "The Sugar Addict's Total Recovery Program" (DesMaisons) first, and I was spoiled by more rational, documented approach to the subject.  To be fair, I only got through the first part of this book before I put it down in disgust.  This book is the rantings of someone who feels passionately about something.  Great.  Now back it up.  You can't just  say, "This is bad and you have to do this!"  Well... I suppose you can.  But in my opinion that makes for a lousy book for someone who is trying to learn and separate fact from hysteria 
 I rented this thinking it was an Audrey Tautou flick, but it isn't.  She's front-and-center on the cover line-up, but she's only in a few scenes.  That isn't the real reason why I think that this movie is so-so.  There really isn't much in this movie that I haven't seen done elsewhere.  I kept thinking that I've seen other movies do this or that better.  Then again, I've seen a lot of foreign and independant films, so I've gotten a bit picky at times. Nothing was really clever or memmorable about this one.  It's a mediocre flick, I don't know why it got rave reviews.  I remember seeing the DVD in a sale bin at a discount store for $5 but I thought it would be a waste, because seeing it once was enough and I don't feel like I'll ever need to see it again 
 If you just want to learn =about= self-employed people, this is a good book. If you want to learn =how= to become successfully self-employed, save your money. There are too many other books that will be truly helpful, such as Get Clients Now!, The Well-Fed Writer, and InfoGuru Marketing 
 Douglas as Van Gogh was a reincarnation of the artist himself. Van Gogh was an eccentric and tormented soul.  Douglas manifested all the elements needed to descibe and fullfill the artist's message.  Like all the great artists, Modiliani, Gauguin and Van Gogh were haunted by the demons of their past, which inevitably lead to their self destruction.  An excellent film to all, not just art historians 
 After much window shopping (research) I bought this chair two weeks ago and yesterday the thing fell apart while I was leaning back and watching a movie on my comp.  Here is the problem, the back support is connected to the seat only by the two handle bars which are made of plastic. While I was leaning back, one of the handles literally cracked open at the junctions where the bottom (right side) two screws are. I fell back wards head first but luckily, my floor is carpetted and I did not hurt myself that much.   The manufacturer rates this chair as big and tall (upto 250 pounds) and for 5 hours of daily usage. I weigh around 210 and I had been sitting on it for less than an hour when the incident happened.  I am surely hoping to get my money back but the rest of you big and tall people beware 
 Look if you want a book to kind a good charicter who is serious this is not the book. But if you are looking for a comedic monologue this is your book 
 I am completely befuddled that anyone with any love for the book could enjoy this movie. It is merely a monument to Hollywood's stunning inability to read or to understand the simplest moral tale. In Dumas's book the Count learns that he cannot play God--dispensing punishments to the evil and rewards to the good--because of the complex ways in which the wheat and the tares are intertwined in this earthly life. He abandons his project of perfectly just revenge and accepts a new love as a gift from a mysteriously merciful God.  Hollywood gives us instead: Triumphant Revenge. 
 Ad hominem is a logical fallacy, you say?  That sounds like something a sexually deviant, financially-incompetent intellectual would say 
 No way to change the inputs on your TV. The DVD functions and the TV functions are accessed alternatly by pressing a "tv" button but there is no way to tell which the romote is aligned to. Therefore when you press the power button you have no idea which you will be powering on/off, the TV or the XBox. And if things couldn't get any dumber, if you press the eject button while the remote is in TV mode it doesn't work. The eject button is only designed to work with the XBox yet it is disabled when in TV mode?  There is also no option to program a receiver.  As many others mentioned, this remote looks nice but the people who designed it must have been drunk. Do not buy this remote unless you like wasting your money on garbage 
 I live in the UK and Amazon doesn't allow me to download ANY off the NCIS shows. This service should be open to all amazon users......!!!!!! 
 Let me first say that I am an unlikely reviewer to be so hostile to this type of book; I am extremely committed to healthy food choices, environmentally sound policies, and all the basic values Gary Null ostensibly embraces.  I have no problem with Null's basic premise that we should consume a fresh, non-processed, plant-based diet(although some studies have concluded that those who supplement their food with some fish and dairy products are healthier), buy organic food when at all possible, and avoid toxic household products.  But I am totally outraged by Gary Null's voodoo nutrition approach to these legitimate issues.  I bought the book and promptly returned it because it was so filled with woozy-new age drivel and devoid of reliable references to support the more controversial points.  We don't need any more evidence that a plant-based diet low in trans-fats is healthier than eating at McDonalds.  This book adds NOTHING legitimate to the basic health information you can obtain from any reliable print or internet source, and is far inferior to, for instance, "The Food Pharmacy" by Jean Carper, in which virtually every statement of fact is supported by one or more scientific references.  Save your money and buy some nice fresh organic produce 
 This book is in three parts.  In the first part tells we meet Miyax on the Arctic tundra after running away from her marriage.  We find that she is only thirteen years old, and is going to meet a friend in San Francisco.  Miyax has run out of provisions for her trip, and realizes that she is lost.  She decides to join a wolf pack to survive, so she studies their behavior and imitates it.  She is accepted, and is able to care for herself.  She also recognizes birds and, knowing their migration habits, is able to discern her location and direction.    The second part tells Miyax's life before part one.  It tells of her father, Kapugen, and how he sent her to live with his aunt Martha and go to school, where she is called Julie.  One day Aunt Martha told Miyax that her father had never returned from a hunting trip, and pieces of his kayak were found on the shore.  Kapugen had arranged a marriage between Miyax and the son of one of his old friends.  When she met Daniel, she was disappointed to realize that he was mentally slow.  After she was married, she basically became a helper to Daniel's mother in her business of making parkas to sell to tourists.  One day Daniel came home angry because others were taunting him with "having a wife and not knowing how to mate her."  Miyax ran away in fear that night.    Part three goes back to being lost on the tundra.  Miyax grows to love her wolf pack, and looks to the leader as her father.  When she sees him killed for sport, she decides not to head to San Francisco where people do not recognize the value of the old Eskimo ways.  She chooses to live alone in the wild, until she meets some people who tell her that her father is not dead.  She goes to find him, but thinks that he has forsaken the Eskimo ways, and is part of the kind of people that would kill her wolf father for sport.  In the end of the book, she sees that maybe the time of the Eskimos is past, and returns to her father.    I didn't care for this book too much, probably because it reminded me of Scott O'Dell's "The Island of the Blue Dolphins."  Then I realized that the same author wrote "My Side of the Mountain" which is the same kind of survival story.  It didn't seem to have all that much of a plot, and I didn't care for the part about Miyax's marriage, or the way she identified with the wolves.  I think it's because we as people are social creatures, designed to live with each other, not alone in isolation from other people.  We desire to have companions, and although dogs or other animals may be man's best friend, and solitude is necessary at times, it is hard for me to connect with a book like this.   
 Purchased 2 pairs for my 8 & 9 year old daughters for Christmas. The shoes are made of cheap pieces of plastic. The box includes bunches of black, elastic bands that you need to really s-t-r-e-t-c-h onto the shoes to provide the "bounce". The more your child  weighs, the more bands you use, but you have to double or triple them onto the same hooks. They are very hard to install and could be dangerous if they snap back into your face while you are installing them. Once assembled, the kids played with them for about 10 minutes before becoming bored. They haven't played with them since. Don't waste your money 
 Admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it's moments of entertainment, BUT overall it's long and pretty boring.  It seems it would have been better suited as a play, which apparently it was originally.  I had just finished re-reading Romeo and Juliet when I rented this, thinking I was still in a Shakespeare mood, but this didn't do it for me.  I suppose if I had just finished reading or watching Hamlet, it would have been better.  My favorite parts are Oldman's silent scientific discoveries, completely amusing.  Couldn't wait for the movie to end, honestly 
 Because many people here seem to have this other faith called Calvinism.  I find it very interesting. Piper and company as well as many others have criticized open theism by expressing thoughts that open theists simply do not have. Despite this, they exclaim how their arguments tear down any open theist arguments. How can that be if you are not talking about the same thing.  For the record: Open theists believe and affirm:  1) That God is divinely perfect, including omnipotence and omniscience (all knowing).  2) That God is the sovereign creator and lord  3) That God is all powerful   and many other beliefs that we all know to be true as stated by the Bible.  If your arguments against open theism are any of these, then you are wasting your time. That is unless your goal is to misrepresent other people.     "Not a very Christian tactic to use, in my humble opinion". I am editing this out because this is not a very Christian thing for me to say myself.  John Lancaster, I forgive you 
 This book is almost all text.  It merely describes six sigma on a very high level; it but never shows you how to apply six sigma methods to software.  It has no specific "how" examples.  Rather, it has elementary tips on software engineering that any software engineer who's been in the field already knows about.  It is too high level.  It's a very disappointing book.  I do not recommend this book even to begineers in software engineering 
 I wish I came here first before allowing my 5 yr old daughter to save and buy this movie, we own the original (non 3D version) and she knew the 3D version was the same movie but was excited about the 3D aspect and the commercial rums every 15 mins here so she asked if she could get it.    We made a chore chart and started saving and mom and dad pitched in half, (at least we had some learning involved with the chore chart), finally got up the money to go buy the 3D version, got home turned off lights put on glasses even made popcorn, Mom Dad Daughter, then we realized Bibble pops on and says take glasses OFF after a few mins of intro 3D?  15 mins goes by no 3d then you are told put glasses ON again etc, overall this movie contains about 10-15 mins total of 3D and most of it NOT in parts you would even WANT to see 3D action...  Needless to say having already bought the first release, even knowing this would be the same movie but buying it for the 3D feature, it falls short bigtime due to the LACK of 3D in the movie.  Buy the original it's better, and it IS a good movie!  Just having kids take off the 3D glasses 5+ times per showing (expecting them to hold them I guess?) for 15-20 mins at a time between the 2-3 min 3D segments is just asking for broken paper 3D glasses and leads to an overall DUD of a supposed 3D release 
 THE STORY OF O attempts to defy the wisdom of the 10 Commandments of Hot Movies and fails.  I won't bore you with all of the Commandments, just #7 "Thou shalt not make a hot movie with an entire cast of non-hot actors."  Shot in that hazy sometimes dreamy kind of way that I dislike TSOO is about a rich guy who sends his girlfriend to a mansion where unattractive masters train unattractive slaves how to be obedient.  After graduation the rich guy loses his woman to his older, much older, step-brother.  Other stuff happens (banging, branding, eating, talking, talking, talking, whipping), but it's all unimportant and not hot 
 The book pretty much presents itself the opposite of what it claims to be about. How can you just expect teenagers to avoid the dangers if you don't allow them to be well educated about it. Remember the "Just say no" program that was supposed to bring down drug addiction? Well, telling teenagers simply not to do it only encouraged more of the same and it's certainly no different when it comes to sex. No wonder the Bible belt has higher cases of teen pregnancy for following Dobson's pathetic advice whereas the West coast and the Northeast have far lower numbers and percentages of teen pregnancy by providing sex education to students. If you're going to read this book, be warned that the author is just another rightwing special interest hack 
 Thomas's work is one of magnificent writing. His pen traces the details of cells with accuracy only surpassed by an electron microscope. Unfortunately, his precision with words and insightful description does not censure criticism of his conclusions. Largely liberal and at times extremely ethereal, Thomas's inferences from observations into society at large and human behavior are largely unfounded or simply appear as ranting. While other writers may be guilty of the same transgression, Thomas couches his commentary behind the mask of biology and below the reader's scanning objective on their microscope of reading. At a glance, Lewis Thomas weaves a wonderous fusion of biology and artistic literature, but the merit of The Lives of a Cell ends at this superficial level of reading. An excellent work of biology and literature, but a work lacking in logical conclusions, The Lives of a Cell provides an excellent introduction to interesting biological facts and theories, but falls short of endowing the reader with much in the way of critical insight into the portent of his descriptions and when he attempts to do so, errs in favor of sophistry 
 Disappointed. As an English teacher, I expected a more compelling and less hokey use of Whitman.  The first story, of the deformed Whitman loving boy, was utterly unbelievable and the continuity was incredibly challenging 
 Really small book, but a great gift for those midgets in your life 
 This is probably the most accurate version of "A Tale Of Two Cities" but, it's the worst version to own or watch. Sticking strickly to the plot of the story and historical facts this movie has no spark or passion. It's an easy out though for the teens to lazy to read the book for English.   The movie is extremely long which is part of the problem and the acting is horribly done.I found myself straining to stay awake. The script is something out of the Middle Ages with no modern word adaptations it's hard to imagine any of the characters are "real." The storyline is straight out the book with no hollywood adaptations this causing part of the problem-- you don't get any sparks between Lucy and Carton- or dialouge. It focuses more on the war and hardly anything on the romance or passion in the story.  All in all this movie in my opinon butchered one of the classic love stories in literature. Tale of Two Cities fans- we know buy the classic it's always better 
 When I got this book in preparation for my PSAT, I knew right away I had made a mistake. The concept behind this "revolutionary" book is to get you to associate words with a situation or mental picture the book provides for you. The problem is that one finds themselves taking one step too many in memorizing both the mental picture and then the definition. This takes way too much time (time you don't have an abundance of on the verbal section of the SAT). Another easy trap to fall into is to simply memorize the picture and forget what word it's associated with. Looking at some other reviews, I see this system is working just fine for some people (meriting its two-star rating). I just find it sad that so many people are willing to memorize information that will not help them in the long run. If you want to commit an act of mental suicide, pick up a copy 
 I've been running Spyware Doctor for 4 years, and was having problems with v4 using massive amounts of memory.  So I followed advice from the PC Tools homepage and loaded v5--BIG MISTAKE!  Since installing the new version and downloading the updates (a bad experience in itself, filled with ominous error messages from Windows), I've had to reload the code, reboot numerous times, had 2 Windows crashes and if the OnGuard facility is left running Spyware Doctor consumes 98% CPU for 5 minutes on every screen scroll done reading html text on a site identified as trusted. Oh and the company quietly changed it's policy and has hijacked my credit card information in order to automatically renew registration. I won't be running any more PC Tools products 
 I liked the watch. I had to send the first one back because the date would never change. I got the second one a month ago and haven't been able to wear it for the past two weeks because the band gave me a skin rash. Nice looking watch. Too bad I have to carry it around in my pocket now 
 Just an ok book. Pictures are low quality. Would have expected better from Golf Digest and Jim Mclean. It is straight and to the point but make sure you at least have a solid working knowldge of all aspects of the game before considering this book. You can get much of the same information for free at various golf web sites. Not bad but not very clear in many regards. 
 Lots of great information about things to see and do in Los Angeles, but presented by someone who cannot keep their distain for conservatives and/or corporations to herself. For example, in her description of the Ronald Reagan Presential Library, she refers to Reagan as "the Forrest Gump of modern American politics". Very nice, eh? Then when writing about Disneyland she states "In Disneyland, democracy equals capitalism. And capitalism automatically creates social justice. In other words, Disneyland isn't real, though suburban American desperately wants to believe it is." HUH? I guess outside of Disneyland, socialism equals social justice; just look at the workers paradise Gray Davis turned California into. And Disneyland isn't real? Seemed solid enough to me the last time I was there. Once you get past these editorial comments, the useful information is quite good. But if I wanted to read left-leaning social commentary, I would have headed for the that section of the library 
 Does not work (cool the interior of the vehicle) barely at all, compared to the ads.  So false advertising.  I purchased 2, and one also broke right away.  Very cheaply made product also.  Would never purchase again, nor recommend to anyone 
 Save your $$ if you plan to run with this on a jogging stroller.  On a mild windy day it flips up towards you and off to the side.  I didn't think it really shielded my baby from the sun like I thought it was going to either.  I would not recommend this product. It's very cumbersome. When I returned it to the store, there were two others on the counter behind the customer service cashier that had just been returned recently.    
 i had just recently bought this camera, and it was OK. the quaility of the pictures was pretty ok. i couldnt really understand it, and what really stinks is that i lost the stupid CD that comes with it and now i cant install it. overall i would say that the camera is a stinky peice of JUNK. now im begging my parent to buy me a REALL DIGITAL CAMERA!!not a peice of crap. 
 If a book thoroughly angers and frustrates you, does that mean it's a good book or a bad book?  In the case of MERCY, I'll have to go with the latter.  I found I could not get past my intense dislike of both Cam and Mia, truly two of the most despicable, selfish characters I've ever read in any book.  I've read murder mysteries with killers who had more admirable qualities.  Their sole intent were their own wants and needs, regardless of who (Cam's wife Allie) got hurt.  Allie was described early on in the book as someone who people walk all over.  I never got that impression.  She was the owner of her own business, and she was determined to help Cam's cousin Jamie.  She also happened to be a woman deeply in love with her husband.  It was her love and loyalty that Cam felt totally comfortable in betraying.  At one point late in the book, Allie asks Cam if he and Mia had laughed at her.  He tells her no.  However in a way, they did, considering they had no problem having sex in her flower shop and her bed.  I felt for Allie.  She deserved far better then Cam  I really wanted this book to be more about mercy killing and euthanasia.  Instead it was more about infidelity and how far a person is willing to go for someone they love.  Infidelity seems to be a pretty constant story line in most of Picoult's books (I understand her latest book, THE TENTH CIRCLE is no different.)  She is without a doubt an excellent writer, but this one just wasn't for me 
 I am quite dissatisfied with the quality of the new Leatherman tools.  I purchased two Leatherman Squirt S4's and the Leatherman Micra from Amazon recently and was surprised to see that all of them arrived scratched up(like it was used before).  Some scratches were wide and deep enough to cause cuts on your hands when you use the tool.  I purchased the Leatherman Charge XTi from another vendor, which was also not of high quality that Leatherman was once known for.  I have owned the original Leatherman Wave since it first came out and have had no problems with it.  It seems like the newer models are being mass produced without some type of quality control.  Or maybe someone is repackaging used Leatherman tools and selling them as new... I will not be buying anymore Leatherman tools until they start making high quality multitools as they were once known for. If you want to buy one of these, either for yourself or as a gift, I would suggest you go to a store and look at it before you buy.  Make sure there are no scratches or smeared letterings or any other problems...The ones I recieved were definitely not good enough to give as gifts 
 This was not for dummies, I found it difficult to follow and to look up specific problems.  Did not care for this book. Not too helpfu 
 Personally I found this book to be little more than a GRE verbal refresher course.  Sure, it is objective and balanced but so impassionate that such a contentious issue seems like nothing.  I think you can strip away emotion from a social problem so much that it creates the question of, well, then, does this really matter?  In my opinion I feel this is what the author has done.  I was really disappointed in this book 
 Arrogant, condescending, uninformative. The only kayaking book I've ever read that I couldn't finish. The photography is great, but the text is horrid 
 I thought this book would give me guidance with regards to finding the right apartment, things to look for when visiting the apartment, reading leases, negotiating leases and calculating rent and expenses.  What this book did do was calculate a budget while factoring a tithe to the church, mention the importance of finding an apartment reasonably close to the church and/or church activities. So, if you want "bible," "God" or "Jesus" specifically named in your lease, or you plan on renting from your Pastor/Church Elder please feel free to read this book.  If you want real-world advice on renting an apartment, don't bother with this 50-page pamphlet. Try "The Savvy Renter's Kit" by Ed Sacks, instead 
 Many of us have the sinking feeling that the Internet is starting to resemble television. As the saying goes, "There are 500 television stations, but nothing's on." Estimates vary about the number of Web sites on the Internet. By some estimates, there are 300 million. Which means there are 300 million Web sites and nothing's on. Most of the Web sites aren't worth visiting.  The author of "Best of the Internet" wants to direct you to the Web sites that are worth going to. To that end, he has assembled some 1,000 Web site names and descriptions into 19 categories -- reference, communicating, computing, entertainment, news, sports, hobbies, family, education, health, lifestyles, religion, finance, careers, shopping, travel, government, and the weird.  If you are willing to trudge through this book's 420 pages, you will find more than a few good Web sites. I found a number of good online stores, for example. But the problem with this book is that the author mostly presents the tried and true. He doesn't stray from the beaten track. You discover Web sites that you could probably find on your own or already know about.  I thought the book book presented far too many corporate Web sites. Do I need to know that Disney.com is a good family-oriented Web site? The author could have searched a little farther for eccentric Web sites that are of interest to families. I find corporate Web sites dull and uninspiring, but many are listed in this book.  Another thing: The Web site descriptions are long-winded. By the time you read some of these descriptions, you could have visited the Web site on your own and decided for yourself whether it is worth visiting.  I hope if the author revises this book that he cuts back on the Web site descriptions and gives us more Web sites instead. How about 2,000 Web sites next time instead of 1,000, with fewer words to describe each Web site? 
 Let me tell you that this booklet is definitely worthless. You can read it in maybe three hours but that doesn't mean that is a good book. On the other hand it doesn't even had an end. When you'll finish you'll be exactly as when you started reading it, exactly with nothing at all because this book says nothing. 
 I did not like the book.  It did have some interesting points to consider, but it did not seem like discipline to me.  I am more of a Love and Logic fan.  I think kids cannot always see the natural consequences of their own behavior (or don't care) until far into the future and must sometimes have consequences imposed upon them, which this book says not to do.  I just don't agree with it 
 More garbage that subtly steers the reader away from the idea that Washington had "No Idea" about the 911 attacks and that they merely screwed up. This book is for cowards that are afraid to look at the hundreds of glaring pieces of evidence that point to Washington pre-knowledge; actually,I think Mossad did the dirty work. I get sick of reading junk like this that serves to only mellow out and support insecure people that cling to the phoney American Dream while they wave their stupid little flags that are made in Red China. The complicity of the American sheeple is beyond belief! Every body is willing to become a suck up like Stalins Yezhov or Beria believing everything that is said to them, then Bang, right in the head. What will you Sensible, moderate sheeple say when the North American Union 2010 and Shafta steal your job and corporations steal your retirement. Another similiar piece of garbage that advances the "Innocent view of the CIA and Washington" is E. Howard Hunt's Book "American Spy: My Secret History in the CIA" Completely sanitized of any useful information. If a book has any truth to it, it will be either "Out of Print", Extremely expensive or the Author will have died of lead poisining ( Gary Webb, Gurudas, David Allen 
 Never having read Macomber before, I picked up Susannah with interest, hoping to discover the secret of her popularity. While the premise of this book is a promising one, it never reached it's potential. Susannah as a character is oh so nice, and for a woman in her 50's, remarkably impetuous and self-absorbed. Her husband Joe is incredibly mild mannered and forebearing, and daughter Chrissy, evidently meant to be charmingly naive and innocent, comes across as petulant and spoiled. As so often happens with writers who turn out book after book, Macomber annoyingly depends too much on favorite phrases (e.g., he "wound his arm around her waist"). Less than halfway through this story, its central "mystery" became transparently predictable, and in the final 30 pages, all the pieces fell conveniently into their happy ending places. On the positive side, Macomber did a terrific job portraying the insidiousness of Alzheimer's. Perhaps her earlier novels are more skillfully written 
 A bad movie. Not even if Denise had been nude, it still would have been bad 
 If you would like to learn more about Financial Statement Analysis, this should probably not a right book of you. The author have put many simple ideas into complicated words, not to mention the poor demonstration of cases. The examples are based on too much assumptions, but the basis for these assumptions are not clearly explained (which should be one of the most crucial parts). In addition, the questions in the "industry analysis" are set by the answer, (that means he already know company A is an airline, company B is a computer manufacturer, then he merely give the financial statements to you, and analyse it as if he doesnt know which company was in which industry), so he must be able find his way to draw his conclusion--that A's statement is A, B's statement is B, no matter how similar the two statements are. Ridiculous!      By the way, What you can learn from this book can be found on the internet, without charge.  The book does not deserve its price 
 I am involved in a project to determine the best practices for integrating web services into our applications.  We purchased a handful of recommended books on the topic including this one.  I have to say that I am disappointed in this book.  First off there is little coverage of web services from an architecture point of view.  There are some decent chapters that introduce the concepts of web services and SOA and then the authors jump directly into reference mode on the dozen or so technologies that they think you must master to develop web services.  Maybe it is just a failure of the J2EE process, but this book does little to address the confusion and complexity involved with developing web services in Java.  In fact this book just adds to the problem.  Developers should not need to know all the details of SOAP, WSDL, UDDI, and all the JAX APIs in order to develop web services.  For the most part, all this plumbing technology should be hidden from developers yet it is the focus of this book 
 This essay may be worthwhile reading for someone getting started in the sport but it useless for the experienced sportsman. Little more than a superficial retred of what so many others have written. Save your money and buy something from the classic outdoor writers like Ruark, O'Conner, or Gene Hill. You could also try the nature writers like Teale, Carrighar, Thompson-Seton, Paul Brandreth, John Taintor Foote or many others 
 Far better use of your time and money is spent on acquiring and reading Xenophon himself. 
 I find it very hard to understand how a work about "Modern" religious movements should be helpful - if the stopping point is 1913! This edition was published by "Low Price Publications" in Delhi, and that's what it looks/feels like. There may be some historical nuggets to harvest if read really thoroughly - but except for some historicians I doubt many people will take the toil to do so. In my opinion this book should carry a warning tag because of its publication date and I'm rather disappointed with it, but I appreciate the thorough and critical treatment of Theosophy. Generally this book flows over with information, but I'd be critical whether it is not outdated. If you can use it anyway - all the best to you 
 John Dunning's "Booked to Die" was a New York Times best seller, and also won the prestigious Nero Wolfe Award.  It is one in his series of Denver police procedurals featuring homicide detective Cliff Janeway.  Dunning, who lives in Denver, Colorado,owned the Old Algonquin Bookstore in Denver for many years, and "Booked to Die," (duh!) is set in the world of rare and collectible books.  I really found it an interesting world to enter, and learned quite a bit about it before the book was done.  But do I believe the designated villain, a book dealer, really would have killed?  Not on your life.  And do I believe anyone would kill over some valuable books?  Not on your life.  Of course, I realize that in the current world, it must require great imagination to write a mystery that doesn't feature as villain a ruthless drug dealer with friends in high places; still, one of the first requirements of a mystery, for me at least, is at least temporary believability.  Dunning writes well, he does well by Denver, and, as previously noted, the book trade. He's a thorough-going professional, and the story keeps trucking along, rented U-Haul and all.  As, "I drove south, into the coming snowstorm.  I thought about the U-Haul truck and the mileage that Bobby Westfall had racked up.  I thought about Greenwald and the screwed-up Ballards and the turtle-faced man.  Snow began to crust around the edges of my windshield.  The road was getting slick."  Still, the book has a paint by numbers feel to me, or rather it has no feeling, to me.  Supporting characters are cut from the finest cardboard. I'd say the book didn't touch my emotions, but that wouldn't be entirely true.  It left me with a bad feeling.  Consider: the first love interest deserts Janeway without a word when he leaves the police force.  A woman who's met up with the book's actual designated bad guy in an unpleasant way is a total senseless irrational coward, keeping herself and everybody else in continuous jeopardy.  Suspicion is cast on the book's later love interest, a ploy that's been used untold times by writers better than Dunning.  And a 19-year old female character, introduced only to be killed shortly, is made a Glaswegian Scot, no less, and stuck with the given name of Elspeth Pride, known as"Pinky" by her friends. For heaven's sake, if you're giving a character only 30 pages to live, at least give her a humane name.  My yiddische grandmother, whom I loved, used to say of someone she disliked," he should live and be well."  After that came an unpoken sentence: "But not in my vicinity."  Dunning should write and be well, but not in my vicinity.    
 I've seen Amy Sohn on TV a few times and decided to check out this novel at B&N. I finished about half of it, just out of sheer curiosity and obviously didn't purchase it. It's amusing if only because of what poorly written, self-important, right out of the gutter sewer sludge it is. The protaganist is self-absorbed, humorless and unlikeable. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be satirical or some kind of ironic twist on this sort of coming-of-age-20-something-hip-post-feminist genre, but I'm afraid it's not because I think the author expects us to actually RELATE to the main character and take her seriously 
 This album is complete ..., I use to like sugar ray, hate them eternally.  And this album did not "save" their career.  Their career was going perfectly fine, but the ... in the band (excluding mark mcgrath, I THINK) wanted to make ...music and make more money, basically saying "Screw everyone else, all I want is my money 
   I'm very surprised that this product has as high a rating as it does, I suppose most are simply glad the show is available on DVD.  However, the transfer to DVD is absolutely horrible.  On an opening night shot on disc 1, there is so much junk on the film that one would think one was seeing lightning bugs -- inside the house!  The colors on these prints aren't even as good as what is shown on TVLand.  This show might be 30 years old, but they cannot be using the best prints available.  There is another irritating tip-off of the cheapness of this package -- the music on the closing credits is wrong -- or is this my imagination?     For those who are defending this package, the upcoming Daniel Boone DVD set is a good item to compare it with.  That show aired in 1966 and the remastered print is fantastic.  Studios and re-issue companies can do a good job when they choose to.  It's a real shame that, in this age of big-screen TVs, this program will look so shoddy.  It's apparent that with such a popular show, they could have recouped the investment 
 This story was about a young brother trying to make it in life. I have to admit that I was excited to read this book, and it let me down.  I didn't like how Bobby let Pearl walk all over him.  I don't think Bobby Dallas was portrayed as a "Do Right Man" at all, but rather a wimp.  During the first half of the book, I waited for him to get a back bone, which he never did.  From there on the whole story was slow. I was bored about continually reading about him and his radio job.   This was a slow read for me, I skipped a few chapters just so I could find out what finally happened in the end 
 Sorry readers but slogging through this "tribute" to friendship was about as enjoyable as a root canal.  Where to begin? The first thing that comes to mind was "what a sick mess of a relationship".  You can sum it up in a nutshell something like this.  Lucy to Ann .... "You will, pay my bills, clean my pigsty of a house, do all my bidding however outrageous, lavish me with attention, declare your love.., in turn I will, ignore you at will, rarely deliver anything as promised, drop you for a better gig at a moments notice, take no responsibility for anything and use you for everything you've got... Ann to Lucy  "Yes pet!"  Lucy comes off as petty, self-absorbed, spoiled and plain obnoxious minus half a face or not.  Ann is a classic enabler, you can't help but pity her.  Like other reviewers I took issue with the author revealing every sordid detail about her dead friend while telling us nothing of her own shortcomings.  Although ultimately I suppose this novel itself speaks volumes about the author's many flaws 
 I must admit that a misguided person gave me this book. Worse yet, she expected me to swoon and join her on my knees and pray for rapture.   Of all the foolishness that is damaging our world, LaHaye's products must be among the worst culprits. I managed to finish this book, and between laughter and rolling of eyes, all I can say is "DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY." 
 The case does not fit and the battery is incorrect for the DX759 
 A flattering cover photo on a pricey double-disc set that includes nothing over previous "Best Of" releases from Kenny Loggins. How many times MUST he re-package "the hits"? And one can't help but wonder: why are tracks like Vahevala and Angry Eyes, taken from the first and second Loggins and Messina records, played off here as strictly Loggins' material? Just because he was the principle writer on those tracks? Jim Messina wrote and produced some of the best moments that duo ever recorded, yet the only face on this compilation is that of Loggins. Smacks of smug profiteering. I'd much rather listen to a re-mastered retrospective of L&M than ever again hear a note of Don't Fight It.  
 Well, I guess it's been a while since I've been a college student. I'm a crusty old amateur radio hobbyist now. I guess all college texts have ridiculous prices. This book used to be the best reference I've ever seen on basic electronics for non-EE's, and even for non-engineers. It's not much of a cookbook - instead, it will make you sit down and work through the fundamentals of the circuits you're designing or adapting. The second ed. is getting long in the tooth, and since the book is used as a college text, it's preposterously overpriced. The one terrible thing about the book is that there are no answers to the (otherwise excellent) exercises, and you have to pay out again to get answers to the questions you're not sure about. It will be interesting to see what the 3rd ed. looks like. Maybe I'll start a web site and publish the answers online 
 There are many words that came to my mind when I first saw these two movies: overblown, pointless, cruel, boring, disappointing, the list goes on and on.  So many things are horribly wrong with this cartoony mess, that it doesn't bear any resemblance to the (brilliant) original trilogy anymore.  In that respect, Episode I isn't nearly as atrocious as Episode II, and that's already saying a lot.  First of all, I don't know how long it took George Lucas to write the scripts for these films, and, actually, it doesn't really matter because IF he put any effort into them, it didn't show on screen, but the dialogues are so wooden that you might as well turn off the sound and read the subtitles only.  Now that we've established that the lines every actor was forced to say are horrendous, it can't look good for the characters either, can it? You can't blame the actors if you consider that they virtually had nothing to work with. Not a single character in these sorry efforts looks convincing, except for Natalie Portman.  Christiansen's helpless attempts at "doing some acting", Jar Jar Binks' infantile jumping around (in one of the many "all time low" scenes on Tatooine, he steps into some dog poo), Young-Ani's witty "Oops", "Let's get out of here" and "Yeah" lines ... not a single minute passes without a cringe- worthy moment. After four hours of pure nonsense and some of the worst "going through puberty" moments, a wacky CGI Yoda who bounces off walls doesn't even hurt anymore.  Even some of Christopher Lee's horror flicks are on a higher niveau.  And when I noticed that the chemistry between Portman and the kid who plays young Anakin Skywalker is better than the chemistry between her and Hayden Christiansen, then I finally realised that these films have no saving grace to speak of whatsoever.  And I mean NO saving grace. It's just aching in my stomach when legendary composer John Williams has to step down to this level and underline the worst clich√©s with some stomach- wrenching Hollywood B- movie love and action music.  Now the effects. Hailed by so many people out there who call them fantastic or a work of art. Now, this may be my personal point of view, but CGI is there to enhance the movie, to put something on screen that you couldn't have done in any other way. The gigantomany Lucas put on screen is no art. The art is to make it look real, touchable.  That's what made the original trilogy, or Lord Of The Rings, tick: that the viewer can indulge into this world.  And CGI is not the only tool; miniatures can look great, good make-up and costumes, animatronics, and so on. CGI is not the solution of everything. You need some skills to make this world look real, which Lucas seemingly doesn't have.  Everything is so smooth and flawless that it just looks artificial. Look at the Clone army and compare it to the Uruk- Hai army in The Two Towers.  See now why Lord of the Rings got the Oscar and not Episode II?  And the depressing thing is that after seeing the trailer for Episode III, it seems like we're getting another flick of the same pattern. With Hayden Christiansen! Hooray!  Get out the earmuffs, here it comes!  I could give it an additional star because there's unintentional amusement value in these flicks 
 Being one of Ms. Brockman's most avid fans, I could hardly wait for the ink to dry before buying this book.  I was so disappointed.  It started out very good, very well written but got more and more outlandish by the minute.  I kept waiting for the other characters to come in and help save the day as usual but there was no sign of them.  The complete reversal in Max's character was a little contrived and I think the worst character portrayal was that of Jules.  He went from an applaudable FBI agent who just happened to be gay to a stereotypical gay man fumbling around trying to be a FBI agent; I always liked Jules and this portrayal was most disappointing.  I recommend buying it used because I know Suzanne Brockmann fans will not be able to resist it. 
 Nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst, and how dare him to diss KRS-one, he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on Number 1, he just added to why he sucks. Lets face it, all his songs are basically dumb and and really don,t have much texture involved. And how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable. If you buy this album, you throw away good money. Unless you like bubblegum rap. This is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool, but lets face it ,its played out 
 When I read Jacob's previous books especially "The Death and Life of Great American Cities" and "Cities and the Wealth of Nations", I became aware that I was reading the insights of a brilliant mind. In these books and others, Jacob's was able to examine society and the economy in ways that went against prevailing assumptions. Unfortunately this is not the case with this book. There is little insight here. The book is just a rambling collection of anecdotes strung together to justify some preconceived ideas.   The ideas themselves are not new. They are the stuff one reads in  newspaper columns about urbanism. The world is going to hell because not everyone thinks that suburbs and cars are the works of the devil. Jacob's broke new ground in her previous books. This one is just a rehash of tired ideas that were not particularly good the first time around.   This is lazy book full of shallow ideas. 
 If you are looking for a thick book about actor/director Clint Eastwood's life and career, illustrated with some unusual photos, then this will fill the bill.  If you want an objective biography of Eastwood, together with an objective analysis of his film work, this is not the book you want.  Schickel was basically an employee and friend of Eastwood during the researching and writing of the book, and he tends to ignore or downplay the dark side of Eastwood's activities, particularly his alleged "women are like kleenex" philosophy, and his alleged cruelty toward former collaborators.  The long book is made longer by merciless padding, including detailed and completely unnecessary plot summaries of the films.  Viewed from 2004, Clint Eastwood is an important actor--- as good an actor as Jimmy Stewart and as iconic an actor as John Wayne. He is also an important and stylish director, and justifiably famous for his gentle ways with cast and crew, as well as his efficiency in coming in under budget.  One of the author's continuing themes, brought up on nearly every page, turns upon  the consistent misunderstanding of Eastwood, both as actor and director, by two generations of famous mainstream film critics.  This theme wears thin quickly when one realizes that there is probably not a single case in which famous mainstream film critics have had the slightest clue as to the value, importance and significance of any new film or film star.  Eastwood is an important figure in 20th Century cinema, and he deserves an objective, scholarly, independently-researched analysis of all aspects of his life and career.  I don't know of one... we'll keep looking 
 I guess the "hidden" in the title suggested the author was familiar with the territory. So this was the only guide I took along on my recent trip to the Yucatan.  Big mistake! A pre-trip reading made it this guide look worthwhile, but in actuality, it misinformed.  Take credit cards.  Harris says, "Credit cards are just about as widely accepted in Mexico and Central America as they are in the United States."  Has the author ever tried to use one in Tulum?  Or even in the resort town of Akumal?  The big hotels in Cancun and other places take them and a VERY few upmarket shops and restaurants do, but that's it. We couldn't even use ours at a gas station in Cancun.   And thinking you'll be able to navigate with the maps in the book is another mistake. The maps are inaccurate.  The one of Cancun bears little resemblance to reality.  After a few days, I imagined the author having taken a hasty taxi ride through the Yucatan and jotting down "hidden" findings whenever the taxi left the main road.  A lot of research went into this book. But not all of it was on site and not all yielded accurate information. Harris writes:  "Palenque was made famous by American adventurer and travel writer John Lloyd Stephens during his first expedition to Central America in 1837."  Actually, Stephens and Frederick Catherwood first traveled and explored Coba.  Senior travelers are informed of Elderhostel trips, but told they must be 60 ( not 50) years old.  This is being picky-picky, but when it's yet another of many inaccuracies (and you stupidly took along only this guide), it rankles.   A better, more accurate guidebook would have made our trip more pleasurable. 
 This book is a total bore. The flowery description is beautiful for the first three sentences, but then it becomes a tranparent cover-up for a book with no plot! Even I could write a more interesting book, and I failed high school english! Muir was a great person, but he sould have stayed where he was better aquianted: the woods! Anyone who enjoys this book obviously has never seen a tree before. A whole book dedicated to them is ironic and lame 
 I am just sitting here reading this book, studying for a huge exam tomorrow morning, and I am just getting so incredibly frustrated with this book and decided that I should let it out on here. Oh my God, there is a mistake on like every friggin page... and to make matters worse, all the mistakes are right smack-dab in the middle of an example problem. So there you are, trying to learn how to work certain problems, and all of a sudden, there's something that just doesnt seem to make any sense. And the whole time you're thinking that you're stupid and you just cant figure out the correct way to do the problem, until a wasted-hour later, you finally realize... "oh, its just ANOTHER stupid mistake these idiots made, and i thought i was retarded." Grrrr, this is killin me.  I cannot freakin believe that they could actually charge $140.00 for a book no one even bothered to proofread. okay, so point of the story is... this book sucks, dont buy it if you can get around it, i'd recommend. 
 Have you ever read a book wwhose plot was so convoluted and whose characters were so uninteresting that by the time you got to the end you just didn't care?  "Hour Game" was like that for me.  The promise displayed by the pairing of Sean King and Michelle Maxwell in "Split Second" isn't realized here.  If they became romantically involved, all the chemistry would be lost, but "Hour Game" suggests that, with that option closed to him, Baldacci doesn't know what to do with them.  If you're looking for a good Baldacci read--heck, a good thriller/suspense/mystery read, period--try his "The Camel Club" 
 Where to start?  This is a positively dreadful waste of time and money....I feel sorry for the actors and technicians that had to waste good time  producing such rubbish. The story is slightly stolen from the classic "A Double Life" starring  Ronald Coleman in an Oscar winning role in the 50's.  ITs nothing but a lame slasher movie with the addition of famous leads.  If you were to bet me that a movie 90 minutes in length and  featuring  Elizabeth Hurley in all her stunning beauty for nearly every minute of it..and that I'd still regret wasting  the time I'd take  that bet....I did,  and lost.  Be afraid ,  be very afraid 
 I bought the book thinking that it would be accurate and helpful in everyday conversation.   I feel that most of what I read is simply not factual.  As a person, I feel strongly that I would not want to tell anyone that I knew the author or was his friend.  maybe it is just that we come from different backgrounds and experience.  
 The intro is tight, the rest just sucks... End of review! 
 I think that most of these guides were written by British people.  Coincidentally, they are pretty objective until you get to this one.  Since the Brits consider themselves to be brutally honest, I was hoping that the authors would mention ALCOHOL under the 'Obsessions' chapter.  Hardly. 'The Pub' is described as a social setting when it should be described as a social ill.  The 'Character' chapter starts off with, "Moderation means a lot to the English".  That in itself is laughable.  This book is obviously about England before dark.  After dark, it's a whole different country, and the authors are truly in denial 
 Katzenbach is a good writer. His "The Analyst" is one of the best thrillers I've read. And Hart's war and The Madmans Tale are well written gripping stories. However with State of Mind I found my own mind wandering as I read it. Somehow it is too long and not particularly compelling. The future America he devises where everyone is armed and guards escort office workers to their cars is not perhaps far fetched but felt superficial. It merely existed as a counterpoint for a new 51st State where everyone was safe.  Don't bother with this book, especially when Katzenbach has written so much better 
 Very promising, but a huge disappointment. I rarely give up on a book, but was unable to continue past page 26 due to the author's fixation on the child's bodily functions, which I found unseemly, unecessary and quite frankly, weird.  Seven, count 'em...seven references...one would have been quite sufficient, thank you 
 This is a postscript to my review titled "The Book Who Couldn't Dance."  For me, the last straw comes on Page 218, when Yudkoff botches his description of the "Singin' in the Rain" number.  It's one thing for Yudkoff to botch the numbers in LIVING IN A BIG WAY, which after all is a fairly obscure film -- though NOT impossible to view -- but to botch the most famous Kelly number in SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, the most famous Kelly film of all time?!  Well, how can you trust ANYTHING in the book after that 
 i would like to order a book that is telling all old samoan stories and customs and the faasamoa in the samoan language. 
 Like the Carolinne White translation of the "Confessions," also carried by Amazon, this paperback does not have the complete original text. Rather, some of the ideas have been selected out by someone and are here rephrased into more contemporary language. That's OK, but anyone buying this book ought to know that this version is an abridgement and not the full text of the "Confessions" that they're buying 
 Thug World Order isn't a CD for the casual listener. If you're looking to get into Bone Thugs-N-Harmony I would STRONGLY reccommend E.1999 Eternal and The Art of War first.  If you like that stuff (you most likely will), then go from there.  This CD is known by most Bone fans as not being very strong.  I hated it at first but now I listen to a lot of the songs on an everyday basis. It's definitely got some songs that feel like filler but it's got some classics on it as well.  BEFORE YOU READ THIS, YOU MUST KNOW, I'M KIND OF A HARSH GRADER:  5/5- Amazing Song.  A classic. Will play it repeatedly. 4/5- Very, very good song, close to being a classic. 3/5- Good song, not great.  Worth listening to anytime. 2/5- Not a song I like really, but I'll listen to it. 1/5- Songs I always avoid.  Here's how the tracks breakdown:  1. T.W.O. Intro: N/A- A nice intro to open up the album.   2. Bone Bone Bone: 3/5- Has some nice flows on it.  When it goes "BONE THUGS!" after every couple lines it's a little annoying but you get over it.  3. Guess Who's Back: 1/5- Just not a fun song in any way.  Lame hook, weak beat and verses.  4. Home: 4/5- Very good song, features Phil Collins (Home was originally his song).  Laid back feel, good verses.  5. What About Us: 1/5- The kids singing in the chorus are just annoying.  Boring song again.  6. Get Up & Get It: 2/5- Still not a song I'm a big fan of but it's not half bad.  7. Bad Weed Blues: 1/5- I'm really not a fan of any of Bone's drug songs (they have a ton). This one is one of the worst.  8. All The Way:  1/5- I don't know how to explain it, Bone just doesn't bring it on this one either, like a lot of the songs on here.  9. Non Fiction Words by Eazy-E: N/A- Just Eazy E talking about how everything Bone sings about on their records is true.  10. Pump, Pump: 3/5- Pretty sweet song, one of their most raw.  Pretty dark.  The verses are pretty good.  11. Set it Straight: 2/5- Decent beat, decent verses.  Not bad.  12. Money, Money: 3/5- Pretty good song, very good verses all aroudn.  Song tends to drag on near the end.  13. Not My Baby: 5/5- One of my top 10 Bone songs ever.  Talks about girls trying to act like Bone got them pregnant so they can get mad $$$ from them.  Sounds stupid but Bone pulls it off nicely.  14. Cleveland is the City: 4/5- Very good song, giving a lot of people in Cleveland props and shoutouts.  Bizzy talking at the end maybe ruins this one from being a 5/5.  Great song, regardless.  15. If I Fall: 5/5- Awesome song.  Very inspirational.  If you need a song to lift you up, this one's it.  It's got great quotes that I live by everyday.  Some people say the chorus is lame but it doesn't bother me at all.  16. A Thug Nation Soldier Conversation- Just a skit, to tell you the truth, I've never heard it, but it's just a skit so it shouldn't matter.  All in all, Thug World Order is worth owning if you're a serious Bone Thugs fan.  Though it starts weak, if finishes strong.  If you're looking to get into BTNH, avoid this one until you've heard their other stuff.  
 I bought this as a large print book for my mother-in-law who has trouble with her vision.  This is NOT large print  She did enjoy the stor 
 Good news: my daughter had a blast decorating this light. It kept her happily occupied for several hours, and it was very cute when she was done.  Bad news: after all that, it wouldn't turn on.  Upshot: She liked it anyway, and kept it clipped by her bed to admire her art. It was a little late to take it back, anyway. But I had to buy her another lamp that actually worked.  Moral of story: if you buy this product, make sure it works BEFORE you turn it over to the young artist 
 It's not often that I want the heroine killed off before I am half way through the book but Josie was disgusting and truly in need of psychiatric help.  By the end of the book I was wondering about Cooper's mental health.  No sane person would have put up with her antics.  I love Ms Brockman's writing but this book was difficult to finish.  There was no one to root for except the kids and you had to wonder what would become of them living in that dysfunctional household.  
 Unfortunately i was not impressed by this book, i had heard so many great things and bought it based on reviews, and my love of nature - but i have picked this book up three different times and can not get into it, i just find it boring. I am not a nature hater, i have a bird feeder, a bird bath, a dog and a cat as pets, I love animals and can stare at the birds at the feeder for a long time, infact that is much more entertaining to me than this slow moving, boring book.  I will pass it on to a friend, and hopefully they can find the magic in the book that i was unable to appreciate. i just found it to be too dry 
 I have been a fan of RENT for years. I've seen the play live five times, can sing all the songs without the CD on and repeat all the dialogue verbatim.  That said, I was highly disappointed by the movie's interpretation of this play's incredible music.  Part of RENT's beauty is its musical simplicity. For anyone who has seen the play, you know that all the music comes from a small four man band onstage. The movie has over-orchestrated the heck out of everything, making it lose that clarity the stage version holds. It has been made into a studio prodect. The voices are overwhelmed by the orchestra, and that is simply a travesty.  While Tracie Thoms and Rosario Dawson are both decent singers, their voices do not have the power their roles require. "Out Tonight", one of my favorite numbers in the play, is mangled by Dawson, whose vocal register simply cannot handle the demands the role of Mimi places upon it. Thoms cannot carry Joanne, and some of the parts Fredi Walker rocked out in the OBCR are squeaked out by Thoms. (In particular, "Tango Maureen" and :Take Me or Leave Me".) The role of Joanne requires a certain vocal presence and richness of voice, and Thoms cannot deliver.  Of the original cast members, Adam Pascal's performance in particular was extremely disappointing. The rock sensibility that wowed me in the OBCR was gone, replaced by the whiny psuedo-emo rocker style of the movie.   The movie also left out much of the great music from the stage version, including the various Christmas Bells, Happy New Year A and B, and Contact, and it is considerably weaker for it.  If you're considering buying this soundtrack, do yourself a favor and get the Original Cast recording instead. It's money MUCH better spent 
 musical parts were droped from the script... the story went to fast and was poorly directed... 
 Borg is new and he is trendy...as Dr. Gardner alludes to in another review here, his interpretation of the Bible etc. almost totally disregards some of the core fundamentals of the Christian faith. It is yet another example of a flash in the pan perversion of Christianity...to claim that Jesus is not God flies against a most central belief...perhaps worth knowing about, but beware...  It continually amazes me how we are all so subject to becoming blind to the deeper truths of the Bible...for anyone interested in a relatively thorough critique of Borg, go to www.equip.org and do a search for Borg. You will find a review of his work which I highly recommend that you read before you buy any of Borgs books.    I bought three of his books via Amazon on the advice of a good friend...anyone interested in getting three of his works real cheap?  By the way, I wish that Amazon would provide a rating of "0' for things that are totally worthless...I struggle to give this book even one star 
 I get pretty tired of hearing that Paul Berman is a liberal or a leftist. If his is, then he is a fifth-columnist. He supported Reagan's illegal wars in Central America in the 1980s for much the same reasons he now supports Bush's wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and all over the Muslim world. He does not understand Sayyd Qutb at all. Qutb did understand the US quite well. He was tortured and murdered by the CIA working through the Egyptian police. He wanted the CIA out of Egypt and he was right to think that. No one is an extremist for wanting foreign occupiers out of their country. Why Berman can't see this can only be attributed to his blind faith in the benevolence in American imperialism. Berman is just another apologist for American imperialism. No liberal or leftist would ever take that position.  Berman is a right-winger. 
 This book is nothing more than fascist cold war propaganda. According to the author, the tiny American Communist Party (thoroughly infiltrated by the FBI, I might add) and its leader Gus Hall have secretly controlled the United States for decades now. The author provides no documentation for this allegation, no verification at all, he just reads Gus Halls self important public statements, then tries to show how this proves that Gus Hall controlled some policy of the government. This book would be very funny if it were only better written 
 If an author choses to write a politcally charged novel, there will be bias. What I look for is some balance in the arguments. But, like his brother Rush, David writes with blinders on and misses the obvious contradictions in his arguments. The Democrats are not like Republicans! Of course not. The current Republican party is overwhelmingly an ideological, lock-step plutocratic mob who won't tolerate open discussion of an issue. Democrats on the other hand are diverse, open minded and welcoming of new ideas and thoughts. David Limbaugh would have you believe that is chaos. Open, intelligent discussions are what is missing in the Republican party right now.  A book does not have to be well written to put across the author's theme, and the ideas he is promoting, but when it is dully written, poorly researched and obvious in its misinterpretation of issues and situations it is difficult to give it much credence.  Basically I have read this book before, several times. There is nothing new, in fact it sounds like a few days of Rush on the radio, usually wrong and overwhelmingly insulting to anyone who can think for themself.  So, all I see here is an poorly written dull diatribe of the same old propaganda from the right - "Don't confuse us with the facts we already have been told what to think." 
 Kipnis uses her mindlessly wielded implicit racism to make jokes about rape that reinforce the myth that her audience (explicitly white upper middle class women whose money she wants) are raped by strangers (when even ABC news admits that the vast majority of rape victims are raped by people in their own socioeconomic group...who they already know).  She's not accountable to her audience, she's merely profittng from the hyper-spending tendencies that she diagnosis them with.  When I had the disheartening opportunity to discuss the book with her she used every tactic of male chauvinism to dismiss my critique of her book's racism...even to the extent of insisting that since her editor was black she couldn't be racist.   Don't waste your time 
 I didn't enjoy this book, even though I'm partial to sea stories.  There is not a single likable, admirable character in the book.  I don't think the author, Robert Stone, has spent much time sailing or knows much about the sea.  I would not recommend this book to anyone interested in reading sea stories.  Actually the sailing material does not play a large part in the plot and is not convincingly portrayed.  So what then is it about?  It seems to be about the misery of modern American life.  Stone wants his novel to be deep and epic but it is just depressing and dorky.  The symbolism and ideas are mostly shallow.  There's obscure religious undertones that made no sense to me.  The parent/child relationships portrayed in the book are utterly banal and ugly.  I found no humanity at all in any of the relationships.   And consider the title-"Outerbridge Reach."  Outerbridge Reach is supposed to be an area in New York Harbor where derelict boats lie (get the symbolism?).  But I think the author wanted to title his story "Outta Reach" and came up with this 'clever' twist on the title instead.  Basically what the book is about is how fulfillment, love, and happiness are outta reach.  If you like this kind of depressing thing, you'll love this book.   I don't and I didn't.  Having said all this, I must admit that I did read the entire novel which I don't usually do if I dislike a book.  The reason I read on is that Stone writes well and has an elegant and interesting prose style.  He knows how to skilfully pace a story.  It's a shame that his talent is wasted on such negative content 
 These other reviewers are kidding you.   There are significant problems with this dvd. 1. The audio on this dvd is horrible.  It sounds like they are talking and singing through a tube.  I could have done better in my garage. 2. The tracks are: all the singing and stories in english, or the same program in Mandarin.  There is no teaching whatsoever.  I realize there are not many dvd's for teaching children Mandarin, however there are a few better than this 
 Take a look at the number of copies up for resale - seems this is not a book that is worth keeping - and I would agree with that (clearly widely held) view. This is 'pop' fiction at it's most cover-enticing best but that's all it is. You can do a lot better than this - even for entertainment. Listen to the nearest politician for an hour or so! You'll get about the same rate of rhetoric per ear 
 Giroux's book restates much of what he says in his other books (only with a few Disney anecdotes added). It took him two pages to say what could have been said in two sentences, and I found those same two pages popping up over and over again. I grew tired as I read, I was looking for substance. By the time I was half way through, I was skimming looking for him to say something new (he didn't)  If you're looking for dirt on Disney, read Schweizer's "Disney: The mouse betrayed" Schweizer's book includes documentation of a pedophile problem at Disney, lack of safety at Disneyworld, Eisner dirt, criminal activity, Disney's link to porn.. 
 This Nick Tosches book focuses primarily upon, (1) Nick Tosches, and (2) organized crime, rather than upon Sonny Liston. Tosches' writing is overwrought and self-indulgent; the history he provides is thin and unrevealing; and the portrait he draws of Liston - a truly fascinating, troubled, and battered figure - is cartoonish. Tosches skips over the two Liston-Clay (Ali) fights in a couple pages, despite their importance to the Liston career and the national mood at the time.  He instead embraces Chuck Wepner, who may be a nice guy but lacks any significance in the fight-game.  In sum, the Tosches misses the story almost entirely, and his narcissistic writing style ends up wasting the reader's time 
 This isn't one story, but seven. One for every one of the papa mouse's sons as they lay in bed. They are but a few pages, and most all of them aren't very good. This book is best for those ages 2 or 3, through 8 or so 
 First, I think Terry Pratchett is a masterful writer.  Second, cat fanciers are boring when enraptured by the small furry pests despite being masterful writers.  This is no Discworld, I did not find it entertaining enough to bother to read the whole thing.  Ansel Adams probably would bore you with photos of his kids.  Speilburg would probably bore you with his home movies.  
 I'm sorry but David Horowitz was always an authoritarian, be it on the left or now on the right. The jump from Mao to George W. isn't as long as you'd think if you are looking for something to kneel before, something to banish thought or ambiguity. David Horowitz was one of the fellows who gave the left a bad name in the first place so it is particulary dishonest and repugnant that he should think his "conversion" tells any larger home truths about anything beyond his own pyschology and extremism. Frankly it says more about the moral and intellectual bankruptcy of the right that they welcomed Horowitz than it does about a "left" that was well rid of such frightening blowhards. 
 I was fortunate not to spend any money specifically on this movie.  I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes... incoherent beginning, and overly stylized particularly where Ashe becomes "the avenger" (for lack of a better name).  Nothing like the original at all, which I love by comparison 
 I can say that I'm a Beatrice Small fan.  Only, I don't care for this particular book.  There were too many despicable situations that Catriona could have gotten herself out of.  I understand that women didn't have much of a choice back in this era, but if there is a will, there is a way.  First off, if I'm that beautiful and remotely think that the king would use his position to lure me into his bed, I would never go to court despite the laird's objections.  That alone would save a whole lot of trouble.  I think what really set me off on this book is that both the king and her husband rape her at her home.  TOO MUCH VIOLATION 
 "An American Tragedy" by Theodore Dreiser is considered one of the greatest American books ever written.  This may be the case if you can get past the first chapter.  Five times, I have tried to read this book.  To date, I am 0 for 5, having fallen asleep each time trying to read it.  If you're a bit of a lazy reader or one who doesn't want to work through a book, this is not for you.  Try Mark Twain instead 
 This silly screed includes (among many other howlers) the firmament and vapor canopy conjured into existence to support fundamentalist babble on topics ranging from patriarchal longevity to global cataclysm (the Noachian deluge).  Purported flood allegedly covered Earth's highest mountains to a depth of 15 cubits (about 8 meters).  Covering Mt. Everest would require a water depth about 9km above sea level.  If the flood only covered Ararat, where Noah supposedly berthed, about 5km of water would be necessary.  Jobe, insatiably credulous, simply asserts that before the flood this water existed in the atmosphere as water vapor.  The flood commenced when this vapor condensed and fell as rain.  Unfortunately the vapor canopy fancied by creationists is fatally flawed.  For the vapor canopy to explain a global flood covering the highest mountains (per Genesis), the atmosphere would have consisted of about 900 parts water vapor to one part of what we call air today. To prevent this from condensing, the temperature would have to be raised until the partial pressure of water equals 900 atmospheres. This results in a planetary environment with a crushing sea level pressure of 90,805 kilopascals (13,000 psi) and a surface temperature high enough to melt solid rock - a hellish pressure cooker and incinerator utterly inhospitable to any form of terrestrial life.  To avoid a seared planet other creationists posit a spherical vapor canopy composed of orbiting ice crystals.  In addition to intractable stability problems, any orbiting canopy would cook the Earth when the gravitational potential energy of the orbiting ice was converted to heat, through friction, as it entered the atmosphere and streaked to earth.  The consequence would be a worldwide superheated steam sauna, not a global flood.  Monsieur Martin, how would you like your order of Noachian animals d'ark - broiled or poached?  Even by the reality-challenged slapstick standards of Young Earth Creationism the fallacies presented as facts in this book are inexcusably shallow and inane. Jobe Martin (a dentist) needs to turn down the nitrous oxide, breathe pure oxygen for a month, and avoid excessive mercury exposure.  Hundreds of equally childish, lazy, and deliberately deceptive examples could be cited but amazon sensibly limits review length.  Jobe didn't invent the "goofy gospel apologetics" genre but his breathtaking inanity, boundless credulity, and blatant sophistry make it his own.  This book pushes the envelope of sophistry and magical thinking with disastrous results 
 At the young age of 25 Julie Barenson loses her husband. Shortly after he dies, a great dane puppy is delivered to her home with a note from her late husband. This part will give you the chills ... nice touch.  She names him Singer, and despite her frustrations with his size and clumsy mannerisms they grow to love each other.   After a few years of trying to get her life back together after her tragic loss, Julie begins dating 2 men--Richard, a handsome charmer who wines & dines her, brings her lavish gifts and professes his undying love very early in the relationship. The other, Mike, is a simple down to earth country type whose idea of a date is a burger, Doritos & a couple beers at the local watering hole.  So who would you choose? Ouch! I'll stop there with the comment that this could have been such a compelling story.  Instead, we are faced with trite, boring, repetitive dialogue throughout, scatterings of viewpoint shifts and a very predictible plot.  I cannot believe this is the same author who wrote The Notebook, one of my all time favorite novels. I'll have to admit the ending brought on a gush of tears.  In conclusion, Singer not only saved his owner but the book as well. 
 I'd like to review this. However, it's been about six weeks since I ordered it & it hasn't arrived yet 
 Eve Dallas is a cop in the future, chasing drug dealers, killer and being a badge heavy bitch in general. Her foster mother shows up and tries to get money out of Eve's rich husband and ends up dead.I hated this book, the characters are all unlikeable and the story drags 
 Buying two of these.  Yes, indeed.  I'm the biggest loser of all.  I was so impressed with how this looked and the write-up, I bought two of them.  They are equally horrible.  One lost it's non-stick properties after the second use and the other became "all-stick" after the third use.  Do not waste your money on these things.  There are cheaper and better skillets available.  If you really want one despite all these reviews, please e-mail me and I will sell them to you really cheaply 
 Unfortunate but true - the author clearly has not read the Harry Potter books themselves.  The "writing" itself is painfully stilted and gives the strong impression that scant facts have been surrounded by stock "fantasy" adjectives and adverbs and then bluntly tacked onto a generic "bio" outline.  I'd heard that this wasn't a great bio but while waiting for the Half-Blood Prince I broke down and bought it anyhow thinking "Just how bad could it be?"  The answer is "very."  I urge you not to make the same mistake.  However many times you've read the books themselves you'd be much better off reading them again than reading this 
 I used to respect Mr. Butler's work. I was a big fan of "Good Scent" and especially of "They Whisper." But this is yet another superficial, lightweight offering. It makes me sad to see a once-great author sinking to such depths. Anyone interested should go back and read the old works. They had some real magic to them. The last few books are all just dead weight, a finished author plowing ahead simply because he's expected to. I wish I could say something more nuanced and objective. But this is just a depressing last straw. I am finished with Mr. Butler from here on in. 
 My daughter just entered the toddler years so discipline has become an issue for us. A friend who is an educator gave us this book as a baby present so I thought I would take a look. I was interested in their approach until I read their take on mom's return to work. Basically, they say that children "thrive better" if a parent is home with them until they are three years old. I found this broad generalization to be both offensive and unhelpful. These authors are so clearly biased in favor of stay at home moms, it undercuts everything else they have to say. Moreover, there is shockingly little evidence to back up their various claims. There are two pages of footnotes for the whole book. If they are going to throw around such concepts as inner unhappiness, the all-powerful self and the competent self and trash working parents this way, they should at least have some studies to back up their claims. 
 This is an example of one of those thousands of guitar books which discusses several subjects in a superficial way and never really nails anything down in a useful way. The author has not put forth a single original idea or even bothered to present the same old stuff in a new and different way. This book is not a guide to the fretboard, it is basic music theory for absolute beginners. If you want rock solid information about the guitar's fretboard skip this and do what everyone else does:  get Fretboard Logic. The author has released several books under the same title with pretty much the same stuff in each one. This one is a Mel Bay retread 
 I was forced to read this book over my holiday break for my AP US History class. Normally, we would have had a test on it upon return, but my teacher went soft and just let us read it without punishment. I was expecting it to be horrible, as are most books about history. However, it was slightly better than I expected.   The lives of the characters really pulls you in, unlike most other crappy history books. This was the only thing that kept me from dying to death of bordeom. There were very long and dull sections where the author went straight into "history mode" and started explaining all the historical details of the time. This was when it got hard to read, and I often found myself skipping entire paragaphs out of sheer boredom.  Another thing was that the book had no central plot. It was basically just the struggle of the Slovak immigrants in America. There was really no substance to the story. I suppose it was written that way because that was how it was in real life. A foreign immigrant's life really had no plot or meaning, so I guess that's why the book didn't. The real meaning of the book only picked up in the last 40 pages or so, with the whole union struggle.   The thing that really angered/confused me was how the author freely switched around character's names. One minute, they were being referred to by their first name, and the next, everyone is calling them by their last name. Not to mention, sometimes between themselves, the Slovaks called each other by their Slovak names. This got very confusing, and made you wonder for a second... "Wait, who is that?" before you finally realized it was the same person as before, only under a different name.   Also, the amount of characters in this book was ridiculous. IT could be compared to The Lord of The Rings character-wise. Random names are just thrown out at you, some of which you are expected to remember for later on in the story, and others which are essentially meaningless.   Overall, the book wasn't too bad. It was better than your average historical novel, but still not something I would read voluntarily.  
 I have heard so much of this book and decided to get the audio CDs from the library. I was extremely disappointed with the narrator - who also happens to be the author. He sounds as if he is about to fall asleep and seems to have trouble annunciating words that end in "w" - it drives me mad. He reads in a monotone - no excitement in his voice - he just drones on and on.   I am a big fan of audio CDs because I can listen to the stories while doing other things - I'm not tied down to the couch. I have listened to many narrators - Jim Dale for one - and have never hated listening until now. Charles Frazier may be a "brilliant" author, and should stick with writing - period! Leave the storytelling to someone who has a personality and brings the story to life 
 This product is absolutely worthless, especially in the hot Texas summer.  The pitifully weak fan does not cool the car one bit.  It is still blazing hot when you get inside.  Don't waste your money on this over-hyped piece of garbage.  Better to leave your windows down or park under a tree 
 I thought that this book has some good facts but on the other hand, It had a really unrealistic feel to it. It sounds like the author, lives in a fairyland world far from what is really happening. I really did not enjoy the book and was very unhappy with the author's job on writing it 
 The premise, the title, and even the cover art are all misleading - this book does not really explore the world of Internet dating beyond 3 or 4 `dates.' The main character, Jess, is 34, single, and envious of her sister Olivia, and Olivia's perfect marriage and children. As a birthday gift, Jess receives a subscription to an online dating site and manages to go on about 4 dates during the course of a year. Not stunning odds, and not very interesting reading either. Maybe it's just me, but I really thought this book was going to focus more on the dates and less on Jess and her sister. In the midst of the book, the story takes a drastic turn and becomes very `deep' in terms of the storyline; the storyline, which involves Olivia, just didn't gel with the rest of the book and its upbeat attitude. It was as if a large cloud came over the book midway through and it was hard to get the spirit of the book back. Jess does change throughout the course of the year, but with only 4 dates as a frame of reference, her changes are not that believable and neither is her eventual romance. I just thought this book was poorly written (which, aside from its poor storyline, is illustrated by all the swearing). Waste of your time 
 Awful.  If it was possible to get a zero, this book would deserve it...Material might be interesting if it was presented in a "manly" manner, at least readable...It's the same stuff over and over again, as if the author is trying to convince himself...  A book on "Manliness" ought to be manly, straight forward, tell it like it is and move on...readers and critics be damned, take it or leave it...this book is any and everything but that, and this critic chooses to leave it and suggest that you do the same...  The author's points are "manly" in one important aspect (at least to the academic world).  He goes against "political correctness" and takes a stand against what is considered "acceptable thought..." Three cheers for him on this point...but if he really wanted to make his point, he should have written a "book," not a bulky unreadable dissertation...Little wonder that it is #9,151 on the Amazon Best Seller List and, most likely, dropping fast.      Having said all of this, to be fair, I must point out that our men's book club had a most lively discussion about this book.  Only two people had struggled through the book (two out of nine), but the ideas in the book provoked great discussion. Unfortunately not much of the discussion was about what was in the book 
 Given his eye for detail, obviously thorough research, ability to write reasonably well, and obvious commitment as a devout Catholic, this book should be a good read. It isn't. Instead, it is an unfocused mess. It even has digressions that repeat themselves without any intervening material. Did this writer never pass his work beneath the eyes of an editor? If he did, was that editor someone for whom English was a second language? Given the great problems with this book, how does it rise so far in the book distribution world? It's as if a gifted High School student, mentored by a teacher so bemused by the fact that his student knows the difference between a sentence and a paragraph that he fails to notice his student's lack of compositional organization, has suddenly had his second-semester term paper marketed by a bunch of grownups who should know better. It seems to be a trend in the publishing world, but it doesn't change anything: this book does not even rise to the designation of second rate. I am sorry about that, too, because I want to like this book and this author and to buy the other members of the Trilogy. But I cannot. This book is just not worth the money 
 On disk # 2 some of the tracks "skip" when played and are inaubible.  Have not yet played all of the disks, but was disappointed to find this lack of quality - especially when the book topic stresses the importance of quality. 
 Out of the whole 180 pages of the book, you're lucky if there's 10 pages SPECIFICALLY addressing oxy & prescription addiction verses addiction in general. even when you read it as a general addiction book - it's pretty superficial (main treatment suggestion is 12 step program)& not quite accurate - first chapter premise is that addiction only happens to people with genetic predisposition &/or "trauma" issues...how about the fact that some substances are highly addictive regardless of the other 
 F this self-help industry crap. Quasi-astrological poppycock at its worst. I can tell this book clamps on to the mind and squeezes it to death merely by reading the cliched title. Humans are far more complex than the hack Man-Warrior/Female-Maiden title what's-his-name gives them. And remember, this "doctor," is quietly making mucho mucho bucks off your poor purchase. Your goddamned ancestors never needed a book to run their lives, so why do you? Let's push all the life coaches off cliffs and put the self-help industry to the torch. That's a great start to a sane life 
 I rate this and "Impromptu" (and also maybe "The Piano") as films that are so impressed with themselves and their supposed pedigree they don't have to "work", and the results are a rather tedious series of costumes, pictures, statements and events.  Maybe it was the creator's intent, but at the end of this movie you don't give a crap about this egomaniacal woman and her emotional patchwork of a life; just on the two hours you'll never get back having endured this drivel 
 This book provides good general information useful for starting any small business - with an emphasis on the private investigator.  However it  provides no real information or insight into the specific types of work  private investigators do, the day to day aspects of the work itself, or  tips for conducting these activities.   Nor, despite its' identification as  a 'self study guide,' does it  provide any useful references to related  subject matter which would provide this information.   Simple, quick, easy  and enjoyable reading but a poor value for the money 
 This was the required text for my Sectional Anatomy course, as part of my radiography curriculum.  I found the layout of the book disorganized and frustrating.  I felt it would have been helpful and appropriate for the text to address the sequencing of CT/MRI images instead of showing a random shot here or there...I suppose that's difficult to do without a multimedia/interactive presentation, but I still had alot of trouble learning  via this text.  I found the abbreviated captions virtually useless and ill-concieved.  It's one thing if you're tyring to quiz yourself and want a hint, but if you're trying to learn from scratch, it would have made much more sense seeing the long-hand terms written out in the columns so we know what we're looking at.  Having to glance down at the caption and search for the abbreviation in question proved very distracting to the learning process.  And the written text was...well, not enough text.  Instead of offering helpful ways to differentiate and remember the many different body parts and structures, the text follows a very robotic "the A bone connects to the B bone which leads to the C artery and supplies the D organ...".  I felt overwhelmed with similar-sounding descriptions and didn't take much away from the learning experience that wasn't lost in days.  If I already had an understanding of cross-sectional anatomy before using this text, it may have served as a succinct review, but given the fact it is assigned to first-time X-sectional learners I felt it was too abstract and devoid of personality.  If I decide to go into CT or MRI in the future, I plan on selling this book and doing a little research on finding the best and most current text available at the time.  I can tell this one won't age well 
 Said's book has, sadly, been hugely influential on thousands of university students, their professors, and many living in the islamic world.  His book should not be read without concurrently reading Ibn Warraq's critique _Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said's Orientalism_.  Said lays the blame for nearly everything wrong in the islamic world  at the feet of the West, and thus helped entrench the culture of victimhood that feeds into suicide bombings and riots against political cartoons.  By authorin this book, Said confirmed his place in History as an irresponsible poseur in scholarly trappings 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 As good as the ideas are in this book, from the perspective of a hardcore blogger, this author has zero street credibility.  I was introduced to David Kline as a public figure, per chance, by catching him on The O'Reilly Factor. While I almost exclusively watch O'Reilly segments through Media Matters for America, I tuned into this particular segment about slanderous websites, because I was interested in hearing O'Reilly spinning reality once again.  Kline was a guest, supposedly the balanced guest from the left, who was immediately blown away by the conversation and O'Reilly. How so? Kline couldn't even engage in the conversation, because he had never even heard of Media Matters, the site that O'Reilly focused his vengeance upon.  Huh?  So I go to Kline's blog and I get involved in a few of his posts. The first is basically an open apology to the left and to bloggers for how he allowed himself to be used and abused by O'Reilly. A ton of people posted comments, with many getting on him for his lack of preparation when appearing on an obvious ambush show.  At first glance, I shrugged it off as a poor showing and gave the guy a break. Today, my perspective changed. Why? Go to his site, blogrevolt, and scroll down to the lower right side of the page. His "site" (his nomenclature) is being managed by Christian Sarkar, a marketing guy that has coined his own website marketing strategy called, "Double Loop Marketing."  Let me get this straight; a guy with no hours put in as a blogger (his archives go back two months at the time of this review) writes, authoritatively, about the future of blogging ("Blog! How The Newest Media Revolution Is Changing Politics, Business and Culture") and has someone "managing" his "site?" Apparently, creating a blog template is too much for this "blogger" so he hires a marketing guy to build his blog, along with providing a strategy to pitch his book on the future of blogs to a demographic, which includes bloggers that come to his blo... I mean... "site?"  No wonder Billy Boy's staff picked this guy.  Kline is the one representative of the "blogging community" O'Reilly finds to placate the balanced coverage that Media Matters so devilishly demands... and he just so happens to not know who they are?  This a perspective from the outside, someone who created a blog to promote the sales of a book while looking inside his subject matter 
 A beginning crafter with little computer experience will probably really enjoy this book. It's got some great very beginning, easy projects.  If you have any graphics and graphic software experience at all, this book will waste your time. It was written in 1998, which in Internet years is approaching the stone age. Sorry to bias the stats, but I'm a graphics professional and was looking for more like some of the new image tranfer technique books.  
 I LUV FALL OUT BOY!!!!!!!!!  AWL SONGS GET 10 OUTTA 10!!!!!!  DESERVS ALL 6 STARSS!!! 
 This book could have been an interesting novel, but that's about it. Way too many inconsistencies...like the carbon monoxide incident. Yes, carbon monoxide is an odorless gas, but the exhaust of a "Briggs and Stratton" engine is far from odorless. The fact that his daughter suffered carbon-monoxide poisoning and was rushed to the hospital, (her lips were blue), yet the firemen allowed the rest of them to remain in the house while they "aired" it out. Six hours later (after being delayed from the hospital for an hour and a half) David went to pick up his wife and daughter...YEAH RIGHT!!! As a diesel mechanic I know all too well the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning...it takes a long time to get over it. His whole mission was to reveal remote viewing to "save mankind", and can now be learned from him at $1,200 a class. What a humanitarian!!! Also his mentor and good friend, Mel Riley, is working with Lyn Buchanan instead of Mr. Morehouse. In this book 5 + 5 = 12. 
 I am going to Bhutan and was anxious to see a map to really see where I was going.  It was just adequate.  I think a map for such a mountainous region should be more topographical with elevations shown.  It would be better with valleys and mountains more clearly delineated.  I guess there is not much out there for maps of Bhutan, but it could be some much better. The back of the map is absolutely blank and could be filled with either information or photos of the highlights of the country with map coordinates so you would know where to find them.  
 Lou Reed rocks!!! Dude!! But methinks this collection dost not. The tunes are all good, but there aren't very many of them, and the sound is deplorable, in that inimitable RCA-first-CD-edition sort of way (fans of the Jefferson Airplane and Harry Nilsson know what I'm talking about). A much better jumping off point would be "Different Times: Lou Reed in the 70's", or, even better, check out "Transformer" or "Rock 'n' Roll Animal" 
 I purchased this coffee maker and in three months time, threw it out. What a piece of [....]. You can NEVER get a decent HOT cup of coffee (it is lukewarm at best) and the carafe not only breaks, so you have to replace it, but it is designed to spill coffee everywhere as you attempt to pour coffee from the carafe into the cup. What a dissapointment this machine is. Mr. Coffee used to make a good product that would actually make a good hot cup of coffee, but the quality and design of their machines today are very poor. I would not recommend this coffee maker to anyone. The only nice thing I can say about it is the programmable timer worked.  I would not give this coffee maker one star, but that was the lowest rating available. If it were up to me, I would give this coffeemaker a minus zero rating!  
 This is a pretty dry book.  First it helps to know a little French.  Secondly, all this book does is throw in a couple hundred names of designers and places. Third, when the author speak of different designs which were created by people there are no images to back it up, so you really can't produce an image in your head of what the author is describing, the images that are in the book are mainly black and white and drawings which really didn't give me a sense of what the designer was trying to portray.  As a designer I purchased this book to learn more about the art deco style, characteristics, elements, materials and influence, which is not what I found in this book 
 While I enjoy geology, it is not my profession. I am interested in expanding my knowledge but have no intention of becoming a geologist. I found this book so boring that I was unable to finish it. It reads very much like a textbook. It certianly contains a great deal of information, but it is related in such a dull fashion that it simply could not keep my interest. I was expecting something more along the lines of John McPhee who writes in an informative but entertaining manner.  This fits the first bill but not the second.   
  What can be said? The show sucks and the magazine is just an ad for it! Wow, that's impressive. Just makes you wonder how much money the "This Old House" folks are swimming in, doesn't it. Yep! Look at all the 1-star reviews. Doesn't that signal you not to buy it? Doesn't it?     LOCAL CRAZY MONKE 
 I was required to buy this book when I took a course taught by the author, Jeff Perloff.  This book is the absolute worst micro text I've ever come across.  It's confusing and unorganized much like the author himself.  If you're looking for a good intro micro text, I suggest you look elsewhere.  I highly recommend Nicholson's Microeconomic Theory 
 You only have to look at the poor cover design to know you're in for trouble here. I ordered this book just out of curiosity and am terribly disappointed.  The author has a formula for decorating that misses entirely. Good design isn't about formulas. And if it were, she breaks her own rules regarding focal points, balance, traffic lanes, weight on the bottom and much more.  The room layouts have no doors or windows which so affect the placement of furniture. What was she thinking?  She places two works of art completely to one side of the wall when two walls join going perpendicular to each other. So if one views one wall at a time as one would often do, the arrangement is totally off balance.  Huh?  Her teachings on the heights of furniture and matching it up with the height of the wall is a nice try that definitely won't fit many situations. There are too many variables that will conflict.   Her teaching that the art should be equally as wide as the width of the sofa or chair creates an oppressive feeling. The drawings that illustrate this prove my point: the art invariably overpowers the furniture below it which flies in the face of her teaching that the visual weight should be on the bottom, with lighter weighted items on top.  She would have you build a wall grouping from the outside in, rather than the inside out.  What?  She clearly doesn't understand scale and proportion and can't even find where she mentions it, so I guess she doesn't know about the Golden Mean Theory or the Rule of the Golden Thumb.  She tells you never to place matching loveseats across from one another when that is a very effective way to arrange them. And she doesn't want you to ever split apart two matching chairs, for instance, when doing so can open up an arrangement idea that is very stunning and just as cohesive as keeping them together.  I'm sorry but if you want your home to have the "Levitt's" or "department store look" with your neat little furniture "set" and no individuality, then you might like her inconsistent rules and formulaic decorating technique.  But if you want your home to look creative, distinctive, original, personal and just plain "feels good when done", a rigid formula is not for you 
 This is a review of the 1997 DVD release- thus far, as of September 2006, the only release I know of.  Of all of the DVDs in my collection this has to be one of the most disappointing. Without going into minute detail of what makes the film brilliant- the classic score,  the hilarious comedy and Burton's twisted but brilliant vision- the quality of the film transfer to DVD is almost criminal. It probably wouldn't be noticed on television screens smaller than 27 inches, but on larger screens the picture becomes soft and grainy, devoid of detail and utterly perplexing, given that the movie was shot in the late 80's. The first thought that sprang to my mind when watching it was that it almost immediately reminded me of my time in elementary school before we switched to video tape- the transfer is reminiscent of an old, battered 8mm film reel. I own a S-VHS vcr, and I have seen better film transfers on video tape. Additionally, the extras... well, what extras? There are several paragraphs of "production notes" which are basically brief overviews of Danny Elfman and Tim Burton, but nothing you couldn't gleam from Wikipedia in three minutes.   All that aside, I did pay $9 for it at Sam's Club, so the old axiom of getting what you pay for is truer than ever- but I expected so much more. If you're a Beetlejuice fan, wait for the inevitable Criterion Collection or Special Edition remaster. 
 About a year ago I submitted a review of this much-discussed volume, and promised to enlarge upon the subject after giving the regimen and medicaments a fair chance. Several kind souls have expressed their  appreciation for the original review, and asked for any new information I  might have about my person.  In the interest of science, and ridding myself  of the joys of arthritis, I have consumed cubic miles of chondroitin and  glucosamine sulfates; I have grazed upon greens; I have eschewed almost  every eatable, drinkable and smokable damned or even tut-tutted by the  authors - for a while, anyway. I still have arthritis. It does not have me.  If any improvement came about through this Spartan experience it could only  be detected by the most powerful instruments in the known universe. I shall  not, in future, invest in any more of the pills; I have just celebrated my  freedom with a beefsteak, which we discussed over a capital Hermitage, and  topped off with about an acre of gooseberry pie. As I write this, I am  savouring a good cigar. I speak only for myself in this regard, for I note  other reviews and comments diametrically opposed. Well, everyone to their  own taste, as the old woman said when she kissed the cow. Probably I, a  skeptic from the cradle, lack the faith necessary to derive benefits;  perhaps my metabolism is not in tune with the free radicals, or whatever  they are, that do the work.  Pity, as I said before, that a true scientific  test was not conducted by the authors. As presented, 'The Arthritis Cure'  and its offspring give off a decided odour of snake-oil. Anecdotes are  entertaining. Data are convincing 
 this item is NOT in color! there is only one movie with Gordon Scott in it. The picture and sound quality are horrendous! I am truely disappointed. Looking forward to watching some good tarzan movies and finding the whole experience very disappointing. Im glad i didnt send this movie to my brother for a Christmas Gift 
 If Zell Miller wants to live in a dictatorship, he's free to want that, but he's crazy with hatred for a party that has no power.  What a noble guy!  Rage against the oppressed - what a man!  This book is insane.  I read it at the local library and wondered how he considers himself a conservative democrat when he supports a man who spends like a drunken sailor on shore leave (though the drunken sailor isn't a fighter, but more of a mascott pretending to be a fighter....) and bloats the Federal government beyond and Democrat's wildest dreams....  why so many in the GOP have let hatred be the guiding force i'm not sure.  I actually believe in God and the God in the Bible isn't the champion of hatred and vitriol.  
 Yes my friends, it's time to review yet another one of Roger Corman's Comedy Classics. The 1978 film "Deathsport" arose from two significant incidents. One, the box office success of George Lucas's "Star Wars" virtually ensured that Corman would attempt to capitalize on that film's success. Two, Rog needed product to follow up on his "Death Race 2000" flick. Retaining the services of David Carradine and throwing in sound effects lifted directly from "Star Wars," Corman must have thought "Deathsport" would rake in millions. There's just one problem, however. "Deathsport" is an awful film. It's poorly scripted, cheesily acted, suffers from cheap production sets and lousy props, and generally runs about seventy-five minutes longer than its eighty-two minute runtime requires. I've seen many Roger Corman films thanks to the miracle of DVD technology, and have even enjoyed more than a few of them. For instance, I think "Humanoids From the Deep" is a massively entertaining movie. But "Deathsport" is in a category all its own. It's easily one of Corman's worst efforts. If you're familiar with his particular brand of low-grade sludge, you know that's saying a lot. When he misses, he misses big time. "Deathsport" is a huge miss.  The opening scenes of the film tell us that what we are about to see takes place in the future, 1000 years after an even called the Neutron Wars decimated humanity. Umm, o.k. Why not? It could happen. Then we see Carradine loping through rugged landscape clad in a cloak, a loincloth, and a few stock post-apocalyptic accoutrements. He's Kaz Oshay, a member of a rabidly individualistic sect possessing mental abilities and a tendency to speak dialogue that sounds like it came from a box of fortune cookies called the Range Guides. An evil dude by the name of Ankar Moor (Richard Lynch) sits nearby on a mountaintop, watching our hero through a scope while issuing frantic ambush orders to a bunch of hapless foot soldiers. Moor wants to capture Carradine's character at the behest of the evil Lord Zirpola (David McLean), a tyrant who rules over Helix City, so that the people in the city can watch Oshay die painfully in a spectator called...wait for it...DEATHSPORT! Predictably, Oshay falls into the hands of Moor and soon learns of a plot to wipe out as many Range Guides as possible. He teams up with one of them, Deneer (Claudia Jennings), to bring down the hegemony of Zirpola and Ankar Moor.  Along the way we're treated to one ham-fisted scene after another. Geez, where to start? How about with Ankar Moor's obvious comparisons to Darth Vader. He dresses in black, was once a Range Guide himself, and now works for an evil emperor...I mean Lord. Then there's the Deathsport itself. Set in a huge coliseum surrounded by cheering crowds--it's all created with canned sound effects and large paintings--the actual game is so lame I hesitate to describe it. Contestants drive fearsome death machines that shoot lasers that vaporize their enemies. Sounds great, doesn't it? It is until you realize these "death machines" are simply dirt bikes covered in molded plastic. Moreover, all they do is drive around popping wheelies and jumping over dirt ramps. Oshay and Deneer compete by running around this dirt obstacle course knocking the bad guys off the bikes, which then explode with big blooming fireballs. We even see one of the riders stumbling around on fire in slow motion. The subsequent escape, and thus the rest of the film, consists of endless chase scenes, explosions, and dialogue so dumb it'll lower your IQ score by fifty points. Will Oshay battle Ankar Moor in the end? Who will win? Who cares?  Whew. You'd have to check out "The Shape of Things to Come" or any of the Italian post-apocalyptic actioners to find a movie that compares with the mind-numbing banality of "Deathsport." Every actor associated with this boilerplate ought to have his or her SAG card seized and burned. It's been awhile since I've seen a film fail on so many levels. Ripping off sound effects and plot points from "Star Wars" is only the tip of the iceberg. Witness, for example, the over the top shenanigans from David McLean as Lord Zirpola. The actor who plays the character, David McLean, looks like a low rent Vic Morrow. His performance consists of threatening underlings when he's not clutching his head and roaring in pain from the "radiation poisoning" that's threatening his sanity. Then there is Claudia Jennings's sultry dance in her birthday suit. O.k., I really liked that part, but I couldn't help suppress a chuckle and a groan when I noticed that her dance was part of a torture devised by Lord Zirpola. The method of torture, you ask? Deneer must sashay through a bunch of dangling Christmas lights encased in plastic. When Zirpola flicks a switch, they cause immense pain. At least that's what I gathered from the ominous music and sound effects. Speaking of the music, the score consists of random synth noises slapped together. It's utter garbage.  Extras on the disc consist of trailers for "Big Bad Mama," "The Capitol Conspiracy," "Knocking on Death's Door," and "Death Race 2000." There's also a talk that lasts for roughly five seconds, long enough for David Carradine to punch out an interviewer who has the temerity to mention the word "Deathsport" to him. I'm kidding. There is no interview, but one could imagine such an incident occurring since the film is so incredibly awful. Still, I'm going to give the movie two stars because of the lovely Jennings and because I can't get enough of these terrible post-apocalyptic flicks. Avoid "Deathsport" like the plague unless you have similar interests.  
 Although my 32-month old loves to watch this movie, it has done nothing to further his interest in the potty. I think it spends too much time focusing on how great diapers are and the quality time Glen gets during diaper changes. It would have been nice too, if maybe Glen tried to go potty a time or two with no success, to show that it's okay not to get it on your first try. I know we have tons of tries before we have success. I agree with other reviewers that don't like that it doesn't address wiping or washing hands. We have ordered Potty Power and it should be here anyday.. 
 I had hoped that this would be a cool film, but as with many of Hollywoods films, it just flat out sucked beyond words that could define it. Basically what we have here is an empty, hollow flim with a miniscule plot.Really though,Smokin' Aces is a huge rip off of other films that were made long ago,and done 100 times better such as Resevior Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Lock Stock and two Smoking Barels and Snatch to name a few. None of the characters were interesting in the least bit and I was astonished that Ray Liotta, Ryan Renolds, Ben Affleck and Alisha Keys(I think that's who it was?) agreed to do this film.If I were them(if we could switch identities for a day) I would have fired my agent for even offering this piece of gragage to me. The film tries to be "ultra cool and stylish" again ripping off the the film formulas of originals done long ago. What it does succeed at doing is making "sleezy,scummy people trendy and cool",yeah...great message.The Neo Nazi Hit men, the crooked cops turned hitmen,the two female assassins and the assasin who makes masks to disguise himself,"I mean...come on!"How much stupider does this film have to get?Well,it doesn't stop there,it all comes complete with an FBI government conspiracy to tie everything in so the unbelievable plot makes sense.I'm all for fiction and fantasy, even for enjoying films that are made soly for entertainment reasons.However,when Hollywood tries to push this kind of stuff onto people by showing some flashy trailers and making the film out to be something it isn't,it can't get much lower,or cheaper than that.I wish I never rented this DVD, it was a total disappointment(not to mention money) and I'm hoping that I can save the rest of you out there from making the same mistake that I did. Avoid Smokin' Aces at all costs, it isn't worth the money that its printed on 
 My husband and I are both history and literature buffs, so we were excited to watch this film when it was released to DVD. We aren't typically hard people to please, but this film was one of the most boring movies that I've seen to date. It's not that I don't appreciate artistic, visually stimulating movies - that have a point. Perhaps, assuming we all knew the story already, the director wanted to impress us with over two hours of lingering shots on grass, water, trees...and more trees. Apart from the lack of any foreword momentum whatsoever (though I will grant the last 45 minutes or so were interesting and possibly worth the slogging required to arrive there), this movie represents revisionist history at its worst. Here we are presented with an idyllic, practically un-fallen and un-corrupted view of the Noble Savage juxtaposed against the muddy, disgusting, conniving white man. Perhaps the writer forgot some of the more violent sides of some Native American life like scalping, or the less-than-environmentally-friendly act of running whole herds of buffalo off cliffs. It's fair to say, as the Post-Colonial talk goes, that Native Americans have been marginalized and misrepresented over the years. But by shifting to the other extreme, don't we fall prey to the same false stereotyping - just going the opposite direction 
 I am an American studying abroad in Buenos Aires and I wanted to advise anyone who is considering buying this book to save their money. I had been using the Time Out guide in the city, which is infinitely better, but I brought this guide on a trip to Colonia and Montevideo because it had much more information. As it turned out, nothing the guide recommended for Montevideo was true or even open. It listed two vegetarian restaurants, one with three locations throughout the city. I spent the better part of a day walking around the city only to find that not a single one of those four was still in existence. I then found a Lebanese restaurant in the guide and walked there, only to find that it wasn't open either. I thought maybe some shopping would improve my mood... but few of the places listed still exist. We couldn't find the reccomended Baar Fun Fun or the Cafe Brasilero. At this point, I tossed the guidebook in the nearest trashcan. At least for Buenos Aires and Uruguay, its much wiser to stick with time out 
 WHAT A WASTE OF FIM! TOO SNIDE FOR MY TASTE. MAYBE IT'D BEEN ENTERTAINING BACK IN THE 60'S, BUT TODAY IT'S ATTEMPT AT CAMP - OR KITSCH - IS JUST TOO THIN 
 I bought this album because I liked her version of Underdog Victorious on Mountain Stage in Winter 2005.  I was disappointed with the version of Underdog Victorious on this album.  Her singing on the Mountain Stage show seemed more energetic and heartfelt whereas this album version seemed flat in comparison.  The album in general just sounds like a really young Sheryl Crow 
 Poor plot, unnecessary ramblings. Potentially interesting drug stories described by a man with a rich vocabulary and nothing else. It didn't keep me interested and I felt like I was dragging my feet everytime I turned a page. I found myself looking for perhaps something deeper and more profound in the book. Instead, I found more stories about mescaline and stupid drug-inpired ramblings 
 I normally wouldn't spend the time to write a review.  This time, I am compelled to warn others not to waste their time.  Beyond Infinity begins as a great idea, and ends with an author so full of his supposed vision, that mere language fails him.  In other words, his images don't come together and the plot explodes.  Trying to find any redeeming value in the last half of his book is extremely difficult.  He creates a world of such strangeness that all "science" is abandoned.  It becomes very much like reading someone doing some serious mind-altering chemicals (e.g. racoon-lke creatures whose intellect spans galaxies - which are all alive and aware - and whose mission to is share their uber-world-view of the pre-eminence of evolution and the failure of the human dream, etc. etc. etc.).  I would quote the book here, but I would probably get slapped with violating some copyright rule.  Please, find another book to spend your time with.  I read a book a week, and I had to struggle to convince myself to not just put it down about once a day and go on to my next book. 
 I liked this book up until the ending.  I expected the judges to be released and taken care of one by one which would have been predictable (it's what I thought was going to happen), but at least satisfying and believable considering the power Grisham gave the CIA throughout this entire book.  Instead, the ending was quite disappointing and pretty much ruined the book for me 
 When my doctor diagnosed my hypothyroidism, my wife bought me this and another book on thyroid disease to help me understand what was happening to me. The authors write with an annoying lack of humility -- the text seemed to be as much about these doctors' superior knowledge as about thyroid disease itself. I was put off by this arrogant tone and did not finish the book. The other book, _The Thyroid Solution_ by Ridha Arem, is a much better choice 
 Utter nonsense. Don't waste your money or your eyesight 
 At first I was very intrigued by this author and his narrative.  The story seemed to have a lot to offer.  But the problem we all have when reading spiritual books is how to separate the wheat from the chaff.  Someone who had done their homework, could undoubtedly, read the literature and put together their own book.  What really separates true experiences from imagination?  And what good is imagination in achieving greater a spiritual connection with the universe?  For me, the deciding factor is, whether or not the work speaks to me.  I set the book down for a few days and meditated on the contents.  As I reviewed the book and it's themes, I am sorry to say, I think it is more likely a scientific reduction of the shamanic experience to an agenda of fighting global warming 
 I read this book and several others on the subject to help myself recover from a painful life-long relationship with an untreated, undiagnosed ADDer. My goal was to understand, and have compassion for those with ADD.  This book seems to be aimed at making those who have to live with ADD or ADHD feel good. In an attempt to make the ADDer feel better, he takes the approach that ADD is an outdated human survival mechanism that causes problems in our more organized society, therefore, it is not a "defect" or something that needs to be treated with medication.   The tendency to pile on fat is also such a mechanism, but that is no reason to consider it a "gift" or not seek ways to overcome it. The reality is that such things can pose very real health risks and the danger is that such opinions can assist those in denial to ignore the consequences of ADD/ADHD behavior on the family's health, happiness, and survival.  He also blames a lot of the increase in ADD on a society that watches TV, and an education system that stifles creativity. Many people try to link ADD with creativity as though one relies on the other. However, there are a lot of us that have grown up in the same environment as those with ADHD, but we manage to remember to pay the bills, we can maintain a job, and we manage to maintain healthy human relationships. And there are many artists, musicians and creative individuals who do not have ADD, and are no less successful for it.  If you are the parent of an ADD/ADHD child, there are some good tips for parenting. But if you are a spouse or child recovering from a disastrous relationship with someone with undiagnosed or untreated ADD, or if you are currently in a relationship with an adult with untreated ADD this book won't help you a bit.  There is no doubt that our society has been bad at helping those with ADD and our attitudes toward the behavior of ADD have caused self-esteem problems. However, the same is true of the overweight issue.  The bottom line is that ADD and ADHD has caused an untold amount of unhappiness for the person with ADD and the family. The behaviors of risk taking, the communication problems that manifest in relationship problems, and the impulsiveness and lack of self control that can lead to emotional or physical abuse are far too serious to be ignored. The exercises in the book are fine, but for anyone facing serious issues because of ADD behavior, think about medication to get the worst of the behavior under control. If medication can help treat it, I say, go for it. Then we can all sit in a circle and sing Kumbayah and rejoice in our "differentness" 
 Ambush Bay is not art.  It is not entertainment.  It is not even interesting. Ambush Bay is without a doubt one of the worst WWII movies ever produced.  The best part of this movie is Robert Mitchum's red cap, worn while he is in the Philippine jungle hiding from Japanese soldiers.  Red cap....  Why not wear universal orange?  I've seen the movie twice.  Once with the sound on.  It was awful.  I watched it again, with the sound off.  It was better this second time.  It had the feel, without sound, of an ok comedy.  With the sound it was pathetic.  Don't both buying it.  Spend your money on something more useful or entertaining.  
 This is the most dumbest story I've ever seen.  It does not make sense and waste of my time to watch it. 
 this movie is flat out doa. great filming great acting. BAD Screenplay! during this year that fight club came out every movie ended with a skitzo type thing, and if you really want to see a good Edward Norton movie see primal fear. this should be on the top 100 dumbest movies of all time list. even if the ending was different that movie would still suck! 
 The one star rating is not for the quality of the performance in the DVD, but rather because this is a repackaging of the "Best of Musikladen" Hall & Oates performance.  Nowhere in this DVD does it state where this supposed concert took place, and the cover photo is not of anything contained in the DVD.   If you are a big Hall & Oates fan you probably already have this DVD.  It's been offered twice before with different cover art.  At least in the past both versions stated that it was the Musikladen TV series performances.  I feel ripped off for buying something that I already own, when the package art ??intentionally?? makes no note of details of the show 
 In the introduction the author states that feminism is the most important discourse of the 20th century.  He recites feminist dogma about men as if it were unquestioned fact, "sustaining unequal material advantage, opportunity, status, and privilege," p-3.  I'm sorry, but I don't believe that feminism and feminist women have any more valid things to contribute to an understanding of men and masculinity than the National Socialists contributed to our understanding of Jews.    The rest of the book continues to be a compilation of feminist men bashing couched in scholarly language.  For example, in essay 8, Naming Men as Men, the author starts out by claiming that many writers use "men" in the titles of their books but actually don't interview men in the text.  The author of this statement then cites feminist women to support his theory.  Much of this essay, like the others, is devoted to women and how men are now supposed to adjust to whatever women want.  In conclusion the authors says that "this chapter has sought ... to identify the gendered nature of power and power relations in contemporary organizations. In other words, it has repeated feminist dogma about men and power.    One flaw that is pervasive is reliance on feminist writers as authorities on men, p-147 for example.  The book is supposed to be about men and masculinitites.  Why do they think that females have any clue about men and masculinity?  Do the authors review men and masculist literature?  Not so you would notice.  In addition, the feminist concept of "the patriarchy" is continually given credence as an accepted standard rather than recognizing it as misandrist propaganda.  A more reasonable approach to understanding men would be to forget the prevalent feminist theories and to start looking at men.    Use of the concept of "the patriarchy" throughout this book is a dead giveaway at it's intent and focus.  As Sam Keen says in "Fire in the Belly, on Being a Man," P-196, "Perhaps the best rule of thumb to use in detecting ideological feminism is to pay close attention to the ideas, moral sentiments, arguments, and mythic history that cluster around the notion of "patriarchy."  "Patriarchy" is the devil term, the code word for the evil empire of men, the masculine conspiracy that has dominated human history since the time of the fall."  In The Masculine Reader, "the patriarchy" is probably the most commonly used word and concept. Anyone wanting to learn about men and masculinity would be far better off reading Sam Keen.   A serious discourse on men and masculinity is badly needed.  Unfortunately this book is very wide of the mark.  You can't learn about men by reading and believing the misandrist theories of anti-men feminism.  A better book real understanding of men is a serious need.   
 This book is an overly-detailed, almost academic discussion of organizational theory.  Some of the basic organizational principles include listing a project's "processes or system[s] into manageable parts" , breaking down projects into  prioritizing projects by how aggravating they are, tackling the #1's first, etc.  Her discussion of how to compose and analyze the daily to-do list is overly-detailed -- for example, calling a student's mother to determine why he didn't show up for class yesterday is an immediate task that just cropped up, while getting in touch with an equipment supplier is "a basic, medium range task."  What does that mean??  And I don't think most of us struggle with figuring out what is really important and what isn't; what we need is something that will help us accomplish what is most important.  The financial planning section is overly detailed -- assess income, analyze fixed expenses, prepare a budget, etc.  I'm consulting a Getting Organized book because I need to get motivated and empowered to plow through the pile of clothes on the floor and the pile of papers on my desk -- This book is better-suited for folks who are already organized and want to be even more so.  This book might be a good choice if you are already reasonably organized and are looking for detailed discussions of the processes that might enable you to become more organized in all aspects of your life.  If you are currently at a lower level of organization, I recommend Don Aslett's books on clutter; for me, they have been much more readable and useful 
 I read the black jewels trilogy on the recommendation of a friend.  Unfortunately I find that the writing is very uneven, and there is not much continuity. It feels somewhat like a mixture of Anne Rice and Jacqueline Carey, with none of the finesse of either.  It would probably appeal to readers of fantasy/romance novels like Cristine Freehan.  There is not much intricacy in the plots, the S&M seem to be thrown in without much thought and the characters have powerful emotions but lack depth or wit.  I do not recommend this book as a good fantasy novel 
 I was honestly pretty excited about this book until I began to read it.  I didn't feel the book did a very good job of giving you any specifics, rather just broad ideas and tid-bits of legal issues and stories.  The book did a great job of plugging the associated website every other page almost.  I went to the website hoping for someone to help find my dream home, filled out all my info, and still have not heard back from anyone.  That was atleast 6 months and counting 
 This book and every other book on self help topics are endless rephrasings of Jesus statement - " Ask and you shall receive ". Why we read these books? Because we are in need. And IF WE ARE CONSCIOUS OF OUR NEED IS THIS SAME NEED WE SHALL RECEIVE. We are always what we are conscious of. That's so simple like that. When I AM conscious of being rich, I AM rich in that very moment. In SPIRIT and so, IN TRUTH, I AM rich. That's all. The proof that I am rich is my total joy and gratefulness. Money in my bank account will materialize soon after, but, first, money must be a fact in spirit. The same with health, relationships, etc. Try this: suppose you are feeling depressed and anxious. Be conscious you are the most happiest person in the world. Right now. Feel  happy beyond your wildest dreams. Not that you will be, but that YOU ARE NOW. And you are. That's all. So, feel you are rich right now. And you are. Apparent money will appear soon in your bank. Ask IS receive. But asking in the conscious of the need is receive the... need - the very thing one is conscious of. Each new book you read about materializing your desires is a proof that you are conscious of your needs and that is your asking and what you receive. This is so simple that you need to be as a little child to believe 
 I'm a fan of real rap, and underground especially, so this isn't the kind of album I usually fu*k with, but I thought say a little something. Just like his bit*h, I mean, his boss, Juelz is an east-coast Mike Jones. Repetitive lyrics just make you tired, and the fact that most of the lyrics at the end of each hit on the beat don't rhyme just make you hate this garbage more. This is like a 50 Cent album, it's just something to break killz up on. The gangstas in the Southside of D.C. don't wear pink. The thugs here in VA don't sport pink when sh*t gets gritty, so why would you claim that you're a soldier when you look like my sister? You're a corporate, formula gangsta. Just being a nigga from the hood with the ability to rap doesn't automatically make you gangsta. Just cause you managed to not get murked doesn't prove how hard you are, so I don't wanna hear it Juelz. This album is just MTV junk so keep it out of your deck 
 People, I love Covenant, they have become one of my favorite groups ever.  This is total tripe compared to everything else they have ever done.  It feels like they either gave up, or ran out of creativity.  If I was them I would be absolutely embarassed by this effort, because they are capable of soooo much more. The only track I like, and I really digit, is 20 Hz.  It is one of my favorite covenant tracks ever. Everything else? Garbage. Just being honest people, don't force yourself to like it just because it is Covenant 
 As a British engineer living in South Africa for 15 years I obviously lived on another planet compared to this lady. Maybe because I worked in black townships and saw things as an outside observer I was not burdened by self loathing and idealistic fantasy that make up much of this work. Sure bad things happen in old wars in Africa or new ones like Iraq, but I can't help feeling that we have been here before. Atrocities happened in Rhodesia but despite the false dawn and liberal accolades that welcomed Mugabe in the same way them as they welcomed Mandela now, we ended up with worse country not a better one. I think that when we all look back on this period in years to come and unburdened by the current plague of political correctness that blights our times, we will realise that those who should ask for forgiveness are the liberal media elites who destroyed South Africa and the hopes of all its people both black and white 
 Allow me to dust off an old cliche and say, Now That's What I Call Crap!  This music (if you could call it that) is on its way out. I don't know what's on the horizon. Hopefully it'll pull music out of the funk it's currently in. Maybe it'll just get worse (if that's even possible...). Either way, ignore this album and series, and check out GOOD music. Classic rock. Punk. (REAL punk, i.e. Ramones, Sex Pistols, Clash, NOT Blink 182 and Simple Plan!) Metal. Hardcore. Alternative. Even some funk and 1980's hip-hop. Many classics are passing you by, kiddies! And you're ignoring them for... ho boy... KAYNE WEST???  Let's just clear this up right now: emo sucks, rap since 1992 sucks, country sucks, pop sucks, R&B sucks. There. I said it. Now take it home and run with it 
 Benford is one of those writers who wax hot and cold.  He is acclaimed to be a science fiction writer's "scientist" in that he deals with a lot of "hard" science.  In this case, the result is pedantic and - the ultimate sin - boring.  The main character was not exciting nor interesting - just smart.  The great experiment and the result were so-so.  I kept waiting for something - ANYTHING - to happen but soon realized that this was it..a globe that was tested, studied and explored. I am reminded of the poem..."this is how the world ends - not with a bang but with a whimper.&quot 
 Jesus, I'm not sure that they could have picked a worse cast for this terrible movie.  The only redeeming thing about it, was Mia Kirshner who gave an amazing performance as elizabeth short.  But besides her I the story was windy and contrived, too many characters and nit enough convincing acting to really pay attention too closely to.  Mia Kirshner is the only reason this movie gets two stars from me.    
 Oh Come on. I've been reading/following this religiously for the last 8 months and have NO relief for my ailments. And I don't mean serious like cancer, just the measurable things like allergies and joint pain. What's up? Ever hear of quack medicine 
 I appreciated this book on modesty because it is an often over-looked subject among Christians.  The book is really short (only 74 pages), and I wish that Pollard had gone into more exegesis on texts like Genesis 3.  I thought the criticisms of the swimsuit industry were valid, but Pollard didn't offer any kind of solution to how a Christian female should dress if she wants to go swimming?  Should we just avoid it all together in fear of causing men to stumble?  Which brings me to another point.  Pollard seems to place a lot of blame on Christian women for wearing clothes that cause men to stumble and on pastors who refuse to teach their congregations about modesty.  On the other hand, he doesn't really place much blame on the men who give the women attention for wearing bikinis.  What is a girl to do?  As far as clothing options, she is already limited by the options availible.  Women's jeans are always made to fit tight in the legs, it is hard to find shirts that aren't tight, a modest bathing suit doesn't exist (according to Pollard), the fashionable skirts are the short ones.  Women my age don't wear these kind of clothes to stand out (at least at my age), but to fit in.  I bring this up because Pollard believes that our clothes should draw unnecessary attention to ourselves.  Overall, I am definately for modesty.  My mom and sister even say I dress like a grandma most of the time, and I agreed with the major premises of this book.  My only complaint is that the book is obviosly directed to men (with greater usage of masculine pronouns and more references to godly men and modesty), but it doesn't criticize the actions of the men as much as it does the women.  Rather than go on and on about how a Christain woman shouldn't dress to cause a man to stumble; I think the book would have been more effective if he also stated that Christian men should stop giving attention to scantaly clad women.  It really bothered me that he compared the issue as another incidence of Eve bringing Adam into sin.  Men should stop expecting women to dress immodestly, and they should also stop objectifying women by referring to the images as "hot" to other men or in the ear-shot of women.  Women do not dress immodestly because they like it, they usually do that because men want them to and its expected of them.  Both men and women should work to fix the problem, and I believe Christian men are just as much to blame as Christian women and the fashion industry. 
 Silone's communist message is outdated. More, he makes the cardinal error to believe that solidarity is a basic human characteristic: 'Bread is made of many grains of corn, wine is made of many grapes, so it means unity. Unity of similar, equal, useful things. Hence truth and fraternity are also things that go well together.' But, man shows only solidarity if there is a 'personal' gain. Pure altruism is absolutely no option in the struggle for survival.  His picture of mankind is static, too rosy and naive. His belief in the proletariat is obsessive: 'the poor are uncontaminated by greed for property.' Hence, he proposes the abolishing of private ownership of land. 'Evil is only everything that prevents millions of people from becoming human.' For Silone, evil is not a basic and intrinsic part of the human character. He doesn't understand that all proletarians want their children to become (not static) doctors, engineers, lawyers, economists ..., in other words 'bourgeois'. In Stalin's Soviet Union, he sees only a fraternity of peasants and workers. The political role of the Catholic Church nowadays is marginalized. In Italy, they even don't have a Christian Party anymore.  Of course, the main character poses certain questions: had that (communist) community not itself become a synagogue? abandoned the critical spirit? the risks of conspirational struggles? His answer is no. He refutes that the communists aspire too to totalitarian power and orthodoxy and that a black inquisition will be followed by a red one. His return to his homeland 'had been basically an attempt to escape that professionalism', and he has the 'hope of one day playing a big role'.  Like a fanatically convinced Christian missionary, he tries desperately to sell his communist gospel to the poor cafoni. Unfortunately, they are terribly conservative ('it has always been so') and his message falls on deaf ears.  What is left in this book are the struggles against a totalitarian (here fascist) regime and against the butchery of war. It is partly very melodramatic (e.g. the confession at the end) and its main symbolism (a marxist apostle disguised as a priest) irrealistic.  I prefer Silone's more direct and less apostolical 'Fontamara' and recommend highly his masterpiece 'Emergency Exit' 
 Please spare us all record company world. I love the Used, but u couldn't give us at least 1 new song? There has to be songs out there that were previously recorded on the 1st 2 cds that didnt make the final cut, no b-sides? no covers? They had a live dvd from their last cd too. I feel bad for the rest of the guys left in the band. I hope they stop charging ppl to be in thier fan club after this. Any must have fan out thier all ready has this. 
 This is one of the most boring books I have ever read in my life!! It was so anticlimatic, which was even more disappointing since I had to force myself to the end hoping something would finally happen!! The author doesn't do a good job with the relationships surrounding the man character Hannah and therefore falls totally short to engross the reader to even care what ultimately ends up happening to her.  It was a total waste of my time and my money 
 I was going to buy this book because it was so highly recommended by Dr. Phil among others. When I checked the reviews at amazon books I decided it would be safer to check it out at my local library and I have to say THANKS FOR THE WARNING. This book was so bad I wanted to throw up. Who would raise their kids like this. Why would you want to make food a control issue and teach your kids animals are disposable. Whats up with the spanking. Why would you beat your own kids! Honestly, it might work but so would hitting them over the head with a 2X4. We are their parents, surely we can do better than that! 
 The answers in this book are way too condensed and simple.  Doesn't thouroughly answer the questions that are brought forth and takes snippets from other books on these topics for its' answers, such as "When Skeptics Ask" and "Case for Christ."   If you are looking for answers to tough questions pick up "When Skeptics Ask" "Case for Christ" "Kingdom of the Cults" and "Evidence that Demands a Verdict"   This book leaves a lot to be desired and expected more being that Ravi was the General Editor of this book and also "Kingdom of the Cults"  
 First, to any stray Zep fans, this book is nothing like the books you're used to reading about the band. The book is written by an associate professor of music, in hideous modern academic jargon. You know, the blocky, obfuscating style the professors deploy to make their subjects or themselves seem more profound than they really are. Examining a Jimmy Page solo note-by-note is of extremely limited interest to anyone but graduate musicology students-and has high music culture declined so much that they now have to fill their syllabi with Zeppelin's catalog? Sure, I'd rather listen to "Gallows Pole" than some atonal serialist composer, but this book is laying it on way too thick. Tedious and unrewarding 
 This book is a waste of money. I received it as a gift so I couldn't return it. It is full of historical mistakes and careless errors. It is not  worth taking the time to point them out 
 this band is terrible. they get worse and worse and people seem to like them more and more....  this is a waste of time, uninspired, irrelevant music, with paltry vocals and "drums" the drummer stinks....the name of the album is Drums not Dead and the drummer stinks.... The pace of the album is horrible, the vocals are whiny and breathy. this band is a transparent attempt to seem relevant. just like all the hipsters from their native williamsburg, brooklyn residence.... i like lots of weird music. there is absolutely nothing in this album that can hold my attention for more than a second (this coming from someone who loves miles davis and godspeed you black emperor and boris, all bands that reach and break the 20 minute mark and still remain interesting)....in fact, after purchasing the songs and trying to listen to it in various situations (ie, as background, while working, while sitting back and closing my eyes and trying to absorb it) i eventually just deleted the songs from my computer...   i couldnt even stand hearing it when it was shuffled with 3000 other songs... steer clear and if you really want such "experimental music" pick up some 70's era Miles Davis. Miles should have named his last few albums Drums not Dead, cuz that group had some freaking rhythm. And if thats too "old" or "outdated" for you, then go buy some animal collective, or aphex twin, or boards of canada, just dont buy this and leave another review giving it 5 stars...please 
 I am not a Henry James fanatic, as a matter of fact, this is the first work of his that I have read, and with that I must say that this novel is horribly written and completely unrealistic in it's portrayal of the child, Maisie and especially her dialogue. I have been assigned to read this for an english class as an undergrad and I have tolerated many a badly executed idea...but never like this. Boring, boring, and more boring. And as a result, I am comnpletely turned off to James other works. I hear his other works are great.....read those first, you may fair better 
 I am a huge fan of Lee since 1979 and have bought every album since then. contrary to what you read above this album is a disappointment for me. Lee is into 'african' at the moment so lots of tribal beats in background if you're into that. There's a great line-up of musicians but unfortunately even they cant do much with the music. The african girl sings Lovely Day - pretty good - makes it her own song. Lee's son plays drums but can't hear any drumming(!) - maybe on the final master they cut out his track? and supposedly co-writes one song. Dave Grusin and Lee plays in Lovely Days with some glimses of Harlequin album - well almost. Patrice Rushen background sings her song Forget me nots - but unfortunately not memorable unlike her original hit in the 80's. Overall nothing memorable and no tunes you can hum along. For this listener, I'll go back to listening to the truly great music from the earlier albums. 
 Although well written and researched, Gail Sheehy's book was a major disappointment. Having experienced many years of discomfort, especially on location, I assumed that somewhere in 'Understanding Men's Passages' I'd find advice on how to treat my chronic hemorrhoids. Alas, not a word. Clint Eastwood made the same mistake, but he cured his by actually reading the book in one sitting 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 Grisham is one of my favorite authors. However this one is not one of his bests! We all understood that he loved Bologna and the culture of Italy. It is a nice written travelogue but this is not what I want to get from a Grisham novel. What about the pace, the adventure, the chase..?  And talking about the end...could it be more simple?   Those who are familiar with Bologna or the Italian Culture, or those willing to visit Italy, you can enjoy but those willing to find a real thrilling novel, try something else 
 I am sad it takes so long to send me my first issue-\ Sure it would be good if I was ever to get one? Dave Tuman New Bern , NC 
 I love Vincent Price and have many of his movies but this one I wish I had not bought. It is really stupid. It was one of his later movies that he probably made just to have work  
 I like these guys alot.I own a bunch of there stuff and love to see them live. I played this Cd a few times liked it at first, but it didn't grow on me at all liked I'd hoped.To cute for me,not spontaneous enough.I feel this cd will be just another dust collector in a short period of time.Just let it rip guys,that's what you do best.Thank god my brother bought this instead of me.I bought live at cow palace (The Dead) great Cd 
 I had high hopes for this novel as a fun summer distraction. The advertised story line seemed to promise a "Flim-flam Man" type plot with some spooky doings thrown in for fun. In fact the story quickly turns into a substandard mystery whodunit. Most disappointing is the author's failure to really develop what could been a very rich assortment of primary and secondary characters. Half way through I realized I just didn't care what happened. The older I get the less willing I am waste time on bad books- there's just too many good ones waiting to be read. 
 Although Neilsen has a lot of good information in here, the information is hidden beneath layers of writing. Every point is repeated several times, and the author is incredibly wordy. As a professional writer, it astounds  me that someone could go on about usability without having the faintest  idea of how to make his own writing usable. If edited properly, this volume  could be reduced to half the size and give exactly the same information.  The passive voice just about slaughters this book. One gets the impression  that the author thinks he must write in this boring, textbook style in  order to be considered "The Book" in the industry. This is  unfortunate, because many readers simply won't make it through this book,  despite the important information it has to impart 
 The Crossing by Cormac McCarthy is an interesting but somewhat confusing look on the early west of America. The story begins with a father and two brothers trying to track and trap a wolf that had crossed over from Mexico. The Wolf is a mother and is supposedly carrying around pups with her. This part was particularly well written, but became confusing when Spanish was being used heavily. In review of this part I believe that there was something deeper in the crossing of the wolf and thought of it as a metaphor to immigration issues. The short-lived story of the capture of the wolf was ended by a cleverly placed trap by one of the sons. 	Instead of killing the wolf as some would have expected (though that would have ended the book rather abruptly) the two sons decided to return the wolf to Mexico. After this happening the brothers go on various adventures including running away with a heartthrob, attempting but failing to join the U.S. army and crossing in and out of Mexico a total of 3 times.  	This was a well written book but there were many useless characters in it that just seemed to distract you from the actual point. The over use of the Spanish language confused me and would confuse anyone who doesn't speak it. I thought this book lacked motivation and suspense, but because of the author's brilliant mastery of the English language he was able to entangle me enough to finish it all the way through 
 With the corporate legal framework in China changing so rapidly, I am afraid that this book is now already hopelessly out of date. Do beware when reading and one has to check and see if things have been changed 
 I wore this shirt just once. It's almost transparent. Not worth it even if you get it for free 
 THIS HAIRSPRAY WAS TOO WET AND TOO STIFF.  IT RUINED MY CLEAN, FRESHLY WASHED HAIR AND MADE MY BLONDE LOCKS STIFF AND DARKER - YUCK!!!!  I LOVE THE VOLUMINIZING SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER AS WELL AS THE VOLUMINIZING FOAM - BUT WHEN I LIGHTLY SPRAYED THE "FINISHING" HAIR SPRAY- IT RUINED EVERYTHING.  I WILL STICK TO AN AREOSOL HAIRSPRAY INSTREAD OF A PUMP.  SORRY JONATHAN :  
 I was dissapointed with the patterns, they were all very interesting and the pictures were beautiful but the yarn use for the patterns was ridiculously expensive. I made a pillow and it ended up being $65.  The patterns also had several misakes in them, I made the slippers and the pattern was incorrect, I brought the book into my yarn shop and they said they do NOT recommend the book to newer knitters due to the multiple pattern errors. Great pictures and good for ideas but not great for a newer knitter 
 So who does the perpetually disingenuous David Brooks speak for? Why do the NY Times & PBS find him interesting? Is he for real or is he an invention of the Liberal establishment?  Hard to tell from this collection of unastounding thoughts. The man does seem to know his audience & demographics though.  Which is really depressing 
 Obviously many people loved this show (it's premature demise making them cling all the more dearly to it). If you've aleady seen the show land like it (or love it), skip this review. There are plenty of glowing reviews that will confirm you opinions.  I came to the how as a fan of the Simpsons and it's many offspring. Reading all the above-mentioned positive reviews made me--a sucker for anything touted as a lost classic--think I'd missed something great in the 1990s.   The one positive thing I can say about the show is that the animation backgrounds are done with a unique and impressionistic flair. I can't say the same about the character designs or the fluidity of motion, but the backgrounds are nice and worth noticing.  But the writing...it's mediocre. I found the humor less subtle than South Park and Beavis and Butthead, to say nothing of the Simpsons and Family Guy. It's not that this is a crude show ('Beavis' and 'Southpark' are more than simply crude), it's just that the jokes are obvious most of the time. And they are never followed up with additional twists they way that can happen with the Simpsons.  The supporting characters (including Doris the makeup lady; the redneck boss guy; the Crocodile Dundee-esqe Australian pretty-boy actor) almost collapse under the weight of the stereotypical behavior, accents and punchlines they labor under. (I'll make an exception for Jay's uber-WASP father, who kind of foreshadows Lois of the Family Guy's parents.)  The best moments are the send-ups of Hollywood flicks that Jay critiques, but these are much too few and far between. I made it through disc one, and when on the first episode of disc two they couldn't even make Los Angeles seem funny, I gave up. Sitting through these things with half a smile on your face hoping for just one or two funny moments isn't worth your time. Some episodes, the funny moments never came. Maybe it got better later on. But it seemed too much like work to me to keep watching this stuff 
 How good was this book????  I don't even remember the story line.  I know I read the book and past it along to a friend, but it sure wasn't memoriable.  Sorry folks, your not going to get a rave from me 
 Over half of this movie consists of scenes taken  from the original 1939 classic film directed by Zoltan Korda. Even those scenes can't disguise the remake's network TV-movie quality. Beau Bridges is generally a good actor,  but he is terribly miscast on this film. Go rent both versions of The Four  Feathers and see it for yourself 
 This book was written in 1969 and tells about how it is better to bury a son or daughter than to have him/her loose their chastity.(pg. 63)  Bishops give this book to teenagers when they have commited a sin without even reading the book themselves, not realizing the contents of this book.  We hope that this message will help teenagers not believe what is written in this book. God is forgiving and loving and in the Bible it says to repent to him, God, not a "elected" man (bishop) who has no training in counseling or phychology to give advice or give you this book.  Page 196 states that "it is better to die in defending ones virtue than to live having lost it without a struggle." Remember, all of this is what the author thinks and not what God thinks. There are no quotes in this book from the Bible, only the books of the LDS church. Please do not read this book for it breeds guilt, sorrow, humiliation, and sadness for the rest of your life. Thank you, a previous LDS member. Been there, done that. Still recovering from 1986 
 I was in college when John Updike published "Rabbit Redux" but I never read it.  I may read it to compare it to the disappointing "Villages". Since I haven't read any of Updike's novels, I felt it was about time.  The brief and humorous description of Cabot City (Beverly) and Haskell's Crossing (Prides Crossing/Bev. Farms) made it momentarily interesting.  However, my dislike of the main character, Owen, made it painful.  One would think that the sexual escapades of a successful businessman might be a quick read, but it was just the opposite.  Owen lacked passion in his extracurricular activities, or for that matter anything in his life.  The one character that I liked, the first wife Phyllis, was "accidently" (suicide?) killed driving to meet her divorce attorney.  I don't think Updike was fond on his main character, Owen, and the writing reflects it. I enjoy a good read, and this wasn't one 
 We absolutely loved "Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs" (I highly recommend it) but this is nowhere near as good.  Most of the story is just rehashing the original book, with a little politically-correct "let's ship the extra food to the hungry" thrown in.  Lame 
 The Riftwar was a good saga.  Pug was good.  Tomas was good.  Arutha was good.  Everything was good.  Then Feist came out with this series...  Anyone who wants to know the plotline for this one just save yourself the money and read the Atlantis attacks comic books by Marvel, the Eternals by Jack Kirby, and the Fantastic #337-340 and then you'll easily see where Feist stole this storyline from.    A dreaming Mad God that influences a world around him, that's buried under a mountain, whose thoughts become reality?/A dreaming Black Celestial from a race of space gods who is buried under a mountain and can control reality around him and is trying to destroy the universe?  C'mon, I can't believe I'm the only who has seen this.  Everyone takes ideals from someone, hence Tolkien syndrome, but to couple it with this sorry book(ie a stupid book where a stupid Pug that throws fireballs but can't dodge them and can't time travel like in other books and can't deal with a minor demon captain)insults the people that made the Dreaming Celestial(KING KIRBY) and the Eternals.  If he was gonna steal ideas, he should have made the entire book worthwhile.  In this book, besides the old guard, Erik is the only guy we really care about.  Characters that were developed in the two lackluster books before are killed off before they have a chance to sign and we're left with characters like Miranda, whom we don't reall any thing for at all.  All in all, a very poor effort in the Serpentwar saga.  Feist gets an A for stealing storylines and an F for originality.  I'll stick to newer guys like Simon R Green, Aaron Mccarty, and Ferrenzano for new takes on fantasy/sci fi. 
 This is the politically correct books on Duke. If you are however honestly and objectively interested in Duke, read instead his My Awakening 
 If you like shallow arguements and can't think yourself out of a paper bag, this is a must read.  Bill use hate speach that will awe the stupid and make the intelligent cry out in frustration.  Remember unlike the government, Bill knows what is best for us....mainly buying his cheap products and buying these third grade readers 
 This book was awful.  I forced myself to finish it because I did not feel right claiming it was the worst book I'd ever read if I had not finished it.  It was a gift, and I was not aware if was the third book in a series (perhaps the cover should be more clear on this matter).  Reading the other books would probably have made some of the confusing parts less so, however the book would still have been awful.  I kept waiting for the author to tie everything together and get to some point or conculsion that he never did.  It reads as if he just stopped writing.  The story was not entertaining in the least with the plot bouncing around all over the place.  I don't claim to be an intellectual so perhaps this book was not meant for me.  If like to be confused and puzzel out books from the first page, read this. Otherwise, I would advise you to take a pass on this one 
 I am very disappointed in this book.   From the Introduction: "Common names for plants can be misleading and do not always distinguish among the species. Additionally a plant known by a common name in one region may have another common name elsewhere, leading to further confusion. However, common names have been retained because they are generally of more interest." Then the book presents the plant alphabetically by common name. Of course this presumes that I even *know* common names for plants I know by botanical nomenclature.  Clearly I was wearing botany blinders when I read the description, saw, "an essential guide for botanists" and thought it might be a good addition to my library. It should be called "Eating the Plants of the Sierra" because it is all about the ethno botany, hardly bothering to offer more than a few one-line descriptions of a "key characteristic" to help you realize that out of a particular group of related plants, some are edible, some are not.   It's ironic that Amazon is pairing this book with Weedon's "Sierra Nevada Flora" because while "Wild Plants" acknowledges that "various keys are adapted from several sources, including ...Weedon." What the book does NOT report is that there are direct remarks in "Wild Plants" that are almost identical to remarks made by Weedon; about Snowplant (Sarcodes sanguinea): Weedon says, "Stalks edible when cooked like asparagus; however this plant is rare and protected by law."; "Wild Plants" says: This fleshy plant is edible when prepared like asparagus. However, this is a protected and rare plant..." adding that you should only eat one in a emergency! I'm still trying to imagine being stuck in a bad situation with only my stove, a steamer and some hollandaise!  IF your primary interest is in learning about native uses of plants, this might be a better book that I realize. Aside from just about everything seeming to be a cure for toothaches or some sort of bleeding, I also learned this "Interesting fact: Small-flowered collinsia was used to make a horse run fast and was used externally for sore flesh." So I guess if you are on a slow horse, bleeding, and happen to ride by some small-flowered collinsia (and recognize it), you are going to be in luck.  Ready to snack on something from the carrot family? Cautiously go through the ways to prepare delicious Lomatium ("Caution: SOME species were too resinous to enjoy") but stop short of reading about Poison Hemlock (described but not illustrated) which is described as "a painless way to die!"  The book actually mentions that some plants are rare, then goes on to suggest that if you want to try eating them you should do so with moderation. "If you decide to harvest plants, it is important to harvest them with wisdom and respect."  Bottom line: this book, with misspelled plant names (a few found so far), minimal identification information, and that odd common-name thing, is not worth $40 unless you are a pharmacist.  
 This book has no idea what should be prioritized and what shouldn't. Also, the narrative is a rambling mess.  Ex: They spend 10 excruciating pages on Stalin's agricultural and industrial reforms, but contrive to cover the entire holocaust in all of 10 LINES! 'Nuff said!  I got a 5 on the AP exam quite comforably, but no thanks to this ridiculous book 
 The title of this book is a misnomer as there is very little about the making of the hydrogen bomb in it. I can't remember the last time I was this disappointed in a book. There are hundreds of pages spent detailing the Soviet spy program during WWII while the USA was trying to build the atomic bomb. The scientists and their contacts and where they met and what they said to each other and what the Soviet scientists did with the information and on and on in mind-numbing minutiae. This information is all well and good, but that's not why I bought the book. The hydrogen bomb isn't touched on for 350 or 400 pages and then it still seems to spend more time on the Soviets and their attempts to catch up to the American program.  The writing is fine, if not stimulating, it just seems to be off track most of the time. I wanted to read about Teller, Oppenheimer, Ulam, Feynman and all the rest and their conversations, disagreements, failures and ultimate successes in creating the hydrogen bomb. What I got was a heavy dose of Klaus Fuchs and the rest who stole every item they could and sold it to the Russians. This is an important story, but it's not the one I wanted to read about and not the story the book purported to tell 
 The voice on the tape is not very engaging, however the story as always is great.  Better to read it to a younger child than to play the tape.  An older child may be better able to follow the story on audio cassette 
 It seems that Mr. Landes tried a bit too hard to write a book rather then an article.  If a good editor worked on this it would have been an intersting article for a magazine such as Smithsonian. Although I bought the book because of seeing if there was any historical perspective, I found that it lacked detail that would have made me connect or say wow. 
 What a disappointment!  I should have know there was something up with this album when Red House (her label) put together a recent anthology of their artists and picked a Gilkyson song from 1999 (by contrast, most other selections were from the artist's most recent album, e.g. Lucy Kaplansky's Thin Red Thread).  This album just oozes her venom which might make her feel better when she's done, but doesn't make me feel good listening to it (even several times since I know some of my favorite music can be an 'acquired taste').  I suspect getting to like this album is like learning to enjoy drinking battery acid.    Want meaningful lyrics AND enjoyable listening?  Buy Lucy Kaplansky - any of her albums is light years better than this one 
 With each book she writes, Jodi Picoult comes down a level in terms of quality.  Rather than narrowing the scope and developing it well, this novel is a pinball machine of ideas, people and issues that never come together.  I kept holding out for an ending that would redeem the rest of the story but was disappointed till the final word 
 "Cube Zero" mearly satisfied my curiousity about what existed outside the CUBE but still leaves a lot of questions unanswered.  Perhaps "CUBE 4" will  answer these questions...someday. Try renting it first 
 Fred Neil was definitely one of the more unique figures in the Greenwich Village folk scene.  In an era when the worlds of folk and rock were anathema to each other, he turned up with his twelve-string guitar after having committed the heresy of writing a hit rock song (Roy Orbison's "Candy Man," of which Neil's own version is included here), and became as much a mainstay of the scene as anyone.    The second half of this collection shows why.  It features some great guitar and harmonica licks alongside Neil's stirring baritone, even working in the occasional electric guitar when folk rock hadn't quite hit the mainstream.  Neil's biggest contribution to that genre, "Everybody's Talkin'," was several years away, but already his contribution to the folk revival was just as important as that evocative cover photo showing him on the title corner suggests.  It's a four-star album, at least.  The problem with this collection is its first half.  Vince Martin's vocals never get any less irritating throughout the album, and then there are the songs themselves.  For the most part, the originals sound like the sort of stereotypical folksinging that was parodied so effectively in the movie "A Mighty Wind."  The catch is, those songs were supposed to be so bad they were good, while these are meant sincerely.  There is a fine line between the sincere and the silly, and an even finer line between poignant and depressing, and most of these songs are quite a way beyond both of those lines.  Neil was fresh from his Brill Building stint at the time, and it shows.  He still had a lot to learn about his new style, and most of his lyrics here sound like the insincere musings of someone who is trying much too hard to be the New Dylan.  The one exception is the title track - "Tear Down the Walls" - but it's been done better elsewhere (notably Judy Collins' live version from a year or so after this one).  Bleecker & MacDougal is now avaiable on its own on CD.  Buy that copy, and leave Tear Down the Walls in the obscurity it deserves 
 Being a student of photojournalizm in Moscow, Russia, I looked for the most complete book on photographic composition that is available. I had studied one book on the subject by the russian author, but knowing that photography in the US is much more developed and professional I was striving to get a book by a professional photographer.  I was disappointed by the book "Photographic Composition" by Tom Grill for a number of reasons:  1. It does not cover all important compositional elements, and those that it covers are not explained in full detail. It does not explain: - how elements with the similar shapes, similar sizes or similar tone interact with each other,  - the reverse perspective effect and its uses, - why right and left sides of the photograph differ and why, how it can be used on practice, - how to balance "weight" of different elements of the photograph, it touches it briefly and furthermore provides an incorrect example, - difference between compositional center and the center of interest, how to balance them if they are in different parts of the photo (does not match each other) - all signs of perspective, it does not say anywhere that overlapping of objects is a clear sign of perspective (trivial as it may sound, it still should be marked in any complete work, especially when the author covers other three elements) - and much much more.  2. It does not use photographs of the best masters to illustrate the topic, neither does it show how composition works in art, which I believe is very important.  3. Most examples are in color, while most ideas on composition are best explained using B&W photographs.  4. Last but not least, composition is about meaning, making a message, not just how to balance different elements within a frame. The book makes this statement, but in my opinion fails to provide poverful examples, while you can fully appreciate the power of composition only by studying powerful photos with good explanation why precisely this photo is good.  OVERALL: I believe that if you want to study composition you want to know all important considerations, not just a few and briefly explained "how-to-quickly-improve-any-photo-you-take". This books fails to provide complete approach to composition and at times can be misleading.  I'd be very grateful if you could recommend me (and other folks that look at our reviews) a more thorough book on composition, I'm sure there must be a good book in english on that subject. Thanks!  P.S. For those who can read in russian I advise a book by A. Lapin "Fotografiya kak..", which compared to the book by Tom Grill explains composition in full 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 After reading two of the author's books Mohammad and Jesus; Islam and the Jews I find that the author is simply promoting anti-Islamic propaganda veiled by doubtful academic umbrella.   I could not verify whether he really was granted a PhD by Alazhar University since his real name is not to be revealed.  Selective quotations from any book holy or otherwise -originally written in a language foreign to the targeted market and audience - throws doubts especially  if the author has vested interest in leading to a certain result.  Hatred among people is the natural result of the circulation of such books.    
 what can you expect from one traitor? hi vill pay for this 
 Had this been the first Linda Fairstein book I'd read, I would never have read another.  Only stubborn refusal to give in allowed me to finish "Final Jeopardy."  I found myself getting frustrated that such interesting premises and plot twists could be written in such a lifeless way.   Also, having met the characters in another novel, I was surprised at how unlikeable they were in this one.  The heroine behaves unprofessionally in her work life, and she is somehow both emotional and cold in her private life.  It was difficult to sympathize with her.  She didn't come across that way in the other book.  There were good things. The short side stories of other sex crimes were interesting, if a little distracting.  The author also does a good job of explaining why someone would want to pursue this particular disturbing career.  You want to like her.  Devoted Fairstein fans may like this book, but reading this one before the others may make it impossible to pick up the next one 
 Stories about the historical oppression and continual discrimination against Aborigines should be told, but it is unfortunate that Morgan is one of those to do it. The book fails as literature simply because it is boring and very poorly written. As such, it does nothing to advance the Aboriginal cause here in Australia, and unfortunately, plays right into the hands of the redneck Hansonites and their views of white racial superiority 
 Just as another anthropologist with a Ph.D. perpetrated a hoax by raping the soul of a culture, while appealing to the drug culture, Wesselman offers a series of Castaneda re-treads, appealing to the masturbatory fantasies of spiritual eunuchs.  Summoning every tired new age clich√© from the Art Bell lexicon, Wesselman is to mysticism what Jackie Collins is to quantum physics 
 This is just a warning to anyone who may actually be thinking about buying this album.  KRS ONE is not a Christian, He did this CD to dupe actual Christians into listening to what his beliefs are.  If you didn't catch it, on the cover of the CD it says Temple of Hip Hop.. and not Temple of God, Hip Hop is a registered religion in which he is a Father/Co-Founder of along with Afrika Bambatta.  They are leaders of the Black Muslims also known as the  5% Nation.  This "Nation" actually believes that the Black man is God and the White man is the Devil.  So before anyone starts givin props to this man for Gods work, you should find out exactly which or what God he is working for.  You're either for Jesus or against him.. I haven't listened to this album completely, but I garauntee that he doesn't Mention the name of Jesus once, in fact in the first track after the intro all he does is brag and boast about how tight KRS One is.. and if he was a Christian then he would be humble.. but Like I said, he's not.. he's a 5% trying to fool the Christian community.  And Christians are Christ Followers because Christ is Lord and Savior... I hope this Review was helpful to somebod 
 For me the only thing this book has going for it is a good title.  I, too, was annoyed with Rebecca telling the story backwards but that wasn't enough for me to dislike the book.  In this Picoult debut, one thing is glaringly clear and it's that the author doesn't write men very well.  All the sections supposedly in the men's point of view--sounds like a woman.  Their thoughts their reasonings sounded feminine--like what a woman thought a man thought like--if that makes any sense.  And quite frankly I didn't care for Joley.  His love for his sister borders incestuous (he wants to be cremated and wore as a necklace so he can be close to her heart?), and his character is never consistent.  For the first half the book he's practically rooting for Jane to leave her husband at any cost and then he doesn't an abrupt about face with no real reason behind it.  Plus, there are sections when I question his mental health.  Was he borderline retarded? Plus, why was he so stunned that she may have slept with his boss?  In his point of view section, he gave her to the man.  He wasn't thinking about his niece then.  I don't have a problem with fifteen-year old Rebecca falls for a twenty year old man, that's normal to have crushes at that age.  But then to have the man fall for her and then consumate the relationship is more than I can stand.  It's called statutory rape.  And yes I understand that Jane fell for her husband at that age, BUT Jane and Oliver waited until she was older before consumating the relationship. The author tries to go through great pains to convince us that Rebecca is not the average fifteen year old--she mature and yada yada.  Since when?  Lord knows her mother will let her talk to any man, encourage her to roll down windows to talk to strangers, let strangers gawk at her.  Then the girl hitchhikes with truckers she knows who want to rape her.  I mean, come on. Jane, on top of being a horrible mother, garnered no sympathy points with me.  Her behavior in front her impressionable child is horrendous.  She teaches her child how steal food from a diner, how to steal money from a car dealer (a bad one), and then have an affair with a man she just met in a bedroom next door to the child.  Whatever.  Then instead of being the parent and putting an end of the relationship or haul Rebecca fast-butt out of there, she meekly goes to Sam and gives him the ultimatium to handle it.  WHAT??  Jane doesn't want a child, she wants a best friend.  Then she susposed to be some sacrifical lamb when she returns home with her husband.  Jane needs therapy--plain and simple. Oliver catches her in bed with another man and literally seconds later he's kissing her.  On what plantet?  I can't tell you how many eye rolls I did for the letters across the nation Joley did.  How do you write a letter to the post office addressed to someone who doesn't live or work there?  This isn't the 1800s.   Bottom line: Oliver and Jane are both abusers who deserve each other.  Nuff said 
 These are great towels if you can get them.  They are very soft and a great price but I ordered them in December and they came in one at a time. Took over 3 months to complete the order and still did not recieve the full order because after 3 months they refunded my money on one towel that was out of stock.  When I ordered them they stated that they were in stock and ready to ship. Buy these only if you have a life time to get the 
 I've enjoyed Trinny and Susannah's other books and picked up quite a few tips from those, but this book has me shaking my head. Worst is the career-dressing advice: it might be fine if you've got an entry-level position, but if you're at a managerial or professional level, forget it! For one thing, Trinny and Susannah seem to have a strong allergy to suits or, for that matter, any clothes that are conservative or classic. Well, trendy doesn't work for everybody, and it doesn't work all the time. Some of their "don'ts" work as well as, or even better, than their "do's". And some sections are overlong; do we really need numerous versions of skiwear and after-ski wear 
 Everyone keeps telling me this is a classic.  I think it's just awful.  It reads like it was written: a rambling, unedited, ill-considered, weakly plotted piece of whimsy jotted down by an ailing old lady... was riding her reputation here - Macabea is just someone who comes and goes.  This novel just isn't finished 
 Having had a Hoover in the past, I was excited to find this one at this price.   I've had it only a year and am now vacuum shopping once again - and WILL NOT be looking at Hoovers.  The parts are plastic and cheap and break easily.  It advertised a power hand tool. It is not. It works on air and when you put it to any material it stops spinning. The upright power tool for carpets also stopped working after about six months.  The hard wood floor tool worked fine - and suction was strong enough - but again the plastic pieces break and the attachments don't stay on like they should, so I spend most of my time with the vacuum re-attaching the pieces.  I would recommend looking elsewhere if you want a vacuum to last 
 I have read several of Hiaasen's books and loved them.  They were very funny.  This one is not.  It is an endless description of naked strippers.  I found the main character, Erin, to be very unappealing.  She is just so stupid.  Her problems are all of her own creation.  And she is not funny.  I think you have to be a man to like this book.  I, as a woman, just found it exceedingly boring.  I kept waiting for it to get funny.  It never did

 This book is a complete slapdash, with none of the verve of quality Regencies.   First of all the book is riddled with errors-they are Simon's half-not his stepsisters. They are clearly related to him, though he treats the girls, and especially the eternally barfing baby, as some rare species of insect. He has as much personality as one of his fine neck cloths. I can't imagine him being a rake-he is so full of himself, leers at every pair of breasts in sight, and is so meticulously dressed all the time that one would doubt he would ever do anything so undiginfied as sweat, let alone copulate. Also, vis a vis the errors in the book, I am sure he does not go around showing his 'labels' all over the place-I am sure the author meant lapels.  As for the heroine, well, what can I say-the crippled heroine left on the shelf and rescued by the rake has been done to death, and done far better elsewhere.  The endless tantrums, dullness of the settings-a room with tall windows, a study, well gee, where is the sumptuous language we expect from a well-written book, are all too dull for words. The endless stream of vomit is also unbearbale, not at all funny.  In fact, I really wonder what people find so amusing or even romantic about adultery  and the social mores that allow men to treat women as little better than chattel. Where marriages of convenience are usually only convenient for the men, who do whatever they like and treat women like doormats.  Austen was highly witty and amusing, but she dealt with the real world and issues too. This is just foolishness, selfishness and hypocrisy. The heroine traps him into marriage to get hold of his sisters as children. He insists he wants to bed her and give her a bottle of an abortifacient just in case because he doesn't want kids and just in case the 'sheath fails'. Revolting.   As if all of this is not repellent enough, what on earth was the author thinking having three couple in the book if we include Rees the composer and his estranged wife. Esme's story is more interesting, but I was really disgusted with the way Simon actually sexually responds to her when her pregnant belly comes into contact with his body. and she is an adulteress, not matter how oyu tryo to dress it up as romance.  I also was appalled at the way that her hero lusts after all the other women quite openly-there is little focus on Henrietta apart from her pretty hair and nice smile. Really gross. I have no idea how the characters fall in love with each other, when they hardly know each other. And no woman in her right mind would wnat to know Simon.   I have to admit I read the books inthe wrong order, Wild Pursuit and then Fool for Love   If you have not read this one, you will not care less about Wild Pursuit's couple, and again, Rees and his wife. And the final resolution to Esme's problems is in that book, but not really a problem. All of these peoole are so selfish and care so little about Regency society with its strict dictates (yes it does seem a lot more Georgian than Regency in many respects, 18th century, as one reviewer said) that nothing is at stake for anyh of the coulles-they thrive on scandal rather than avoid it.  she set up the next books in her series, but failed miserably to write a single book in the series which we could classify as romance.  A romance is a hero and heroine falling in love. This is not a romance. Nor are the others 
 Admission to America's elite colleges is an increasingly trying affair. An academically strong, middle class high school senior with no particular claim on a space, "un-hooked" as it is known, is faced with increasingly long odds of acceptance. The "un-hooked" applicant is squeezed by a dynamic made from increasing applications as more high school seniors go on to college and the colleges' own efforts to expand the applicant pool through increasing financial aid as well as recruiting international students even as they hold the number of places in freshman classes unchanged.  In this environment it is hardly a challenge to find a really sharp kid who was not accepted and also to find some "hooked" applicant who seemed rather less than qualified who was accepted. Venting on this situation provides a good release.   Golden vents well, but is unfortunately short on substance. Lacking quantitative data, the scope and scale of the matter escape Golden.   More importantly, Golden does not attempt to address what seems to be the most pressing question: What do we expect of these elite institutions? Do we require that they be social engineers? If yes, to what degree? Failing  an attempt to answer this question "The Price of Admission" is reduced to a voice only of frustration and angst.  For a more thought provoking read, see Harry Lewis's "Excellence Without a Soul". Lewis is not specifically concerened with admissions, as GOlden is, but Lewis is very much interested in the question of what an education at one of these elite institutions should be. 
 This book purports to study the relation betwen epistemology and technology, but only manages to stutter a few inanities about postmodern skepticism and the information age.  Neither well researched nor well  written, Aliens in America fails to illustrate the phenomena in question in  ways that are accessible to many readers.  Students will doubtless find  this book impenetrable.  Some academics who were fooled by Sokal's famous  hoax in the journal Social Text will probably be fooled again here 
 I don't know how this book managed to get a 4-1/2 star review which is why I bought it.  After seeing an interview with Carl Hiaasen I decided to try his books, starting with his first one.  This is one of the worst books I've ever read.  Hanging the psychiatrist out a window by his feet is too incredible to believe (I had to reread the paragraph to be sure that's what was happening), but then locking the door on a hospital room and having sex in the room while recovering from surgery was the last straw.  After reading 190 pages I finally spared myself the torture of finishing the book.  It found it's way to the trash can.  Don't waste your time on this 
 I really was interested in the topic of Arab history but found the writing so boring I had a hard time staying awake.  I finally gave up.  I would look for another book on this subject 
 Somewhat disappointing as I was looking for a deeper explanation of the fundamental relations, as the book's name implies. Aikido and Tai Chi Chuan are both internal martial arts and I would have thought that the philosophies, techniques & applications would have been described in more detail than maybe the two sentences mentioned in the entire book. A great deal is discussed about the history of the Chinese Martial Arts and its influences into the Japanese martial arts, which is fine and perhaps from which the fundamental relations are drawn from. In this case, the book should have been titled - ..."The Historical Relations." Keep looking elsewhere if you are searching the true fundamental relations.

 This book is way too short for such an interesting topic. Another problem is that it depicts women as main victims of weird medical practices in 19th and early 20th century, which is not entirely true. At those times (and may be true today in some cases also) one would be far better off if one stayed away from medical profession. Also, there are some really hillarious things about treating hysteria which authors didnot bother to mention. For the hystory of vibrators as legitimate medical treatment for hysteria, Rachel Maines has done very good job in dealing with this topic. What is also a pity is that authors didn't pursue various medical superstitions about females and different treatment of females which are present in modern times. For example, nobody questions the articles published in peer reviewed medical journal which state that patient's absolute refusal is "relative contraindication" for performing episiotomy. Is there any other surgical procedure which can be inflicted on a patient against patient's explicitly stated wishes? Or for example the fact that many health insurances cover Viagra but don't cover contraceptives. There are many topics well worth investigation which belog to the topic "Complaints and Disorders : The Sexual Politics of Sickness" which authors have chosen not to address in this pamphlet (can't even call it a book) 
 I loved the first Santa Clause, so I was excited  to see this one.  but it's so lame!  it's like they decided at the last minute to hurry and make this in time for christmas. the storyline is far from solid,  the lines in this one that are supposed to be funny are just flat, and it really doesn't have the warm & cozy 'feel good' that the first one had.  I don't think I'll be seeing #3, after how disappointing this one was.   : 
 I have been struggling to figure out why an author of Jane Smiley's stature would write a book like this.  I find the characters to be the most vacuous bunch of people and I couldn't care less about any of them.  I find the sex to be completely gratuitous and while I share Ms. Smiley's political views, they seem like an anti-war rant.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 Like the other reviewer, I ordered these and was disappointed to find they are not 18/10. Nice looking set, but not the quality I expected. 
 In high school "Stroke You Up" was the jam, so I went downtown and bought the cassette. Let me tell you something: It took me 2 days to listen to it because it was utterly boring. Even "Stroke You Up" became unbearable to listen to. No funk, no groove- just lukewarm soul. That was the first *and* the last time I listened to "Changing Faces." The two chicks who made up "Changing Faces" had airy, monotonous vocals- no edge to their voices at all. Even the album cover looked boring. These chicks had no style or any type of pizzazz at all. Skip this at all costs and get Zhane 
 POOR quality unit.  Worked sometimes, sometimes not.  Gave up and returned it after a couple of weeks of trying it out 
 Well I hope Christ is nicer to Michael than Ronnie was. Ronnie once famously asked which one is mine when visiting Michael at camp, not knowing which of the boys was his adopted son. Presumably on the day of judgement Christ won't ask Michael "Which one are you?"... I've always cut Michael some slack despite his pandering conservative views and his seemingly insatiable thrist to milk his connection to his father for every last dime he can hustle. And in a way it is refreshing to see Michael still throwing himself at Ronnie's cowboy boots even after his passing. Then again there are still dollars to be made which brings us back to this book. The sob story presented here is not without genuine sobs, but I found it all a tad tragic that here is this abandonded boy still trying to win some acceptance from Dad - be it his earthly one or God - and that his method of winning that acceptance is to live on his knees instead of his own two feet. Hopefully Michael's next volume will be when he finds his own voice and his own manhood. 
 The first Saw movie was like a breathe of fresh air to the genre.  It wasn't a PG-13 rated teen fest or a remake of a classic 70's horror film either, and while it wasn't perfect, it still managed to deliver the goods with a little bit of originality thrown in.  Saw II picks up where the first film left off, with Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) playing another game with a group of people; among whom is survivor Amanda (Shawnee Smith) and the son (Erik Knudsen) of crooked detective Eric Matthews (Donnie Wahlberg) who is forced to play along as well.  Replacing James Wan as director, Darren Lynn Bousman ups the ante in terms of grotesqueness and the design of Jigsaw's game, but the story (originally based on an older story by Bousman that was later transformed into Saw II) isn't close to being as engaging as it was the first time around, and besides Bell, Smith, and Wahlberg; the rest of the cast (including a returning Dina Meyer, along with Glen Plummer, 7th Heaven's Beverly Mitchell, Franky G, and Emmanuelle Vaugier) range from grating to awful.  There's some pretty good gore effects, and the scenarios offer some imagination, but Saw II is a far step down from the original.  All in all, Saw II isn't horrible, but it's definitely the worst entry in the series by far 
 I read this book because it says it was a best seller, and the author is supposed to be one of the best at suspense.  With those expectations I was disappointed.  The author relies on gimmicks - like ultra short chapters to make it seem like you're reading faster.  Each chapter is 1 or 2 pages with at least one blank page between, so what looks like a 400 page books is really only a 250 page short novel.  One chapter is literally a cliff-hanger.  The plot's sort of a rehash of H.G. Wells' Island Of Dr. Moreau, borrowing a bit from X-Men comic books.  The mutants are all children who can fly, and they're severely persecuted by their keepers, so perhaps what makes the book appealing to other readers is the suspense derived from the endangered children angle, another cheap gimmick.    The villains are all one-dimensional stereotypes, blindly abandoning all their principles and humanity to profit off the children.  I could point out numerous flaws in style as well - but that's not the point; you could find flaws in better books too.  The point is the book is overrated for hack writing of less quality than many old pulp magazines I've read.  Even the love scenes are corny and seem like one of those cheap romance novels ("My arms were high and tight around his neck.  He pulled me against him and I felt him, all of him, against my thigh . . ."). The author also doesn't seem to understand the geography & terrain of the area he's writing about (for example, a small Sony TV won't receive Denver channels in Gunnison National Forrest, certainly not well enough to recognize faces in long shots as the author describes), and has some weird ideas of horror ("Chain link fence and concertina wire and guard dogs in the middle of the woods were scary enough, but to see the words "U.S. Government" attached to "Trespassers Will Be Shot" made me ill.").  Much more like this is topped off with a liberal dose of hypocrisy:  "The arrogance and amorality of the scientists working here affronted everything I believed in.  I wanted to find one of 'them' and strangle the person with my bare hands."   This is the last time I'll buy a book because it says "best seller."  If you want to read a well-written sci-fi suspense novel in which the protagonist is a child prodigy, I recommend The Fourth R by George O. Smith (ISBN 1557429332 - Also known as The Brain Machine, ISBN 0824014308) 
 I have an older copy of Emily Post's Etiquette that I think is much better written than this version. Yes, I do admire the idea of updating the book to recognize changes since the 1980s, such as the rise in the use of email and cellphones. Nonetheless, I think the book raises these issues without giving much in the way of practical etiquette advice. Want to know something surprising? Letitia Baldrige's new etiquette book does a much better job on this front. Frankly, I'll probably donate the new Post book to clear space on my crowded bookcases 
 Usually a book is redeemable if it has one of two positives: a good plot (even if the writing isn't great) or fantastic writing (even if the plot isn't great). This book had neither. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters, and the so-called hilarity consisted of two jokes (an old woman having sex and spam email) that were dragged out the entire way through the novel. Plus, you can predict everything that's going to happen with every character from page 10.   Usually I pass all of my books along to friends when I'm finished, but this one went straight into the trashcan by the pool. I'm a fan of so-called beach reads but in this case, you'd be better off making a sand castle 
 This is everything that is wrong with party politics in America.  My party - right or wrong.  Forget what is in the best interest of the nation.  Much of the writing and the ideas expressed are roughly equivalent to a junior high school understanding.  Way too much emotion and ranting, with, as I said before, not enough real analysis of what is good for the country.  These people (party politicians) are what is going to destroy America.  And it is happening, at a far faster rate that even Rome fell 
 I tried following the reasoning (what of this precious commodity there was) here, but can only agree with Mr. Steven Tooley: Left-turners already dominate much of society so who does this book think it's enlightening? It's like the Left Wing doesn't know what the Left Wing is doing.  An objective observer can plainly see America moving to a more polarized condition of Redness vs. Blueness. But all the while Redness has a lot of Blueness around the edges and Blueness some Redness. Yes there are the core Bluers and core Redders, but overall, the nation is becoming more homogeneous: Republicratic or Demopublican. Just recall the recent conventions and what each candidate is promising voters to get elected. Sometimes the Redness fella sounds downright Bluish, while Mr. Blueness can wield Reddish rhetoric to appeal to the edges of his dominant color scheme.  In the end this book is not helpful in labeling the GOP as the bad guy or off-color. America is not just Banana-republican, but equally Bananas-democrat. Main point missed with this one-sided Politiconcoction: it all comes from the same Banana plant 
 Mr. Lord could have written a good book.  He has the tools and the know-how, and he did his research.  He made one fatal error, however.  Actually he made not one, but two mistakes.  The first mistake is that his starting point is wrong.  As a trained journalist, he does as a journalist does - he keeps trying to find "dirt", or rather manufacture dirt - all in order to give us a "balanced view".  One can't help feeling, as one reads interview after interview, that Mr. Lord has somehow picked only the disgruntled, caustic and jealous remarks to print.  The second mistake was in underestimating "James Herriot"'s fans, and familys goodwill towards him.  He treats his subject manner as just another subject, as routine grist for the gossip mill, but Alf Wight was not that kind of person. He was a person totally out of Mr. Lord's scope and understanding.  He underestimated Mr. Wight's fans and family's tolerance for having his name besmearched, and, indeed, his son wrote another book in response, a beautiful book about his father, and in it he easily refutes all Mr. Lord's accusations - and turns Mr. Lord into a laughingstock.  Because anybody who has read the two books side by side - which I just did - would realize that Mr. Lord has indeed made a laughingstock of himself.  While there are some good parts to the book, they are very much overshadowed by the other parts.  There are two good chapters - in the middle - which were written factually - the chapters dealing with the content of James Herriot's first books, and the publishing history.  There is a good reason why this is so - Mr. Lord was indeed part of the publishing business and would have been privy to that sort of information.    But much of the book is exactly what he accuses James Herriot of writing - pure fiction.  It would take too long to point out every one of Mr. Lord's mistakes, but I would like to simply write just a few of the many mistakes Mr. Lord makes.  The rest, if you still want to read this book, you could find out for yourself.  The first accusation Mr. Lord makes about James Herriot is that Alf Wight did not write a semi-autobiography, but rather pure fiction.  He maintains that even if this were so, it would not matter, because the books are still entertaining.  With that salve to his conscience, he methodically starts to take apart many stories in an effort to prove them fiction.    His first assertion - that it would not matter if it were actually fiction, is simply not true.  It would matter, and matter a lot, to both his fans and friends and family.  His son says as much in his book- that it would matter a lot if his books are fiction.  Fortunately for us, Mr. Lord does not bring a single proof that could stand up to scrutiny.  His method seems to be - I don't think this story is true, so it's probably not.  That's it.  Not one single proof.  For instance, he says that Alf Wight's memoirs of his war years are fiction - because the dates are wrong.  He says that Alf Wight joined the army in March, 1941, and was discharged two years later, and therefore his story that he was called up to the RAF while his wife was expecting their first child is a fictional story.  His son, in his book "The Real James Herriot" explains that he enlisted in the RAF in March, but was NOT CALLED UP until 15 months later, in November 1942, when his wife was indeed, expecting their first child.  Is it possible his son and wife might know when he joined the RAF better than Mr. Lord?  Especially since Mr. Lord actually admits that he is going from hearsay - since the RAF would not give Mr. Lord access to their records, claiming that they were still classified?  This should be enough of a blooper to discredit Mr. Lord; however, there are many, many more - so many that it would be funny if it were not also very, very sad that someone could so easily print a book full of lies and get away with it (by prefacing all his explanations with "perhaps" he covers himself from libel, I suppose).  Another example of Mr. Lord's innuendos -  he quotes from one of Mr. Herriot's books that James Herriot was taken aback by the red (and squished) face of his newborn son, and asked the nurse if there was something wrong with the child.  Mr. Lord asks how can this story be true if he is a vet?  Just so, explains his son, animals are born much more fully formed than humans are.  (A horse is born already able to walk as soon as he is born).  Mr. Lord falls flat in the mud.  Mr. Lord quotes James Herriot as saying that 90% of his stories are based on real life.  Mr. Lord asks how that can  be - when the Herriot books say that he joined Seigfried's practice in 1937, when he actually started working there in 1941?  Mr. Lord, I think we are ready for a lesson in English.  Do you know what the words "based on true life" means?  "Based" means "based", not "actually, exactly, fact".  When he first started writing, he was hoping to remain anonymous, and therefore disguised his stories so that the people he was writing about would not recognize themselves.  He changed the location of his practice to the Dales, he changed the dates, he even changed the characters - some from a man to a woman, for example.  He put two stories into one, etc. etc.  This all falls under the heading of "based on real life".   There are many, many more examples of this in his book - where he "proves" that James Herriot was writing fiction - and he has no proof whatsoever.  Not even one single time.    If there is one person writing fiction, that person is Mr. Lord.  Mr. Lord spends two entire chapters on a conjecture of how Alf's childhood might have been like - all based on the assumption that Alf had grown up in grinding poverty.  These chapters become almost a farce when we read his sons portrayal of his real childhood - although his parents were not rich they were certainly never poor, and Alf had a very happy childhood.  He also explains the economics of why this was so.  Which puts Mr. Lord's two chapters of conjecture on how Alf's unhappy childhood might have been like in the category it deserves - pure fiction.  While the poverty of the under-class in Glasgow in the 1920's is certainly very sad, it definitely does not belong in a biography of Alf Wight.  Another mistake that Mr. Lord makes is that he constantly contradicts himself.  For example, in one chapter he spends many paragraphs conjecturing on why Alf was always poor, when he should have had a thriving practice - and the fanciful castles he builds in the air are very elaborate indeed.  And yet in another chapter he quotes a neighbor as saying - "oh, they claimed they didn't have any money but that wasn't true.  They had money for everthing - a tennis court, ballet lessons for Rosie, etc."  This came across as a vitriolic statement, but of course in contradiction to his earlier assumption that he was poor.  Mr. Lord, you can't really have it both ways, can you?  Another example - he constantly quotes Eddie Steanton throughout the book, with all kinds of outrageous comments, yet he himself quotes one of Eddie's colleagues "oh, Eddie always exaggerates, you can't believe everything he says".  And later in the book it comes out that Eddie had had a falling out with Alf Wight, and I would assume that his "memories" might be somewhat tainted by those sentiments.  And yet Mr. Lord accepts Mr. Streaton as a fully credible source.  As matters stand now, this book is laughable and barely deserving of a review - except for one thing:  if Mr. Wight's son would not have written his own biography, Mr. Lord's fictious book would have remained as the factual biography of  Alf Wight.  He would have succeeded in besmirching Alf Wight's name with his book full of lies (oh, excuse me, fiction).  The fact that his son wrote his own biography, and a beautiful and moving one at that, has turned Mr. Lord's book into a joke, a book that his fans would not touch with a ten-foot pole, but Mr. Lord did not know that in advance.  He tried to change James Herriot's fans opinion of their idol, by trying to find "dirt" on him, and that was a very low thing.  The fact is that he fortunately did not succeed, but that does not take away from what Mr. Lord tried to do.  Mr. Lord, shame on you 
 We had been researching booster seats for our 2 year old and we found this seat and thought it was an large enough and sturdy enough for our rambunctious son.  Boy, were we wrong.  The first time we put our son in it the seat fell apart.  So we popped it back into place and all he has to do is wiggle a bit and the seat pops out again.  He only weighs 30 pounds and it specs for up to 50....I would definitely not recommend this to anyone.    
 I've read 300 of the 362 pages and I can't be bothered to finish.  Not particularly well written.  The secondary characters are un-developed and annoying... in fact, the same can be said for the main characters.    I don't care what happens to them.  I don't care about finding out what the "mystery" is.  I can't figure out how they could possibly have fallen in love.  The author just springs it on you.  It's a bit insulting to the reader, in fact.    The heroine is passive and whiny... "[spies (or whatever) are following me and I'm going to do nothing about it except wait for them to spring on me at every tourist site and "ruin" the tourist experience for me.]"  This is my first book by this author, and unless I forget her name (it's a very bland, forgettable name) and accidentally buy something by her again, it is the last.  I'm really glad I only paid a buck for it 
 The basic information in this book is invaluable, but the Author's style resembles that of high school student. The book is written in a classic outline style (I'm going to talk about this now), it's impersonal and has cold examples. Dr. Tannen doesn't seem to give much if any of her own realizations, instead she consistantly refers to other experts. I constantly felt as though I was reading a report written for a social psychology class 
 The doll is a great gift for little girls who love dolls.My 6 year old loved the doll.I do not like the way allysens hair sheds when you comb it.When allysen asked when is your birthday? My daughter had to keep repeating herself,when allysen asked what is your name the same thing happened.so my daughter got stuck with Happy New Year as her birthday and sweetie as her name,when you ask Allysen to read her book she asked for a smoothie,She is also very loud,my daughter slept with allysen and carried her around everywhere she went.When allysens batteries died she went back in the box 
 While I know that this book is considered by many to be a great classic, when I read it I literally had to force myself to finish this book over the course of a month, when normally it would have taken me a matter of days. The writing dragged on and on and on with little details and events I could have cared less about. The characters did not appeal to me, except for Claudia and ""SOILER"" she was killed off rather quickly, compared to the rest of the book. The only thing that attracted me to her was her determination and more ruthless personality than Lestat and Louis, who were, in my honest opinion, too effeminite for me to greatly like. I suppose the overall story is interesting, but it is so lost in a web of mind-numbing writing and weak characters that it was impossible for me to enjoy in any way. 
 I'm not a big fan of existentialism to start out with, but I began this play expecting at least to find an interesting theme or philosophy concerning the nature of life and existence.  This work, however, is pure tripe.  Critical appraisal should not even be attempted for this drivel- it's akin to the random scribblings of a two-year old or a mud-splattered canvas.  The drawing on the front cover has more artistic value than this play.  In my mind, it doesn't merit serious consideration and analysis, because it is by nature pure absurdity and nonsense.  Beckett sure accomplished his goal though- look how many reviewers commented on the "extremely difficult themes" and "brilliant artistry" of the play 
 The Big Apple definition in the book is wrong again.  Other guide books have it right, but LET'S GO just doesn't care about accuracy 
 Generic lyrics kill this album. Nothing separates this band from so many others that are coming out 
 As an avid reader of Anne Tyler's works, I found The Tin Can Tree to be a surprising letdown. Over the past year I've read eight of the fourteen books Tyler's written and had greatly enjoyed every other one.  However, I  had to force myself to finish The Tin Can Tree and was sadly disappointed  as to how much I didn't love it.  If you are a fan of Anne Tyler, read it;  maybe you will enjoy it more than I did.  If you have yet to read Anne  Tyler, don't form your opinion on this book.  I suggest reading Celestial  Navigation or Ladder of Years, two of my favorite novels of Anne Tyler's  mastery 
 I love "The number one detective agency" series, and hoped for the same writing quality in this collection of folk tales.  Unfortunately there was no narrative flow, making the stories stilted and un-interesting.  Maybe a narrative explaining the lessons would have helped.  I suggest this book only for those interested in collecting african fable 
 I enjoyed ric's other book "The truth about money", and decided to purchase this book as well.  Firstly, for someone who is looking for a tactical plan and something i can excute upon, this books provides very little help.  Only the last few chapter provided some relevant information, the rest of the book was focusing on the inspire readers to invest, not exactly what i looking for.  Secondly, a lot of the information is a rehash of the truth about money.  I do like ric like a financial advisor, but wouldn't recommend this boo 
 This book appears to be fine for a general review of the Access topics, but is lacking in detail for the test. I found that the book alone would have been totally inadequate for the certification test. The MeasureUp online training had value, but it too was limited. Access 2003 has a sorting and grouping icon, yet what I found was that I needed to use Access 2000 procedures for this and other MeasureUp tasks, without the newer icons. The MeasureUp study guide was well-presented, yet I faced a culture shock on test day. The questions were formatted differently, the questions significantly different than the way MeasureUp presented them. MeasureUp wrote their questions in a clearer manner than the test, but the problem is that I needed to see the questions as they would be on the test. The text is essentially a step-by-step book, not of test-taking value. I will keep it as a reference, which was not my reason for purchasing it. The MeasureUp training was great, but not related to the actual test 
 I found nothing gripping about this story, unlike author's previous work.  Others indicate that there is a reward here, and there may be, but I couldn't stay interested long enough to find it 
 Instructions which come with this item are woefully inadequate to get a person started. Everything I tried to make it work with my iPaq pocket PC resulted in building frustration when it STILL wouldn't work.  I finally decided to set the keyboard aside and went to fold it back up, only it started to break up instead!  The end of all this was that the keyboard wound up in two pieces (roughly) on the floor.  [...] and I will no longer consider ANY bluetooth keyboard for my iPaq 
 Everything reviewer Lisa A. Lassner said below and more.  This book is written like a neverending, obnoxious Cosmo or Glamour article.  It tries to be "girlfriend to girlfriend" and it just comes off as ridiculous.  Everything positive that I got out of "Unmarried to Each Other" was shaken by this book because of its "no legal marriage = no commitment" attitude.  Devoting ONE chapter at the end of the book to alternative couples is just insulting.  It's light on research, light on footnotes and light on reality.  Seriously, get "Unmarried to Each Other: The Essential Guide to Living with Each Other as an Unmarried Couple" instead.  Pair it with "Living Together: A Legal Guide for Unmarried Couples" and you have a winning combination that blows this book out of the water 
 Did not work at all!  had to return it!  We prefer the "Tinkle Toons" potty with a moisture sensor.  the motion sensor on the royal potty did not work 
 As a fan of Black Sabbath, I was disappointed in this book. Rosen had his chance to write a definitive book on Sabbath and failed miserably. His failure however left the door open for two other excellent books to be written. 1. HOW BLACK WAS OUR SABBATH by David Tangye and Graham Wright. (Yea!) 2. NEVER SAY DIE by Garry Sharpe-Young  To the reviewer who said about Rosen's book, there are no better books on Black Sabbath out there, I say bollocks! DO NOT buy Rosen's book until you have gotten HOW BLACK WAS OUR SABBATH and NEVER SAY DIE. Then if you are still hungry for more Sabbath books, I would recommend the Mike Stark book BLACK SABBATH AN ORAL HISTORY and lastly Steve Rosen's appropriately priced book 
 I was looking forward to using this cookbook as the idea of preparing dinner early in the day and having it ready and waiting for me at six o'clock was extremely appealing.  However, I have been extremely disappointed.  All the entrees I have tried have been, in my opinion, overcooked.  Sadly, I am coming to the conclusion that most foods were not meant to be cooked 6-7 hours.  Most of the recipes I tried were a bland mushy mess and there is not one that I would subject my family to again.  My last and final attempt was the Chicken with Beer which was both dry (due to the required baking for 20 minutes in the oven after 3 to 4 hours in the slow cooker on high) and tasteless.  Much to my amazement, one prior reviewer actually liked this recipe!  So maybe its just me.  In any case I am considering givin the slow cooker to Goodwill, along with this cookbook.  There has got to be a better way to simplify the chaos of dinner time preparation 
 On its face, this book seems to be on to something.  The social sciences have long adapted ideas from the natural sciences, so why not look to current natural science and see what it could teach us?  Unfortunately, she misquotes many parts of the scientific theories she examines and takes them in directions that they do not warrant.  This is not good science.  First and foremost, Wheatley completely ignores the fact that the seventeenth century science she disparages was not wrong.  It was incomplete, yes.  But most of the modern theories she explores cover natural phenomenon beyond the margins of our everyday world.  Newtonian mechanics continues to be a very accurate, widely used method.  It is only at the margins - very small objects (quantum mechanics), very large objects (relativity), and very fast objects (special relativity) - that many of the new theories take over.  It might be more appropriate, then, to try to discover how ideas from the new sciences could extend our ideas about leadership and organizations rather than replace them.  The first modern theory she discusses is quantum physics.  She paints a metaphysical world where we all get to create our own realities, where nothing is real outside of our relationships, and where the idea of objective reality is a myth.  This is not what quantum physics says.  It does not say that there isn't an objective world out there.  It says that it behaves in a probabilistic way.  We don't get to create our own realities.  Instead, at the quantum level there is no such thing as passive observation; our observation influences a reality that is already there.  Her treatment of thermodynamics is similarly skewed, and her understanding of open versus closed systems is in places flat wrong.  Similar criticisms for her treatments of the other modern theories.  The conclusions she comes to have value, but they can be found in other books with MUCH more clarity and much better support (see Senge's "The Fifth Discipline" for example).  Wheatley offers what one New York Times op-ed writer termed "quantum mysticism" instead of what could have been a very interesting and thoughtful treatment.  I cannot recommend this book 
 I would have to disagree with the pronouncements the book has to make.  I feel very strongly that the Bible does say much about homosexuality, in the concept of sin.  Thus I myself take a literalistic point of view of the Bible.  I believe the Bible is exactly as it says it is, the word of God, the message of God, to a fallen race--us.  The author, on the other hand,  takes a postmodern, very liberal view toward what the Bible speaks of and what the Bible preaches.  By maintaining a postmodern ideology toward the Bible, the author...as many other post modernists...have stripped away the Bible for what it truly means as God's message to the world.  In this case, the author has stripped away the truth toward homosexuality as viewed of by the Bible.  What do I mean?  Let me explain.    The Bible speaks of sin--those deeds that first manifest upon the soul, then formulates in the mind/body, and then done physically.  Within our souls is a cancer, a cancer that is born from our sinfulness in a sinful world.  It is because of this seed of sin that Christ came into the world through virgin mother as the prophets foretold, died on the cross as the prophets foretold, and rose again on the third day as the prophets foretold.  Sin is then "thought of" in the mind and body.  It is the whisper to do evil in our brains, the easier choice in comparison to the right choice, the lust, the desire, to want that burns in our minds and our hearts.  Then, when it is done, it is done through physical manifestation.  In this case, homosexual acts and actions.  Thus homosexuality is an act born of spiritual sinfulness and acted upon out of physical sinfulness.  However, and this is an important realization that is to be known from the Bible, homosexuality is just one of many sins that tempt and bring us to fall.  This, again, is a difference of opinion between myself and the author of this book.  I do not think that homosexuality is any worse than say gambling, or any better than say abortion.  All sins bring forth a wall between us and God, all sins must be forgiven by the blood of Christ so that we will be cleansed.  For you see, all sins are the same before the eyes of God, because they mare our souls and flesh, however, each sins has their own consequence.  And this is an important understanding toward the homosexual issue.  Homosexuality is just one of many sins and all sins are the same before the eyes of a Holy God, but its consequences are different than say adultery or stealing.  But know well that you and I are sinners too.  Our sinfulness might be different than the homosexuals, but we are still sinners that need the grace of God.  Our sinfulness, too, will have different consequences than the homosexuals, but still we are called to love the sinner (just as God loves us) but hate the sin.  This means that homosexuals should not be treated badly.  This means that homosexuals should be given our friendship.  This means that homosexuals can be loved through the love of friendship and through the love that neighbors are to have as the Bible speaks of.  What do I mean?  Well we are all sinners, and we all need Christ's grace.  If you are a homosexual, why should I judge you because of that homosexuality (as long as deeds such as pedophilea aren't done or other illegal actions).  I have known many a gay in my life and time, but I do not judge them, just as I do not judge those women I know who have had abortions.  Yes I strongly take a Biblical POV, and they know this, but I do not and will not treat any less because that would be a wicked deed.  You can agree to disagree about an action done, in this case homosexuality, without having malice or hatred toward the one who is washed in that sin.  You can give friendship to the homosexual while still maintaining a Biblical belief...the only thing that is called to you is that if he or she wishes to know your belief, you act with fearlessness in speaking the Gospel, the truth.  
 This book is the worst math book I ever had. I had to buy this for my class, but I barely take a look at it because the explanations are so messed up. They do things the long way and do thing more complicated, but the thing that bothers me the most is that their explanations can confuse you more than clarify things. This book has some bad editing because some of the answers in the back are wrong and they don't show the process of the problems. I only use this book for the homework assignments. I usually just jog down what the teachers says, which gives out better explanations which are shorter and clearer ways to do things 
 Admittedly, the reason I read The Bourne Identity had everything to do with how much I enjoyed the recent film of the same name.  However, the book bears very little resemblance to the movie.  So little in fact that I wonder if the writers of the movie recognized the same weaknesses in the book as I did: shoddy writing, a confused and over-complicated plot, and a ridiculously juvenile, untenable love story.  I kept expecting the story to pick up and sweep me away as most great novels do, and I tried to gloss over my own revulsion at the soap opera dialog, and blaze undaunted through the remainder of the book...sort of like sitting through a movie you know you don't like much, but sticking around because you've already spent your money to see it.  The premise of the story is also hampered by a sort of cowboys and indians, good versus evil, over-simplified rationale on the part of Ludlum's characters.  Their motives are described plainly enough throughout the book, yet those motives are difficult to understand because they seem so casually overwrought.  Both Bourne and his nemesis, Carlos are laughably thin characterizations.  So much so that I found myself reminded time and time again of The Young and the Restless...especially when the story involved Marie.  Too often, her character came across as wooden and forced.  I don't buy her devotion to Bourne for a minute.  I was actually hoping that she would turn out to be an undercover agent or a psycho or something...anything to make her character more interesting or believable.  I have heard that the second and third books in this series are better, but The Bourne Identity doesn't give me enough reasons to find out for myself.  This is the only instance I've found where the movie is better than the book.  So, rather than waste four or five days slogging away at another Ludlum "best-seller," I'll just stick to the films, thanks 
 To see my point read Edgar C. Whisenant's "Why The Rapture will be in 1988"  HA-HA-HA-HA!!!!!     Don't be taken in by Tim LaHaye's false prophecies asd broken promises.  This book has stated NOTHING that Christendom has not heard before. It's the same old "The sky is falling", superstitious, nonsense that has been rehashed since biblical times.  For example: 1John 2:18, 4:4 - John thinks he is living in "the last times." He "knows" this because he sees so many antichrists around.  1 Peter 1:5, 7, 20 Peter believed that he was living in the "last times. 1 Peter 4:7 "The end of all things is at hand." James 5:8 James thought that Jesus would return soon.     Readers, has there ever been a time in our world history that the so-called "End Time Signs" did NOT apply?  The Civil War, WWI, WWII, The Could War and all other wars and rumors of war wasn't good enough?  One of the signs of the "mark of the beast" started in 1948.  The Doomsayers were in a tizzy over the modern bar coding system then the Social Security Number system.  Recently, someone "set a bad precedent" by coming up with a novel way to find lost pets via an implanted chip (In the wayward animal of course)     It seems the statute of limitations has not ran out as to when the human race will meet its end and all the Chicken Littles has been making excuses ever since it all began.    2 Peter 3:4 "Where is the promise of his coming?" The author of 2 Peter is aware of the failed expectations of early believers. He knows that Jesus, who was to come soon, didn't come at all. Many have begun to ask, "Where is the promise of his coming?" He tries to cover for Jesus by claiming that "one day with the Lord is as a thousand years."  Mat:-16:28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.  Revelation - 3:11, 22:7, 12, 20 quotes Jesus (1900 years ago) as saying, "Behold, I come quickly.  Lahaye's book reads like tabloid trash. !!!!!      
 Found recipes dated, layout makes it difficult to use and although some of the how-to is useful, its generally from another era. Bought Gourmet cook book instead 
 I love sci fi, and I love Vernor Vinge, but man, I just could not finish this book.  It has some interesting details about future tech and society, but Vinge spends waay too much time on diddly details and the story never. gets. going.  I made it to the last several chapters and could not care less what happened to the characters.  Maybe one day I'll dot the "i" and finish it.  Such a shame, because "A Deepness in the Sky" is just brilliant.  Oh well... if I could write half as well, I'd be happy 
 the script is garbage...as if they made it up as they were going along ( the amount of production goofs prove it).....even a golf ball knows you can stop a train by killing the power to the third rail...the subway chase scene ?...catching a train on a motorcycle ?...the two trains ramming at high speed ? ugh hello !!!this movie was a complete waste of time and to be avoided at all costs......if your into trains by any means, dig into the archives and discover "the taking of pelham one two three 
 This might be of some to someone who could not print out the manual that ships with Reason.  Otherwise, it simply is a lazy rewording of the manual - a functional description of the components.    Whereas the manual might say, "such-and-such a knob does so-and-so" this book says "such-and-such a knob does so-and-so, turn the knob and play a note, see what happens."  Well duh.  Part of what makes it come to over 300 pages is its wide margins printed over with a gratuitous graphic of a level indicator.  Reminds me of a kid's book report they try to fluff out to make  extra pages.  You'd do much better to play around with the turorials that ship with Reason, and visit Propellerhead's website for some real tips, tricks and insights into stuff not covered in this quick and dirty little pamphlet 
 IM not sure where to begin with this review, its not that the book was poorly written, quite the opposite it was a very good piece but it lacked any sort of luster or appeal. It was quite infact extremely boring, by page 300 I could not wait for it to be over and this is weird because up to this point I have LOVED the gunslinger series, they were all very good from front to back. There is way, way, to much about Susanah and the whole thing about her having this baby and it dragged and draged, maybe this series is showing its age im not sure but one thing is for sure it was no Wastelands or Wizzard and Glass. It was a far fetch from those titles and it had barely any excitement. It got to the point where I had to try very hard to pay attention and often I would find I had read a page and not remebered what it was about and had to read it again. Im giving this book 2 out of 5, very poor story line, poor plot however it was written well I can only hope that the next book is better, cmon King give me the feeling Wastelands did, BLOWN AWAY!! rather than tired and exhausted 
 This textbook takes microeconomics which can be explained in a technical, exact manner and makes it abstract and foreign.  This textbook's sentences run-on and lose their direction, confusing the reader...If a reader had a firm understanding of economics prior to this textbook, after reading it, it is certain that they will no longer have the understanding of economics, that they did previously.  It is a travestly when a textbook designed to teach the reader about a certain subject, actually makes them less knowledgeable of the subject.  I must also ask why it is being used to teach university students in different years and programs, when it should not be, for example in my university it is being taught in the following programs  IBBA - Year 1 BBA - Year 2 BAS - Year 3 MBA - Year  
 Out of fairness, I should tell you that I didn't listen to the whole audiobook.  I got about 1/2 way though the first CD and just couldn't stand it anymore.  What I heard was boring and extremely slow moving.  It's read like a "see spot run" story for children, which makes the boring storyline even more boring and I found it to be a bit insulting.  I think an audio book of names and nummbers in the phone book would be more exciting.  Maybe it gets better as it goes along, but I am not willing to endure any more to find out.    
 Drew's Famous Party Music is a joke. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this cd. In the past 3 weeks, I have probably ordered 8 or 9 compilation cd's looking for great music from the 70s, 80s and 90's for a party I am hosting. I read the reviews for the other cd's and they were great, but in my excitement about finding Whoomp there it is and Love Train, I didn't check the reviews for this cd. This CD is not at all what I thought it would be. Trust me, THIS IS NOT THE ONE, it's not even on the list. I was looking for Whoomp there it is, and especially Love Train by the Ojays. Not what I got. I excitedly listened to Whoomp, and I kept saying this doesn't sound right. Something sounds like its missing from the song. So I listened to Love Train, and immediately, I knew that it was not the Ojays singing. I realized that none of the original artists were singing. This is a terrible misrepresentation. I was so disappointed! Thank goodness I listened to the cd before I played it at the party. I would have been horrified. I wish I could give it less than one star and get a refund. Please, please, please DON'T waste your money 
 Her choice of songs are wonderful, and I was going to buy the CD, for my personal favorite, "What are you doing New Years Eve."  After listening to all the songs, I decided NOT to buy the CD as I cannot stand listening to her taking a breath, into the mic all the time. Someone should teach her about not breathing into the microphone, in other words, learn breath control.  She has a beautiful voice. I wish  her well and I would like to buy one of her CD's. But, the ones that I have heard are all the same.  
 We wish we had not wasted our money on this juvenile, violent, lousily acted series. How this survived as many seasons as it did is beyond our comprehension! Our eyes glazed over right from the first segment. We couldn't believe how bad it was. The second segment never made it into the DVD player. What a waste of time 
 This book is soporific.  I fell asleep every time I picked it up.  The opportunity for a meaningful and dynamic book was there but the promise was never kept.  Boring!  It is unlikely that I will read anything else by this author.  Give it to someone you don't like very much 
 Rarely have so many pages been used to convey so little information. This is a very superficial treatment of many subjects. This book offers very little in making language interesting.  I bought this book after reading a review in the New York Times which made it sound interesting. After looking through this book, I suspect the reviewer was put up to writing a favorable review. If you think this book might be interesting, borrow a copy and inspect it before buying. 
 While Kimball does bring up some valid points as to how the counterculture affected the American culture they way it did there doesn't seem to be many (if anything at all) positive things to say about the sixties and what the counterculture inspired.  Many times I felt like his views were unneccesarily derrogatory and never once spoke of anthing that happened in the sixties of any value.  He never once spoke about the Black civil rights movement, of MLK jr., Women's Lib, or any other facet of the cultural revolution of the sixties.  He discredits the sexual revolution as being nothing but a suspension in the development of the sexuality in the authors who promoted it.  He discredits Charles Reich because, as he implies, Reich was unhappy and a repressed (...).  Nowadays, after the sexual revolution, the homophobia of yesteryear is gradually dissapating  and Reich may have been happier during this time as who he is.  While reading this I kept wondering, the cultural revolution of the sixties must have been a result of something.  Perhaps it may have resulted from the time before it, maybe the sixties revolution was creeping under the surface of society all along.  So why discredit it as nothing more than a farce that continues on through today?  Why not accept it for what it was, a reaction to the times before it, an expression of the elephant in the room of post-war America 
 I am puzzled by the title and the contents.    I wanted a book about small houses and how to remodel or decorate them.  This book cannot be more irrelevant.    This book is exclusively about custom built, large (2000 sqft+) houses for people (retired wealthy, or professional double income wealthy) with unlimited budgets who are building their dream home in the country woods.    What really bugged me is that "not so big" in this book really means "not a 5 bedroom MacMansion."  If you are in New York City, Los Angeles, or San Francisco, the featured houses would count as rare gargantuan behemoths.   I thought book editors gave lots of thought to titles, but this title was downright misleading.  
 I would not recommend this book.  It covers some individual cabling components, but it does not have a coherent review chapter that explains "How" to run cable through a building.   It does not cover different situations that might arise in running cable and doesn't have tips on things like, avoiding electric cables and plumbing, how to ensure you have enough cable for the job, etc.  Again, it documents individual components, but it does not cover much of "How" to run cable.  The book does have pointers spread throughout the book, such as dropping a metal bead chain down a stud cavity, then inserting a magnet into the outlet box hole to retrieve the bead chain.  After that, you can attach a pull string to run the cat5 cable.  However, this book seems very disorganized.  It sprinkles tips throughout unrelated chapters.  It repeats concepts frequently in different chapters, and sometimes the repeated topics have discrepancies.  For example, one chapter mentions patch cables should not exceed 10 feet, and a different chapter says patch cables should not exceed 15 feet.  I would NOT recommend this book if you're wanting to learn "How" to run cable.  I would also not recommend this book for anyone wanting to run cable in residential buildings.  This book covers commercial buildings almost exclusively. 
 Literary arrogance at its height, this book takes simple concepts and makes them obtuse.  If that is an accomplishment, then I'll grant the praise.  I would prefer some of her contemporaries like Waugh or Cathers who's prose gives me far more pleasure without the hubris - and in the end teaches me far more about life, and writing.  Don't be intimidated by pedants who call this great, trust your own judgement and the emperor's clothes reveal themselves for what they aren't. 
 Ok I have to tell you, about a year ago I was looking forward to playing a show with this supposedly garage rock group from Denmark, who had been hyped continually.  The album may be good, don't know as I haven't heard it, but they put on one of the most boring live shows I've ever seen, the only standout being a cover song.   Big let down and basically a hipster joke, best part was watching four guys in beatle boots trying to carry a 3oo pound hammond down a set of stairs into the room where the club held their shows.  Honestly I wasn't impressed at all....  
 Scarecrow, Captain Shane Schofield, makes James Bond look like a character in a My Little Pony story.  Tough?  This guy is nicknamed for the criss cross slits cut over his eyes by an evil enemy.  Cool?  This guy urinates liquid nitrogen, nothing can rattle him.  Connected?  The President of the United States tells his National Security advisors and Joint Chiefs to quit questioning Captain Schofield's directions, just do what they are told, short of a nuke of course.  Well for now, anyhow.  If you removed about half of Dirk Pitt's humanity, stirred in enough testosterone to create an outside linebacker for the Bears and heavily caffeinate the result, you might come close to Scarecrow.  Close.  The trouble really is that while the story has possibilities, it is so far over the top with decapitations, earth shattering explosions, and chases with anything from jump-jets to supercars and big rig trucks that the reader is just too weary to follow it.  An intricate plot with dozens of mercenary / bounty hunters following Schofield  to more ends of the earth than I knew there were needs to follow a plot, any plot.  Any one of the stories, back stories, side stories would have been fun but all at once were just stunning, and not in a positive way.  Other things are just weird:  the Author apparently hates Europeans.  French, Swiss, Germans, the Ruskies, all bad, mean, and ugly.  He also has an apparent enmity for both the United States Government, business, and the US military, especially US Special Forces.  He does like the Marines, Schofield is a Marine Officer and is as heroic as all get out.  His fellow Recon Team members, (don't get started on this one), are also seen solely in a positive light.  This must be an Australian thing and I will have to ask my Aussie pals about it.   Did I mention Shane Schofield is bad?  Scarecrow is so bad the Terminator seems a girlyman in comparison.  When he kills the baddies he would rather fling their bodies hundreds of feet onto jagged rocks or smash their heads under vault like doors.  When he does shoot them, he uses his .44 Magnum Desert Eagle auto; Dirty Harry only had a revolver. 
 This is my second Brew Station. I have finally learned my lesson. The first one leaked until the electronics failed (6 months). The second one has leaked from day on. I think this week-end I am going back to the old reliable Mr. Coffeee 
 A superb trumpeter of classical music, Marsalis could not swing his ass. It is a sad commentary of the times that the brilliant horn of Byron Stripling receives scant press, and Marsalis makes the big bucks for playing awful jazz. Harry James: Where are you now that we need you 
 I thought this book started very strong; it set up everything very well, and i could start to see the themes emerging from the work. But then the author decides to have these long-winded conversations with herself that are very hard to follow. She uses hyphens instead of quoation marks to represent dialogue. The major problem with this is she combines more hyphens when she breaks away from conversation to describe how the person is talking or to depict a scene taking place. Sometimes she doesn't even bother to start another paragraph when the dialogue starts back up again. So this results in a very confusing read as it's hard to tell if someone is talking, or if it's a scene, or could it be how they are talking, or is it an aside, or is it just a thought, or maybe this is a convo, and who is talking again, oh, maybe she is describing the surrondings....?   It drove me Crazy 
 Why were the other three released on DVD and not this one?  I would like to complete my set 
 You do not need to read this book to get your kicks out of know what happened before Episode II. Just listen to Samuel Jackson's line, "They just returned from a border dispute on Ansion." That's it. That's what they've been doing. Everything about this book was bad. People dancing with lightsabers? Singing? ach...enough to make a person vomit just by reading the words...pass it PLEAS 
 The premise is intriguing: the Allies have lost WWII, the US has been partitioned, and Nazi atrocities continue in the US and Africa. But Dick spends far too much time developing the backstory through tedious dialogue, and on explaining the factional infighting among German leaders, neither of which advances the plot or tells us about his characters. I also found the use of the I-Ching to reveal the characters' psychology and to create mood to be ineffective and unconvincing, more a reflection of the Alan Watts-style mysticism of the Beats than an outgrowth of anything in Japanese culture; i.e., just a plot device, and a poorly chosen one.  I imagine the admiring portrayal of Japan and of the Japanese characters was brave for its time, but it nonetheless is inflected with a slight contempt: while German science has developed sophisticated plastics, the Japanese continue to make do with wood. But Dick was scarily prescient with his Japanese characters' odd obsession with Americana, such as Mickey Mouse watches; I'd be curious to know to what extent this had begun even in the 50s.  Overall, very disappointing; it doesn't approach my favorite Dick novel, "A Scanner Darkly", a real masterpiece 
 It is odd that my taste buds reported to me the opposite of the reviews here.  I'm disappointed by that, as I paid this premium price based on the 5 star reviews.  I'm old enough to remember "old time" licorice that was sold for 1 cent (even 5 for a penny) and that is the flavor and consistancy that I was looking forward to when I purchased this licorice.  I have some anise spice in my cupboard for baking, and I just tasted it to make sure that I didn't have my spices mixed up.  Based on that comparison; My verdict is that this licorice tastes strongly of anise (NOT licorice).  I thought it was much too soft.  There was no "chew" to it.  It was mushy.  The only thing I can think to compare it with is a soft cheese, such as Havarti.  It is even softer than a mild chedder.   Sorry... only 2 stars from me 
 If you are expecting the Disney's Mary Poppins, you are best making another reading selection.  Unfortunately, my expectations may have tainted my reading experience.  The book is filled with fun imaginative adventures children would enjoy.  However, Mary Poppins is stern and hard.  Her tightly guarded compassionate side does pop up during different events, but overall she treats the Bank's children with a harsh and sometimes demeaning hand 
 The first several books were great, but about half way through, it just turned into porn. I have never minded a little sex in books, but this one is nothing but sex. There's supposed to be a big important vampire meeting/party after the ballet, but Hamilton doesn't even bother to write it, having Anita passed out from too much sex and magic. I lost count of the new people introduced in this book so that Anita could have sex with them. and not just sex, but multiple partner, kinky sex with an audience. This book finally crossed the line where I can't stand it anymore and will be selling the entire series as soon as I go back to selling books.  Anita has collected a harem of who know how many men that only have sex with her, and do whatever she tells them to.   She has created a triumvirate of her, Nathaniel and Damien, but she doesn't take care of them and Damien is forever on the edge of dying because Anita doesn't have enough sex to keep him alive, even though she needs a waiting room and a take-a-number machine for the people she is having sex with.  The preview of the next book features Edward, who's been missing for a long time with a personality transplant. As I read the preview, I just could not see this new Edward. I'm not about to read a new book and see Edward as a different person. Stick a fork in her she's done.   This book should not be sold to minors. The review should come with a warning. I gave it one star, because they won't let you not give it any 
 I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice 
 Is the Internet the last, best hope for the Democratic Party? The authors, who are the  founders and moderators of two popular leftist websites, would argue a most resounding yes. However, I'm not quite convinced that theirs is the best solution, even though they gave a rousing lecture on behalf of their book a few months ago before a friendly audience at a noted New York City-based progressive think tank. And much to their credit, both in their lecture and book, they  have offered at times a thoughtful, occasionally profound, analysis of what is wrong with the Democratic Party. But frankly, I think they've missed the Democratic Party's ongoing woes, which more thoughtful, conservative authors like Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter have noted in their books.  With much regret, I also think that both authors have become part of the problem, since they have ignored the significance of ongoing battles in the global War on (Islamofascist) Terrorism, acting as if these battles had no relevance to current American politics (Daily Kos founder - and co-author of this book - Markos Moulitsas Zuniga has taken a hypocritical stance by opposing Connecticut Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman's reelection due to Lieberman's unwavering support of both Israel and our participation in the War on (Islamofascist) Terrorism, since he and his co-author, Jerome Armstrong, have argued persuasively in their book that Democratic party activists must move beyond single issue politics.). Instead, for example, I have found a more thoughtful analysis of current partisan Democratic Party views on Israel's bloody, but necessary, war against Hezbollah stated eloquently in political pundit - and commentator - Dick Morris' recent column (http://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/Comment/DickMorris/072606.html) co-authored with his wife Eileen McGann, than I have seen from those posting at either www.MyDD.com or www.dailykos.com. Since some of the comments on Israel's current war against both Hamas and Hezbollah  that I have seen posted at www.dailykos.com could be described as rabidly anti-Semitic, then I have to wonder whether potential buyers should purchase this book. My own answer is no, recommending instead, more profound works written by the likes of Dick Morris, Bernard Goldberg, Kevin Phillips, Peter Beinart and Joe Conason, to name but a few, who are more thoughtful scribes across the political spectrum than the authors of "Crashing the Gate: Netroots, Grassroots, and the Rise of People-Powered Politics" 
 I'm engaged and some of the anatomy type explanations were very helpful, that's where the good parts of the book end.  As a man reading this book I felt like every stereotype in society about men being sex-animals with no feeling or regard for anyone was pointed out-and agreed with.  If my sex drive is higher that's my problem, and I need to fix myself.  If our sexual relationship isn't going right it's always the man's fault.  On the flip side, my fiance almost cried as she read the book, feeling that being happy with our sex life and finding satisfaction can't ever happen.  While I haven't been married yet, I believe this is a false belief, that a wonderful sex life can be achieved.  A relationship where each partner is unselfish and aware and sensitive to the needs of their partner.  This book did a poor job of giving anyone who's never experienced a sexual relationship, hope of that ever being a unifying, positive experience for both people 
 I got this book hoping it would maybe give me some recipes for nutritional food, or some kind of food plans for different "diseases".  Instead, no matter what ailment he is talking about, his recommendation is vitamin pills.  Granted, he is not selling them himself and (unfortunately) does not recommend any particular brand(s).  What he does give you is a 2 page layout of the different vitamins etc. and amounts you should be taking every day (from 4-8 pills a day!), plus a few extras for various conditions/diseases.  I have not tried his recommendations myself so I cannot speak to the book's efficacy, but I can say, save yourself the time of reading through the whole book which basically tries to convince you he's right, and skip to page 194 to find out what you need to take, along with whatever he recommends for specific ailments (usually seems to be grape-seed oil).  I do plan to try some of his suggestions, if I can stand swallowing that many pills, but when I saw the title, I expected more about nutrition (food based), than vitamin pill popping 
 I have just listened to the samples available online, and being a native spanish speaker, the gramatical errors I have heard hurt my ears. I am also bringing up my baby bilingual english/spanish, and as someone mentioned in a previous review, mixing the two lenguages goes against the expert's advice, as it creates confusion for the baby 
 I don't know.  It'ts a struggle for her to come up with the next line.  Doesn't feel especially creative, inspired, or notably intelligent.  I read other disappointed reviews people had written about this book, & bought it anyway.  I tend to have avant-garde sensibilities, so I thought I'd enjoy it for its avant-garde qualities.  I really tried to appreiate the experimentality of it, but I couldn't, because I realised I was readin it more for the sake of reading, & because I enjoy reading,than because this book is any good.  I know a lot of unskilled teenagers who write dada-influenced poetry that's much more interesting than this uninspired book; I don't see what makes Anne Carson so special.  1 star because it's not a good book. 1 more star, bringing the total to 2, because I feel bad just giving it 1 star.  At least she wrote something.. 
 This has to be the single worst textbook I have ever seen, in computer science or any other subject, and I don't even know where to begin with my complaints.  First, the book is INCREDIBLY hard to follow since they constantly refere to earlier figures and algorithms simply by giving a number for it(not even a lousy page number), and you have to spend 75% of the time searching for it, only to find another one listed 2 sentences later.  You would think they could have at least been courteous enough to provide a page number.  Still it doesn't beat question 7.24 which states, "use the algorithm", the algorithm as it turns out is printed 20 pages earlier, but I suppose that they figured you have the ability to read their mind and should have known that.  Seconly, they butcher the Java language.  They just use sloppy code and static objects wherever possible, which is the polar opposite of what Java is supposed to be about, but then again, given the wretched state of the rest of the book, this comes as no surprise.  Well, since I only have a limited space to fill, I'll bring it to a close.  Do NOT under any circumstances consider purchasing this book, a dancing dog could teach you more about data structures and algorithms 
 The only reason I'm reviewing this movie now is because I just watched it on TV today. And the only reason I watched it was because nothing else was on. So...  No, let's be fair. I did enjoy Analyze This, I really did, though it wasn't a masterpiece that would remain with me for the rest of my life, or even for the rest of the day. And I do love both Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro; they made a fantastic comedic duo in the first movie. I didn't have very high expectations, though, because I rarely expect too much of sequels. Once again, I was proven right.  Analyze That illustrates perfectly why `sequel' sounds like such a dirty word. The original film had a spark of originality; the sequel merely takes the same idea and the same jokes and tries to make them funny again. But of course, that could never work. It's the same problem with almost every comedic sequel: those who haven't seen the original wouldn't understand the jokes, and those who have already heard them before. And that is why they fail time after time.  So what does this movie have? A great comedic duo, a couple of really funny guys. Yeah, and? Fathers' Day had an even better pair, look what happened to that. A couple of good mafia jokes? Sure, sure. I even cracked a smile on several occasions. But that isn't enough. There are thousands of comedy films out there; not many of them have that special something that makes them memorable, and producers think they'll improve their odds by recycling the ones that work instead of trying to get new ideas. Newsflash: think again. Nobody watches these movies. There's no reason to when you can just watch the original again 
 I rated 2 stars and the price is $2.99. "LET IT WHIP" by the Dazz Band,  2nd is  " CELEBRATION" by Kool and the Gang,  3rd is the "SHAKE YOUR GROOVE THING" Peaches & Herb. The rest of the songs needs to be replace 
 Potential for a great DVD concert, but like so many others out there, they fell flat on their face when it came to the recording quality. If you like monotone, flat leveled music with no definition or separation of highs and lows, and vocal and instrumental, you'll enjoy this.  No solos stand out...in fact, nothing stands out.   My advice...watch the concert, play a cd with another system. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY 
 I found this dictionary almost worthless. It carefully includes rarities like "xebec" and "yawl," but hours of trying to read Catalan with it proved that it lacks many basic words on both the Catalan and English sides. It should have been superseded by the excellent "mini" dictionary published by Enciclop√®dia Catalana, which I discovered later 
 This book is written from the point of view of someone who doesn't like cats. It's amusing but not laugh-out-loud funny 
 If I could have given this a ZERO rating, I would have.  I bought these sheets because they were "deep pocket" sheets.  They have shrunk and no longer fit my bed 
 While this is a well researched and thought-provoking piece of literature, I do have some critical comments to make. Firstly, it is apparent that the author's own holocaust experiences (or more specifically, those of his family) have left him with a vested interest in how the material in this book is presented. Secondly, there is a LOT of content to trawl through to get, in my opinion, a few pieces of interesting material. Finally, the underlying theme or accusation that without IBM the holocaust may not have happened, or would not have been so sever, is (again in my opinion) flawed. As the book shows, IBM certainly made it much easier for the Nazis to locate and identify Jews, it would not have been impossible without IBM.  Having said all this - it was an interesting read and although overly wordy is certainly worth reading 
 I was attracted to this book, because I thought it would give me an historical accounting of personal experiences on the Oregon Trail.  The book does offer that.  However, I had a hard time staying interested.   It was hard keeping track of the characters - if I had a nickle for everytime I turned to the page listing Cast of Characters, I could have paid for the book.  This book moves very slow, there is not much action or suspense. Much time is spent on emotions and personalities.  I can see where some readers would love this book - but it is not my style 
 This is a terrible missues of one of Asimovs greatest novels. The relevance to the novel is only marginal.   Will Smith is (as usual) doing a terrible job at being an action hero. He should have stayed with the sit-coms 
 Or perhaps I should have said Nazi-science. Extremist Budiansky seems to have picked up where the likes of the Nazi-mentality left off. This absurd diatrbe should certainly not be listed amongst any legitimate science writings as it has nothing to do with real science, but rather, the author attempts to pass off his hateful agenda of others, as science; nonsense. Do yourself a favor---save your hard-earned money, you certainly won't be missing anything with this one....except precious time 
 Astonishing to see Amazon promoting this anti-Israel, anti-semitic book, from an  organisation that prides itself on just those prejudices.    This book skews history, totally ignoring the 8, yes 8 times when the Arabs could have got themselves another Palestinian state, ignoring the fact that Jordan already occupies 2/3rds of the original area of Mandate Palestine allocated for a Jewish Homeland by the League of Nations in 1920.   
 The Motely Fool has never shied away from congratulating itself, in an entertaining sort of way.  The trouble comes in when the reality fails to live up to the authors' claims.  Their style of rah-rah anyone-can-make-a-million investing appeals to some novice investors for obvious reasons.  But as Malkiel points out in the classic A Random Walk Down Wall Street, there will always be a few people who have a fortunate run for a few years.  Today, sadly, after the crash of 2000, the Gardners' conclusions in Rule Breakers Rule Makers seem to be more misleading than helpful, especially for someone just starting out.  If investing were only as easy as the Gardners make out then their own "Rule Breaking" portfolio might have continued to work.  They have tried to selectively cite certain of their more recent portfolios to make it appear that they're continuing to "beat the market like a drum", while sweeping under the rug their losing portfolios.  But as the reality of their results stands, they ought to be ashamed of themselves for hyping up stocks and making themselves sound like the next Warren Buffett.    There will always be people on Wall Street like the Gardners, inflating expectations and temporarily taking in some newcomers.  In contrast, real investors like Buffett and Graham are modest about their results.  They stick to a realistic expectation of returns, and realize that today's hot stock is often tomorrow's set of crashed dreams.  A beginning investor would be much better served reading Graham's The Intelligent Investor, or another classic of the Street, rather than being drawn into a charming but unrealistic look at the high hopes of what are ultimately mere self-promoters 
 This book is a feeble attempt to slam a politician. There's nothing constructive here, just liberal whinning. 
 I thought this was a fun read some years back..well-written..hence my first inclination to give it 2 stars, but taking another look..if a man ever wrote about his "repulsion" over sex with an overweight woman, the way Robin describes sex with Michael, we'd be taking to the streets in protest...there was such an unkindness to it..and this was a woman with a dear, overweight friend...I'm changing my mind..back to one star..too much shallow emphasis on looks, money, etc..it's not a race thing..it makes all women look bad. Well, maybe just these women..I'd like to think some of us are different 
 Definetly not one of Stu's best. I think he needs to stick to the Stone Barrington character, or make Rick Barron's adventures a little more interesting. Maybe Stu needs to read a couple James Patterson novels 
 When I purchased "Hog on Ice", I expected a book with hundreds of expressions along with the historical origin of each. The books does indeed have hundreds of expressions and what they mean, but the author, when describing the origin, rarely gives a definite answer. The origins frequently have phrases like, "probably came from", "could have been", "it is likely that", etc. A great book if you only want to be entertained by learning new expressions and the meaning behind some you already know. As a historical reference, however, you may want to check out Garrisons' "Why you Say It" 
 I had great hopes for this book; hope that it would be the first REAL book about clematis for the North American grower.  Don't bother.  The author's style is too casual and cavalier.  There isn't even one really new cultivar.  She should have stayed with photography.  By the way,  I have a HUGE clematis garden. Trust me.  I own every book ever written about clematis! 
 Mr. Winchester takes an interesting subject, collects enough material to make a fine article in, say, National Geographic, and somehow pads it out to several hundred pages in length.  (Case in point, a chapter devoted to how he found an interesting fossil by the seaside while a kid, but loses it, and his journey back to the site of this failure of his to wallow in the misery of this horrible loss. Ick. Self-induldgent.  Boring.)  Worse, still, even where there is a potential for interesting and enlightening material, such as relates, say, to the subject's wife, all Mr. Winchester bothers to give us are some gossipy speculations.  I guess extensive research might have been too time consuming.  Numerous times I considered stopping reading the book because the writing was so dreadful, but the subject was just interesting enough to keep me going, hence my review of two stars.    John McPhee could have covered the actual science of geology way better than Mr. Winchester, and just about any other author could have done a better job of telling the personal story 
 i was inexperienced enough to waste my pocket money on this dam book. i went into the bookstore and the only thing attractive about this book is its cover. i automatically bought this book and made one of my biggest mistakes this year.   the book is slow, and all, ALL, the ONLY thing the book talked about is who married who and had kids, and four uncles married and three of them divorced, married again, some romance that i bet many people find depressing.   my mom made me read this last night, and i just could not keep up, i have seen many reviews, whether positive or negative, cannot hide the fact that the book is hard-to-keep-up, complicated, and confusing. Mrs. Quidlen is a newspaper reporter, and she definitely need to cut out a load of useless scenes and details when writing a novel.  I anounce to every reviewers of this book, to the people who read this book only cuz their school made them to, to not lie and betray your inner feelings about this book, to the boys i suggest they let out their inner anger and frustration inside when writing a report and not let some sexy paragraphs in the book make you feel that the book is "good." To the girls, i dont know what to say to the girls, i have many reviews of this book, and the girls had always gave the book a high score. maybe girls enjoyed flat family and friends relationships more than guys do. and i accept that.  here is this basic profile of this book i have made up, i tried to make them as truthful as to anybody any sex as possible.    |plot- no plot, confusing  |humor- very rare, about 20 pages any funny moments appear.  |age- teen to adult  |dialog/narration- huge continous chunks of narration that sometimes seemed never-ending, then huge chunks of continous dialogs.  |mood- sad, with occasional depressive humor.  |sex- definitely a girl's book.  |details- many useless details such as a scar on someone's body without the description of where the scar is or how did he get that scar, with no details that moves the story forward such as the setting, the main character's age, and personalities, the reader has to figure out the personality of each character by reading their dialogs.  |style- Anna Quidlen's own unique and strange style.    i will end my review here by stressing the fact that future readers must express their real, deep feeling about this book, regardless of the author's other books, and other people's feelings. write only about what YOU feel and what you feel ONLY.  
 The late Julian L. Simon who decimated (and won a bet) with Paul Ehrlich summed up Mr. Gore's effort quite nicely: "The book is as ignorant a collection of cliches as anything ever published on the subject."  And, "Just about every assertion  in the book points in the wrong direction - suggesting that  conditions are getting worse rather than better, which they are."  Mr. Simon then discusses the following subjects on which Mr. Gore was WRONG:  soil erosion; hardwood trees; DDT; Agent Orange; Love Canal.  Finally, Mr. Simon states:  "And the entire book is filled with this sort of environmental gossip, backed by no sources, and contradicted by solid data."     These quotes are from Mr. Simon's "Hoodwinking the Nation" which has some excellent chapters on "media shaped opinion" and the mis-use of statistics, sampling techniques and data which every citizen should read 
 I bought the dvd because I love Prokofiev and Nureyev so I was pretty sure the combination would be great. Is it ever. Margot Fonteyn is also exceptional. I have a version of Romeo & Juliet recorded from A&E network also the Royal Ballet from Covent Garden and must say I had my reservations about Juliet in this version because Alessandra (I forget the rest of her name)was such an innocent Juliet. I'm very glad I have this ballet but admit that I would like to have the later one as well to round out my collection. As far as I know the second isn't on dvd or vhs 
 If you are a fan of the ORIGINAL Empire Records, DON'T buy the Re-Mixed Fan version... it's a big dissappointment.  There are added scenes in the movie, and some of the BEST lines are changed.  Example: When Rex is leaving the store and says "Why don't you all just fade away."  Yeah, he doesn't say that in this version.  I was very dissappointed when I saw this, b/c die-hard Empire fans DON'T want the best lines changed, so this really isn't a "fan re-mix" b/c it changes stuff the fans LOVE!!!  Definitely just buy the regular DVD or VHS version... it's much better as an original, not a re-mix!!! 
 If you're a magician expecting to learn technique, secrets, patter, or gimmicks, then you will regret the day you cracked the cover open.  Stage Mindreading isn't real -- period.  You can fake it, though, quite impressively, and anyone can do it if their performance, confidence, and showmanship is convincing.  This book, however, asserts the phenomena is real and instructs you on the use of color to stimulate your chakra, a psychic energy that flows on your spine. [p.83]  Or, if that doesn't do it for you, you can shake your hands until you experience them shaking. [p.89] Or, by breathing to create vibrational harmony. [p.112]  In short, it's a book for the gullible to be lead by the crackpot.  James Randi and Penn & Teller would have a field day with this one.  Those with any education will recognize the primary technique as simply ignoring or discarding all the stuff that didn't work, and focusing only on the random "successes."  Success rates less than 50% indicate random guessing is more effective.  It's one thing if this was billed as parapsychology or new age, but it's sold as a performance instruction manual -- it's anything but 
 This book may be helpful for some people who want to know more about possible conspiracies. Personally, I believe some of them; but that's not why I purchased this book. This book is highly misrepresented on Trudeau's infomecials. There are no specific recommendations for treatment of any illnes in this book. Only some vague references to start you on a paper chase. There is not even an index in the book to direct you to information on a specific illness. This book is basically another infomercial for his subscription website.

 I purchase several feng shui books and this one was the easiest to understand. However, nothing happened after purchasing several hundred dollars of feng shui items. Instead it seems bad things were happening to me. I junked all the stuff. I think it's total nonsense and more like witchcraft...stay away from it 
 Atheists have a lower divorce rate than born again christians but I guess thats just a fluke hu, Ann. They must be bad people somehow. People like Ann can't be christians because they shame one person for having an affair and then forgive another that is an alcoholic because he's a republican. She speaks to people who want to believe so bad they don't care that she doesn't have a christian bone in her body. True christians don't defame, judge or claime superiority. She doesn't have any idea of what being Jesus-like is. Oh and intelligent design is not science. Science is how Religion is why- They are too different questions 
 The Author doesn't really demonstrate any long term problems of the "hook-up culture" and cites a discredited theory about women's bodies not producing oxytocin when they engage in multiple hookups.  She talks to a few women who have had disappointing relationships but doesn't really provide any compelling evidence in her conclusion 
 Shawn reveals (indirectly) that he is a disloyal Catholic. Now before you rate this review as unhelpful I'll explain why that is relevant: It shows he is a hypocrite and that his book is therefore hypocritical. Now although a hypocrite can get things right, when it comes to morality they usually get things wrong, which Shawn certainly did do in his teachings in this book. For example:  He promotes (and worships) democracy and "liberty" over God. I'm sure some of you Catholics will be like "what? He advocates the Bible in school and school prayer" but that doesn't mean he is advocating it for the right reasons, just as the Pharisees didn't advocate religion and the Old Testament for, ultimately, the right reasons. Now perhaps some of you will think, "Well who cares as long as he is advocating what is right, who cares about his motives." Well he says what his motives are and they go contrary to the Bible, so in the end he is promoting something which is just as self-defeating as liberalism, etc.. He reveals in his book that his motives are to maintain the (publically known) Republican agenda (plus getting the bible and prayer in public schools, etc.), promoting and upholding democracy throughout the world, and indirectly promotes the whitewashed historical teachings and books in public schools (although I'm sure he wouldn't if he really knew more accurately the history of the U.S.)  So, what's wrong with promoting liberty, democracy, and the white wash in schools? Obviously no one wants white wash and most American's know the usual history text books in school are something the inquisitions might have had success using, so I'll move on to liberty and democracy. Liberty in Shawn's eyes INCLUDES the right to promote Catholocism and not just the  traditional religions. For us who are saved and many atheists know that the Catholic religion is a cult, and promoting it is treason (among other things) in our eyes. Now for democracy. The U.S. has a rigged democracy, and it is really an Aristocratic Democracy, everyone knows that, even Shawn, it just slips his mind because he lets himself get majorly distracted.  As an example of Shawn's ignorance of the more complicated parts of U.S. history, and his gullibility, he says in his book that F.D.R. was a democratic leader. Yet many teens in high school know that isn't true having heard his "New Deal". Even wiki acknowledges that that was communistic. He also perpetuates the myth that Islamic terrorists were responsible for twin tower DEMOLITION. Anyone with the net and who knows to double check facts, and who knows the evil side of America's history knows what I mean by "demolition" in reference to 9/11.  He also perpetuates this illogical goal: unity (under democracy) for the sake of it (like just supporting Bush, Jr. regardless of what he says). He doesn't say it but implies it. Unity for the sake of allowing Bush Jr. and the troops in Iraq to have a nice day is stupidity.  And check out this self-centered attitude: "some sick cell of terrorists just attacked my world." Well what happened to the people they attacked, their world, the one that ended that day?  He also picks on Clinton for reasons you can probably guess, as if he was the ONLY bad president. This book is childish, and I don't mean that in a mean way, I mean it's as if it were written by an angry, poorly educated, arrogant preteen who had a good editor.  One thing he does imply, and rightly so, is that the "Koran" is evil. But, big surprise, didn't come out and say that outright, I WONDER WHY?! So much for courage 
 I can't believe anyone liked this book.  I was three quarters through and nothing happened and I was wondering how the last quarter was going to make up for this boring read.  Well it never did and remained boring until the end.  You Michaels fans must know something that I don't and you know what I really don't care.     
 Where is J.B. Jackson when you need him? The spirit of the seemingly unbiased observer of the American built environment, who is said to have said that he never saw a landscape he didn't like, and who extracted a quiet poetry from the most modest, mundane, and - let's face it - sorry of places is strangely missing in this book. And what a shame. Regardless of what side of the sprawl debate you're on, you have to admit that some of the things produced by (and for the sake of) sprawl are, if not awe-inspiring, then at least wonderous. It may be ugly, wasteful, and dehumanizing, but sprawl is America's urban vanguard, and, for all the criticism that has been leveled at it, it remains true that, as Hayden herself acknowledges, "well-educated Americans often lack words for the cultural upheaval caused by rapid sprawl."   What is needed, then, is precisely what A Field Guide to Sprawl isn't: a scientific illumination of what's going on out there. The biggest (though unfortunately not the only) problem with A Field Guide to Sprawl is that it interprets when it should inform; proselytizes and polemicizes what it should explain. Thus in an entry for "duck" we're told not only what a duck is (a building that replicates and serves as an advertisement for the product sold within it), we're told (incredibly), that "while some Americans justify ducks as zany landmarks that help people locate themselves in sprawl, ducks are always out of context and do little to unify neighborhoods." In an entry for "big box" we're told, predictably, I suppose, that "big boxes undercut smaller, local businesses, causing abandoned buildings on Main Streets in older town centers."       Hayden is certainly aware of this criticism. In her introduction, she criticizes the American Planning Association's Glossary of Zoning, Development, and Planning Terms for "playing it safe" by "defining terms for zoning legislation in a neutral way." As an example, she sites the Glossary's definition of "billboard," which, in her eyes is too respectful for avoiding words like "garish" and "aggressive." Indeed, if we look up "billboard" in the index of A Field Guide to Sprawl we're told to see "litter on a stick."  A Field Guide to Sprawl is propaganda for the New Urbanist movement, plain and simple. Further evidence of this is the fact that many of the entries in fact have little to do with sprawl, but are nonetheless keywords in various (hackneyed) New Urbanist discourses. "Ball pork," for example, which "combines ballpark and pork barrel to describe a stadium built with public funds for the use of a privately owned ball team," is, as Hayden herself acknowledges, a largely urban phenomenon, as most new stadiums that get built today get built downtown. Ditto "theming," which, like "ball pork," is associated more with casinos, festival marketplaces, and other downtown developments than with sprawl. "Litter on a stick," "LULU," and "TOAD" are similarly out of place here.    But if A Field Guide to Sprawl is propaganda, what useless propaganda it is. This is the second problem with the book. It is poorly researched, and shockingly naive. Almost every entry in A Field Guide to Sprawl raised an eyebrow. In the entry for "manufactured housing" we're told that "manufactured housing contributes to sprawl because . . . units are often crowded together." In the photograph that illustrates the entry for "low density," we see a subdivision of about ten houses per acre (the intended subject of the picture), set in a landscape of farmhouses, each of which takes up about five acres (the intended background of the picture). Hayden's case against the "snout house" is that it's "difficult to see residents' activities since protruding garages take up most of the street frontage," and that it fails the "Trick-or-Treat Test," which measures how easily children can find the house's door. Moreover we're supposed to take solace in the fact that the city of Portland criminalized snout houses by limiting garage-frontage.      Moreover, A Field Guide to Sprawl is photographed poorly. Not only is the grainy, 35mm quality of the photographs mediocre at best, they don't do nearly enough to illustrate the entries. The photograph accompanying "strip," for example, is an aerial photograph of two gas stations. Accompanying "putting parsley round the pig" are some wildly colored plants lining a fairway. These pictures do not sing.       Are there exceptions? Of course. "Mall glut" is an illuminating concept and Jim Wark's aerial photo of a mall with "room to grow" is perfect. "Leapfrog," "groundcover," and "alligator" are also fascinating, but looking at them only wets the pallette. Granted, it's only a lexicon, but how about a few diagrams? How about some maps? How about some annotation? How about some history?    Hopefully, someone will steal Dolores Hayden's great idea and redo this book the way it should have been done (I nominate Atilier Bow-Wow). Again, Hayden's insight that "words such as city, suburb, and countryside no longer capture the reality of real estate development in the United States" couldn't be more true. J.B. Jackson, where are you when we need you?       
 As a student of cinema and history, I am amazed at the attention this book on the popular Indian cinema has been able to garner. The book is full of such obvious howlers as for instance the translation of BR Chopra's "Naya Daur" as not the "New Epoch" but as the "New  Race". It seems that the writer has been somewhat overwhelmed by the  rural tonga race included in the film. I wonder if, with that kind of  understanding of the broadly "Hindustani" language, it is really  possible to write the kind of seminal film and cultural study that this  book is being so unabashedly advertised as by the likes of Robert Stam and  the OUPs of this planet. Having gone through the book I have been able to  find at least 71 similar mistakes. Just because India is far off and  Hindustani an unknown quantity, one doesn't have to jump to Ms  Chakravarty's defence 
 If I could give this book zero stars, I would do so. There's barely a plot: the protagonist, Janie, marries three men and kills the last one because he gets rabies. The end. Janie is the ultimate antiheroin. She comes off as this oppressed little wife who takes forever to speak out against her husbands. It would have been better if Alice Walker had not "found" Zora Hurston and brought this awful book back into the public. 
 John Dunning's "Booked to Die" was a New York Times best seller, and also won the prestigious Nero Wolfe Award.  It is one in his series of Denver police procedurals featuring homicide detective Cliff Janeway.  Dunning, who lives in Denver, Colorado,owned the Old Algonquin Bookstore in Denver for many years, and "Booked to Die," (duh!) is set in the world of rare and collectible books.  I really found it an interesting world to enter, and learned quite a bit about it before the book was done.  But do I believe the designated villain, a book dealer, really would have killed?  Not on your life.  And do I believe anyone would kill over some valuable books?  Not on your life.  Of course, I realize that in the current world, it must require great imagination to write a mystery that doesn't feature as villain a ruthless drug dealer with friends in high places; still, one of the first requirements of a mystery, for me at least, is at least temporary believability.  Dunning writes well, he does well by Denver, and, as previously noted, the book trade. He's a thorough-going professional, and the story keeps trucking along, rented U-Haul and all.  As, "I drove south, into the coming snowstorm.  I thought about the U-Haul truck and the mileage that Bobby Westfall had racked up.  I thought about Greenwald and the screwed-up Ballards and the turtle-faced man.  Snow began to crust around the edges of my windshield.  The road was getting slick."  Still, the book has a paint by numbers feel to me, or rather it has no feeling, to me.  Supporting characters are cut from the finest cardboard. I'd say the book didn't touch my emotions, but that wouldn't be entirely true.  It left me with a bad feeling.  Consider: the first love interest deserts Janeway without a word when he leaves the police force.  A woman who's met up with the book's actual designated bad guy in an unpleasant way is a total senseless irrational coward, keeping herself and everybody else in continuous jeopardy.  Suspicion is cast on the book's later love interest, a ploy that's been used untold times by writers better than Dunning.  And a 19-year old female character, introduced only to be killed shortly, is made a Glaswegian Scot, no less, and stuck with the given name of Elspeth Pride, known as"Pinky" by her friends. For heaven's sake, if you're giving a character only 30 pages to live, at least give her a humane name.  My yiddische grandmother, whom I loved, used to say of someone she disliked," he should live and be well."  After that came an unpoken sentence: "But not in my vicinity."  Dunning should write and be well, but not in my vicinity.    
 I didn't know when I ordered this that it was such an old book. It's not that the kitchens are bad but the book and the rooms in it are so dated. I feel that I did not get my money's worth. I assumed that the book would give me some fresher ideas than these. A real disappointment 
 Don't waste your time on this 
 Unfortunately this book has no foundation. The author is lacking in credibility and is a member of several forums that exploit people. The central message of the bible is love and the central message of this author is exploitation. A shame that this was ever printed 
 Hey, look at my review title, I'm playing the historical race card too! Before we compare our pesky scorned eurocentric models and archetypes to Afrocentric 'black/negroid' models and archetypes, let us look at the basic 'historical/cultural' facts. First, the Egyptians, Phoenicians and Carthaginians which inhabitated the northern fringe of Africa and Asia, and did influence the Hellenes,  were Semitic/Hamitic peoples....NOT negroid....Eventually the black Nubians did rule over a later Ancient Egypt for a time, but this was past the cultural mingling  stages between the Hamitic Egyptians and the Ancient Hellenes.  Minoan Crete knew of the Egyptians. Crete never depicted the Egyptians with black/negroid features. If anything, they bore a slight resemblance to the Minoans.  This guy's farfetched theories do not add up, they are riddled with obvious contradictions and totally bogus assumptions.  Athena is Semitic before she is black. Though she had braided hair in some depictions, she was not dark in complexion or ample in the facial features. A straight nose, not a wide nose.  Better yet she was neither Semitic, or black...but Greek. Seeing it is the Ancient Greeks who worshipped her....NOT the Semites or blacks.            
 When I bought this book, I was looking for info on how to price a photo assignment for sale.  The title and short abstract of the book led me to believe this would be a great reference for my purposes.  However, when I  got the book, the first few paragraphs pointed out that its focus was on  assignment stock photography, not for pricing photo assignments in which  the finished prints are to be sold to individual clients.  If I were  submitting stock photos to publishers, it would be a great reference for  me.  It gets 2 stars only because it didn't suit my purposes at the time 
 This is a nice coffee table picture book. However, when a specific behavior issue comes up about my dog's behavior the text is lacking. Wish the author would give more specifics on the select topics covered in this book. Not an on the spot survival kit 
 DREAM CATCHER, by Margaret A. Salinger, is easily the most loathsome book I've read in a decade.  Ms. Salinger, J. D. Salinger's daughter, is so unsympathettic an individual that by the halfway mark of this disjointed and far-too-long narrative, I was finding fresh cause for disgust on every page.  Her parents weren't perfect, no, but my sympathies are with them nonetheless.  Ms. Salinger's problems are often normal growing pains.  When they are not, they stem largely from being the product of an unhappy marriage and from the isolation of a rural upbringing (as has been noted in other reviews).  Her problems are decidedly not due to her father's celebrity, a non-issue as he has so laboriously avoided those trappings for decades.  Ms. Salinger is a malcontent: she can't stand her parents' attention; she can't stand her parents' perceived neglect.  She is a hypocrit: she steals $150 from her brother's bank account (for which she never expresses any remorse) to pay for an abortion, but years later, pregnant again, single and with no appreciable income, stridently condemns her father for mentioning abortion as an option.  She is self-destructive: her initial bouts of "madness" are clearly alcohol-related blackouts, yet it never occurs to her to stop drinking.  She has reached middle-age still believing that every bad thing that ever happened to her is someone else's fault, and this is both the saddest and most annnoying part of the book.  Ms. Salinger is not a tremendously talented writer.  However, she is done an atrocious disservice by her editors.  The footnotes are silly, the narrative digressive to the point at times of incoherence, some of Ms. Salinger's comments nonsensical.  In a passage quoted here by other reviewers, in which Holden Caufield imagines himself a catcher in the rye, Ms. Salinger writes: "When I read this passage as an adult with a child of my own, my first reaction was outrage...Where were the grown-ups? Why are those kids allowed to play so close to the edge of a cliff?"  Hmmm...I thought that passage was the fantasy of a fictitous, troubled teenager.  Perhaps J. D.'s intent there was to write not a parenting tip, but something true to Holden's character.  If the purposes of writing this memoir were, as Ms. Salinger claims, for personal catharsis and as a lesson for her son, both those aims would have been fully realized by completing the manuscript and handing it directly to her son.  Ms. Salinger does more than that, however.  She publishes.  And this smacks not only of cashing in on her surname with the only form of her writing ever likely to see the light of day, but of a vindictive slap in her father's face, yet another round in a family feud from which we'd all best keep our distance 
 My favorite from this one had to be the fat guy's comment -- "I'd be a rich man if I had a dime for every hour i've spent auditing Pentagon departments" -- what - he doesn't make more than $0.10 per hour?  In 1987?  Give me a break.  Yes, these are great page turners.  But the dialog is absolutely horrendous.    Shakespeare, he is not.   
 Ultimately nothing more than a snuff film for girls who like to get it on with the same sex via an alpha male vessel, Spikester goes to great lengths to make his locker room-talk experiment seem a product greater than the sum of its parts. Coffin-size office floors, psychic monkey sidekicks, a cabinet that spills onto an exit ramp, dysfunctional imps who made faces at the dinner table when they were kids and the "faces" stuck, Pinocchio fetishes. Watching "Being John Malkovich" appears to be a bit like going to a carnival put on by Aphex Twin. I'd rather drill holes through my kneecaps so I can whistle while I walk 
 The slide tray, after several months usage (no more than twenty times total) wont slide back in.  There seems to be no access to the slide mechanism to try to fix it.  
 Of the three boxes I ordered, over 35% arrived broken.  When Amazon replaced the broken glasses, the new box arrived with 2 of 6 glasses broken 
 this book is another one not worth buying.  It is funny that non intiates like to write books about a religion they do not have a firm grasp of knowledge of 
 I wish this book was written better. You could tell that it was her very first time trying to write a story. I kept waiting for something to happen yet I feel like she was whining the whole tme 
 I had my twins at 35 after fertility treatments and still had a difficult time relating to the woman in this book. Not because I like things sugar-coated or pretend that motherhood is always a bed of roses. But for a far better written realistic account of how tough new babies can be on your psyche,read Anne Lamott's Operating Insructions. Judith Newman had a charmed life, with the full time nanny and never bothering to breastfeed even one week,even though the babies were preemies and one had very serious weight gain issues for months.There are some funny lines, but mostly I just found myself disgusted with her and being happy i checked it out from the library instead of buying it 
 I've picked stuff outta my nose after a long ride which contained more character and advice than this claptrap.  1 star because "No Stars" was not an option .. 
 If you want to spend 4 times as much money, 8 times as much time, and 12 times as much frustration trying to serve something that your guests will ultimately "politely refuse"--THEN BUY THIS BOOK! The author clearly has NO CLUE that "less is often more. 
 When I picked up True Believer, I was anticipating a good mystery as well as the chance to empathize with sensitively drawn characters.  Neither panned out.  This book is boring.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no mystery.  Too much detail and not enough substance.  Not sure what the point of the story was as I didn't get it 
 how did heppner publish this mess of ideas and words? unreadable. possibly the worst book i have ever read. ever. ick 
 I recently saw Danielle Steel interviewed and was impressed that she had raised 9 children, lost a son to suicide, and did so much humanitarian work.  I'm not a fan of this type of novel but thought I would give it a try since I was so impressed with her in the interview.  There were two things that drove me nuts about this book, the most annoying of which was her repetition of words and phrases, often right on the same page.  "He was going to ask Carole" and then in the next paragraph, "He had decided to ask Carole."  The second most annoying thing was all the cliches.  It isn't often that I roll my eyes while reading a book.  I also think she spends way too much time with her superficial descriptions of places and people and not enough time having them do things.  I like the way other authors develop their characters by showing us how they behave, react and what they say in different situations.  I think having a character kick a dog (3 words) tells you a whole lot more about them than 50 pages of superficial drivel, which this book is full of.  I think Danielle Steel is a remarkable woman, but as an author, at least of this particular book, I don't see the magic or talent I expected from a person who has been called, "the world's most popular author."  447 pages.  Two days.  That's time I could have used elsewhere, feeding the hungry or ministering to the poor or sick.  OK, probably just reading another book 
 Edward Burns is a talented actor, but as a writer/director he seems to specialize in myopic boorish "male chick flicks" (McFlicks?). Halfway through this film I thought ,"hey,noone's going to give me back those 45 minutes" and put the DVD back in the box. You've seen it all before,and if you care about these shallow cliched characters,perhaps you'll have a good time (watching the film was like being with relatives you don't care for). Me,I'll look for him in "Private Ryan" and kick myself for opening the DVD! 
 I hardly know how to begin. First, I guess, the history: the Franklin Expedition provided one of the most enduring mysteries of arctic exploration. The fate of the crew was finally determined when some of their well preserved bodies were found on the ice and autopsies done. Bad bear meat seemed the main culprit -- in short food poisoning. This is not to discount the suffering that must have been their lot when their ship was trapped in the ice.  But this book! It's probably 600 pages too long, and yes, I did wade through it, but I found myself constantly wondering why I was bothering. The plot thread into the "thing" on the ice and Francis Crozier's  mental ruminations became, for me, tedious in the extreme. The constant descriptions of the suffering of the men, the slide into the depravity of cannibalism, the whole "what's out there?" just became burdensome. And the mysterious Eskimo girl with no tongue? Please! I suppose that when someone devotes enough time to a book to write over 700 pages, you almost owe them a read. I kept thinking "it'll improve," right up until the end... when it didn't.  Reviews say Simmons is an eloquent and beautiful writer. Maybe so. But not here. Not for me in this book. The size and heft of the novel make it great for a door stop or to press flowers in. It's not one that you'd want to re-read 
 This is just more bland mainstream electronica from FS. If you like Prodigy, Chem Bros. and Crystal Meth. you'll probably like this too. But if you like actual artists like Aphex Twin and Amon Tobin, you'll be very bored with this indeed 
 Having watched this film three times since 1996,I keep revisiting it hoping that maybe something in me would change to make me like this film more,but it hasn't!!!When a movie wins nine Academy Awards I think,maybe the "intelligentia" knows better.They don't!!!This film is positively plodding. The acting or the screenplay is not anything exceptional in any way.(No small wonder that Fiennes and Scott-Thomas were beat out!)I am a person who is usually moved by what I see,but the more I view this picture,the more I realize why the SEINFELD show dedicated a whole episode to their hate of this movie.When I revisit the nominees for 1996 I see what a weak field this film was up against,but certainly FARGO,SHINE,SECRETS AND LIES and even JERRY MAGUIRE were more compelling than this 3-hour bore.To each his/her own.You will either love it or hate it.I preferred the latter vehemently 
 I am a huge Janet Evanovich fan; this is not one of her better stories.  The book jacket summary sounded very interesting to me, it had real potential to be a lighthearted, intriguing romance.  The book started out decent enough, I immediately liked the main character, Cate, and fell for her and her crazy Irish family.  At the same time I was falling for the Madigan's I was introduced to a not so loveable character, Patrick Pugg.  This guy is so annoying it really takes away from the rest of the story.  I feel he was inserted into the story to garner some laughs; unfortunately he had the opposite effect on me.  He constantly refers to himself in the third person, everything is "Pugg this" and "Pugg that."  It was exhausting and exasperating to read!  He had absolutely zero redeeming qualities; any normal person would have sprayed this guy with mace and taken out a restraining order.  For you Plum fans, think of all the faults and quirks of the character Albert Kloughn, add a few more, than multiply and magnify by 100.    The rest of the characters were endearing and likeable.  Kellen McBride is a loveable hero and it's easy to see why he and Cate are so attracted to one another.  The whole mystery of the missing drag queen roommate and the other surprises (don't want to spoil anything) also had some potential, but ended up falling flat for me.  The ending and the wrap up of the mystery was completely unbelievable and ridiculous.  And just when I'd think it couldn't get any more far fetched, it would.   While I know this is fiction, and I appreciate the land of make believe, I always prefer a little reality in my books.  The humor and the dialogue seemed really forced and childish to me.  Nothing in this book made me laugh out loud, like I normally do with a Janet read, I barely smiled at some parts.  Another problem with this story was the introduction of yet another dog.  I was happy this one didn't resort to the normal dog antics, but the dog thing is getting a bit stale for me.  Not the worst book I have read, but far from the best. If you're dying to read this book, I recommend borrowing it from a friend or your local library.  
 The face of power tells the tale of a young man and his nonsensical and often anti-social behavior somehow leading him to a higher knowledge.  Matt Guest clearly has a problem with the opposite sex and identifies with his female relationships as "energy draining".  His account of romantically embracing a close male friend in a kiss is most certainly his moment of clarity.  It would have been more honest of a read if he just accepted his homosexuality and moved on.  Instead the reader is given uninspiring pieces of drivel such as, "where do all the birds go when they die"?  This book came highly recommended and sadly it offered nothing useful or even mildly entertaining.  However, if you like self-indulgent, sexually confused, new age ramblings, then you'll love this book 
 This unit satisfies in its GPS functionality, but is problematic elsewhere.  When I decided to purchase a GPS, I decided to spend the extra money and get a integrated handsfree bluetooth unit for my phone (Motorola RAZR V3).  The bluetooth connection was easy to set up and reliably would find my phone and connect.  Unfortunately, the bluetooth connection would disconnect after about five minutes, even though the 6000T would still show the unit and phone as connected.  Customer service was no help.... it seems their script only includes the instructions "download the latest software" (I already had) and "reset the unit" (didn't help).    Second problem:  the unit started turning itself off randomly (actually, it went into "Sleep Mode") while driving down the road.  The customer service response?  You are correct.... "download the latest software" (I already had) and "reset the unit" (didn't help).    I finally complained loudly enough that they told me to send the unit in for repair (at my expense, of course).  I received it back and the bluetooth feature was not repaired.  Their solution for the unit randomly going into Sleep Mode?  They turned off the power management so the unit would not go into Sleep Mode under any circumstance.  Well, I suppose that IS a solution, but a pretty crappy one since, if you forget to power down the unit manually when you leave the vehicle, the GPS battery will be totally drained when you get back in the car.  I expected MUCH better at this price point.  Shoulda gone with Garmin 
 A fun read, but you'll finish it in under an hour and it doesn't really lend itself to a re-read. Even the pictures are more glance at them once then move on icons than bits of art you'll ponder for more than a second.   On the other the book would make a fun gift for the guy that fixes your computer for you. If you're already yelling "Hey! I take care my own computer. Sheesh!", then you probably already own the book. Heck, I bought it. So if you don't already own it and just have to buy it, read it carefully and then wrap it up as a silly gift to someone else 
 I was somewhat entertained watching this movie, John Travolta made it more interesting that it would have without him. However, it did not really impress me very much. It's the kind of movie to see only once, it's definetely not a collector's item. 
 Perhaps the lesson one can learn from this album is not to buy an album because of one song  . . . you heard in a commercial.  I bought this album and found out that I have been duped again. Is it wrong for me to assume that an album I take a chance on can have two good songs on it?  I wasn't expecting this to be Moby, but even so I was caught off-guard by how abysmal this album is.    After a couple of listens I found that I don't like any other song on the album and even "Breathe" is becoming quite tiresome.  There is no "hidden gem" on this album, just one slightly-less-than-mediocre song after another. "Telepopmusik" is an appropriate name for the band that phoned-in this effort 
 Other reviews fairly reflected my feelings about the system. My complaint is the range from the base set to the handset. I live in a fairly large townhome. My baseset is at the front of the first floor and one of the handsets is at the rear of the second floor. The distance is only 80' plus 12' up. The handset can not communicate at that range. This is a normal house with regard to heating ducts, electrical wiring, etc.  AT&T cusomter service was great when I first brought this to their attention and even sent me a new base unit. I also tried different handsets, all to no avail 
 I was looking for this binder to really help organize me and I didn't feel like it did so much.  It is just a binder with some pockets in it, but it didn't give me any ideas on how to organize.  If you're one to go through magazines and do a lot of clipping and searching of pictures, this binder might be great, but I already had a good idea of what I wanted so I didn't do all of that.  I had a good idea of what I wanted, i just needed help organizing everything 
 This book does not describe the evolution of consciousness but rather the evolution of unconsciousness.  It describes the work scientists have done in determining the limitations and inaccuracies in consciousness thought.  This is useful in helping frame something as poorly defined as consciousness.  However, mostly you can get this from your Psyc101 text.  The worst is at the end where Ornstein introduces a sort of Sufi mysticism as a substitute for the reason he believes is so flawed.  This is a poor substitute that falls apart at the first rational question, why should I believe this new system which has no evidence for it, as opposed to any other?  You know the book is flawed when a single paragraph he quotes from William James "Varieties of the Religious Experience" has more insight than the rest of the book.  Readers who are interested in what Ornstein is trying to commmunicate are better served by reading William James 
 I found that the author's philosophical ramblings were as uninformative as they were boring. I recommend this book to those suffering from insomnia 
 I don't know why this William Styron is trying to lie on my great great grandfather.  Needless to say I am a decendant of Nat Turner and it bothers me that this author is trying to lie to make this book more interesting.  I cannot say for certainty that my grandfather was not gay or that he didn't like white women and neither can this author but I can say that Nat Turner was married and had children and I am a decendant of that union!  As far as EVERYONE knows he was NOT gay and he certainly loved his African American Wife.  William Styron had no reason to portray him as such other than to make this book more appealing and that detracts from Nat Turner because it was a falsity.  Other than that idiotic portrayl the book was good 
 so very boring... i gave up halfway in. i usually hate to leave books unfinished but i felt like it was a waste of my time. my sister liked it though. 
 I'm a Cash fan, and have many albums, but this was a disappointment to me. They say everything on this album was previously unreleased.... I think there is a reason for that. If you're a diehard fan with his entire catalog, then you'll probably want to pick this up, but to the average Cash fan, save the $14 for something else. 
 This has to be pretty much the most worthless book I've ever encountered. It details a vast "conspiracy" against the American people on the part of every reputable scientist who has ever walked on this earth (as vs. Dr. Carter's tame circle of quacks, who are of course perfect in Dr. Carter's estimation despite the fact that their so-called "studies" violate every principle of double-blind controlled research). If you are an adherent of wishy-washy new age "therapies" or you believe that the U.S. government is covering up the "fact" that UFO's are visiting our planet, you'll love this book. If you know a single bit of science, buy this book only for the comic effect 
 First of all, let me say that I absolutely loved Reindeer Room 1 and 2.  They are the best holiday albums I've ever heard--upbeat but edgy, perfect for a hip holiday party.   Over the years, my husband and I have purchased copies for my family and his, and many of our friends.   Everyone has loved both CDs; in fact, Reindeer Room 1 is my father's favorite CD.  He plays it year round!  And so I been eagerly watching for a Reindeer Room 3.  We all have.  We could hardly wait--how could it be anything but fantastic?  Alas, Reindeer Room 3 is the single worst album I have ever purchased.  It is so bad that it seemed to be a parody of itself (especially the accompanying DVD).  I gave it to my dad for Christmas, and none of us liked a single song.  We were all heartbroken.  So, take my advice... do not, under any circumstances, buy this album.  You will be very, very sorry!  
 Reading the posted reviews here, is like revisting the ballessssss white liberals who are portrayed in this preschool-level, skewered portrayal of the 60's. White = BAD (you can finish the equation.)  For those considering Hi, Mom whether for purchase or rental, be sure to watch it with your (white) wife and then project her  into DePalma's puerile depiction of a liberal couple, attending an all black drama (except for DeNiro who conveniently is portraying the viscious hunky cop). Then witness her being raped and mauled while you are beaten. Why? Because you are white!  Stupidity not worthy of further commentary 
 This is a great book, if you want your child to think of all kinds of great things you can do with your hands.  but..If you are looking for a book to teach your child WHY you should not hit or anything about feeling and emotions involve in hitting than this is NOT the book for you 
 I was incredibly disappointed by this superficial book masquerading as scholarship and hiding behind manipulated or massaged statistics. All of these yahoos who think this is a solid piece of research need to read more about the subject.  The book argues that foreign occupation is the problem. This is a necessary though insufficient condition. This does not explain suicide bombings without occupation and occupations without suicide bombing. Furthermore, the book tries to pursuade you with statistics that do not hold up the central hypothesis. Finally, how do you have  a book that completely ignores all the work on terrorism that existed before it... The book duplicates the work that Bruce Hoffman (of Rand Corporation) did in the Atlantic Monthly two years previously and yet he is not cited. This is intellectually dishonest to say the least.  The author has a terrific PR machine but for a seriously interested person, skip this one and read one of the better reviewed books on the subject 
 I thought this book was very well researched, however, I was disappointed to see that 30 pages are notes and bibliography in a book that is 310 pages in length.  This book could also use another good edit for several 'snags' that I encountered.  Otherwise it is a good read 
 I have been a Dean Koontz fan for years. When he is at his best, heis books are VERY good. I used to think that even when he's formulaic, at least his books are always entertaining. Recently, I've had to reevaluate him. He can write books that are bad. I was disappointed by "The Taking", and now this... I've been listening to this as an audiobook, but now I'm turning it off. I usually don't write reviews on books or films I don't finish, but this one, I had to give up and feel abliged to warn others.   I made it almost halfway through the book, waiting for something to happen. I really don't care to know how the story ends because it's hardly started yet. There are several parallel plots, all overwritten, with long portions of text where nothing happens and too many characters that feel not realistic, but constructed to be likeable and/or funny. I've always liked the way Koontz writes characters you really get to know and care about, but this time it's way too overdone. They can't just sit around feeling sorry for themselves and have endless dialogues that doesn't move the plot forward. Something must happen for a book to be interesting.  I was a big fan but I'm going to be very cautious about his books in the future. I'm not going to waste more time on this one. Not recommended even (or perhaps especially) for Koontz fans. 
 First, of all, I would like to begin by saying that I'm not one of those reviewers that enjoy bashing books for the mere sake of it, nor do I bash books I have not read.  It is rare that I end up reading a book that I simply detest, because I usually read up on them beforehand, and know what I am getting into.  Given that I love black comedies, horrors, sci-fi, and over-the-top shocking stories, I thought that I would enjoy this book; I did not.  My main complaint with this book isn't the content (it was original, and over-the-top), or the subject matter; my complaint is the bad writing.  Each chapter was one to three pages, and the story was badly written.  I felt like I was reading a sexed up cyberpunk cat-in-the-hat.  If you took the pictures out of the book, and reduced the fonts down to a normal size, the entire book would have been maybe 30-40 pages of fluff.  This book had virtually no plot, no character development, and was comprised almost exclusively of attempting to shock the reader with adjective-ridden fluff of some odd LSD-like sex trip.  All-in-all, this is just a poorly written attempt at a book.  If you want to experience good fiction in this genre, try any of Chuck Palahniuk's novels; or in film try Takashi Miike's films like Visitor Q, or Ichi the Killer. 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  There were some good reviews but I found that the story could not deliver.  It started off good, a good murder mystery, I was excited to see what would unfold...  I kept waiting for the book to get exciting or suspenseful or to get attached to one of the characters but it never happened.  The whole book was, to me, a lot of filler and the end was anticlimactic 
 It is difficult to give this book a critical look because it has become as unquestioned as the Bible is in certain circles.  According to the author the Vietnamese are unknown and unknowable to westerners. (Somehow she has grasped their elemental essence.) They share so little in common with the rest of humanity that Stalinist communism is the only political system under which they will prosper and be true to their anthropological roots.  "The moment has arrived for the narrow flame of revolution to cleanse the lake of Vietnamese society from the corruption and disorder of the American war.  It will have to come, for it is the only way the Vietnamese of the south can restore their country and their history to themselves."  As it has been seen by the eyes of the world through the history of Southeast Asia since 1975 the South Vietnamese were truly fortunate to have been "liberated" and "brought back to their heritage" by a force as truly benevolent and peaceful as the government of the "Democratic Republic of Vietnam."  Overly academic in an elitist anti-anticommunist way, this book has been required reading in all "revisionist" undergraduate history seminars and lectures since its first publication in 1972. (What was "revisionist" in the 1970s is the Very Truth in 2005.) It has the obligitory academic but irrelevant references to "dead white men" (Shakespeare's Tempest) for mostly incomprehensible reasons.  As I watch the people of Vietnam being pimped by their government to enrich its coffers and those of the Nike Corporation, I think of how stupid, ignorant and ultimately vile this book is and was.  As I watch the diaspora of Vietnam succeed and prosper I wonder how Frances Fitzgerald can sleep for all of their brothers and sisters left behind in that unfortunate and misjudged land. For all of its damage done it is regrettable that this book was not the end of Frances Fitzgerald's career, but its beginning 
 This book turned out to be another release of the original book from the 1980s and it shows.  It is full of seriously outdated information and old style, pushy, boiler-room style telemarketing tactics.  Worst of all, it tells you to always push for the appointment and end the conversation there.  What about qualifying?  I can already set appointments all day if I don't bother to qualify them, but unfortunately those unqualified appointments don't buy.  Save your money and find a more up to date sales book 
 Anyone who believes that this book is an authentic portrayal of boxing has never stepped into a ring and has no sense of history or perspective. Mailer hero-worshipped Ali, and could never write anything objective about him. Mailer knew nothing about boxing, other than the sensation of hitting a woman in one of his drunken binges. Mailer went to Africa, and could not write the truth about Zaire or its bloodthirsty dictator. He either did not know or could not write that the stadium in which the fight was held, for example, was a killing field for criminals who were rounded up before the fight to make sure the event went smoothly for the press and the tourists 
 Top of the line (April 2005) D-cell NiMH batteries have 11,000 mAh compared to this one 2,200 mAh (they cost 16 bucks but 10,000 mAh battery costs six bucks). Top of the line AA NiMH batteries have capacity of 2500 mAh. Top of the line NiCad D-Cell batteries have 5000 mAh capacity (costs around five bucks). I thought that NiMH was more capable than NiCad. True, but not in this case.  So what are we gettting here? Higher AA battery capacity in D-cell case. This battery is overpriced for what it delivers. 
 The photo is quite deceiving.  This suit is made out of cheap polyester fabric that looks cheap, shiny, and is horrible to the touch.  My three year olds hate the uncomfortable stiffness.  Spend the extra money for a decent fabric that is actually practical for a toddler if they really need a suit 
 I bought this item from Best Buy.  It works great until it was time to change the batteries.  The battery cover is hard to open, which caused a back piece to break off.  Since then, the mouse did not work anymore.  I would not recommend this mouse 
 The author has her narrator("Cinnamon") spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating Scarlett,in a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship. Even though she's calling the shots,as it's her book, Scarlett still comes out miles ahead. Perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society,but there WAS once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies,such as "Ivanhoe" presents.The story may have been one-sided,but it's the side MM chose to tell,and there's kernel of truth in the "myth" of the Old South,as in all myths.   Margaret Mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called "parody",which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious,in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal,that epitome of heroines-Katie Scarlett O'Hara and the wonderful Melanie Wilkes.As if Rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with Scarlett.That's why he turned to women like Belle Watling.And to imagine Mammy killing the male babies,when she had been devoted to Ellen O'Hara from Ellen's childhood.Thank goodness this book isn't a pimple on the fanny of the classic GWTW,because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.GWTW will still be read and loved for all time,like the classic it is,when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.I didn't even pay that,thank goodness-the woman gave it to me,and I read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.I'd give it a negative star if there was such a rating.Ludicrous and laughable-try again,Ms Randall,and try to get over the jealousy of Scarlett and Co. Again,Margaret Mitchell need not fear,LOL 
 I just wish I had read all these reviews before purchasing this book.  I just took the TEA and am in shock.  This book in no way prepares you for the math and even the verbal reasoning doesn't match up to what is actually on the TEA exam.  I hate to admit this, but because of relying on this study guide alone, I have probably blown my one and only chance to become an ATF Agent.  Don't waste your time with this book 
 This book is not about est.  It is a fraud, and Mr. Frederick is a thief.  It contains a recently and poorly written forward that mentions est - otherwise it is not mentioned in the book.  This is fraud and theft. So much for enlightenment.  Don't misunderstand, it's not that it's a critical book about est, it isn't about it at all.  Shame on Mr. Frederick and anyone associated with this.  They are theives.  I will be asking Amazon for my money back.  The reference in the title is to get those legitimately looking to explore something about est to order it - and be ripped off 
 This book is filled with 4-letter words. The "f" word is used throughout.  The premise of the story is a teen girl turns into a fly, and goes into the boys locker room.  She describes in detail, boys' anatomy, and a large part of the book is spent describing boys' genitals, and how she feels upon seeing them. She also discusses how seeing the naked boys makes her want to pounce on them and stick her tongue down their throats.    My 12 year old daughter picked this book up out of the children's room in our local library.  It has a cheerful, little-girlish pink cover.  My daughter thought that it was going to be a fun adventure story of a girl who turns into a fly.  It is an adventure story, but an x-rated one.  Fortunately, my daughter stopped reading, and brought the book to me when she encountered the first 4-letter words on the first pages.  I highly object to this book being marketed to CHILDREN, when between the girly-pink cover it is undisguised, blatant pornography.  While I do not care what other adults read in the privacy of their own homes, to have this book being marketed for children is unethical, immoral by any standards, and should be illegal.    You have to be 18 to purchase pornography.  You should have to be 18 to purchase this book 
 I have read Baldacci's first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them.  This one, however, is just awful.  Not only the character's dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie.  The only thing I can think of to compare it to is this :  There was a series of Calvin and Hobbes cartoons where Calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows, with lame lines like "The gun was loaded, and so was I".  That is exactly what this book is like, except it goes on for 400 pages.  There isn't a single interesting character in this book, in my opinion.  You just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end.  It's the Bataan Death March of novels.  I hope this is an aberration - I'll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that I read were so good.  But one more stinker like this one and I'll drop his name from my reading list 
 No doubt Stewart Lee Allen was pleased with the success of "The Devil's Cup", a fine travelogue/meditation on coffee. With this book, it seems he decided to indulge himself a little, which actually turned out to be quite a lot. He attempts to display wit throughout, but for the most part Allen's wit is supercilious and sophomoric, and would to many seem to be the product of a vastly overinflated ego. In fact, "In The Devil's Garden" is laden with inaccuracies in both fact and interpretation. Simultaneously, Allen takes pleasure in virulently anti-Christian prejudices. Time and again he discusses "the Christians" as if retailing a particularly juicy piece of scandalous gossip which instead is really no more than a figment of his ignorance and over-heated literalistic imagination. But, have no fear, the author slanders all religions East and West with equal verve. This purports, after all, to be a book about food, which features in most faith traditions. To add to the horror of it all, his misuse of the English language is beyond belief. About a third of the way through I began to circle the malapropisms as if I were a high school English teacher. Two thirds through I gave up. I only finished this book to make sure it really is as bad as I thought. It was. It is a mercy to literature that "In the Devil's Garden" is out of print. R.I.P. May it never be revived.      
   It should be named "how to writing SQL for MS Access, Oracle 7i and xxx" since that is all about. It is weird to me why "Design" is in the title. There is absolutely nothing covered on what is inside a RMDB, man 
 The first part of the book is thrilling and page turning. The way Judge Ramsey found Emma. The way Molly found Judge Ramsey. Everything will keep you in the book. But the last hundred pages or so she really misses the plot. You'd ask yourself where's the plot? You'll read about a propousal, Ireland, a wedding, and many more stories that shouldn't been there. And as nigh all of her books, the end is a fairy tale that nobody'll believe. There are better books than this one 
 This is one of three stepmothering books I purchased, and after reading all three, I can say this book leaves me depressed and hopeless, feeling as though I cannot cope with what stepmothering brings.  The 'real-life' examples and stories seem so negative and worst-case scenario.  This book just encourages feeling negative and hopeless.  It left me full of anxiety and fear, not answers and solutions.  Even though it does offer up many useful suggestions, and illustrates the reality of stepmothering, it errs on the side of the negative extreme.  I'm sure many women can relate to this book, but for those of us who need a positive approach, and have supportive partners and stepchildren who like us, actually love us, we need something else.  I highly recommend "The Courage to be a Stepmom" by Thoele, and "The Stepmom's Guide to Simplifying Your Life" by Goodman.  These two books left me feeling hopeful, I realized the positives and the love, the reasons WHY I'm even bothering with this difficult situation!  I really see the hope and love in my situation after reading those two books, not so for "The Enlightened Stepmother".  Perhaps, the best approach is to read this book first, to make sure you are well aware of the realities of stepmotherhood, THEN read the other two books to learn how to positively face the challenges 
 I think in retrospect I wasted my time on this one. It had a great premise that indulged me into buying this book but who knew dark days lied ahead of me. As I read through the last chapters trying to uncover the mystery, I kept on hoping that there would be something more to it, something more enigmatic, a brilliant twist but I was left with despair. My major problem with this novel was there were not enough, in fact hardly anybody whom the reader could suspect as the possible killer. And bringing out a totally new character at the very end to describe the proceedings only shows a lack of respect to the mind of the reader who had been guessing until now about various other possibilities. I will never touch this author's book again! A mantra for reading thrillers is in believing the hype and read the best of the best-Dan Brown 
 1) The end of "Still the One" is ten deathless seconds of rock n' roll guitar. Its "like wow, man" quotient exceeds the opening of "Layla," the fade-to-black hook of "More Than a Feeling," you name it. There were a hundred better blues-based rock bands (and even better vocal harmony bands), but this riff is Orleans' alone.  2) This band's threat to sue the Bush '04 campaign over its unlicensed use of "Still The One" was the most unexpected, rib-tickling slapdown to powers-that-be since the Dixie Chicks.   No, Orleans' didn't get too political about it. But this incident arguably said as much about music's relationship to power today as anything on, say, the "Farenheit 911" soundtrack. After all, rock n' roll has always been about two things - sex (the literal source of the term) and rebellion. Nowadays, hitting 'em on the courthouse steps is about as rebellious as it gets - far more so than Eminem cutting an overtly anti-Bush record yet failing to release it as a single, or "American Idiot," which for all its bluster is so, so MTV-friendly...the political equivalent of a Britney/Madonna/Mariah tease that says, "Come hither/I'm a bad girl/but not REALLY."  When Orleans howled, Bush, who received boo-koo campaign money from a music industry terrified of Napster and related theft, demonstrated that the prescriptions of his pro-business campaign had not applied to HIM.    Sure, the electorate ultimately agreed that Bush is "still the one." But Bush '04 backed down from Orleans. So they didn't get to crow about it on election night with that too-cool riff!   OK, this ain't your usual review. But I love rock, and the form has woven such a rich and culturally powerful tapsetry over the past half century that its tiniest thread, which Orleans can claim for the aforesaid reasons, is worth noting 
 I started reading this book with the expectation that I would learn about women in a culture totally different than mine. Instead, I read the story of a lusty, rich, worldly woman with no sense of morality. Then it gets  incredibly dry as the author launches into a historical story from the  middle ages. Very boring, and I heartily do NOT recommend this book 
 I love Linda Howard, but I didn't even finish reading this book because it was so boring and annoying!  The heroine was a whiny martyr--she drove me crazy!  And where was the suspense?  I truly can't believe that people liked this book!  If you want to read a good Linda Howard book, read "Mr. Perfect" or "Dying to Please" 
 I found this product did absolutely NOTHING for me...granted I don't have huge wrinkles, but the few I do have certainly got no better and i'm wondering if it made them worse! I wish I had asked around from friends, cause if I had I would have discovered this on my own without wasting the money. I'm wondering a couple of things, what all the fuss is about with strivectin? Is it just that everyone is different and some people have good results and some don't? AND is there anyone out there who can recommend a product that REALLY works? (if it works i don't mind spending the money... 
 This is a wordy, diatribe on brain mechanics.    The best that can be said is that Dr. Goldberg is considering establishing for profit cognitive enhancements centers along side retirement chains around the nation.  In chapter 15, Goldberg gives ancedotes about the aging who benefit from attending his cognitive center.  He does not describe the contents of the computer programs they use.  (trade secrets?)  This center offers, "personal cognitive fitness trainers and a broad, all inclusive cognitive cocktail." (whatever that may be?)  All this and a 'bag of chips' are sure to be expensive.  My pattern recognition system has seen this sleaz before.  It used to show up on television in the wee hours of the morning.  The 'informercial' has now hit the scientific community and book publishing 
 This book is a big dissappointment!  I saw Rita Hutchens on Alex Anderson's quilting program and was intrigued with her technique, if not always the results.  I downloaded the directions after the show and wanted to see more so I ordered the book, even though I did not care for the work on the cover.   The photo illustrations for turning the tubes are pathetic, especially the diamond tubes, a very step by step DRAWING is an essential addition, that will probably not ever  be added. The photos show various views of wadded up fabric strips.  While it may be useful to see that this is indeed what you will have to work with, it is of no help in achieving the goal. The later drawings are adequate, but where we especially need them is in the very beginning.  The projects for which there are directions are not the ones which intrigue me, rather the examples in a long section, at least a third of the book,  at the end, are those that are most fascinating, many, many kaleidoscope quilts with no directions for how these were achieved. If only they coulld have included the directions for just one kaleidoscope quilt! Very, very frustrating!   She seemed like such a nice woman on the show, It is too bad she was not better served by her publishers!  A strip of errata is wedged in at the end, so who knows what they haven't caught yet!  Altogether not C&T Publishing's finest production 
 This book was recommended to me by a relative, and I purchased it based on her suggestion. It was disappointing when I realized within a few pages that its viewpoints relate more closely to a fundamentalist/conservative slant than to the God of my faith. I offered the book to another family member, with brief comments that I didn't care for it much. She suggested that I should be more open-minded. Yikes! That is exactly the opposite of my problem with this book. For example, it seems to me that a person who is open-minded just isn't going to be inspired by the statement that "God isn't who we want him to be." In my opinion, God is more perfect than we can fathom, and that IS precisely who we want Him to be 
 First, JFK did not write this book.  Rather, it was written for him by a number of people, and one of the writers described it as 'a very sloppy job, mostly magazine and newspaper clippings stuck together', when seen in  its original state.  Joe Kennedy, the President's father, made it a  best-seller by using his influence with publishers like Henry Luce. Old Joe  also helped out by purchasing 30,000 to 40,000 copies of the  "book" and storing them at the family compound in Hyannisport.  See Paul Johnson's A History of the American People for full details...    Save your money, and your time 
 I loved Wheel of Time books one through four.  Five got on my nerves, but I liked it.  But this, the sixth in the series is a yawner.  Either plot or character (and hoefully both) moves books. This one has little of either. I am still waiting, at page 824, to become more than mildly interested.  Apparently there are some people who will read anything as long as the secondary world is graphic enough.  But grocery shopping is just as boring in WOT, Hobbiton or the real world.  And Jordan likes to tell us all of those details--the  carving on the chairs, how a woman's hair was done, the color of every character's dress, eyes, decolletage and a million other details that make us feel like he is just filling up space.  Jordan's has succeeded in creating a vast secondary world, but the dramatic tension seems forced, especially in his conflict among the main characters.  And his characters still do not seem to grow up.  It is almost like reading a novel of a video or RPG.  That might please 15 years olds, but not me.   I give the novel 2 stars as a nod to the prior novels in the series.  Perhaps Jordan rescues the last part of the novel.  But really, it should not take this long to tell the story.   Knowing that I am only half-way done with the series daunts me.  I want to know what happens, but the ride is not nearly as fun as when it started 
 Nice to see the other reviews of this product, that seems to mostly exist in myth.  Ordered it for my daughter for Christmas, and when they told me it wouldn't even possibly be shipped until March (in February I was notified), I cancelled and found my daughter a calendar that featured old Broadway show posters.  It came within a week.  Whoever makes this product deserves to go out of business 
 The product description in January 2007 is inaccurate: batery life in the standby mode is about 20 hours, not 60; there is no hands free speakerphone; if you use a standard plug-in headset, the microphone does not work (tested two units). There is more: the headset is very loud (you have to listen with the phone an inch away from your ear), but there is no volume adjustment; the microphone has low sensitivity, so you find yourself yelling into it; the clock resets itself when the power is turned off. I returned mine 
 If you like strange stories, you will love "Running with Scissors" because it is just plain weird.  After reading this book, you will have a feeling that you just returned from the Twilight Zone. Marty Wurtz Author of Deceptions and Betrayal 
 This book was a complete waste of money for me.  Not only that, but I didn't even feel right about reselling it, so I threw it away.  The author picked apart the Old Testament, saying the gospels are the only part of the bible to believe.  He also talked about "Hell" as being a "realm" where the spirits of people who died were full of hate. He did not mention the fact that there is a real hell with fire, anguish and complete separation from God awaiting those who do not accept Jesus as their savior. He also said many other things that were way off.  I have heard so many stories of after death experiences that all agreed, making them believable.  However, his description wasn't even similar to the others.  I was very disappointed.  
 What a beautiful, godly message of self-respect for young women.  The analogy of two identical apples entrusted to two sisters to be kept for the rightful owner should have encouraged girls to resist sex before marriage and guard themselves for the wonderful man that God has for them. Instead it smacks of nighttime drama - sort of like an episode of "Dynasty."    One apple was overexposed, handled and caused to rot due to a careless bite taken by a man for whom the apple was not intended and did not belong.  The other apple was wisely hidden and protected so it stayed fresh and lovely.  With a stunning lack of sensitivity, the sister who is blonde, beautiful, fun-loving, and cheerful, must also be the self-centered, vain fool who lacks good judgement and integrity.  It follows that her apple rots.  As totally expected, the plain sister must have dark hair, be serious by nature and favored by her parents. She has the misfortune of being overlooked and undervalued.  But, stereotypically, her shining character makes up for her lack of beauty and vivaciousness.  Although she lacks charm and confidence, her care of the apple wins her the marriage proposal of the handsome, manly and discerning prince.    She is chosen - not for being attractive in her own right, but for her sterling character.  The blonde, pretty, but unworthy sister flees the scene in tears.  Although full of remorse for her mistakes, she is out of luck.  She is only mentioned again for having the ability to overcome her jealousy of her sister's good fortune.  Why is it necessary to equate beauty with badness and uglyness with goodness?  Why did they have to be sisters?  The contrast only makes God look unjust to both and unforgiving of the "loser."  Why will my daugters never read this book?  You guessed it.  Their looks and personality mirror the sisters in this fairytale.  Does that make one foolish and other wise?  Of course not.  I am tired of the same old yarn about the pretty blonde only being valued for her looks, (because it stands to reason that she stinks inside).  I am even more sickened by the assumption that the "plain" girl is destined to live in the shadow of her sister, fighting despair and hopelessness because her only value is her good heart.    Isn't beauty in the eye of the beholder, anyway?  Why confirm the Hollywood perversion of beauty?  It is detrimental to the self-esteem of both girls.  I will find another way to honor the attributes of my daughters without comparing them to one another.  This story, in effect, illustrates that they are both, for differing reasons, inferior to each other.  In addition they are each, at least partly, undesirable to their future husbands. (Neither one is the whole package - pursued for having godly character and God-given sex appeal.)  I love all of Lisa's novels.  Needless to say, I am furious that I wasted my hopes and money on this one.  This storybook won't even be donated to the library.  I have already slipped into the trash.  Suzann 
 The best ever!!!  If you don't have on buy one. But buy the bag 
 Movie is horrible but horses are FABULOUS!  This is some of the best footage of the fabled Andalusian Horses I've ever seen - if there's more out there somebody please let me know!  Bought the movie just to see the horses 
 If you're looking for a sequel to "Relish" this isn't it. Joan's passionate portrayal of brazen romantic decadence and shameless sin that I so loved in the appropriately named "Relish" is completely absent in this new CD. It is as if Joan repented, sacrificed her inner spark, and become a rural country housewife. The only song that remotely echoes the good old days is the title cut albeit done gone countrified. I miss the old Joan. I want my money back. "Relish" still kicks the pants off all her other CDs 
 The story was okay.  Not the best in the series but okay.  My rating is based on the length.  The book itself is very misleading.  You look at it and see what appears to be a full length book.  When you read it, you find a short story and a recipe book.  If your going to write a short story, bill it as such or write several and publish them together.  Wish I would have gone to the library for this one rather than the bookstore 
 If you just want to learn =about= self-employed people, this is a good book. If you want to learn =how= to become successfully self-employed, save your money. There are too many other books that will be truly helpful, such as Get Clients Now!, The Well-Fed Writer, and InfoGuru Marketing 
 From the first 80 pages of "Flesh and the Devil" I thought I was reading a page turner that I wouldn't want to put down but then the book just took a huge nose dive after that, the characters became less developed and the story just tanked.  It was as if Kola had used all the good material on the beginning and ran out of steam before the book was even half way through.  Needless to say by the end of the book I was very disappointed and felt cheated considering all the rave reviews the book had gotten.    If you're thinking of spending your hard earned money on this book DON'T...if you really must read this book I suggest you wait for it to hit your local library that way you can keep your money in your pocket 
 I remember loving these films as a child, but watching them as an adult, I felt they moved very slowly 
 I read chic-lit, a lot. I found myself truly disappointed in this book. What a waste of time! 
 I too should have read the description more thoroughly. Some good advice but expensive for 38 pages. I thought I was getting a book, not a bookLET. Definitely don't feel I got a bang for my bucks 
 I found this book incredibly boring. While it is obvious that Leddick gets into his characters, I did not. I found them two-dimensional, hollow cliches lacking in authenticity. Mr. Leddick should do more research and try to imbue his characters with more dimensions and distinct voices. I would suggest that he write porn instead, but even the sex scenes in the book are unrewarding, unerotic and unarousing. On the plus side, the guy on the cover is quite tasty and fortunately legal. Someone should just put together a coffee table book of covers of gay novels. I am sure that it would be more stimulating than a great deal of the novels themselves 
 I bought this DVD with gear from Walmart at $13, steeply reduced from the original price.  I am watching it while writing this review.  The lead plummish oldest presenter/"ballerina", probably a teenager, is the worst dancer.  Her ungraceful dancing style has little to do with ballet.  Other little girls are just so much better. Unfortunately the camera was not focused on them.         The smelly plastic mat made with cheap PVC is slippery. The bar is unsteady. It has turned into a towel rack in our household.   The whole thing seems awfully and amateurly put together.  The best thing is clips from various actual ballet performances.     You don't want to introduce ballet to your little ones from this DVD.  It has nothing to do with ballet, let alone Swan Lake.  
 I've read most of the books written by Greg Iles. I liked them all except Dead Sleep, which by the way was much better than this one!  Anyway, despite Dead Sleep, if I see a book by this author I haven't read yet I'd grab them right away without further thinking because I enjoyed the rest of his work very much.   So, when I bought Sleep No More I was prepared to stay up all night because I was certain it would be thrilling. WRONG!  The whole Mallory/Eve/Cole/etc thing is just not believable at all even though I set my memory and imagination open as the author suggests.  I still laugh when I think of the explanation of how Mallory gets into another person (she has to have sex and have a mindblowing orgasm). I should give Greg Iles some credit for this idea, a stupid one, but creative nonetheless.  As for the characters, I was so appalled by the paranormal plot that I couldn't care less about any of them. I read The Quiet Game and liked it, but the appearance of Penn Cage was just so blah because he's like a cameo in this book and didn't have a character development nor adds anything to this book.  In conclusion, I would not recommend this, especially to those who liked other books by Greg Iles.  Nevertheless, I'm going to continue to purchase other books by him because I enjoyed his other works very much and strongly believe he is one of the best fiction writers. 
 I agree, the book has many, many good insights and most of it makes sense. You can theoretically use his techniques, but sometimes they are just unrealistic in real-life situations. Also the book is so short and his chapters so small that it leaves you hungry for more depth, more explanation and more examples on how to use his tips. Sometimes the situations he describes are just too limited. I would not buy this again...it's just not detailed enough and provides too few examples on how to use this in real life--not every situation is about a cheating boyfriend or a dishonest employee. It seriously lacks depth but it's a decent read...but you will forget everything you read in 2 days.   I'm sure there are lengthier and more in depth books that deal with the same topic which are more worth your money, time and effort. 
 Although Carol Dweck is a women, I feel this book would do well in a college "women studies" class. Good stuff, but a little tuff on guys and pity for women. Maybe I am stuck in a "Mindset", but harps a little too much on women issues for me. I will be alble to utilize some material from the book, but would suggest it as a good read for women. 
 The characters are all really depressing and it is another one of those styles in which improper grammar and a lack of literacy is used all throughout it.  It was the style that goes along the lines of, "It was the store.  I stood there.  I saw.  'Hey watcha don' thwat ah thing fer?'  He sputtered."   I don't recommend it.  
 I purchased this to use on the desk chair in my office at work. I was basically interested in the heat feature.  The heat and massage turn off after 15 minutes. This is described as a safety precaution but it is highly annoying to have to re-set everything every 15 minutes. j 
 This book inaccurately addresses the topic and supports false ideas. I don't see how anyone can read a book like this and take its themes seriously; especially when coupled by all its discrepancies between fact and fiction, starting with the foremost and largest falsehood...   Sexuality is a predestination, and for all but a very small few, never changes!   This book defends a falsehood and therefore lies to its readers. I would not recommend that anyone waste any part of their life reading it, especially young or otherwise adults struggling with their own sexual identity, because many of the aforementioned are rendered unstable by our society and resort to hoping for any chance of changing themselves. A book like this could only destroy people who are insecure about their identity.   What our world needs right now is a book about recognizing homosexuality and embracing it, instead of rejecting its truths as this book does. 
 I have read 10 Sheldon Novels and this was my least favorite. Kelly and Diane either are cats with 9 lives or those pursuing them are the most incompetent clowns in the underworld universe. Also, with there lives in constant danger there is a such thing called police to seek out help from. Oh yea, Diane tries this and the detective is transfered. That means he does not turn his case over to his replacement? Was he the only detective in NYC?  The other books I read had narrow escapes but the ones that Kelly and Diane get out of are so unrealistic that I found myself reading a comedy. I was waiting for "Angel" (Kelly's dog)to also be involved in the conspiracy also. (Heck, the rest of the characters in the book was including the person I bought it from at the store.  I hope the next Sheldon novel I read has a plot along with twist that are more plausable. 
 This album will only appeal to die hard UB40 fans and not casual fans or fans who loved the old up tempo sound of UB40 on LOL 1 and 2. This album only has 2 up tempo songs that sound like the old UB40 from the early 80's and early 90's. Download the songs Come Back Darling and Mr. Fix it, so you can save your money. I love UB40, but after listening to LOL 1 and 2 I thought LOL 3 was going to be a classic, but it is not close compared to the previous LOL albums and seems like it was just put out to make a quick buck because there was no passion in the music and singing, which made the entire album boring or like Reggae elevator music until I heard the two songs I already mentioned and recommend downloading. Those two songs saved the album in my opinion, otherwise it would have gotten zero stars.    
 Probably the most overrated performer of all times, Mr. Bowie is a perfect mystery. While there are moments when his genius clearly shines through (Life on Mars, Space Oddity, All the Madmen, Kooks, notably The Man who sold the World and few more)it remains a pretty frustrating thing to like him overall.I saw him live couple years ago and he really pulled the crowd's strings, undeniably an incredible showman. What about Ziggy Srardust then? A classic rock and roll album topped with Bowie's characteristic juicy English eccentricity.That's all fine, but why should everybody go raving mad about it?I'm utterly perplexed.At the time of its release much more talented bands like Led Zeppelin and The Who were in full swing, Queen were just starting to gain prominence, but people still paid much more attention to the thin white duke.Oh well, must have been his make up.. 
 Breton, the overrated, dull and inept absolutist leader of the "so-called iconoclastic" surrealists was not as bombastic as people who worship him would have you believe.  This 'work', merely an arranged compendium of useless episodes and scenes, is completey boring and without any enrichment, all it does is tire the reader.  The style is marginally academic, that is to say, it is written in long, flaccid sentences with too much self-exaltation included.  I was bored by the entire book, Breton imagines that it was revolutionary to write about fractured and obtuse occurrences which have nothing to do with anything except his own idea of importance.  He meanders through pretentious descriptions which are trite.  Don't be fooled by his sycophantic adherents who believe that he actually "invented" surrealism and art.  I'd rather read the true ramblings of a madman than this ordure.  
 I didnt think the book was bad until the further I got.  I could understand why Rose decided to leave California.  I was glad that she decided to keep the baby.  Even when she married Son I thought for sure that she would finally grow to love someone, including her daughter.  The fact that she remained so flat and uncaring really bothered me.  I would have loved to see Thomas show up with no warning and finally see all the truth come out and see some resolution for all the caracters that Rose touched.  I almost felt that Patchett lost her steam, and found it easier to let Rose disappear and end the book than to deal with what was really happening.  At the very least, I would have liked an explanation from Rose at the end as to why once a again she couldnt stay and deal.  As far as being a Saint, I didnt see any redeeming quality about Rose for that kind of title.  It was frustrating and disappointing.  Its the kind of book that leaves a bad taste in your mouth 
 i bought this hoping i would look good and get my face cleaned. no lie, this soap makes you look uglier than you really are. so unless you wanna smell a little weird and not look your best, dont buy this soap! im serious! 
 I would rather not even give this one star.  Forms of Mental illness do exist.  Medications are as helpful as psychotherapy.  There are thousands of independent research papers showing evidence for this.  Is it really that difficult to believe if the human body can be ill regardless of diet, excercise, or living healthy (i.e IDDM, Retinoblastoma in children, rheumatoid arthritis, etc) that the human mind could also be predisposed to illness regardless of our life style.  For instance we have established that individuals with two short alleles for the serotonin transporter gene are much more likely to become depressed under stress than someone who is homozygous for the long allele.  Glasser is old, out there, and misinformed.  Any one who has sit for any time with a schizophrenic or manic patient can tell you that the illness is not by choice.  Individuals like Glasser (add Tom Cruise/ scientologists) use their title and status to undermine scientific evidence, therefore interfering with potential successful treatment of psychiatric illness in people who would maximally benefit.  Because of the reviews and content of this book, I no longer care to read Glasser's book on choice theory--he obviously has discredited psychiatry's utility to pad his own pocket book.  This book is at the expense of patients I see who ARE actually suffering brain damage due to untreated mental illness (schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder), because they read misguided authors such as Dr. Glasser. 
 This book is not as good as i thought it would be.  I hope i have better readings with Bryan Tracy's Advance selling 
 I bought this book after seeing Mr Florida talk on CSPAN-2. He does have some interesting things to say about creativity, but...  I found it very difficult to finish.  Mr Florida claims to be politically independent, but he doesn't even hesitate to engage in the sort of casual Bush bashing one see's only in the extreme left, and along with this he repeats almost every silly platitude of same, including the ridiculous "pentagon holding a bake sale to buy a bomber" bit.  If he's politically independent, then I'm the King of Siam.  And his solution? right out of the leftists playbook, we have to spend more, lots more, way more than we ever have, "several orders of magnitude more" on "education", "culture" and "the arts."  Anyone interested in buying a used book? Only read once.. 
 This book is very poorly written. For historical fiction it is extremely boring and the plot is shallow and predictable. The characterers are ridiculous. Hake tried to create characters that are endearing, but they turned out iritating especially the hero, Josh McCain. The O'Sullivans had a bit of charm, but not enough to carry the book. Don't waste your time 
 Look, I'm used to movies like "Better than chocolate", "Listen", "Gia", Monster, series like "The L word", real good lesbian stuff. When I got this movie thinking it was a good lesbian drama, I was completly dissapointed. Boring, unrealistic, stupid... do not waste your time/money. The real lesbian of the movie ends up with a guy, and the main characters were so boring! oh god! I still regret I watched it. Hey, if you wanna see a lesbian movie that has never been properly discovered, buy "Listen", it's only a VHS version, but it's hot, great lesbian thriller... reminds me of Basic Instinct but better 
 I usually really enjoy Jayne Ann Krentz and her alter ego Amanda Quick, but I actually returned this one to the library unfinished. I found it boring and the whole dream reader concept to be unbelievable 
 Once again I have to disagree with every other reviewer.   Greek Homosexuality is a strange book. It is also infuriating. I was never able to read an entire chapter of it. I threw it several times in the garbage can and then went out again to retrieve it because I thought I should know more about Greek gays. But the fact is that the more I read the less I understood what Greek homosexuality was. My own take is that the writing of Greek Homosexuality is an extreme case of a rampant scholarly disease called "not seeing the forest because of the trees".   If you want to buy this book because you are anxious to know whether homosexuality was widespread in ancient Greece and whether it was really accepted as a normal form of sexual behavior, let me tell you that the author has no definite answer to these two crucial questions. These are the kind of general questions he eludes or is honest enough to leave unanswered because the evidence is unconclusive. I spoke of honesty, but I sometimes put down the fuziness of all this to a wrong understanding of what it means to be objective. To be objective doesn't mean to just align dozens and dozens of pottery fragments and ancient author quotes and other scholarly references and then leave the reader to decide what this all means.   As I have just said, Greek Homosexuality is replete with hundreds of details about homosexuality in art, in law, in philosophy, in language. But the trouble is that it is almost  completely devoid of enlightening syntheses. Therefore every time I read a few pages in this book, I ended up knowing less about homosexuals in ancient Greece than when I took it up. This sounds incredible, yet it is true. I have tried to read the whole book several times, but simply wasn't able to. I keep getting lost in thickets of disconnected details while the myriad qualifications with which they are hedged about and the dry and technical language get the better of all my intellectual machettes.   Therefore my conclusion is: Greek Homosexuality is un-rea-da-ble! But I will gladly admit that the numerous black and white photographs of male nudes depicted in Greek art are gorgeous and give the reader a fleeting sense of understanding the whole mess of details in the rest of the book.   Touto biblion ouk esti kalon...   
 This has to be one of the most overpriced and under-satisfactory books ever. Nearly $20 for an ultra thin book the size of a Dr. Seuss story, completely devoid of pictures, but because it has Rowling's name on it, they feel compelled to overcharge the unknowing public. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, and if you do, don't pay full price. Absolutely and completely NOT worth it. 
 The radio for the boom box worked.  The CD player did not work.  I had to return it to be repaired or replaced. I do not have it back yet 
 I was dissapointed in the book.  I found his argument for a coming Antichrist at the end of the age to be very weak.  It appeared more as an opinion rather than supported with good, solid Biblical rationale.  I would not recommend it as a source for anyone looking to understand the Spirit of the Antichrist.    
 I like Mos Def's "Black on Both Sides" and the Black Star album, as well as some of his collabs with The Roots, Common, High & Mighty, ect...but this album is worthless.  It's all pop slow jams that are boring and mundane.  If you liked "UMI SAYS" from B.O.B.S. the most off that album, then this may be for you.  But for Hip Hop fans and Mos' fans this will most likely dissapoint.  The Rap-Rock doesn't fit his style, the love ballads get boring after the first 8 bars and everything else is just boring to me.  As a HIP HOP fan I can't recommend this album, but I do give him credit for having the cahonies to experiment 
 Could not stay awake for more than 3 pages.Could not be get into this book maybe I can't see the horror in a ghost story.Lacks suspence very predictable 
 When this group rocks, they wail -- reference cuts #1, #2 and #13.  Other than that, having listened to the CD several times, and been a popular music fan all my life, I'm not sure what I heard except a bunch of kids playing around with electronics.  Many groups have experimented with new musical forms, themes, lyrics, and so on, over the years, sometimes with results that have a significant impact either immediately or over time.  Far from being a trendsetter, this CD, in its better cuts, temporarily entertains, while overall, it costs much more than it is worth and resells at a very steep discount 
 The hardcover edition of this dictionary is awful. The binding is originally constructed, with tight pages that cracked my edition beyond repair on the second day.  The dictionary itself is exceptionally good, making for easy reference. A paperback edition would be ideal.  This dictionary is also mediocre for referencing technical terms 
 This was bought for my son for a babyshower gift. He really doesn't play with it. It doesn't do much. I also had a hard time opening the part where you put in the batteries. I was not happy with it. 
 I read this book several years ago.  Just recently, I read Anthony Robbin's Unlimited Power.  If you're choosing between Awaken the Giant Within and Unlimited Power, definitely go with Unlimited Power.  Don't bother with this book.   
 I am appalled that the publishers continue to pimp these books to lovers of Lillian Jackson Braun.  When you read these past few books, you are gradually disappointed more and more--and this one is the worst of the bunch.  I found the style annoying.  The book skims through the story.  It is sorely lacking in the rich details and characterizations that made the first 20 books so enjoyable.  When I finished this book--so short that it took me less than an hour and a half--I threw it across the room and into the trash.  What a waste of time and money.  There is no ending, the plot has promise--but is never explored in any quality or depth.  I think Quill should have eloped with Violet and ditched Platonic Prozac Polly and her evenings of sheer boredom. He needs a passionate affair--how long has he been in this sad relationship? The most interesting characters were ignored or forgotten.  I am done with this series.  I will just reread the first 20 and mourn what might have been.. 
 I have always been an avid fan of Westerns in general, and Charlton Heston in particular, but this is one of those movies where the legend surrounding it far exceeds the actual viewing, even allowing for its having been butchered by the studios Charlton Heston of course, plays Major Dundee, a man with a very forceful character - resolute, determined, and even rebellious ("invading" Mexico and attacking the French army).  For such a man to later be found as a hopeless drunk wallowing in the gutters of Durango is thoroughly incomprehensible. The purpose of the "invasion" of Mexico is to capture or destroy the Apache Indian, Charriba, so one would expect the audience to watch the movie in anticipation of a great climax when the two sides finally meet.  When they do meet however, the action is over in less than a minute, and Charriba is simply shot by Michael Anderson Jnr.  So the climax is, in my view, an anti-climax. We are then presented with a new climax, when Dundee and his men have to defeat the French army in order to get back across the Rio Grande.  Although this encounter is a lot more exciting than the one with the Apaches, the overall effect, as far as I am concerned, is rather like the effect one gets when reading a murder mystery to discover that the murderer is somebody who only entered in the final pages (and the scene where a wounded Richard Harris single-handedly takes on the other half of the French army is so unexpected in view of what has gone on before, as to be virtually unbelieveable). With regard to the movie having been heavily cut by the studios, I would suggest that if any cuts had to be made, they should have cut the Durango scenes entirely, plus all of the scenes featuring Senta Berger.  Romance only slows down the action and adds nothing to the story, whilst too much romance leads to boredom. Finally, having watched the movie with the new score first, and then with the original score, I have to say that I preferred the original. The movie opens with Charriba saying to an upside down strung-up soldier, "Who are you going to send after me now?"  The original then has the opening title, "Major Dundee," accompanied by the Mitch Miller Sing Along Gang singing the Major Dundee March.  To me this is a much more stirring and rousing score than the new replacement, and sets the scene for what one hopes will be an exciting movie. By all means buy this dvd as a piece of movie history, and as part of either a Charlton Heston or Sam Peckinpah collection (even though Peckinpah disowned it), but for my money don't expect a Western anything like as great as the likes of The Big Country, The Magnificent Seven, or How The West Was Won.  
 I thought that this book was a realy slow pase. I liked how they tied the beginning to the end and how everyone thought he was crazy. It is sad about the death that goes on durring the storie. The one thing that bugged me  about this book was that you never finf out the boys name who is the one  telling about the book. It is hard to write about someone when you don't  know his name. oh well, it was an ok book, my class thought that it was  slow too 
 I'm a pediatrician and have seen most of the physical and behavioral consequences of corporal punishment, many terrible and long-lasting.  There is never, ever, a need to strike an animal or a child.  Rather, the approach called "Inductive Discipline" is far more effective.  Discipline is not synonymous with punishment, and the approach takes note of the common word root (disciple) and the priority of maintaining, not disrupting, the loving relationship.  I've summarized this approach and discussed the downsides of spanking in the following chapter from my book on raising boys, "The Men They Will Become." (...)   
 I think deep thinking people tend to be unhappy because they're not living life.  They're idealizing and rationalizing life.  Some of the concepts here may be good, but reading this book will leave you feeling empty, even if you agree.  It's better to spend the time living your life than reading these kinds of deep books 
 Laura Childs writes like an adolescent girl.  With sentence fragments.  And italics.  The background of tea knowledge will be of interest to aficionados.  The mystery is light and the story overall entertaining.  But there is no character development: no changes or growth in anyone.  An entertaining light read.  But there's not enough here to intrigue me to read others in the series.   
 I had high hopes when I bought this reproduction cook book, based on my memories of my mother's (1947) edition of this famous cook book. However, the '47 edition was much better. This one is full of '50s-era recipes, with lots of canned food, gross casseroles made of Spam, etc. Plus the pages are "browned" to look like the book is aged, which just adds to the yucch factor. The food looks icky and the layout and illustrations are charmless. Want a retro cookbook? Buy the 1950 Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book (it's great!) or haunt the used bookstores for an old edition of The American Woman's Cook Book. Both are superior to this one 
 I'm sorry but I found this very tedious. I read a lot and I have never been prompted to give a review before, but I think you should be forwarned.  Though I did learn about several kinds of cancer and a bit about the process of becoming a wise and humane physician,  I did not learn anything new about the anatomy of hope.    If you're a die hard scientist and have to be spoon fed anything that is other, and you have been living under a rock for the last 20 years, perhaps you'll get something out of this book 
 I didn't know anything about author Iris Johansen before I picked up "Body of Lies" at the library, but as a thriller fan I thought I'd check out her brand of suspense. About fifty pages into the book I began suspecting that Ms. Johansen had a romance writing past. A check of her bibliography--with early titles like "Lion's Bride" and "The Magnificent Rogue"--confirmed my suspicions. Let me clarify that I have no problem with the romance genre, and Johansen certainly isn't the first romance novelist to make the jump to the thriller genre. But I prefer the thrillers I read to have a bit more edge, and Johansen's prose dulled that edge. Still, I kept reading because the story was intriging and fairly fast-paced. By page 200, though, I was starting to lose patience, and by page 300 my only motivation in finishing the novel was the anticipation of reading something else.  The characters Eve Duncan, her boyfriend Joe Quinn and Eve's adopted daughter Jane weren't terribly interesting to me and often seemed like they were all three the same person. Only the supporting character of Sean Galen seemed to possess any real personality. Too bad, because much of this story is told through dialog, which I don't have a problem with provided it's interesting dialog, but it isn't. Johansen--no Elmore Leonard she--prefers her characters in "Body of Lies" to spout off cliches or give us paragraph upon paragraph of exposition (between gazing, grimacing and moistening their lips, of course). In true detective show fashion, whenever the bad guys are cornered, they fill our heroine in on all their dastardly deeds, saving Eve the trouble of having to work too hard to dig it up on her own. Her story of an underground society of world leaders known only as the Cabal had potential, but it's wasted in this novel. Johansen seems on surer ground when dealing with Eve and Joe's turbulent, if irritating, relationship than political intrigue.  I don't want to be too hard on Johansen. Another disappointed reviewer mentioned her earlier thrillers being superior to this one, so maybe I just caught Iris when she wasn't quite on her game. However, I doubt I'll be reading another one of her books anytime soon. So now I'm going to wipe this grimace off my face, moisten my lips and turn my gaze to a different author.     
 Polacco manages to jam this children's book with urban poverty, fatherless homelife, ethnic consciousness, and even a Holocaust survivor.  Bravo to the queen of children's PC stories 
 Anyone looking for a reasonable analysis of causes & effects; well-thought out proposals for future change, or even just an engaing read: Look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a seemingly endless and repetitive whine from an author whose only skill seems to be find the fault in every act from everyone on every side, this is the book for you.    Worst of all, a classics professor with a scholarly reputation ought to know better than to fill a book of this sort with the same circular logic politicos resort to all the time, a la: "Though well meaning, the policies of the liberal elites aren't based on a real understanding of the needs of Hispanics, so those policies are bad... And, liberal elites policies, though well meaning, don't seem to be working, and that's evidence that liberals don't really understand the needs of Hispancis."  Huh?    Where's the beef?  Definately a D- performance for a crucially important issue that needs both legitimate scholarship and good enough rhetorical ability to compel the dispassionate masses to start paying attention 
 I like reading.  I am a literature snob.  I put down poorly written novels (even though I can't write well myself!).  But, I think I've met my match in this novel.  I recognize the style is something unique, but I just couldn't grasp the rhythm.  I'm afraid I'm going to have to side with those who gave this book thumbs down.  I really want to be in the group that appreciates this Plitzer Prize novel, but I don't make the cut.        HOwever, I'd love to read more from reviewers on what they saw in this book because I just couldn't find much other than the rambling thoughts of a very whiny and boring 40-something man whom I would't enjoy spending a 3-day-weekend with at all.        I've persistantly struggled through 180 pages, but now will surrender!   
 I have owned five of these UPS units over the past four years. I purchased three for my Mac and PC at home. Then I had to purchase two replacements for units that simply quit. Currently only ONE still works! I have very infrequent power outages, perhaps three in the past four years. These units work well to allow you to save your work and shut down. My G5 mac was so power hungry that I had to use one for the computer and another for the 23 inch LCD.  I can't comment on other UPS brands such as Belkin,  but I have seen many competing brands on the web and at the computer stores. There seen to be quite a few dealers selling refurbished APC products but this may be a reflection of APC's popularity rather than the poor reliability of their brand. My experience over the past four years has been mixed. These are not inexpensive units and you have to decide how precious your data becomes. If you really fear the loss of data during a blackout then the answer is clear. I chose to switch to high quality surge suppressors and never work during potential storms. Many users do not have that flexibility so a UPS is essential insurance. The units I puchased were identical and only one unit is still operational after four years. I can accept the need to replace the battery every one to two years; three of the batteries failed and alarms beeped until I bought new batteries. Prices vary from $15 to $50 depending on the vendor. Battery life depends on many factors so I don't begrudge APC for wear and tear on the battery but to have 4 out of 5 units simply stop working is unacceptable. I bought APC branded batteries and can't explain why the recurrent failures. I'm frustated with my APC products but it may be a problem with this model. Just beware of the hidden costs of battery replacement when purchasing an UPS 
 Maybe it's me, but I think that if you're writing a light-hearted mystery with a lot of one liners and some characters who are so exaggerated as to be basically comedy relief more than real people, maybe you shouldn't punctuate it with scenes of grotesque violence.  There are descriptions of acts in here that reminded me why I was never able to read "American Psycho"-- really appalling, hideous stuff.  And yet the book is clearly a comedy.  I just couldn't reconcile the two aspects of the book.  There are some other problems:  I saw the major twist coming from around page two-- Konrath uses a gimmick that should be retired by now; it's been done so often that it just leaps out at the reader.  Jack Daniels repeatedly acts in ways that violate any willingness  to suspend disbelief: she knows that she's targeted by a psychotic who's torturing people to death, you'd think she'd take the situation a tad more seriously.  This is the first book I've read by Konrath, whose jacket blurb conceals his/her gender, a move about as coy and pointless as much of the book.  I seriously doubt I'll ever read another 
 Senator Obama'a latest screed is a book about politics, common gound and reclaiming the American Dream. People looking for some deep thought that transcends our political, social, and foriegn policy issues are bound to be disapointed, especially if you are a progressive who swooned over his Speech at the Democratic Convention 2 years ago. The book breaks down into his childhood in Hawaii youthful indiscertions (a little coke, herb etc..) and the transition into the man he is today. Obama's centrism is really oft- putting to someone like me who feels that partisonship is a good idea (At least your enemies know where you stand)he would rather work the middle ground and find soloutions to our problems that are at it's heart does not lend itself to a 'gray area'.   The chapter I found on race is  typical Clinton doublespeak, As an Afro- American His appeal to 'universality' is trite at best because in one minute he knows he does not live an "authentic" cultural black expericence  Obama who is mixed is doing what Shelby Steele calls  " racial negotitating " making whites feel comfortable around someone like Obama who trusts that white america will do the right thing and he believes in the moral goodness of the majority white population and this country's ethos thereby he is liked for not challenging their morality. Obama tries to have it both ways empathizing with  the Afro- American and Hispanic  struggle (the vote he really needs to win election if he chooses to run for the Presidency)and he unlike many black intellectuals knows that the conservative movement used the symbols of the great society progress to butress their arguments in a "racial cold war". Obama fails when he lectures Latinos on Immirgration and by trying to find common ground he ends up alienating those who challenge this society's attitude about both blacks and Latinos.I think he is naive about race in this country, I for one do not trust the majority society to treat us with brotherhood and charity (after 389 years Afro- Americans ought to know better)I look at people as Enemies or Allies and white conservatives are the enemy of Afro- Americans or do we have to go to New Orleans for the Genocide (I see dead black people floating) they attempted last year.If Obama wants to negoitate with conservatives and find common ground that's his right, I would rather have power because it is the only thing White conservatives (and their minority allies) understand.  The last chapter he talks of his wife and her family that is the most touching thing in the whole book, his love for her seems genuine and you can tell he has empathy and concern for her and children in general. I feel that his book is just  and average at best. Maybe he might be President but he will not be the 'first black president'. But if you are a believer in Obama's charisma and think he can rise above petty politics and bring people of different races into a common American ideal then this book is for you, But if you do not like " Colorblind Centrists" like Obama and Harold Ford think they are weak 'Uncle Toms" then this book will to you be just average
