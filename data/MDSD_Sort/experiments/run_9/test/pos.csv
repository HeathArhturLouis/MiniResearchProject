 This book is one I couldn't put down, kept up my interest throughout.  Explains in full detail while also providing great photos and drawings in color that are simple to follow. You will be amazed at the wonderful results.  This undoubtedly will be a classic in the years to come. It teaches all you need to know in learning how to utilize different colors and yarn for your knitwear. I would love to rate this higher than 5 stars.    Included among the chapters are many various styles of sweaters, sweater coats, children sweaters, Norwegian Sweaters, and even cardigan borders in detail, or knitting without patterns at all, and even knitting your own color picture graph without any difficulty. Color blending so easy, you will find it hard to believe that you can do it as quickly as you do. Also included, Embellished Children's Sweaters, an elephant, a ghost, a dinosaur and believe it or not, a "cute" snake.  Also included, a great section on Charting Lace, picturing Alice Starmore's design "Flying Birds", and how to accomplish the task of charting lace.  Terrific chapter by Nancy Marchant teaching the three basic techniques of Intarsia knitting, including wonderful photos and diagrams showing how to do perform this amazing art.  Ribbing that holds it shape, hems and pockets, and much,, much  more. This is a wonderful knitting book that should be in every knitter's library.  This one is a keeper 
 I have a kind of love-hate relationship with Springsteen. I LOVE his earlier stuff, but I'm not so keen on his more recent material. I LOVE his concerts when he's got the E Street Band with him, but I don't really care for his solo shows.  As for this album, I almost love it. I definitely like and recommend it.   My problem is that it's successor, "Born to Run," is, in my opinion, the greatest rock album of all time. It represents greatness, and was Springsteen's pinnacle album. "The Wild..." also is a fantastic, solid album, but it falls just short of that greatness for me.  Having said that, I often find myself listening to these two albums together because you can hear the beginnings of the masterful songwriting and musical composition that elevates "Born to Run" to legendary status. For example, the musical playfulness that makes "10th Avenue Freeze Out" such a timeless song seems to have grown its roots on this album's "Rosalita."  "The Wild..." is the perfect preamble to "Born to Run:" enjoyable and solid in its own right, and a teasing taste of what's to come 
 This series just keeps getting better and better. In this installemnt we find Eve investigating the murder of someone from her past.   Watching Robb reveal the layers of Eve and Roarke, two of my all time favorite fictional characters gets better with each book. Readers will be pleased with this installment and anxious for the next one to arrive. Another winner in a fabulous series 
 Ever since Robert Penn Warren's "All The King's Men," Huey Long has owned a special place of contempt in the American consciousness.  His popularity in Louisiana has given the rest of America to hold Louisiana in a special kind of contempt.  Louisianans are stereotyped as ignorant, credulous "booboisie" (to use H.L.Mencken's term) because of their loyalty to a man like Long.  This grasps a very important point, though:  is the highest form of democracy the ability of leadership to deliver results?  Long was not just about rhetoric and image.  People of his "type" are often the only politicians willing to act for regular people, and this fact is held dear by many in Louisiana who might still remember the kingfish.  He did not merely promise things like free schoolbooks and new roads, but he delivered them.  The same is true for, believe it or not, free medical care.  And, much contrary to the times, these resources were made available to all regardless of race or status.  After Katrina, we're eager to see Louisiana as worthless.  But, incredibly, instead of blaming FEMA, majority opinion casts the people of New Orleans in the villains' role, and "All The King's Men" gives us that permission.  White's book restores a needed sense of balance to this perception.  If there is any conclusion to be drawn, it might be that Long delivered too much, not too little.  In so doing, he might have inadvertantly fashioned a sense of trust in the effectiveness of government which was tragically misplaced 
 It's been almost 4 years since the 8th Edition came out. A lot has happened on TV since 2003--Lost? Criminal Minds? Deadwood? House? Heroes?...the list goes on. I hope the 9th Edition is just as informative. 
 This is one of her best. I had bought the book a week ago and finished it in about twenty minutes and I loved every page. Keep on writing them 
 Excellent book very easy read,very informative, would recommend this book. I purchased other books on the same topic but this was by far the bes 
 Talking Timbuktu is a conversation between jazz and traditional West African music, likely the grandfather of jazz. Wonderful rhythms, great improvisation and evocative emotional expression 
 Awesome book and face paint! Paint is very easy to use and remove. Color pictures in the book are excellent giving the novice to the professional painter creative ideas & techniques. A big hit in our home 
 A recent work by MacPherson on the battle of Antietam attempts to locate the turning point in the Civil War. Reading this work one wonders if the whole history of abolition is not a series of endless turning points against eternal delays. This very cogent work by someone acquainted with the facts is an invaluable expose of how politics actually works in that scarface Uncle Sam's 'democracy' of equals. Giving the history and gritty details of post-Reconstruction politics dominated by the Bourbon elites, it is essential reading for anyone attempting to decipher the legacy of the Civil Rights movement this period prefigures, and starts to anticipate. Histories of Roosevelt's presidency don't always make clear what was going on, and the obstacles he faced. Nor do we quite assess the effect of the Second World War on the economic context behind Jim Crow in its ad infinitum history of domination, political manipulation, and class and racial struggle. We can see the great tide turning in the thirties and forties, as the struggle begins just to recoup the ground lost in the 1870's and after, Lyndon Johnson's voting rights bill a resurrection of the same failed bill of the Redemption era. Out of many issues in this very useful book is a reminder of how Lyndon Johnson, extremely adept in this Lost Cause dominion, was deftly able at the right moment to get the job done, if it has been done. With this history, keep your eyes peeled. We could be far short of 'done' 
 Edwin Black has done it again, placing 7,000 years of Iraqi history into extraordinary perspective, reminding us of the truth and revealing the newly discovered facts to create an indispensible chronicle of that troubled land and its relation to Britain, France and the United States. That said, the book is really devoted to the last 150 years, when the importance of oil sprang upon the world and Iraq slowly rose to the top of the western nations' agenda as the greatest petroleum source of the new 20th Century. Black's access to heretofore secret oil company archives and his resurrection of forgotten military accounts reveals that Iraq has been desired by the west only for one thing: oil. This book changed my entire thinking and I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to understand how we got into Iraq and whether we can ever get out 
 I traveled to India on business, where just plugging something in was quite the adventure, so when I pulled this little gizmo out of my suitcase (where it took up almost no room), attached it to my laptop, and heard the whir of it going into action ... well, I almost wept. So far from home, with such a little piece of technical ingenuity. I have wanted to thank Canon for the past year, and so I'm doing it now. We actually use the BJC-85 as a secondary printer in my home business ... you know how it is, you don't want to walk all the way from the dining room to the office. It's sturdy, compatible with Mac and PC, and just too cute for words. For goodness sakes, it's not much bigger than a carton of eggs 
 	The youth of Frank McCourt is one that I would never wish upon any other human being.  Often starving or ill, his whole family is disjoint and falling apart whether in Brooklyn, New York or Limerick, Ireland.  His father's alcoholism and his younger siblings' mortality rate both enrage and soften the reader of this tremendous memoir.  He constantly captures these moments of his childhood wonderfully in his seven-year-old voice.  His description of his father's desire for his sons to die for Ireland is almost comically scary, "He's pushing in our door and singing, And if, when all a vigil keep, The West's asleep, The West's asleep!  Alas! And well my Erin weep, That Connnacht lies in slumber deep, But hark! A voice like thunder spake `The West's awake!  The West's awake! Sing, Oh hurrah, let England quake, We'll watch till death for Erin's sake'" (111).  The way that McCourt captures the voice of his drunken, patriotic father is heartbreakingly wonderful.  Telling the whole story through his own eyes as he grows up himself adds a level to the storytelling that few other authors can mimic.  If you liked Mary Karr's The Liars' Club, you will love Angela's Ashes in the same way.  Both Karr and McCourt capture the voice of a child perfectly.  Another thing that McCourt does with scenes like this is to present to the reader the rich passion his father has for Ireland and set the scene of his childhood even better.  As Karr did with her father's loyalty to Texas, McCourt does with his father's obsession with his homeland.  Both of them use specific scenes with each parent to really deliver the story of their lives.  Angela's Ashes blew me away and I would recommend it to anyone. 
 David Lanz's Sacred Road is definitely a Sacred Road that one must travel. I have traveled the music of Sacred Road and it was one of the most enriching and beautiful experiences that has ever happened to me. Listening to the music that David Lanz creates is a great treat that everybody should be able to experience as much as they possibly can. I would recommend Sacred Road for any Piano, New Age, or Music Lover. If you are not a music lover, I would still recommend this album to you. This album has made a positive effect on my life and I would like to thank David Lanz and the music that he creates. If you have the opportunity, get all of David's albums. They ARE all worth the experience 
 That is a very good introduction book to cosmology at an undergraduate level. Although there are not many complicated equations, the physics ideas are very clear. It covers a lot of materials with easy-to-understand languages. The big bang model is the main part, with concise introduction to dark matter/energy, neuclosynthesis, cosmic microwave background, inflation etc. After reading this book, you will have a general idea about most of the concepts in cosmology and about what is going on in modern cosmology. Each chapter is accompanied by some problems, which are good exercise to understand the context. But I think it is a little outdated now, so maybe you should buy the 2nd edition 
 I am a huge ADO.NET nut and David's first book was absolutely priceless. After his last book, he set a very high bar that was going to be hard to meet, yet that's exactly what he did.  Pros:  - He discusses every facet of the ADO.NET library and does it well - He doesn't shy away from difficult topics and in particular, goes straight at them in his Advanced Update section - Excellent flow - Won't leave you hanging if you don't know the 1.x framework but doesn't bog itself down in it either. - Stellar writing style.  David is interesting and always keeps you wanting to read more. He's concise, to the point yet does both without ever leaving you wanting for more.  CONS -Calling this  a con is probably a bit unfair but if there's one thing I didn't like was the coverage to TableAdapters.  This has nothing to do with Sceppa's coverage and everything to do with the objects themselves.  Since I never use them I have a bias against them.  With that said, I doubt you could do a Core Reference without covering them so this doesn't really count.  The specific areas that this book really does a great job in is Transactions, Advanced Updates and client side data manipulation. Items like the syntax for DataTable.Select are covered in such stellar detail there's probably no situation that you will be unprepared for. Transactions are another complex area and this section alone makes the book worth its price.  Advanced updates are a must in any ADO.NET book and history repeated itself here.  Pure Gold plain and simple.  
 Letters to a Young Poet is a short read that you can run your eyes and your soul over again and again!  But just because it is a short read does not mean it has to be a quick read.  Rilke's words were so rich and full that I had to read his letters slowly.  I found I enjoyed savoring his beautifully sculpted words even though part of me wished to devour them.  Mr. Kappus, a young poet struggling with life in military school, discovers that he is enrolled in the same military school that Rilke used to attend.  Therefore, he decides to seek Rilke's advice and opinions in his poetic endeavors through written correspondence.  This book is a compilation of ten letters Rilke sends in response to Mr. Kappus's letters.  After the letters themselves, the book builds background context to the letters by informing the reader about Rilke's life and state of mind during the time these letters were written.  I found this book inspiring and saddening at the same time.  It isn't really the advice Rilke offers that I value and enjoy so much.  My love for this collection of letters stems from the incredible word pictures that Rilke paints in my head and his touchingly sincere style of writing.  For example he paints a visual of patience with, "Being an artist means, not reckoning and counting, but ripening like the tree which does not force its sap and stands confident in the storms of spring without the fear that after them may come no summer."  His words stir something in the heart.  He writes with such intensity and depth that you can see each lesson taught and each thought that is shared has been earned at a high cost to the writer.  He speaks to the young poet on solitude and patience for which he has himself been battling to achieve.  As I read, I began to feel that maybe he is actually advising and encouraging himself as much as Mr. Kappus through writing these letters.    At first I didn't really find the ending section of the book on the life of Rilke very interesting.  In fact, it bored me until I got to the background of about Rilke's sixth letter which contained more of Rilke's own words from correspondence he had with other people.  But when I went back and read the letters again, I saw even more depth and emotion in them revealed by the context built in that ending biographical section.  This is one of those books I'd keep handy for repeated reading.  The reason I rated the book a 4 instead of 5 is because I don't know if this book is for everyone.  I really enjoyed it, and I truly believe most will.  But I could see some that will read it and just not find the beauty in it.  If you love the magnitude of words, this book is for you.  Drink it deeply and enjoy!  
 When I read this book, I was completely impressed with the author's power to draw you into the scene of the story. I mean, I was seeing mountains and open grass lands and beautiful horses - and I've never seen them in real life. This book is very well-written, and the imagery is powerful and moving.   The main character, Cole, is chasing after a lifestyle that has passed. A life that is no more. He wants beauty in the world; all he finds is pain and sorrow. And maybe that is the way it is for all of us. We want what he wants, but reality crushes our view that this world can be made perfect if only this could happen...if only that could happen...It cannot. This is one of the most powerful themes in the book: we are all chasing a life that in many ways cannot exist in this world. 
  I consider "The War of the Worlds" to be one of the top five science fiction stories of all time. It has been the model for two excellent movies and the driving force behind one of the greatest unintentional hoaxes of all time. The original story is set in England at around 1900 and that has not been altered in this story.   Evans does an excellent job in altering the language to fit current usage while maintaining the integrity of the original story. The abridgment retains all of the excitement of the story and the presentation is suitable for the target level of reader. The illustrations capture the action; I was particularly struck with the detail of the facial expressions.  
 Audie Murphy's screen autobiography is a much better film than it has any right to be... The Army provides a Depression-era kid from East Texas with a strong family structure that he has never really experienced...  In 1937, a young Audie Murphy (played by Gordon Gebert as a boy, by Murphy himself later) is forced to become the head of a family with an ailing mother and an absent father... He drops out of grade school and goes to work full time to provide for his younger siblings until, at roughly the same time, World War II starts and his mother dies...   By enlisting in, Murphy can provide more money for his brothers, but neither the Navy nor the Marines were interested in the small guy...  In the Army, Murphy is promoted to Corporal on the troop ship carrying him overseas where he joins the 3rd Infantry Division, B Company, 15th Regiment... It soon becomes apparent that the likable 'baby face kid,' hardly old enough to shave, has a genuine aptitude for soldiering...  After North Africa, his outfit takes part in the invasions of Sicily, Anzio and Southern France... In every engagement, Murphy steps up and excels as a soldier... At the same time, he becomes friends with Brandon (Charles Drake), Johnson (Marshall Thompson), and Kerrigan (Jack Kelly). He sees himself as part of a unit, and everything that he does is meant to advance the unit, not the individual... Murphy liked to work alone, putting only himself at risk...  The one long scene that moves away from the Military--an interlude in an Italian town where he meets Maria (Susan Kohner) and her family, is embarrassingly bad... As long as the focus stays on the platoon's activities on the battlefield, the film is in fine shape... Director Jesse Hibbs makes the cold mud and rain of the Italian campaign believably real, especially a series of scenes revolving around a farmhouse and a burning tank...  One might assume that Murphy's indomitable courage would be described as Rambo--like heroics, but in comparing the film with the official combat reports, it is clear that Murphy became an astounding soldier by skill, training, intelligence, and luck... He was an equal opportunity soldier, doing everything the front line combatant is required to do in order to take and hold ground through Sicily, Italy, France, and into Germany...  All of the events recounted in the film take place before Murphy was 19 years old... In that brief military career, Audie L. Murphy becomes one of the best fighting combat soldiers of the last century... He never really seemed to care about the medals or glory, just the men of his unit and friends who fall down in the European Theater of Operations...   Murphy died tragically on May 28, 1971, when the private plane in which he was a passenger crashed into a mountain near Roanoke, Virginia... He was 46.  His last film role was earlier that year, playing Jesse James in 'A Time for Dying.'   
 In "The Murder Room", a British television production of the P.D. James novel, Commander Adam Dalgliesh (Martin Shaw) investigates a murder committed at the Dupayne Museum in London. Siblings Neville (Michael Maloney), Caroline (Samantha Bond), and Marcus  Dupayne (Nicholas Le Prevost) are trustees of the museum, and they must all agree and sign the upcoming lease renewal in order for the museum to remain open. Neville, a psychiatrist, loathes the museum--partly because it dwells unhealthily on the past, and partly because it's a monument to a father he hated. Neville is under tremendous pressure--his siblings (and there's no love lost here)--are pressuring him to sign. Neville's daughter is pressuring him not to sign. Between family pressures and patient demands, Neville slices a small time of escape when he picks up his parked Jaguar from the museum and drives off for solitary weekends in the country.   When Neville is horribly murdered, there is no shortage of suspects. Neville's decision to close the museum resulted in plenty of people who'd like him dead--there's Tally (Anita Carey) the kindly, cat-loving housekeeper who would lose her job and her home, Ryan (Sid Mitchell)--one of Neville's ex-patients, and squabbling siblings, Marcus and Caroline.  To complicate matters, Neville's murder is a copy-cat slaying of one of the crimes memorialized by the museum's 'Murder Room'--a room devoted to some of the most heinous murders of the 20th century. Commander Dalgleish must find the killer while deftly not offending his superiors (who take an inordinate amount of interest in the museum) or upsetting the surviving, volatile Dupaynes. While trying to solve the case, Dalgleish is involved with Emma (Janie Dee--"Death in Holy Orders")--and the course of true love does not run smooth.  "The Murder Room" is an elegant, interesting mystery, but suffers a little from unnecessary distractions. Can a mystery have too many suspects? Perhaps or perhaps not--but there are several sub-plots here that amount to distractions when viewers really do want to stay firmly on the trail. Also, while there's a nice parallel drawn to Neville Dupayne's inability to establish intimate relationships and Commander Dalgleish's own tentative romance with Emma, somehow Emma's romance with Dalgleish is unbelievable. He wrestles with his demons, and she has a tantrum about his scheduling. Dalgliesh's difficulties with intimacy fit his character, but Emma's inability to accept the demands of his profession seem ludicrously and curiously flighty. Ultimately, in view of Emma's failure to accept the demands of Dalgleish's career, their romance is unlikely at best. Fans of British mystery & Dalgleish will not be disappointed, however, in this extremely well conducted programme. Special note for the entertaining performance of Jack Shepherd as James Caulder-Hale. Extras include an interview with author P.D. James and information on the cast--displacedhuma 
 Most anyone knows that they are supposed to read Homer's Iliad at some point in their life, but many are intimidated by its complexity.  For starters, try Rosemary Sutcliff's Black Ships Before Troy.  It is a beautiful and delightful read for all ages.  You can easily sort the characters and get a grip on the plot without wading through the epic or the longer narrative.  Once you have done this, you may muster the courage to attack the Iliad itself and impress all of your friends, or you can just let them think you are an expert in ancient literature after Black Ships Before Troy 
 The person below is a kook and she says practically the same thing in ALL her reviews. I find this book funny, and I love the fact it remembers to account for children affected in a breakup. The Bible is filled with offensive material and advice any idiot should know, but I wouldn't dream of throwing it out 
  This is an excellent book for young children to learn about the states. A topographical map of each state is given along with diagrams and text explaining various facts about the state. Items like the state bird, state flower, state insect, state tree, endangered species in the state, primary crops, unusual natural features, famous people and other points of historical significance. I strongly recommend it for social studies classes or just for quizzes among family members.  
  Because of poor money management by her clergyman father, Agnes becomes a governess, first to the Bloomfield family and then to the Murrays. Writing in the first person, Agnes relates her experiences, taking her remembrances from a journal she's kept for many years. Caring for the three spoiled Bloomfield children, she learns all about arrogance and over-indulgent parenthood. It is always Agnes's fault when the children misbehave. Yet it is her calm reportage and her own high principles that mainly impress the reader.   With the Murrays her problems are different, and concern mainly the dealings of flirtatious Rosalie, who cares only about finding a suitable husband. Of course she chooses poorly and ends up unhappy. It's Agnes, though, who comes through all this the "victor": not only does she find a good husband in Edward Weston (the curate whom Rosalie had rejected), but she is obviously head-and-shoulders above the upper-middle class people she works for in morality, decency, self-respect, even common sense. To witness Agnes's success is the joy of the book; her straightforward and ironic tone only add to the pleasure 
 I'm a Turkish french horn student who lives in Cleveland. I didn't have any recordings of Baumann when I was in Turkey. I came to USA and got this CD. With his great technique, Baumann makes it sound very easy. And his  musiquality is also wonderful. I love his cadenzas. This guy is a great  motivation for me. If you like horn, you have to get this 
 This is a similar version of the top I had when I was a child in the 50's.  Lot's of fun, low hum and changing colors.  
 Zweig is a gripping storyteller and these stories are taut, atmospheric and psychologically astute. Zweig explores the human mind in the grip of obsession, fear, guilt, sexuality and suicide. My favorite of these five stories was "The Burning Secret", a brilliant exploration of the anatomy of the seduction of a married woman, with her young son the implement of the seducer's art. In the process we are shown the inner workings of a child's mind as it becomes aware of the hidden power of sexuality. Each story is gripping and beautifully written 
 I had wanted to read this for quite awhile so when I happened on it in a bookstore (such luck! HARD to find classic gothic literature in ANY bookstore) I snatched it right up.  I was surely not let down. This book is glorious, it sneaks up on you and you can't put it down.  It's not as "well written" as some other gothic classics such as "Mysteries of Udolpho" or "Melmoth the Wanderer" in my opinion...but it none the less a book not to be missed if you love this genre.  A true treat for the mind and soul 
 I am a huge Muppet fan, and was very excited to have the opportunity to get a newer, remastered version of this classic. While the quality is not too much better than the original DVD release, it is definitely worth adding to your collection, especially if you don't have any version of The Movie yet! 
 I bought this book to get an introduction to oil painting before i went out and spent my hard earned on brushes, oils etc etc...to be honest I didn't know what I needed to buy! This book solved that initial problem, aswell as giving me heaps of information to ease me into the medium + food for thought and excellent 'down to earth' advice/inspiration. I haven't left it out of my sight and everytime i open it up I encounter something new...Thanks Mister Gorst on a very fine book indeed! The design/layout of the book is also excellent and you won't find a page lacking in wisdom.. 
 Much longer lasting than the standard battery.  Fast shipping 
 nice simple design, easy to use, worked great for me so far 
 this book is a biography of ken kesey.in case you havent had a flashback recently,he wrote "one flew over the cuckoos nest".but when he made oodles of money from it,he defied the sell out path the other hippies took and went big time in full hippie fashion.no limos here!he bought a school bus and painted it all hippie like.then he drove around the counyties "staging happenings".these stretched from everything from trying to make  a 2 day long movie to running a moving radio station from the bus called "klsd" .his seemingly innocent  antics ended up in wild times like 2000 people showing up at his farm after a beatles concert,the hells angels cleaning up in aprons and even crazier stuff.loads more!anyhow,they eventualy start doing "acid tests".youre gonna gave to trust me on this but these tests are really cool.id tell you but its a suprise.id rate this as one of the top ten best books ever. 
 Thanks for the prompt, accurate delivery of this product 
 Sin Bandera offered us a nice CD and I was surprised when I heard the songs "Será", "Un Buen Perdedor" and "Si Tú No Estás aquí" that I heard the original versions and These new ones are as good as those but Sin Bandera conserves its unique style.  Nice... I recommend it! 
 It's been a long time since I read a book that motivated me to action like this one.  Women still make 76 cents to every dollar earned by men-who knew?  It's a great read and spans a lot of material-from the history of American feminism to contemporary women's issues and politics.  If you want to know about women and politics, and the current state of women's issues, this is the book for you.       Packed with stories from young women across the country, this book flows well and is an inspiring call to action.  And, as a bonus there's a reading group guide and several how-to sections (like how-to get information about issues and candidates, how-to run for office, etc.).       My book group will certainly pick this one up!  The readers guide included in the book provides ample ideas to spark great discussions. 
 Since the premiere of the first episode of "Batman: The Animated Series" in 1992, Warner Brothers has produced a number of cartoon series based on the great heroes of DC Comics. After the three-season run of "Batman," the production team turned their attention to the Man of Steel, redefining the hero and matching him up against villains old and new.   This DVD set offers the episodes from the second season, by far the best of the three the WB produced, as the creative team hit their stride. Its stories - which were critical in what was viewed by the producers as a plot-driven series - were free from the often formulaic plotting of much of the first season and the sometimes strained premises of the third. Though there are few duds here, among the best of this set are the hilarious "Mxyzpixilated," the stark parallel-world story "Brave New Metropolis," and the epic-length "World's Finest," which saw Superman join forces with Batman to stop a partnership of their respective nemeses, Lex Luthor and the Joker.   Fans of the series will enjoy this set, with its quality audio and video transfer. An added bonus is the audio commentaries provided by production teams on three of the episodes, which give a nice behind-the-scenes glimpse into the preparation of the series. It's obvious from them that for the producers, directors, and writers involved that much of their work is a labor of love, remaining true to the basic elements of the Superman mythology in the comics while modifying enough elements to keep it fresh. Their pride in the series shows through, though they are also willing to admit both the visual errors and the storytelling problems that would face later on. Such candor only improves the quality of their commentary. No true fan of the series should pass up this set, while people new to the series will find hours of enjoyable storytelling, animation, and voicework on these discs 
 The Hollow Oak book was about a message along with treasure hidden in a Hollow Oak by a man named Pere' Fracious.  He was a french surveyor who traveled to indian villages and one of Nancy's new friends Bocecy and his crew of detectives were trying to find the message. However, because they didn't have enough time to find the treasure, he told Nancy about it and thought maybe she could discover it.  When she gets on the case, a man maned Kit Kadle tries to stop her from getting the treasure by kidnapping two people to scare her off the case. Instead she finds the two people and finds the treasure.  I thought the book was very exciting and intriguing because it really had me glued to the book so much that I never wanted to put down.  It really had my attention.  submitted by Brittany, I 
 Doctor who materialised without his Tardis on this, my first timelord download in the amazon unbox, which is much larger on the inside than it appears on the outside.  For a very reasonable sum, $1.99, my family and I were able to enjoy the first Third doctor adventure after his regeneration, where he encounters the Nestene Conciousness.  The down load took only a few minutes although I had some considerable difficulty installing the microsoft program. thanks to the good people at amazon tech support I was able to obtain an alternative download from the gates empire itself which allowed me to enjoy our rental.  a great experience and will not be the last. easy to navigate and fun for all the family. someone should tell the timelords on gallifrey about unbox and perhaps they could get rid of all the old type 40 tardis' 
  Anyone who has read anything published by Gordon Wood knows that he has a knack for making history and politics unique and accessible.  After initially upsetting a few of the established academics with this bold, new take on the American Revolution, this book has become a standard for many college classrooms and a new generation of historians.  Wood's analysis focuses on the successes of the revolution rather than its failures and examines how, when put into historical context, the Revolution was indeed radical and extremely significant.  This book is full of interesting anecdotes and facts that make the revolutionary period much more tangible than other texts, and Wood's concise style and ability to clearly connect the dots between events make it profound and easy to read.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know more about the revolution and the period that would lay the foundation for the constitution and an entirely new system of government.  All in all, an excellent read.   
 This book clearly, easily teaches the 5 different ways we each relate to one another.    It is applies very well to couples; however, the principles also provide essential insight into relating with children, colleagues... anyone!  It makes an excellent group book study or a read-on-one's own 
 This is Bernard Malamud's best book. It is written with a kind of understated beauty . The story of Frankie Alpine the assistant who works in the grocery of Morris Bober , and connects himself in suffering with Jewish identity contains the heart of Malamud's 'universalization of his own Jewishness'. The book is a moving story, including the love story between Alpine and the elderly grocer's daughter. Malamud's tender and humane ironic tone informs his warm relation to his characters.  One of those rare books which seems to fully make concrete an abstract ideal of human goodness. 
 I feel as if I truly missed out as a lad in not reading this book.  Unfortunately, the book was more or less verboten in the UK when I was young as racist, imperialist etc etc  I don't find the book to be either of these things.  If it's racist, then the racially superior ones are Tibetans, as personified by Kim's beloved lama, the inferior ones are Sahibs (whites), and, in particular, non-Anglo sahibs who are notably mean-spirited and cruel, not just laughable, like the Anglos.  If it's imperialist, then it's only depicting the India that Kipling knows.  I don't find anywhere in this book the notion that this should always be the case or that Indians couldn't eventually win their independence.  There may be undertones to this effect.  But undertones, of course, are notoriously ambiguous and subjective.  What this book IS then is a lovely adventure and spy novel, as well as a sort of Bildungsroman for Kim.  It is also a book whose main character seems, at times, to be the Indian land itself, portrayed lovingly and gracefully throughout the work--and also, it's just good rollicking fun!  No, it's not exactly literature.  Aside from the lama's speculation on the wheel of life, and on the illusory nature of the senses, no profound insights abound.  But Kipling is not a particularly introspective writer.  Note: Those of you with the Penguin Classics edition and Edward Said's rambling 50 page introduction, pray don't bother with it.  It's nothing more than an obfuscatory, academic apologia for Kipling's racism and imperialism, evident perhaps in other works, but not here, which I suppose Penguin felt they had to include. Bother it.  Jump headlong into the adventure!     
  Semisonic, a band known by their one hit song `Closing Time," began many years before their song was even a thought.  Jacob Slichter, the drummer, knew both Dan Wilson and John Munson a long time before `Closing Time.'  Semisonic became a band called Pleasure in 1992.  They tried hard to get a record deal, to eventually get two offers.  After picking one, they started an album, only to have major problems with the people in charge.  Their first album Great Divide came out but problems occurred since Semisonic became hard to place in the world of Nirvana and Green Day.  The band members spent lots of money traveling, even making their first video.  Meanwhile, Jacob had to overcome his own nerves onstage.  It took Feeling Strangely Fine and the single `Closing Time' for the band to make it.  But the band could easily become a one hit wonder.  So You Wanna Be a Rock & Roll Star details Jacob's trip with the band Semisonic.  He talks honestly about wanting to be a star but being terrified of performing.  He allows readers into his own fears about music videos, performing, and being dropped by a label.  He talks candidly about the pressures of becoming and staying a star.  Jacob writes wonderfully about traveling.  I honestly enjoyed this book between some of the chunks of technical information. 
 While the "Gold Experience" doesn't cover the myriad history of popular music as "Sign 'o The Times" or the "Symbol" album does, what it does deliver is something that most popular performers and bands don't deliver: intellegence and style.   This recording came out in 1995 after "failing" with the "Symbol" recording and the "Prince is dead" "Come" recording.   To say that Prince was heading in a different direction is a misnomer, because none of his recordings sound much like the other ones unless it serves his musical purpose. And yet, with the beginning of this recording, it was clear to those who have studied Prince over the years that this was a clear break from the "Diamonds and Pearls", "Purple Rain" and the "Sign O'The Times" eras. This was Prince at odds with Warner Brothers. This was Prince who was sick of being told how much, when and where he could record. This was Prince starting to break away from the "music business" mold that still operates on premises that started with rock and roll in the mid-1950's.   Warner Brothers really slammed Prince by making fun of his "symbol" name while promoting this recording by annoucing this CD with a bunch of squiggly lines as if to say here is Prince and Prince is weird, thus, making a statement that Prince couldn't market himself the way he saw fit.  As for the CD, well, it didn't sell well and Prince balked that the package was not promoted enough and correctly. Incidently, this is the last full blown album of specific new music intended to be sold as a package. "Chaos and Disorder" and some other "NPG" projects fulfilled his contract and he became an idependant artist, recording, packaging and marketing any future projects on his own. As many of you already know, the first recording of this era is "Emancipation".  Prince is still hands down the most talented and visionary artist of all time. You will never hear "manufactured music" coming from Prince. One or two songs here and there might sound like it, but once you break down the music and/or the words, you'll realize that every note has it's place and every word has a meaning. Even if that meaning is obscure, I challenge you to listen as you may find something you didn't expect to find....yourself. 
 So, all right it's a c-d, but "Turntable Matinee" reminds those of us old enough to remember what it was like to set the needle in the groove and hear something special and not bat an eye at an occasional crackle or pop. This album is fantastic. Most are comparing it to Buddy Holly & the Crickets. There's some truth to that, but I'm hearing some Nick Lowe & Rockpile in there too. This album has a great "live" feel to it. I'm already looking to see what club they'll be coming to in my area 
 What enjoyment I find in this book!! It tells me all about the lives of the greatest songwriters the world has ever known...where they grew up, how they got into songwriting, what they wrote, who they wrote with, the movies and shows they did, and so much more. The era described extends from 1927 to the mid-sixties when rock arrived. During that period the greatest American songs were written. It is doubtful that the world will ever know another such a wonderful period or such songwriters. This is a book to treasure; to be read and reread if you remember the classic songs of that era 
 My daughter gave me this book with her strong recommendaton.  I resisted, thinking I was not interested in a book about cooking.  Finally guilt forced me to pick it up and, for once, I'm grateful for guilt.  I actually laughed out loud throughout.  Sure, if you want a book devoid of sex, profanity and politics, it's probably not for you.  But, if you can handle all that, this is a delightful read.  Rita Bleiman, author Dirty Trick 
 This is certainly the best book of the year that I have read.She spares us nothing of the torment of her life;yet it is told with such simplicity and elegance. anyone who considers themself a serious reader owes it to themselves to read this memoir 
 Parahia is no doubt one of the ultimate and authoritative interpretors of Bach's keyboard works. This recording is a good exmaple of his precision (Teutonically so!) and artistry in a beautiful blend. This is the "Mercedes" of the Goldberg! Highly recommend it to anyone who likes Bach, keyboard, or baroque music 
 If you have trouble making up your mind, this otherwise excellent guide will frustrate you. There are 2,500 species of palms in the world, and Floridians Robert Riffle and Paul Craft almost never met one they didn't like -- a lot. Like mothers who love all their children but have a favorite, Riffle and Craft do praise some palms more than others. This is what they have to say about Cyrtostachys renda from Southeast Asia: "The slender diaphanous trunks are heartbreakingly beautiful and so thin and lissome as to often bend as if they were long stalks of big blossoms in a bouquet.  . . . The younger stems add incredibly beautiful tiers of leaves from top to bottom; however it is the magnetic attraction of the long, red crownshafts that makes this species irresistible." Not every entry in "An Encyclopedia of Cultivated Palms" involves quite so much heavy breathing. Of the Samoan palm Clinostigma samoense, they say merely, "There is no more beautiful palm species." But they say that about lots of species. Ceroxylon quindiuense of the Columbian Andes, for example, is the tallest palm in the world, and Craft and Riffle label it "beyond spectacular." In truth, they make the reader believe that palms are underappreciated. For a plant family that is the essence of the tropics, it is surprising how few species like real heat. Like humans, almost all palms like to be warm but not hot. Only a few can stand even a short while at below freezing temperatures, but equally few are able to stand the scorching desert the way the date palm can. Hawaii would have been a paradise for palms, but only one or perhaps two ever made it here on their own. It is still undetermined whether the coconut floated here by itself or came with the Polynesians. The only native palms are the Pritchardias, all evolved from (probably) one migrant that made its way up from somewhere in the South Pacific. Once here, Pritchardias radiated into more than two dozen species, but many of these are either extinct or heading that way. They are commonly called fan palms, or loulu in Hawaiian, and a few species are regularly encountered in landscaping. Many, many of the species in this encyclopedia are either extinct in the wild or probably going. The center of palm extinction is Madagascar, where a rapidly expanding, desperately poor population is eating its way through its forests and the 200 species of native palms. Elsewhere, the expansion of agriculture, coastal development and an extravagant taste for eating the growing tips of large trees are threatening many species of palms. There is -- or was -- a palm for just about every situation between the tropics of Capricorn and Cancer, from salty marsh to high desert, though rainforest is the favorite setting. Mature palms range down from Ceroxylon's 200 feet to just a few inches. The longest, some of the rattan palms, grow over 300 feet, but they have to climb over other trees. Palms are amazingly spindly. Even the most robust come nowhere near the girth of deciduous trees like, say, monkeypod, and some species in New Guinea are more than 500 times taller than they are thick. How these hold themselves up is a wonder. 
 While I have not had the honor of meeting Jackie Wiggins, I am never the less very impressed with this book. I especially found the first four chapters helpful. This textbook was referred to frequently during my recent Curriculum Planning class taught by Northwestern graduate, Dr. Michelle Kaschub 
 Everyone whines about campaign finance reform, it's about time someone talked about what we can actually DO.  This is a great read, a super analysis of the issue, and a very well thought out description of what can be done about it 
 When Helma Zukas graduated from high school, 20 years ago, she was put in charge of the class treasury and charged with organizing a 20th. class reunion.  Helma is reminded of the promise by an anonymous note which spurs her on to begin organizing the event.  Since she had wisely invested the class's money, she had enough to fly her classmates out to Seattle where she had moved from Scoop River, Michigan.  Furthermore, her best friend Ruth, also a classmate, offered the use of her friend's island resort as a gathering place.  Many surprises awaited Helma, Ruth, and their classmates on the island, and most of them were unpleasant.  Dead bodies begin to appear and Miss Zukas is again in the middle of a murder mystery.  A dense fog covers the island and the threat of the murderer becomes even more imminent.  Helma and Ruth go through their usual amusing efforts at crime solving and finally do uncover the murderer.  This is a fun and quick read 
 I finished reading Triumph of Hope this morning, after starting it two days ago. I simply couldn't put it down. The author, Ruth Elias, is nothing less than extraordinary. The way that she expresses her memories, through her style of writing and description, helps us to get one step closer to understanding an experience, which we can never really comprehend, because we were not there. Mrs Elias's life is remarkable, and through reading her book I thoroughly believe that she is a genuinely lovely, kind and warm person. It is such a tragedy that the Jewish people of her generation went through turmoil and absolute hell. But through this book, Ruth's aims - to spread the message that the discrimination and racism they experienced should never be repeated - are being achieved when a single person reads her book. Her message is being spread over the world, and I am glad that i was able to read Triumph of Hope. I intend to share this book with my family and friends, so that they can read of such an incredible woman, and a generation of people who refused to give in. I sincerely recomend this book to anyone who is thinking of buying this, for themselves or for others. 
 Tom Brokaw said of this book:  "Three Cups of Tea is one of the most remarkable adventure stories of our time.  Greg Mortenson's dangerous and difficult quest to build schools in the wildest parts of Pakistan and Afghanistan is not only a thrilling read, it's proof that one ordinary person, with the right combination of characgter and determination, really can change the world"  For me, Three cups of Tea is a beautiful true story of one man's efforts to improve the lives of children, particularly girls, located in remote villages in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  The book is well written, keeping suspense and interest as the story is told.  Of particular interest is the description of life in these remote villages and the frightening and agressive work by the Taliban in setting up Madrassa schools to train and recruit terrorists to the Radical Islamic cause.  Congressman Mary Bono said .."and I'm his biggest fan. "The sacrifices that he and his family have made are staggering. "He represents the best of America" (page 291).  This book is a good read that will leave you with both a better undertsanding of the struggle for the future of our civilization as well as a warm feeling that something can be done by a common man and all of us 
 I anxiously awaited the publication of this third edition.  And, I was not at all dissapointed.  This book provides the most current, comprehensive, and thought provoking information on corporate restructerings.  The case studies and reseach are very practical and add immense value to the book.  It is the only book that I am aware of that thoroughly addresses the corporate finance, legal, economic, and valuation considerations for all types of corporate restructerings (M&As, LBOs, joint ventures, etc. 
 In this third volume of Marcel Proust's epic In Search of Lost Time, the narrator gains entrance into the Duc and Duchesse de Gurmante's chateau near Combray and becomes more intimate with the elite Parisian society, he provides a detailed portrait of the mechanics of social interaction and the underlying driving forces that motivate the bourgeoisie. He encounters nobles, officers, aristocrats, and of course his friends Robert de Saint Loup and his prostitute Rachel, and the Baron de Charlus at a number of extravagant and detailed parties. Proust situates the reader in the world that he vividly experienced, and it's a totally absorbing experience. We see Oriane Guermantes calculate every social decision like a four-star general; she refuses to show at the parties which expect her and forces herself into the parties which did not to draw consideration to herself. Guermantes Way is also, somewhat surprisingly a much more political section of the book. It deals with military strategy, with socialism, anti-Semitism, and class struggle. However, unlike the previous volumes, the last one hundred pages slow down to a near stand-still in pure social observation. Readers often cite this section of the work as the most difficult, and their judgment is correct. The pace is simply comatose here, but it picks up again for those with enough patience to get through it. The Guermantes Way is a powerful and beautiful centerpiece to Proust's great novel.  
 I'd never heard of 'Soul' or Tracy Kidder or Tom West until my class with University of Phoenix.  Something compelled me to purchase it and read it and I was very happy about it.  It was a relatively fast read, technically informative but not too much so...and that's what I wanted.  I wish there were more historical accounts of extraordinary things that have more diverse people in them.  It was never mentioned but I'm pretty positive there wasn't a black person among that whole group.  Black people are not 'let in' to those kinds of circle...special and extraordinary things; given an opportunity to stretch, given a chance to grow into something.  Black people have to have 'credentials and experience' before a special project is even offered to us.  I couldn't help but know - instinctively - that there were none.  Good story though 
 Dear Reader, Do yourself a favor.  Take this book to daily prayer.  Let the love embrace you 
     With his first two albums, Prince had yet to develop into a serious or lucrative artist.  That all changed when he released his third album, 1980's Dirty Mind.  The production was a landmark in new-wave pop, R&B, and urban funk.  It also broke new ground in its explicit sexual and personal content.  Nobody before the album's release has bared so much.  Nearly every aspect of sexuality is discussed here: Homosexuality, excessive libido,  threesomes, oral sex, incest, sexual freedom: everything Prince could think of.  The album was recorded at his home studio with Prince playing nearly every instrument, with the exception of Dr Fink playing synthesizers on some of the tracks and Lisa Coleman doing some of the backup vocals.  The album opens with the title track, a four minute robotic funk jam that sums up the whole album.  When you here lyrics about laying down a woman in your daddy's car you know your entering some interesting subjects and lyrical themes.  The most notorious subjects are explained in tracks six and seven.  Track six titled,"Head", is the most explicit number about oral sex ever written.  "Sister," is one and a half minutes of incest, lost of virginity, oral sex, nudity, and graphic language.  Threesomes are discussed in track two and four while homosexuality and sexual freedom are discussed in tracks three and five.  The closing track titled,"Partyup", is a relentless dance jam about dancing and partying as opossed to fighting in a war.  To sum it up, 1999 and Purple Rain might not have come around if this album wasn't made.  At only a half-hour long this album makes for a nice, short easy listen.  Get this album and see what most pop and hip-hop has been built upon 
 This review refers to the DVD widescreen edition(Columbia/TriStar) of "The Chase"...    Marlon Brando and company mix it up big time in a small Texas town that is ready to explode with hatred and jealousy. And what company Brando keeps...Robert Redford, Jane Fonda, Angie Dickenson, Robert Duvall, Richard Bradford and the great E.G. Marshall just to name a few. And there's more..directed by the illustrious Arthur Penn, from a novel by Horton Foote, a screenplay by Lillian Hellman and music composed by John Barry, this is one fabulous flick.    The lines are clearly drawn in this small Texas town. Class distinction, racial barriers, generation gaps, social injustice, vigilante justice and forbidden love, are all a big part of this tense story. Bubber Reeves(Redford), a one time resident, has just escaped from prison, and has been accused of a murder he did not commit. He is sought out by everyone from the richest man in town(Marshall),to a drunken mob of vigilantes, and his wife(Fonda) who fears for his life. It's up to Calder, the town Sheriff(Brando), to bring him in safely and see that justice is done. Not an easy task, and our guy takes some pretty tough knocks in the process(very tough for the Brando fan to take).    This is a beautifully filmed intense drama, that will keep you involved from the first frame to the last. These big stars are not just window dressing or cameos. All the characters are pivotal to the story and all the performances are played with perfection.    The DVD transfer of this nearly 40 year old film is gorgeous. The film is presented in anamorphic widescreen(2.35:1), with a nice clear picture and vivid color. The sound is very good, clear and distinct, but a DD5.1 enhancement would be a welcome addition to this film. The DVD includes subtitles in English, French Japanese, Portuguese and Spanish.    A classic film with classic stars from the 60's to add to you DVD collection..Go For it and enjoy...Laurie

 This book has the most information on Kauai that I have seen. Anyone traveling with kids this book is a must. Things to do and places to stay........this book has grreat stuff. I reccomend it to anyone going to Kauai.  Barbar 
 I am almost finished with the book.  It is a very good story.  Catherine Coulter is a subpurb writer 
 You think that the children will be better off now that they are in an orphanage. But beware... it only gets worse for the childen that you have learned to care about... thanks to Snicket's great story telling abilities. 
 I am lucky this was the first book i read written by J.R.R TOLKIEN, it was given as a present by a friend who insisted that this was the greatest book i would even read, he was almost right,this book was very interesting to me it was a kind of historical mythology,it give a very detail account of what happened in the first age and why! it's very much like the bible if i am permitted to compare,it begins with a great one and creator Illuvatar and his servants Ainur and their creations,songs of great power ect.., the great valar Manwe and the dark one Melkor who later became Morgoth, Feanor the eldar (first elves)who created a great gem called the Silmarillion, the envyous Melkor stoled it and fled to middle earth Feanor pursued and swore to reclaim the gem even if all his kins would die trying, he committed a very sinful act by slaying his kins men and was cursed, i have to tell you that while i loved this book at the end of it all it was but vain knowlege and empty. there are other interesting love stories in this bbok, such as the story of Beren and Luthien very romantic, you will learn of Turin a great warrior from the seeds of men, but all in all it's no different from reading Scandinavian or Greek mythology in some instances very similar ummmmh!! anyhow you have to read this book yourself and form your own opinions, no one can tell you what this book will be like it's all a matter of you intellectual ability and imagination that will make this book a classic or  just another novel, well that all laters folks 
 Remarkable outpourings of the heart that transcend time,religion. also highly recommended: "The Last Hoshana Raba" (video); "Shlomo Carlebach Live" (video); "At The Village Gate" (cd) "Haneshama Lach" (cd).barry smal 
 Those unfamiliar with Kimball's work will be surprised to find out that essays which explore the intellectual and moral lives of various century-old writers and philosophers can actually be quite accessible and entertaining.  This is Kimball's best quality as a writer: his ability to pull himself above the jumble of scholastic dissertation when covering subjects that usually invite prolix pontification and (in today's academic environment) wild speculation.  Kimball is especially good at deciphering philosophy; he has a knack for relating an individual philosopher's ideas to the world of philosophy in whole.  He also has the intellectual restraint to investigate the relationships between the philosopher's ideas and the philosopher's personal life without drowning in the vague conjecture of Freudian interpretation.  (We can hope for Kimball to produce a Durant-style survey of philosophy some day).  Lives of the Mind deals mainly with philosophers, mainly from the Modern era, and it shows Kimball at his best.  The compositional nature of the book, a collection of original essays and book reviews, gives the book uneven pacing and a disappointing lack of structure.  After a first reading, however, most readers will keep the book on the shelf for the occasional glimpse into the individual essay, and the book serves this purpose well.    Some readers may also complain that Kimball rarely gives a pronounced judgment about which intellectuals use and which abuse.  One reviewer on Amazon contends that Kimball shows Wittgenstein as an abuser of intelligence; I came to the opposite conclusion after reading that chapter.  This, rather than being a shortcoming, shows Kimball's judicious treatment of his subjects as he avoids forcing these complicated lives and ideas into becoming the servants of a narrow political agenda.  I give this book a solid B. 
 Dr. Atkins provided the facts I needed to know in an encouraging, straight-forward, friendly fashion 
 It's a great book. I really enjoyed reading it. It took me two days to read, I just couldn't get my hands off of it. 
 This movie takes you away for 90 minutes into the arms of someone who can deliver a line so effortlessly you forget he is an actor.  He and Miss Graham are a delighful odd couple and Miss Driver, trying to find a place to smoke in America, is perfect British allure.   If you are a Colin Firth fan, it is worth every penny 
 Great story!!  Excellent in fact.  My beef is with the narrator and editor:  As someone who grew up in the Baltimore area, I thoroughly enjoyed the local references.  However, it is frustrating to hear the narrator mispronounce Baltimore icons, like Boog's BBQ at Camden Yards.  For the record, it is NOT pronounced Bow-g!  It is Boo-g... Do better research!! 
 The exotic fragrance of this tasteful ancient-looking candle arrangement fills a room with the smell of traditional temple incense, without the smoke or fire hazard.  Everytime I walk by it, I can't help but inhale deeply and enjoy the beauty and scent of it.  I enjoy collecting candles and making candle gardens.  After the first one arrived, I quickly ordered another set online.  WHY WOULD ANYONE BURN THIS?  Buy some individual candles to light instead 
 I really enjoyed this a lot. It's not quite as good as Pride and Prejudice, but it is better than Sense and Sensibility. It still has a lot of things to say that are still very much pertinent to modern times. Austen's longest work is an entertaining romp that shows what happens when one young girl gets too involved in the affections of (and between) others. Although overlong, it's still a really, really entertaining read 
 A story of two families, one japanese and the other American, against the backdrop of pre-WW2, WW2 and a short post war period. Without seeming to take sides, the story takes the reader from Japan to the US and the Pacific Theater. We meet the young couple. He is a young Japanese academic and she is the total california blonde. From there, we read as they struggle, love, fight and find redemption...while Mr Green weaves other characters in and out, no less compelling. A good read. NOT history verbatim by any means, but good enough for me to say " and then what happened to them ? &quot 
 I am a great fan of the Chicken Soup Books.  They are a wonderful way for me to start my morning.  Being an avid gardener, this one was truely special.  Although many of the stories left me teary-eyed, the messages relayed were always positive and uplifting. -- Highly Recommen 
 This is still the single best book for learning stereochemistry, which is one of the most fundamental aspects of organic structure and synthesis, and it became an instant classic when it was first published in the 60s. Stereochemistry is a topic that comes up again and again in an important manner no matter what kind of research in chemistry you are doing. Ernest Eliel was probably the foremost expert in stereochemistry of his time, and even now, there is nothing which compares with his book. Luckily, he has updated it periodically. It now includes an excellent section on stereoselective synthesis, which drives research in both academics and industry. The earlier chapters on the stereochemistry of acyclic and cyclic systems (especially six membered rings) are updated and still remain the clearest explanations of conformation and reactivity that I have seen. They contain very basic and extremely important concepts which drive the reactivity of organic molecules in any reaction, including those in biological systems. I have this book on my shelf for six years now, and so do most of my professors. And we find that no matter what kind of reesearch question we are pondering, we often keep coming back to 'Eliel'. An indispensable reference 
 I had just bought this book and finished it within a week! I loved this book because it has the same feeling from the show that is placed into it. I also thought it was nice to read about all of the charactors in there own story lines, like from the show. It is written very well with lots of feeling. The story line is original and is smoothly placed in the book. "Prime Evil" takes place somewhere in the third season, and is one of the best buffy books I have read yet! If you are into wicca, you would love this book 
 Someone should have pushed this book into the hands of the many leaders of nations around the world, who remain oblivious to the power of nature and of the impact we not only have on it, but the impact it can have on us. The fact that within two years of publishing this book, Winchester's unwitting prophecy that that part of the world would explode once again with immense loss of life and of ability to care for life due to the plate tectonics of that area, is nearly awesome in it's correctness. Yes, there are numerous mistakes and flaws in the book, both scientific and literature related, but of the three books I've read of Winchester's, this book grabbed and held my attention with the sheer writing and momentum. As a deaf person, I always would love to have more pictures, more maps (I enjoy being able to trace the happenings of such an occurrence), but with or without the few graphic media provided, the book draws a moving timeline, and the use of diary and journal entries from those who saw this happening provide us with more than enough information to guage how 'bad' this must have been in comparison to Katrina of 2005, and the tsunami of 2004. The one written statement of pumice stone gathered in knots that ships had to go through that was laced with the leftover debris of Krakatoa including palm trees, plants, animals, and people who are whole but are without clothes on (they had been blasted off of them by the force of the surf most probably) is as good as a photographic journal. I am not into the gruesome, I am into the history.  I also agree with the author's realization that this horrific catastrophe merely provided the exclamation point of political and religious change that was already in the works against the colonial imperialism of that time. The argument of whether the change to a more fanatical form of Islamic faith was an answer to the prayers of the native people of this area, could be a loud and long debate. But the fact of the matter was, that the egotism and paternalism of white man's colonialistic endeavors needed to end. And yet, we still seem to fall into old patterns, thinking that our political and religious answers can 'fit all' continues to resonate; and as long as it does, we will continue to face rebellion from those we push our beliefs on. It is one thing when someone seeks for something different and finds it on their own. It's another thing when Western Civilization waltzes in and states 'this is what's best for you, do what I tell you (and somehow make us a profit that rightfully belongs to your people) and we will babysit you guys!  People of various nations are made up of individuals. Individuals decide for themselves where they want to go, what they want to do with their land. True benevolence means providing assistance needed, then backing off...yet this concept seems to escape the minds of our politicians and militarists.  A wonderful history, that approaches an incident from all directions. A wonderful book, in that it really makes  you stop and think. Hope I find more of his books are like this.  Karen SAdle 
 This is a wonderful book, which my children adore, and which taught them each to recognize the instruments in the orchestra before they were three 
 You really get a full band feel throughout most of this album and they add horns to many of the tracks as well.  The only problem with this album is that it is their longest and features the most amount of songs that are longer than their trademark of under 3 minutes, even 2 minutes.  There are a number of songs on here that are longer than 4 and some that just feel longer.  AT a certain point it just feels as if the album has stayed past its welcome.  I'm not sure if it does.  I like this album because it shows the influence of grunge on a few tracks while also staying true to the stylistic flipping from song to song that they are known for.  You might not make it through the entire album in one sitting, but it's still high quality 
 Relaxin' is a great record. the performances are smooth as silk and the playing is superb. it's not quite as good as Workin'; which is my personal favorite of all these 1956 Miles Davis Quintet albums; but...you can't go wrong with this timeless and enjoyable slice of jazz history 
 Cat Stevens' fourth album for A&M records is a definite treat. The first Cat Stevens LP to feature a promotional label: (2 different labels on one record), and I believe the first of those 4 albums to feature electrical instruments. This album contains the top 20 hit "Sitting" as well as the acoustic masterpiece "Boy with a moon and star on his head". Cat's first big rocker was "Freezing Steel" from side 2. Also included are "Angelsea" and "Silent Sunlight" which i think are the best ones on the album. The remastered CD has brilliant sound, just like the LP right out of the shrink wrap. If you are just discovering the sound of Cat Stevens, "Catch Bull At Four" is an excellent first choice. The musical energy will fill you up 
 First I want to tell you what this book is not. It is not a biography. It really isn't a biography of the Ford motor company either. What it is is the mind of Ford on paper. Henry Ford was a pure genius! This book is about how Henry ran his company and about his thoughts and ideals on business. You will really get to know the man behind the company in this book. A few of the chapter titles are  "What I Learned about Business", "The Secret of Manufacturing and Serving", "Wages", "Why Not Always have Good Business" and "Money - Master or Servant". This is one of the top business books ever written. I think it was written very well and it just grabs your attention from the begining. If you are looking for a great business book or just a great book about the real Henry Ford then you need not look any further. He certainly was one of the best business men to ever live. 
 An avid home cook that is a collector of both cookbooks and cooking gadgets writes this review.  I purchased this product because I was tired of fishing bay leaves and herb stems out of my dishes and did not want to bother with cheesecloth bundles or straining sauces.  I have summarized my observations of this product below:  Pros: 1.	No more hunting for the last annoying bay leaf in the sauce 2.	Small size means it is easy to store 3.	Easy to clean by hand because it is stainless steel 4.	Fine mesh also makes a nice pot of tea or herb infused wine or vinegar  Cons: 1.	Due to its the light weight it could be a problem in a dishwasher, although I haven't tried it there because it is so easy to clean by hand  Overall, if you do a lot of cooking, and use a lot of whole herbs and spices this little gadget is much easier than straining sauce, making a cheesecloth bundle or searching for bay leaves and herb stems in your finished dish.  My only regret is that I didn't purchase this product sooner 
 Jorge Cham and his PHD Comics are for graduate students what Scott Adams and his Dilbert cartoons are for the cubicle-dweller white-collars of the corporate life. It's as (painfully) real and funny as it can get. This collection of his strips, which is also available at his website (www.phdcomics.com), is a fantastic gift for your grad student friend, or to their "PhD widow" (a.k.a. spouse) -- to show them that there are other widows like them throughout the world. I'm Brazilian, and those strips are as true in my country as in the US, and I believe as in every other university around the planet 
 This is a smooth, easy and short read. D'souza ideas have a nice and consistant flow to them that makes this a pleasure to read with out making this a war-n-peace dissertation on some of the cultural warfare present in our day.   D'Souza's main thesis is to acknolwedge the debauchery caused by the unbridled use of freedom in our society from what he calls the ethic of authenticity. Also by acknowleding this he also points out where the Islamists and multi-culturalsts do not. This is the most important aspect of his book, where by that same freedom when engaged in virtues such as altruism have a greater meaning in the greater context of the culture and in the world.  He talks about several key cultural issues in America and portrays them in an unapolgetic prose that acknowledges the short comings of America while also expressing them as great strengths. For instance, racism in America. We were the country that led the charge to abolish it. It took the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans in battle to do it as well and our Republis survived. This is not to America's discredit becuase it has flaws but to its credit that it is unique in the sense that it overcame those flaws. Mr. D'Souza is quick to point out that the West has been responsbile for great progress in the world and that even in the tyranny of colonialism, his native India benefitted from the imposition of the British where they outlawed the practice of killing female infants, child marriage, and more.   I found this book amazingly refreshing and I would assume that most multiculturalists, who continue to blame America first for all the woe's of the world will probably find it troubling. Mr. D'souza, I enjoyed reading every single page. As an American, a service-member in the military, a father, and husband in a two-parent home... I'm am convinced that some ways are better to live. This is not to the discredit of those who are chosing a different path but American altruism and invention are at the heart of almost everything that defines my life and for that I am unapologetic and greatful. For that I've seen first hand how the rest of the world revels in that same special 'stuff' that is unique to America. Thanks for articulating this as you have. It's refreshing to not have to trudge through some angry American historian who's ashamed to be an American. My hat is off to you sir! 
 101 Ways Black Women Can Learn To Love Themselves by Jamie Walker is an impressively practical self-help guide written especially to aid black women to get in touch with their spiritual side, experience a zest for life, and achieve a personal liberation. Walker articulately and persuasively takes the position that true healing does not come overnight, but rather it gradually evolves over time, once we learn not to look outward for validation and approval, and only when we embrace the love of God. 101 Ways Black Women Can Learn To Love Themselves is definitely recommended as being an unusually powerful, emotionally charged, and uplifting personal improvement and self-help guide 
 I have read a number of books on the TCP/IP protocols and their implementations; both the original Berkeley (BSD) Unix TCP/IP stack and the Linux TCP/IP stack.  I must say that this is the best of all of them.  This book makes the subject very approachable for the newcomer to network protocol software but the explanations are detailed enough to satisfy an old dog like me.  Benvenuti's writing style is clear and very readable.  He liberally provides diagrams to illustrate the concepts he is discussing.  My only fault with the book is that the transport layer protocols (UDP and TCP) are not covered.  Benvenuti provides a list of important areas of the networking software that are not covered in the book but gives other references for most of these.  I hope that he is working on a volume 2 to cover these areas.  I would sum up by saying that if you want to learn about the Linux networking software or network protocol software in general, start with this book.  This book will give you the background to understand other, less well written books that cover the remaining networking software topics. 
 IF you find yourself in your seventh year of your PhD work, and you are not sure you want to work at the bench, buy this book!  There is a world outside the lab 
 I've seen the movie and now have had the chance to read the book. Recommended, done in Grisham style 
 This album got heavy rotation by me in the early 90's this the first album to bet a classic rating in the Source when that meant something. Full of hits, Slow Down etc. Banger Son 
 I rented this movie a few years ago just out of curiosity, without any big expectations, and I was blown away by how touching and bold it was.  Lawn Dogs is one of those rare movies that you think about days, weeks, months after viewing it.  Of course I immediately bought the DVD and still watch it frequently.  It's that good!  Sam Rockwell gives an amazing performance.  5 stars 
 This is a fabulous album from one of the best comics working today.  If you've never heard of Oswalt, he's very much in the vein of Dave Attell.  He cracks on everything from midgets to retards to breakfast treats.  The CD, from front to back, is one of the best stand-up albums in recent memory.  Plainly put:  this guy is hilarious.  On a side note, this 50 or so minute album was culled from a two and a half hour performance.  You can purchase the full set on a double CD from Patton's website though(pattonoswalt.com).  Check Patton Oswalt out.  You won't be disappointed 
 By and large it is a good camera.  There is one thing it won't do (refurbished) and that is manually focus, but since I almost never to that any way I am not sending it back for another 
 Sedaris is hillarious.  The book is a compilation of short storis of his family and life history.  If anyone is an Amy Sedaris fan and wonders how she could be so eccentric than read anything by any of the Sedaris'.  "Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim," makes an entertaining leisure read.  I reccomned it 
 The author can be forgiven for writing a book that reads a little more like a formal academic paper, given his illustrious credentials. However, it is a surprisingly comfortable read given the complexity of the industry (if you could call it one industry) and the material covered. His analysis is as comprehensive as it is thought provoking. He does an excellent job of portraying the myriad of complex relationships between various evermore technologically sophisticated players within the health value chain. I would have preferred more coverage and discussion of specific company/organizational profiles. But, his artful and deft handling of the complex subject matter presented in a way that gives the reader many "aha" moments makes this book a must-read for anyone serious about the business of healthcare 
 Mother Teresa speaks in her own words on subjects such as Prayer, Love, Giving, Poverty and Suffering. Her teachings are presented without adornment, in simple English. This remarkable lady believed in serving God by serving others--the poorest of the poor. She founded a worldwide order of sisters who live in poverty among the poor they serve, and who treat the poor with the respect and dignity that they sorely need. She did not believe in "evangelizing," except by service and example. As a result her missionaries have been accepted and treated with great respect in remarkably diverse places throughout the world.  In this slender volume Mother Teresa's thoughts are presented without commentary, footnotes or sources. Just her words, stunning in their simplicity. Stunning too in her literal application of Jesus' own teaching--to give everything to the poor--everything--and follow him.There is a brief interview with Mother Teresa and the briefest possible autobiographical sketch. I wish there had been more.   This beautiful little book made a profound impression on me and made me want to read more. I recommend it highly to you as well. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber 
 If you're looking for a dictionary of baby names, there are about a zillion other books out there to choose from.  But if you've already looked at the typical baby name lists and were left feeling uninspired, check out "Baby Names Now".  The authors offer real world wisdom and advice about each name.  Each entry is clever and funny.  Their descriptions are often completely subjective, but that's what makes this book so much fun.  It really gets you thinking about what you do or don't like and why.  I recommend it to all expecting mothers and fathers 
 I read this book a couple of months ago. It's very funny and sad at the same time. i feel bad for the dad because he's going through a hard time. But it has a happy ending 
 For over a year I'm looking for a good book to help business analysts to understand data models drawn by others and to train them in creating basic data models needed to cover business needs. I found a lot of good books but all too heavy, too many pages, too detailed and very nice if you want to become a real heavy duty data-guru. There is absolutely nothing wrong with  data gurus, every organization needs a few of those, but it needs quite a few more of the 'casual' modellers. This book .. not too big.. a good read.. and even better reread.. It contains exactly everything that is needed for those modellers.  So, if you're a Business Analyst, Information Manager and need a good understanding of Data Modelling, even occasionally need to make one yourself, without having to spend years in training: buy this book.. 
 I have been an avid fan of Jayne Ann Krentz and this book is her best.  She has combined some excellent family values with romantic suspense.  The dialogue is fun and you will find yourself laughing alone.  I highly recommend it 
 James Wright's mastery of the traditional formal elements of poetry coupled with his contemporary and timeless themes makes his collection of poetry one of the best I have ever read.  The first reading of his works leaves the reader wondering. The second brings comprehension.  The third and any subsequent readings mesmerize as Wright's web of imagery and contemplation becomes more intricate. It is a shame that more readers do not know of his fascinating works 
 I can't say anything about this soundtrack that hasn't been said a hundred times.  The known songs are great and the surf songs are better.  I just wonder why Tarantino didn't include Link Wray's "Rumble" that is played in the background during the Jack Rabbit Slims scene.  It is such a great song, it would have put this soundtrack over the edge 
 This HAP CD is awesome!  Such a great mixture of music.  Something for everyone, but you'll most likely love the whole CD.  And these guys are a lot of fun to see live.  They put on a great show.

 I purchased this book thinking it was going to be very similar to the DaVinci Code (which I suppose everyone has to do when considering anything having to do with the Vatican,thrillers, etc., these days), however, I was pleasently surprised to find that it really didn't.  This story is a very interesting and thought provoking thriller.  It doesn't have a lot of "car chases" and "shoot em' up" kind of action, but it is still very, very exiting.  The story also provides one with a great view of what goes on behind vatican doors, and I also found the historical information about several visitations by Mary to be fascinating.  And, when you are done reading it, make sure to check out the predictions of Father Malachi Martin online 
 There are many great recipes for people that need some new ideas. They taste fanfastic. Very easy to follow, Kathy, Richland W 
 I would rate is a 4-star DVD.  I am a John Wayne and a Louis L'Amour fan. I love westerns.  The movie Hondo is true to L'Amour's book, it's almost verbatim. The characters are strong and the story is exciting.  You can't go wrong with a combination like that.      Andre 
 This selection of Wagner's "Greatest Hits" is a great CD, with a good selection, overall, or Wagner's most representative work, and very good sound quality. The recordings are all by famous orchestras and conductors--including Eugene Ormandy, Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops--and the sound is terrific. Listen to this CD on a good stereo.  The tracks themselves represent some of Wagner's best work. "Chor der Pilger" from the opera Tannhäuser is sung in an English translation, but this doesn't detract from the power of the music itself. Of course, there are the requisite tracks of "Siegfrieds Rheinreise" and the "Walkürenritt," or "Ride of the Valkyries;" both of which are very good, and having both on the same CD is nice.   Highly recommended for anyone who likes Wagner or classical music in general. Again: listen to this on a good sound system 
 Deborah Harrison is the affluent and intelligent daughter of an important businessman.  One day, on her way home from St. Mary's school, she is strangled in a graveyard.  The residents of the Yorkshire town of Eastvale are shocked by her death, and Deborah's father is pressuring the police to come up with a suspect quickly.  Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks is called in and he, along with his colleagues, arrest an English teacher for the crime.  Peter Robinson does some interesting things in "Innocent Graves".  He tells a good part of the story through the eyes of the arrested man, Owen Pierce, who swears that he is innocent.  We experience Owen's panic and bitterness as he is processed through the criminal justice system and stands trial for a crime that he claims he did not commit.  Robinson once again shows how difficult and painstaking police work is.  Banks and his colleagues must interview dozens of people over a period of months to get to the truth.  The patience and the perseverance of the Eastvale police force are strained to the breaking point during this case. The ending is a bit melodramatic and not completely believable.  However, in spite of a few minor flaws, "Innocent Graves" is an engrossing mystery and a wonderful character study 
 This is just an absolute beauty of an album, and I'm thrilled to see it's been remastered and released on CD. This is the kind of music Dickey Betts does best. Get this and Gregg Allman's "Laid Back", and you'll have two of the finest solo albums ever to come out of the south 
 When this CD was first released I was still a teenager living at home. It was a very violent and abusive home life and every night I would pop this CD in, hit repeat, and go to bed. The very real-like and natural sounds of the rain and thunder was calming and provided a reassuring environment for me to sleep in. I lost this CD a few years after that because everyone wanted to borrow it and I don't know where it ended up. Ever since then I would go in every music store I knew of just to see if I could find it. I always left disappointed and heart broken that not even a search of possible inventory I could order came up with this CD. A few years ago my husband bought me another thunderstorm album that ended up reminding me of what I was really missing. It didn't have the real life, natural sounding rain and thunder. I kept searching. Did I mention that I was searching with only a memory of the front cover to go on! I had eventually lost the case as well. Then tonight, out of the blue, I was going through a box of CD's that had been sitting in our basement for the past 4 years and I found the empty case! I couldn't get to my laptop fast enough to punch in the important information; and there it was! My jaw dropped and I gasped when I finally saw the familiar front cover... Echoes of Nature... Thunderstorm... Dark blue sky with the lightning bolt! I didn't even hesitate to put in my order! So, long story short - THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART to Kim Wilson for the talent in recording this one-of-a-kind CD! And to everyone out there who hesitates to buy one label over another... I promise you that the un-rivaled, natural sounds of this Thunderstorm will be a rewarding treat for years to come! 
 This is one of the best books to tackle the subject of Hollywood. Ever since the beginning of motion pictures, Hollywood has made movies critisizing, and complimenting itself. The movies range from musicals, to comedies, to deep drama. This expertly written book covers movies such as Singin' In the Rain  (a musical comedy about two stars making the transition from silent films to talkies), What Price Hollywood? (The first talking picture to tackle the subject of Hollywood- later remade as A Star is Born), Sullivan's Travels (a hilarious comedy about a comedy director who wants to make dramas), and Sunset Boulevard ( a deep Billy Wilder drama about a crazed silent star who hires a screenwriter to write her a comeback script). It is a must have for any fan of old Hollywood 
 If it is a mystery book readers want, Nancy Farmer has definately brought a whole new world of adventure for us. This excellent story stretches from the past, present, and future while managing to keep you on the edge of your seat.    This story starts with three children escaping outside the boundaries of their guarded home to find rude monkies, people of the earth, vicious thieves, dishonest mothers, and MUCH more. Every step of this amazing journey comes as a satifing surprise and yet another clue to the main solution. Following the children's every step of the way are Africa's most unusual detectives...the EYE, EAR, and ARM all with phonomenal powers beyond imagination.    Sooooo finally here is a match worthy enough for the Westing Game. Dare to read it at night 
 It's easy to argue with much of this book, but the author presents ideas that deserve wider attention.   For example, I could relate to the section, "A Cold Bath instead of a Warm Welcome." The author describes difficulty in making friends after she moves to Chicago from Dallas. I could certainly relate!  But I don't agree with her sentence, "The problem is not just that friends ineluctably disappear from our lives but that making new ones is so arduous." As we get older, we just can't develop a shared history with new friends - there aren't enough years left.  I agree with other reviewers who critiize Paul's easy acceptance of terms and conditions set by married friends with chidren. It's frustrating to be the one to yield -- all the time. Yet I find the gulf widens simply because, as a single person, I don't have a place at family gatherings. The woman who missed her friend at her children's bar-and-bat mitzvahs assumed her friend didn't care. I suspect the friend feared being an unnecessary extra.  I know friends feel offended when I turn down holiday invitations. But as someone who loves being single, I treasure my solitude and don't enjoy being a fifth wheel -- inevitable during special family moments.     As other reviewers have said, some of us enjoy friendships with men -- a topic completely  ignored here. Yet there is a difference. Jean Shinoda Bolen covers this topic well in her book about aging goddesses, noting the limits on these friendships.    Since I have a relocation website, movinglady.com, and a moving book on amazon, I was most interested in Paul's discussion of unique challenges of finding friends after relocation. While she recommends seeking out other newcomers and joining groups, I recommend enjoying one's solitude.   Make short-term commitments for the first six months, especially if you move to a small city where everyone knows everybody else. The first friendships you make are like spring dandelions: they grow early and fast and after awhile you need to get rid of them. Wait for the June roses.   I've met far too many people who joined a group eagerly, right after moving to a new city  (and I've done the same thing). Six months later, they realize they made a mistake - but leaving the group creates a long-lasting unpleasantness. A club may have a branch in your new city but will have a unique personality. You may  like it more or less. And you'll change, too, after moving.  Finally, these days, during a crisis, friends may be around more easily than family. And many chidless women are aging. Can friendship be sustained as we get older? Can we trust friends to be responsible for managing caregivers and even serving as our end-of-life representatives?   A last quibble: Most of the self-help type questions seem a little simplistic. I can't help wondering if the author's publisher asked her to add them as an afterthought.  But overall, this book raises fascinating, provocative, important questions. If nothing else, many women will feel reassured: "It's not just me!"  And often that's quite a lot to get from a single book.  Cathy Goodwin (.com) 
 This is more of a short story than a full blown novel.  Unencumbered by a lot of intricately drawn characters, it moves in, gets to the point, and seals the deal in rapid fashion.  Because of that I can forgive a little bit of simplicity when it comes to the emotions and actions of the main characters.  Neither was extremely compelling or fascinating but given the page count, it would have been hard to give them a lot more depth.  Overall, it was an easy read and fun enough that I can recommend it to someone who is a fan of zombies.  There is a new and creative slant to the zombies of old here.  I do feel that it works well in a nuclear devastated wasteland where this story takes place and makes it interesting.  It does drive this tale along so is certainly worthwhile without overshadowing the story itself.    I myself have no preference for new vs. traditional zombies.  Some folks might complain about more stories with the old Romero zombies, saying "its all been done before" but the best out there, in my humble opinion, are "Day by Day Armageddon," "World War Z," and "The Walking Dead" series, all of which deal with traditional Romero-esque type zombies.  What makes any zombie tale great is the story telling and the characters that inhabit it.  Of course, there are good stories where there is derivations from the traditional as well, such as Brian Keene's "The Rising" and "City of the Dead" as well as a plethora of short stories in the various anthologies out there.  The derivation works here, but it does not elevate the actual story so much as move it along.  It is fun and interesting, but not totally fascinating or outright terrifying.  Since this story was so fast paced, I did not invest too much in either of the main characters.  They were pretty flat and lacked a great deal of depth.  Their actions weren't necessarily always predictable, but how they react seemed pretty straight forward and simplified.  This is not a sharp criticism...afterall, there is only 190 pages in fairly large print which doesn't give a lot of room for more indepth analysis of each individual's psychy.   The quick pace does have its failings.  At one particuarly dramatic and critical point near the end of the book an action and its results are explained in all of one paragraph, which is tremendously anti-climactic.  I refuse to play the spoiler here, but something so key to the story development is over and done before you know it and we are on to something else.  I feel that a few more paragraphs could have been spared to detail things out a bit at that point.    Overall though, a creative zombie story that was fun to read and quick to finish 
 I bought this for my daughter 2 1/2 for Christmas.  She love's it.  It has a ton of stuff included.  Lot's of playdough and mold's and cookie cutter thing's, those things that make spagettie hair.  Her favorite are the scissors. It has cute mold's on the top which work really good. She is a perfect size that if we put it on the floor her little leg's can even fit under it like a little lap desk but I don't see any kid's much bigger being able to do that. When we set it on the table it is a little to high for her to play with so we take the lid off and set the lid on the table.  I wish the lid had more of larger groves to hold more of the accessory's, so when she is playing with it they didn't go flying everywhere even like a little net pocket or something attached would of been nice.  I like the other reviewer don't really understand the crayon's and paper, I guess showing that she could use it as a desk also but when we get it out all she want's to do is play with the Playdough.  Well worth the money in my opinion! 
 Ted Dekker refuses to let you down.  Good thing too!  Obsessed is another edge of your seat read.  Even though there is a whole lot of rage and obsession throughout this book, the ending result is very uplifting.  Great characters and a fantastic storyline of hope, love, and never giving up.  Another Ted Dekker classic 
 This is my favorite Madeline book and one of my favorite books in general. I think it's very sweet that Madeline, the littlest girl in the old house covered with vines, should be the one doing all the cooking and cleaning when everyone else in the house is sick. It's also sweet that she makes the important decision of purchasing carpets from a rug merchant to warm everyone else in the house; in many households, little children hardly have anything important to do, so this story is a lovely fantasy that children might enjoy. I also liked the part where the magic carpets brought all the little girls home to their families, and they were able to give their parents hugs for Christmas. A charming story 
 What can I say if you love trower this is it. Sound and interview are great 
 "Goodbye, Mr Chips" is a moving and compelling classic movie version of James Hilton's novel of the same title. The film, made in 1939, is a tribute to the English public school system. This is the story of the life of a school teacher, Mr Chipping (exceptionally well played by Robert Donat).  Chipping starts off as a well meaning, shy and nervous teacher. Along the way, he meets the lovely Kathy (Green Garson) whom he falls in love with at first sight. They marry and his assertive wife resurrects his love and great appreciation of teaching and his students. After the marriage, Chipping (affectionately named Chips by his wife) is viewed in a new light by students and colleagues. Mr Chips is trusted and admired by pupils due to his empathy and dry sense of humour. He eventually wins the appointment of Housemaster.  Tragically, Chips loses his wife during childbirth. However, he spends the remainder of his life as a well respected and devoted teacher who is a champion of learning. When the end of his life came, it is very clear that he lived a very meaningful life of imparting knowledge and wisdom to his pupils over a period of over 60 years.  This is an excellent, heart-warming classic movie that is worth watching.  
  I don't disagree with a majority of the reviewers for this book. I thought nearly every story was amazing. My favorites were probably Cowgirls and Indie Boys, Relent/Persist, and Grief Diet. I think a bit of a problem was people were expecting one primary genre, like Sloppy Firsts and Second Helpings variety books, but this book offers a plethora of different authors, styles, and perspectives on the teen years. I was drawn to the more eccentric stories, but all readers can find one they like. I highly recommend this book 
 The beginning starts out innocently as the book progresses the main character develops hypochondria. The mad-man falters, because of his guilt. What disturbs Rodia was not who he killed, but rather his guilt. The book depicts a killer and the true stuff what the soul is made of.comment on the authors philosophy in the book 
 I was glad I had this book along with me when I went to see the real Book of Kells at the Trinity College Library in Dublin.  The lines of tourists waiting to view this famous eighth century manuscript were about a quarter of a mile long, and the museum proctors were really hustling us through the area where a small sampling of pages were actually on view.  (If you take the tour, be sure to check out the main chamber of the Old Library with its first editions of Newton and Darwin, plus the harp that is (alas, falsely) attributed to Brian Boru, high king of Ireland).  The first facsimile of the Book of Kells was published in 1974, and although this book only advertises itself as 'an illustrated introduction to the manuscript...' it contains good color plates of many of the most famous pages, e.g. the symbols of the four evangelists and the beginning of the 'Breves causae' of Matthew, among others.  Author, Bernard Meehan, the current Keeper of Manuscripts at Trinity College states that "the sacred text itself was copied in the Book of Kells with a remarkable degree of inaccuracy."  It consists of the Latin text of the Gospels, illuminated in the very ornate Hiberno-Saxon style ('Hiberno' refers to the Irish, or Hibernians).  Legend has it that the Book of Kells was produced by St. Colum Cille on the island of Iona off western Scotland.  Although it was probably begun in the Irish monastery on Iona, it was taken to the monastery of Kells in County Meath, after a series of Viking raids.   The monastery on Iona was pillaged in 795, and again in 802.  According to the author, "In 806, sixty-eight of the community were killed in another raid.  The following year, the survivors migrated to Ireland and began to erect conventual buildings at Kells..." where the illumination of the manuscript was probably completed.  If you are interested in the historical background of the Book of Kells, the author devotes a whole Appendix to it.  Alas, according to this book's second Appendix, "Losses, Additions and Marginalia," the Book of Kells has not remained intact down through the centuries.  "At present there are 340 folios, but around thirty folios, including some major decorated pages have been lost."  The monks also used blank spaces in the manuscript to record details of property transactions in the late eleventh and twelfth centuries.  Meehan's book is definitely worth viewing and reading.  It also  contains a wealth of the smaller decorative illustrations that do not always relate to the sacred text, e.g. hares, dogs, horses, and at least one moth.  The color and minute details of these decorations are a source of endless fascination, and the scholarly text, although a trifle dry, is also very interesting. 
 I was a typical "I'm not a wine person" person until a few friends introduced me to some tasty wines.  I then bought this book and it completely enhanced my appreciation of wine.  Wine for Dummies didn't make me a wine expert (I don't know that I'll ever be one), but it gave me a solid basis for at least knowing how to appreciate wines by terroir and varietal (and even just knowing what those words mean!) and furthering my excitement of this wonderful hobby.  I look forward to many more fabulous tastes and furthering my knowledge on the subject.  If you don't think you're a wine person, buy this book and at least give it a chance - it could change your perspective on food and give you a new appreciation of life forever 
 I bought this book for my daughter, who has been having anger management problems at school recently.  After working through the sessions together, she seems to be able to talk about her feelings much more easily now rather than just acting on them.  She is starting to make friends at school and her schoolwork is improving too. Just fantastic 
 What I like about this book is that the technical information is at a level where amateurs will not be overwhelmed while seasoned pros will not be bored.  The format is also very nice because you become involved in the solution rather than just having technical information thrown at you.  Finally, and most important to me, the solutions to the challenges are technically correct.   The book is certainly a good read. 
 Michael A. Cusumano and David B. Yoffie have written a play-by-play of the competition between Netscape and Microsoft in an enormously detailed book that became an instant classic. Adding to the insider scoop, the authors take the opportunity to show readers how they can apply the "lessons" from this historic corporate battle to their own businesses in the context of today's fast-paced world, which runs on "Internet time." Critically acclaimed, the book is filled with facts, figures, insights and strategies, and manages to do it all without drowning in tedium. We at getAbstract highly recommend this book to people in all business. It's exceptionally well written and flows like a good adventure saga, which it is. (getAbstract note: Despite its commendable Judo tactics, Netscape in late 1998 was acquired by America Online Inc. in a deal that was roundly viewed as a final victory for Microsoft in the browser war. 
 It is a tragic, heart wrenching account of an unfortunate simple man, Yakov Bok, a handyman, a Fixer. He is also a Jew, living during waning days of Tsar Nichols II. He is falsely accused of murdering a boy of 10, a case reminiscent of Dryfus affair, who was also falsely charged and sent to prison, later exonerated, however. It is a remarkable tale of suffering, faith, hatred, endurance and above all triumph of truth. One is helpless when the whole state, the establishment commits such dastardly act. Yakov is doomed as wherever he turns he runs into blood drenched anti-Semitic wall. He spends horrifying three years in solitary confinement just to get his indictment. He waits and he fights against insurmountable odds, never compromising on his principals. Finally Yakov gets his indictment and goes to trial. This book must rank among the best 100 books of 20th cenury.  Before we tell ourselves that such horrible deeds do not occur in our free society, think of Abu Gharib, Gauntanamo and recent revelation of kidnapping of passengers and flying them to foreign countries for interrogation under torture. How many Yakovs are in prison today? 
 This kind of information saved my life when I first started reading about it 20+ years ago.  I was hospitalized with a life-threatening colon blockage.  I was told I would need to be on medication the rest of my life.  After reading some of Dr. McDougalls's books, I was blown away how with easily my doom and gloom illness evaporated.    In my humble opinion, Dr. McDougall ought to win the Nobel Prize.  He has been way ahead of his time (at least in this country) for many years.  His latest book addresses some of our most common illnesses and diseases and how you can easily doctor yourself to good health.  The book is an easy read and covers any question you might have from what goes into your mouth all the way through to when it comes out.  Though I consider myself well-educated, I learned new things. Especially helpful was the part on how to decide if you need a colonoscopy, something the over-50 crowd is being pushed to consume.  I only wish books like these were required reading for educators, all health care professionals and children.  In addition to helping you rid yourself of some of the major illnesses of our time, if you follow the good doctor's advice, you'll just plain feel better.    I have no connection to the author, other than I think this is  the best advice money can buy.  It's bound to save you at least one doctor's office visit, or more.  And maybe even some costly, totally unnecessary surgery 
 I loved this book. I'd been looking forward to it for a long time and it lived up to my expectations. Filled with transformations and strange magic, Past the Size of Dreaming continues the story begun in A Red Heart of Memories. Having found Edmond's friend Suki and settled (temporarily) in the magical, sentient house which served as the safe haven for Edmond and his friends during their adolecent years, Edmond and Matt attempt to locate Julio and Deirdre. Matt learns of the events that helped to drive the four friends apart fifteen years earlier through dreams which the magical house sends her. When Edmond tries to find Julio with magic he fails. Leaving Suki and her ghostly boyfriend Nathan (who is trapped in the house except on Holloweens and seances) to keep the house company, Matt and Edmond go in search of Deirdre, who is relatively easy to locate. A drive to the desert finds her ensconced as a small-town, small-animal vet. She is happy to see Edmond but reluctant to return with him to the house. Using their very different magics (Edmond can communicate with the natural world, whereas Matt can communicate with human-made objects) and some common sense, they end up finding everyone, including the twin witch sisters Tasha and Terry and the person Julio has become. Everyone has changed, some more than others. As the friends get to know each other anew, an old enemy begins to move against them.     I don't want to give away what happens next, as this book is filled with many fantastic surpises. The writing is supurb and fans of Ms. Hoffmans earlier work will not be disappointed. Be prepaired for an engrossing, beautiful read 
 Just what I was looking for, some traditional British songs from the age of sail.  I recomend this for anyone with an interest in British maritime and naval history 
 The back cover of this book glibly promises "a biographical and critical introduction, as well as an extensive bibliography." The introduction is there, but you will search this volume in vain for the slightest hint of a bibliography, extensive or otherwise. JLB's stories are excellent, but if you're expecting the promised extensive bibliography, prepare to be bitterly disappointed 
 In THE MILL ON THE FLOSS, George Eliot writes of her heroine Maggie Tulliver in such a way that autobiography seems inevitable.   Even had Eliot not made a secret of the nearly one to one relationship between her and Maggie, the connection is too obvious to ignore.  In George Eliot's personal life, she had an ongoing dispute with her brother that so distressed her that the only way to resolve it was in her fiction.  So Maggie spends nearly the entire novel trying to prove her unselfish love to her brother Tom who refuses to see the good in Maggie until the highly controversial ending in which Maggie nobly risks her life to convince Tom that her love for him is unsullied.  However much one sees of Eliot in Maggie, Maggie is still a fully-rounded individual whom Eliot has chosen to flesh out in a manner that was unheard of for her time.  In presenting the character of Maggie, as well as the others, Eliot presents the unfolding of their distinct personalities against the backdrop of their respective social milieus.  Eliot suggests that society has a definite impact on the way each character develops. For Eliot, character is formed partly by his or her environment and exhibited heavily in the ways that she chooses to allow each character to act in their homes, their fields, and their workplaces.    Eliot traces a gradual connection between theme and character.  Since environment is one of the two primary factors that impact on the push-pull connection between theme and character, she is careful to delineate early on that the same environment that houses Maggie and Tom nevertheless pushes each to a sociological fork in the road from which each takes a divergent turn. This divergence leads to the book's primary theme: the evolving nature between brother and sister is both cause and effect of the ultimate maritime tragedy that concludes the book.  Maggie, even as a young child, is seen as perpetually in conflict, the causes of which are beyond her control.  Maggie has an internal conflict in that she is often called to make a choice between that which her heart calls for (say, her love for Stephen Guest) and that which her duty forbids (the vast class gap between the two that forbids a relation). Maggie also has a direct conflict with Tom, whose brutishness and inexplicable meanness toward her impel both toward the book's tragic close.  Finally, she has an ongoing conflict with society at large, symbolized by a collective mass of family, friends, lovers, and a cobwebbery of implicit rules that Maggie breaks unwittingly and to tragic effect.  The ending of THE MILL OF THE FLOSS has created a controversy that has lingered from Eliot's day to ours. When Maggie chooses to literally die with Tom than to live without him, the reader is faced with passing judgment on its credibility.  Has Eliot taken the cheap way out and sought the conventionally tragic ending of the sentimental Victorian novel?  Or is Maggie's final act of unselfishness to be viewed through the lens of autobiography in which the author is vicariously healing the rift between her and her real life brother with the sacrifice of Maggie for her fictional one?  The question was raised then and is often raised now with no resolution. What remains is a novel whose ongoing charm lies in its depiction of a style of life that was seen as far removed even in Eliot's day and for which retains a nostalgic charm that the passing of the centuries cannot lessen. 
 This set comprises all four or so volumes of The Amazing Bud Powell, the first two discs of which were Powell's first albums as a leader and which undoubtedly represent his finest recorded work. The later discs are  sometimes boggy and inept; that's the risk with consuming Powell in large  quantities.  The booklet is okay, but put to shame by the vast and  compendious tome provided with the Verve boxed set of Powell (perhaps to  make up for the fact that a lot of the music in the Verve set was  distinctly substandard).  For my money, Powell never played better than he  did on these recordings 
 The definition of a piano jazz trio.  I'll leave it to people who know what they are talking about to describe the technicalities of the music.  For the layperson, this is piano jazz at its best.  I can't get enough Evans, but if I had to take one Evans recording to the proverbial desert island...this is it.  The title track is, maybe, my favorite piece of music of any sort.  It's light, it's buoyant, it's whimsical, it's melancholy, it's playful, it's timeless, it's Bill Evans, Scott Lofaro and Paul Motian making magic.  If for some reason you are on the fence about this recording, climb down off the fence, punch the appropriate keys and order this CD 
 If you are a collector of old school kung fu then you MUST have this in your collection! One of the best to come out during the golden era of the Shaw Bros. Also make sure you pick up the 1st DVD release as the picture is more acurate to what was released at the time it came out. And the dubbing is more what you came to expect of a great action packed old school flick. The new DVD release is a little too slick and polished for my taste and the dubbing is way off as one reviewer stated here 
 The day-to-day struggles of human existence are quite difficult for many people, and for others, they are a marvelling pleasure, and why is that? What sets one group of humanity apart from the other whereby their only connection is the gossamer thread of humanism? It is faith in Jesus Christ and how that faith is utilized in the molding and or sculpting of  humanism to hopeful, healthy perfection. Yet, too, what are the molding tools that are used in the vast dichotomy of that living? The universal tool is love and sacrifice, and that is a no-holds-bar truth which is ardently championed by the Holy Catholic Church. But there are many impediments and or blockages of our own making, because we either fail or simply choose not to see the universality of that global truth, for in the acknowledging of that, it means giving up an element of one's vital self to it, and that is where we are constantly at odds; it is frightening; it requires too much; it is overwhelming; it is too good to be true, et cetera, et cetera. Sometimes we learn that lesson early in life, and sometimes we learn in the very end. It does not matter at what age one accepts that truth, as long as one does, and in the novel Viber's Tangle, the character Louis accepts it before he meets his Father, a gift from the Mysterious, a humble yet grateful yes in return. There are so many stumbling blocks that prevent people from being genuine religious carriers of faith, and for Monsieur Louis, it is greed and the evolution of it from being one of a good, practical necessity into a self-serving tactical weapon by which to negatively dominate over the lives of others; he could not see beyond his own creation and perception-the viper's tangle that surrounded his heart and soul-skewering the reality of the more careful loving domination that had easy attention on him all the while but which he chose to coldly mock and ignore, and as such, his evolvement through career and family was nothing more but an appendage to a miserable life of his own free will and making. And Love, who is Christ Jesus, is not a word or simply an experience. He is a fact. And Louis's conversion to that truth where he sees that the Word and the Man are not separated but are in actuality one-in-the-same, is a moving reading experience. In the excellent introduction by Robert Coles, he makes mention that the author wanted the reader to feel pity and be moved by the character's predicament, which is not so easy, because his deplorableness is easier to latch on to. Francois Mauriac makes it very easy for his literary creation to be despised. But upon reading the concise language and deft plotting, there is an evolution that takes place from dislike, to pity, to hope, to change, to cheering, to Love. And in the end, is that not all to whom we desire to return to? 
 What a wonderful read. America's in the Heart adds to the meaning of being American. Filipino-Am. must read and be acquinted with their cultral icon 
 "Efil4zaggin" was released in 1991.  Without a strong radio single or video NWA's second full length CD which had followed a short EP (100 Miles and Runnin) quickly shot to the top of the charts.  Gosh, this album is the early 90's gangsta rap era all over.  When the songs were so profanity laced and sexually explicit you couldn't dream of hearing one of the songs on the radio (Alwayz Into Something) was released as a single and a video was shot but this song hardly drove the albums interest.  The remaster is so worth it if you have the original.  The album will get you really charged up.  The beats are just crazy.  Okay the bonus stuff.  You get the song "100 Miles and Runnin," "Just Don't Bite It," which is a slowed down song which is very similar to "She Swallowed It." The other bonus material is "Sa Prize" part 2 and Komershul.  Komershul is so crazy, it's basically the track from "Prelude" and it's telling people to get the album.  I so remember this so maybe it was on the EP "100 miles and Runnin'."  Yes, some of the lyrics are very derogatory to women.  As a women I admit I had a huge problem with the song "To Kill A Hooker," and "One Less B...." but I admit I love this album.  Dre's production is great and I mean the beats, the lyrics just take me back to a different time in music and I love hearing Eazy's high voice.  You can't miss out with this remaster.  I'm ultrapleased.  This is a hip-hop classic because whether you like it or not now, in 1991 people were going out to cop this.  True, Ice Cube was missing and it was clearly a different group but Dre's production and Eazy's humor save this album.  And CPO...where is that dude..."Findum, F---m, and Flee" is classic.  The people who had a problem with NWA took them too serious, this album is pure entertainment 
 BABE THE GALLANT PIG  A touching fable abuout a pig who wants to be a sheep dog. BABE, PIG IN THE CITY An imaginative, funny and moving film that completely lives up to the original.  The ''character animation'' in both movies is excellent, the animal's mouthes move seamlessly and smoothly, their voices are perfectly suited to their parts, and their personalities are colorful and engaging. Too bad they didn't make a Babe three.      
 This is a thorough and scholarly treatment.  Hilton and Due's backgrounds are in economics, and their analysis of the interurbans' development and demise is first and foremost an economics, business-oriented one.  This is a welcome change to the average railfan-written book that addresses the business aspects of a railroad as an afterthought if at all.  This book allows the reader to understand the interurban railways in the context of their times, in the context of the forces that created and ultimately destroyed them.  This is not to say the authors don't enjoy their subject.  There's a lot about the way the railroads operated, from signalling to staffing to equipment to operations.  Obviously, in a general book, there's a limit to how comprehensive this can be, but there's a huge amount of information here.  The potted histories of pretty much all interurban lines are necessarily short, and don't replace reference works on the individual lines, but they give an excellent overview.  Strongly recommended for anyone interested in railroad history, anyone interested in interurbans and electric traction, and indeed anyone with an interest in social and economic history of early 20th century America 
 The best of the game, set and match trilogy. Exciting, lean and suspenseful.  
 The Kate is more padded around the heel than the original canvas sneaker.  It makes all the difference!  Instantly, your foot is snuggled by the shoe.  Comfortable!!!  I have 6 pairs.  Not a darn thing negative to say about this shoe.  You won't regret buying this shoe 
 I was very impressed with the book.  It begins with a good theology based on biblical teaching-- very unusual in much of church planting and a lot of "emerging church" books.  Stezer explains that good theology leads to good methodology.  Unlike some, he does not de-emphaize theology or, for that matter, re-invent it.   After building a good theology, he then explains how we are to reach our community by using good missiology.  That is where some of the more cultural issues are addressed.  The last part of the book is practical "how to" material.    It is a big book, but worth the read.  Very thorough and helpful.  We plant our church in a few months and our whole team is reading it 
 Kings X is one of my favourite bands, which is a credit to them since i only usually listen to 80's metal. There are many songs on this best of that rock, like Summerland, Dogman and Its Love, but i find it hard to listen to many of the other songs they put on there. I thought it was missing many too, like In The New Age from there first album(kick ass song) and a decent version of over my head. I have the studio version of it and listen to it all the time, but live one gets dragged on and spoils it. I dont understand why there biggest fan favourite song had to be ruined in their best of.  Its still a decent best of, and is a good buy for anyone who likes them but doesnt want to go out and buy all there CDs just to listen to a few of their biggest songs 
 This show is an amazing concept with superb execution for a TV drama.  It's the kind of show that should be on HBO or Showtime but the hacks who run the TV studio said it was too expensive.  Better to produce three brainless sitcoms instead of one well done drama.  I really hope someone else picks it up and brings it back 
 Having been born in 1981 I was educated as a teen about the importance of safe sex and the realities of HIV and AIDS. But, this book brought home the true horrors of the history of the pandemic. While lengthy, it is extremely informative and, if read with an open mind, refreashingly unbiased. I found myself taking extra time and care in reading "And The Band Played On" just to let the information sink in. 
 A very inspiring book about creating and maintaining a vision for yourself, your company and even applicable to your own family.  A challenge given to plan and define the future in more than years but in decades 
 Our heroine Librarian Jane Kerry finds an envelope at work. It's addressed to her, her name written on it in big block letters. Inside is fifty dollars and a note from MOG (short for Master of Games). The note asks to take a look in a book in the library. She does and finds a hundred dollars and another note which leads her to still another and more money, and so on and so on. However, with each note Jane must perform a task. They star out simple enough, but as the money escalates, so do her tasks and they get kinky (for example she has to climb atop a statue on the campus while nude, another task has her lying in a nightie in a coffin), then they get dangerous. Jane's greed puts her life in danger. As always Laymon takes the most outrageous situations and draw us in, keep our fingers flipping through the pages. Laymon was so good and he's was up to his best in this five star kinky thriller-slash-horror story.  Reviewed by Stephanie Sane 
 This is a wonderful book, easy read, and really opened my eyes to the inner voice that causes people to delay, hesitate, have self doubt, and sabotage themselves.  Do not be frightened away by the price, this book is one of the best self help books I have ever read because you can get immediate benefit from it.  Stop dreaming and start doing, if you hesitate or are not taking action on your dream or goals, if you have difficulty losing weight or exercising, or simply are not doing the things that you know you should be doing, then get this book.  You will be glad you did.  It has helped me with weight loss, getting things done around the house and at work, and kept me focused on my exercise and health goals.  I would like to personally than Ted Bryant for this brilliant book 
 There are many articles and books available for business people traveling overseas. Of these there are a few that deal directly with the advantages and challenge that women have in foreign business. This book provides an  excellent overview and in depth look at women conducting business in  Europe. I would highly recommend this to women and men alike. Gent&  Associate 
 My son, who only usually reads Manga books, loved this one!  Patterson, of course, is one of the masters of suspense and action.  My son loved his characters and the action sequences.  It was good to see him reading something w/out pictures 
 Like the Kipling saying, this book portrays the tragic collision of two cultures unable to understand one another. Arguing that American values of freedom, democracy and optimism were inconsistent with  Vietnam's values,  culture, and above all, its bloody history and essentially agrarian  existence, the effort was doomed from the start. THe Vietnamese's sense of  government, history,politics and even conflict is completely different from  our own, as is their cultural tradition of ancestor worship and their  belief in what constitutes effective government (i.e. the mandate of  heaven) and we never took these differences into account. Whether this is  the fault of the military or the U.S government is really irrelevant,  either way it was a crucial factor in the tragedy. Fitzgerald's book is of  course an incomplete picture of the reasons we failed there, but is one of  the most important and overlooked. While other books focus on the flawed  military strategy of endless bombing, destruction and body counts, or the  corruption of both Vietnamese regimes, or the arogance of the US military  establishment, this book hones in on the cultural issue. Its also one of  the best written books on the subject, regardless of the message, one  written with passion and insight, and one that clearly shows that there are  parts of the world that operated and still operate very  differently from  what we understand. While the world might be glowing with the promise of  democracy i nthe new milennium, in the 60's and 70's it was still a place  where ideological differences could sink even the best-intentioned efforts.  Highly recommended, along with The Best and the Brightest, A Bright Shining  Lie, and Stanley Karnow's Vietnam. This quartet of books would give you the  most complete picture of the war and its history 
 Timely shipment and in great condition.  I was very pleased with order. Very educating 
 Rankin lives up to expectations with this his fifth full length Rebus novel. The plot leads the reader on a chase around Scotland for the truth behind a hotel fire five years ago and a series of more contemporary crimes  and misdemeanors. With more twists and turns than the Hampton Court Maze,  this book is sure to delight anyone who likes to be taken up numerous  garden paths and back again. From the first page to the last your sure to  find plenty of suprises in this novel. Definitly one of the best I've ever  read 
 Never have I read a book quite like this one. This is not a book full of retelling of myths, but a book full of detailed info on the relevance of these gods to the ancient Greeks. Information on their worship, their origins prior to Olympian times, and many of the contradicting stories of their births, and how these stories relate to the times from which they came. If you love mythology, but are curious as to the more down to earth aspects of these gods, read this, and you will find yourself seeing the gods as more than just the vulgar fictions of a primitive society. Perhaps you will even begin to see them as they should be seen, as Gods 
 If you have ever gone to the Nutcracker Ballet and didn't quite understand what was going on this book will be a great help.  My daughter and I went when she was five.  A few months later she found this book at her school library.  She couldn't put it down.  She wanted a copy of her own.  The next year when we went to see The Nutcracker Ballet again she really understood what was going on and said she enjoyed it alot more than the first time she saw it. It is a must for any little girl 
 This book was excellent and easy reading.  My 12 year old granddaughter, her mothe , my father and I read all of Dave Pelzer's series of 3 books.  We also read his brother's story 
 Not to dismiss acknowledged contemporary story writers like Updike, or Carver, or Doyle or Oates or a dozen others you may have read in school or out, Andre Dubus is BREATHTAKING!  He captures the angst of the internal, the behavior of the external, the glint of the physical detail, the subtlety of emotion like NO other contemporary writer.  After reading hundreds of short story writers, I have never been so moved and learned so much about he human heart. Put down your DSM-IV, therapists, put away the existential tracts of Camus & Sartre, and PLEASE put away that post-modern numbing theory.  Learn about life through the characters, places and situations you shall discover among these brilliant tales.  Now, here is a true anecdote.  I had read a story in this collection "Killings," and said to myself, this would make a FABULOUS film.  I was all set to translate fiction to the screenplay genre.  It was going to be a stunning work no studio would turn down. Then low and behold, it was all in vain.  This story became "IN THE BEDROOM," the award-winning film. So obviously, my intuitions were confirmed.  Read these stories for confirmation of what it means to be alive, for here you will discover the principle behind Joseoph Campbell's remarks about the meaning of myth: "Life is struggle; life is pain, but by God, you know you're ALIVE 
 Information is the key to the mysteries of the universe, according to Charles Seife, author of Zero and now of Decoding the Universe: How the New Science of Information is Explaining Everything in the Cosmos, from Our Brains to Black Holes (Penguin Books, 2006, ii + 296 pp.).  This information is not like the letters on a page (which encode information that allows us to read words), though it includes that.  It also includes any kind of charge or registered change of state, such as a 0 or 1 in computer talk.  In fact, anything that can be represented by 0's and 1's is information, and all information can be so registered.  In explaining how information theory has transformed thinking in the sciences, Seife covers a lot of ground--cosmology, quantum theory, biology, etc., etc.  Seife does a fine job of explaining some key concepts in information theory, such as redundancy--the use of clues to indicate what some piece of information actually is.  One such is the use of vowels even when not needed for capturing the words.  Th ct n th ht, probably does not need the vowels to be understood.  `Ingenius' and `ingenuous' would, however.  One thing I did not know, meaning I was utterly clueless about, is that computers, which use compressed files that eliminate all sorts of redundancy, do make errors, though we virtually never see them because there are built-in checks and balances that catch and correct them.  Since a computer operates entirely on 0's and 1's, or, more literally, on charges and lack of charges, all information that we normally think of as information can be recorded in this way.  What Seife wishes to show is that information theory underlies physics and other sciences and that understanding that much helps to deal with a variety of problems, from probabilities to the famous Schrödinger's cat to black holes and what happens around them.  He also discusses some problems that have yet to be resolved.  Without attempting to explain his explanations, which make sense upon reading but can be difficult to keep clearly in mind, he uses as examples DNA sequences, mathematical formulas for the expansion of gases (which exactly parallel equations for the transmission of information!), and probabilities associated with questions like the state of Schrödinger's cat before anyone looks.  He illuminates the issue of light functioning as a wave and as particles through information theory, showing that, while light might be considered neither or both, thought of as information resolves the paradoxes associated with it.  The book, as he warns, has a dreary side, since information is closely tied to entropy, the diffusion of energy until it is evenly distributed throughout the universe.  Information theory itself suggests that we are doomed to a future (incomprehensibly long in the future) when all information disappears, that is, entropy is total.  For information requires differences in energy levels--a distinction between 0 and 1, so to speak--to exist, and, for Seife, everything is information.  The time will come when there will be no such differences.  There are more immediate threats to our existence, however. 
 This book is a great introduction to a subject that can be hard to understand - postmodernism.  Grenz writes from a Christian perspective as he highlights key points and the thinkers who paved the way for this emerging view of life.  Toward the end of the book Grenz contemplates some similarities between the Christian faith and postmodernism.  I recommend it 
 I give this 5 stars because its one of very few DnD books by Wizards of the Coast that's come out in the past two years that I read from cover to cover. It interested me. A lot of the other titles they've released lately have been the sort of material you pick and choose; sometimes avoiding large sections of altogether, like the race books they released earlier this year. So I guess I'm rating in comparison to other DnD books.  It's not the most amazing or ground-breaking stuff, but it's a different take on the game than most of us choose to use. I guess it was inspiring to me. I've been DMing now for about 20 years, and though I've done a lot of what's in this book on my own at times, I really enjoyed reading it, and I think this book needed to be produced for those who want to run a battle based campaign and didn't know where to start.  A warning, though. If you're looking for feats, races, classes, prestige classes, etc.... this is not that type of book. That being said, I'm glad. Most other DnD books of late have been only those things with a little fluff to make it all part of a theme. This book is good for any DM. 
 Great price and quality.  This monitor is wonderful.  I got one for my mother as a gift and after seeing how easy it is to use, I picked one up for my whole family.  The instructions are clear and the large size of the display makes it much easier to read.  It has all kinds of features - memory, date/time on the display, and it even tells you if your pressure falls into a risky category.  For non-doctor types it is great, and I have to say it gives accurate readings - verified by a recent doctor's visit.  I highly recommend this machine to anyone.  A+++ : 
 I am not a photography buff.  Saw the exhibit in L.A. at the Hammer museum.  I read magazines like "Vice", which feature alot of photogs who seem to be influenced by this guy.  I thought his stuff was awesome- very contemporary, like someone travelled back in time and shot 70s landscapes etc.  Also: it's a big book- so have ample shelf space ready if you don't want to keep it on your coffee table or on display 
 Every generation has it's flagship writers. Fitzgerald and Hemingway for The Lost Generation. Kerouac and Ginsberg for the Beats. DeLillo in the 80's. I believe Jonathan Safran Foer and Dave Eggers are the writers for MY generation, the first two great writers of the 21st century. Thank you Dave Eggers for doing what Kerouac did for his generation fifty years ago. Eggers may not be remembered in years to come the way Kerouac has, nor may future generations continue flock to "YSKOV" the way succeeding generations have to "On the Road". However, these possibilities will not diminish what Eggers has achieved in becoming, in my opinion, one of the great writers of this age.  Few writers have the ability to seamlessly blend the variety of emotions Eggers evokes, bringing the reader from pleasure to sadness, joy to pain, laughter to tears...and everything in between. Somehow Will and Hand become real enough to us, probably by being in their own way the friends you've been surrounded by. Therein lies our ability to feel their sadness and longing, because it's your longing as well.  An important note- I highly recommend purchasing the edition with the added section, commonly known as "Hand's Interruption". While some have argued against this section, I believe it fully enhances the plot and characterization, especially on second reading. The book took on a stronger symbolic level with the addition.  
   After you read this book, you will look at the world in a whole new way.It outlines on how random the pace of discovery of new ideas and technology really is. If you want to be really challenged intellecually, then go no further. Mr. Burke has done an outstanding job. I just wish that I could afford the DVD that is based on this book 
 Why do we hang on science for evidence of God? Must there be some sort of equation? Must we see ultimate fate to believe? Glynn attempts to say no, that there is overwhelming evidence of God in the world now, even though many claim him "dead."  Glynn doesn't speak much about the scientific proofs of God. But, he does mention the hated Anthropic Principal. Which is "too convenient," according to evolutionists. Interestingly, though Glynn believes in "God," and that the world cannot have come by chance, he does seem to believe that the world started billions of years ago. Only to later argue that "gradualism" evolution is phony. So, the world existed, but nothing happened for billions of years. That's the weakest link of the book, in my opinion.  IF YOU WANT SOME REAL scientific proof that evolution is struggling, take a look at a Kansas school board's findings while conducting research on the true validity of evolution. It seems that a BUNCH of scientists think that it is no longer Truth, but philosophy. http://www.ksde.org/outcomes/schearingff.pdf It is a PDF file, and quite long, but it really is worth reading. Really.  Glynn does offer some revealing common-sense proofs that God exists. For example, Glynn discusses the age of pure Darwinism. That is, when Darwinism had the church (or science for that matter) in a headlock, and so people lived as if they had to answer for nothing. The "roaring 20's," and 60's and 70's are perfect examples. The 20's brought out the social policy actually dubbed "social Darwinism." Because of this, few gained riches, while millions of others lived in poverty. Then came the depression. The 60's and 70's brought about sex, drugs, and "peace." It's kind of hard to live with peace when your crotch burns from sexually transmitted diseases. While the former of the two is not mentioned (I made that connection myself, after, of course, reading the latter), it is interesting how we tend to pay when we "kill" God. Could that be chance? Sure, says Glynn, if that helps you sleep better at night.  Glynn also speaks of the changes being made in philosophy, the fraud of Freud, and how mental health seems to be connected with religion. This, though, should be taken quite lightly. Statistics can ALWAYS be twisted to support someone's views. As someone once said, "there are lies, and then there are statistics."  Finally, Glynn discusses NDE's. I recently read a book entitled, 90 Minutes in Heaven, which discusses these and I would take a gander if I had the time. But, Glynn talks about Moody's work mostly. Now, I really liked what he said. But, it seems Moody has changed his mind on NDE's himself. Though I am not sure at the implications, I would read up on that myself, and not take anything without personal research. What was given was fascinating, and what's more, in a recent Scientific American, one writer admits to NDE's, but attempts to say that our brains are "wired for them." It seems odd, but possible, I guess.  Glynn is no literary master. In fact, I think a 12 year old, with a decent education, could read this book. With the oddity of time aside, Glynn packs a pretty powerful punch. It's certainly worth a read. 
 Cover photo notwithstanding (though maybe it  looked less silly in 1983), this album made an excellent case for consideration of Rick Springfield as a serious rock artist.  "Affair of the Heart" is as powerful as  its lyrics are sensual, and "Human Touch" was a progressive (for  its time) look at how computers and technology isolated people from one  another.  For this reviewer's money, though, the best tracks were those on  Side 2 (tracks 6-10, for readers who don't remember albums or tapes),  particularly "Motel Eyes", one of Rick's best and rawest cuts,  and "I Can't Stop Hurting You", wherein  Rick (or the song's  protagonist, take your pick) cops to mistreating the woman he loves, and  laments the fact that he can't seem to stop doing so.  "Like Father,  Like Son" ends the albums on a somber note, but one that should have  listeners thinking about the tradition of families to mindlessly carry on  stifling, even cruel traditions in the name of religion. Definitely worth  owning, even if Rick was trying a little too hard to be taken seriously at  this point. (It worked! 
 Sinners & Saints is a compendium of homeo-erotic images in which photographer Anthony Gayton pays homage to the iconography of the male in the tradition of pictorialist photography. From romanticized mythic imagery, to Victorian style nudes, to stylized contemporary pin-ups, the visual theme of eternal masculine beauty and desire is provided from beginning to end without textual interruption. Enhanced with a bi-lingual essay on "Youth, Beauty And Desire: The Photographic Work of Anthony Gayton" by Peter Weiermair, Sinners & Saints is an impressive body of work and a recommended addition to personal, professional, academic, and community library 20th Century Photography collections. 
 This cookbook is a realy impressive collection of dinners, appetizers and desserts.  I particularly appreciated the desserts which were tasty and beautiful.  There are color pictures of osme of the dishes in the book.  The back has suggestions for holiday menus.  I recommend this highly 
 It had been some time since I listened to this album but, it dawned on me when I did recently that this might be the best album to represent the changes in America in the 1960s. A lot of groups are credited with writing music that captured the tension of the time, particularly that found in the civil rights struggle.   Coltrane, already a very popular tradition jazz player, put out an album in 1964 that challenged most everything musically while capturing a spiritual side of jazz that would influence others to come 
 This is a very good book for beginners, but you still have to sit down and practice the basics with it... it's very good 
 5 year old boys love this book and since they won't get bored, it helps them learn to read 
 This is a colorful little book packed with numerous (fairy friendly) recipes for enchanting creations.  Lovely as a coffee table book and also makes a great gift for your crafty friends.  I can't wait to try all of her ideas 
 This magazine is so packed full of goodies that you may need something with wheels to carry it out. The paper alone is worth the price.  There are a lot of good books on decorating. And more on picture of foreign places. This one however is of items that you will want and maybe even afford one or two, if you have not spent all your discretionary money on books and book cases. Every library should have a fire place and this magazine often shows some of the best surrounds.  The furniture and art work is well within the norm but just beyond the ordinary.  Even if you do not take advantage of the ads and articles to spruce up your abode, you can sit back and dream of being there. 
 I loved reading all the stories.  I thought that they all touched the heart.  It was nice to read things from some of the more "mature" country stars.  The song "In the Shade of the Family Tree" was  wonderful.  I think a lot of people could picture their own families.  Good  work to the authors of the book and to the songwriters of the song 
 this is a very good book about Elvis. one thing I really loved about it was his mother was still alive when this story took place.I could not put it down.it grabs your attention from the first page if you love reading books on  Elvis you will love this one it is a sweet love story with a sad ending 
 I have been married to a latin man for 37 years & learned how to cook Cuban (& Puerto Rican) food.  I bought the book for a friend after I showed her how to make 'ropa vieja' (translated 'old clothes'). She loves it & has tried many of the recipes. The photos truly capture the latin feel & the script of the three guys is added fun.  I also live in Miami & enjoy Cuban food in restaurants or my own. A must have for your collection.  
 This formulaic thriller tells the story of Muslim terrorists sneaking a nuke into the US with intentions to detonate it during Memorial Day ceremonies in DC. Returning hero, Mitch Rapp, the top counterterrorist expert and former field agent/killer, must race against time to foil the plot. While a bit jingoistic in its patriotism (there is no question who the good guys and bad guys are), this is Flynn's best book to date. It is fast paced and action-packed. It helps that Rapp's whinny, insecure wife Anna doesn't appear in this novel. Rapp is still a bit too arrogant, pushy, hot-headed, and condescending; makes it somewhat difficult for the reader to totally like the hero of the book. I don't think this was the intention of the author, just a result of bad writing. However, it was very entertaining.  
 Great illustrations, a fun addition to a phonics-based curriculum!  I really enjoy reading this with my grandchildren.  Some of the words will probably be new for many children... a good thing 
 I loved this film. The writting, story, special effects, acting, and directing exceed the original. I recomend this film to any fan of the genre 
 My first time seeing this movie I was in the barbershop. I said to myself, this is a must see movie. I like John Travolta as an actor. I have a few of his films already. This movie is a bit comedy,drama,gangster,and Pulp Fiction. The Rock's character was amusing,who would have thought he would play as a gay bodyguard. I'd recommend adding another good movie to your library. 
 Go Dogs Go is a great book to read to your kids. All of the dogs are eather red, blue, green or yellow so it is a good choice for kids that are learning there colors. This book is funny because it has a dog that say "do you like my hat?"  and she is wearing a crazy hat and then the other dog says "no I do not like your hat". It is a good book that anyone would like. 
 Of all the articles and books of Chomsky that I have read, Necessary Illusions: Thought Control in Democratic Societies is without doubt the most exhaustively researched (and footnoted), the most logically  structured, and the most convincing. Chomsky reminds us that the majority  of the populace rely on the various media institutions for their  information about political affairs; both domestic and foreign. One can  only hold an opinion on a topic if one knows about the topic. So take, for  example, the popular myth of the 'persistent Soviet vetoe' at the UN during  the cold war. Why do people believe the USSR was constantly vetoeing any  and every Security Council Resolution? Simple! When they did, it generated  front page condemnation. When the US or the UK exercised their right of  veteo: silence. As Chomsky notes, during the years of 1970 and 1989 the  former Soviet Union veteod 8 resolutions. The US veteod some 56. This is  what Chomsky refers to as Thought Control. Unless the public examine the  factual record of the UN themselves, they will never come by this  information, (at least not in the mainstream press). So although Chomsky's  title may appear somewhat paradoxical, or oxymoronic, a moments reflection  on such facts shows it to be, in fact, extremenly pragmatic and truthful.  The question is, have you the honesty and sheer guts to question yourself  and challenge the information which has contributed to your beliefs?  The  crux of Chomsky's argument is that propaganda is to a democracy what  violence is to a dictatorship. Chomsky points out that, in fact, propaganda  is, contrary to popular postulations, more important and vital to a  democratic society because people still have some rights. That is, since  people can talk, the powers that be must ensure that only the correct words  come out of the peoples' mouths. In a dictatorship it does not really  matter too much what people think; for whatever they may think, they have  to do what they are told, by pain of death. In countries such as the US  (and the UK) other, more subtle, methods are required.  People often  critisise Chomsky for the sources of his information (the copious  footnotes). No such critique can be levelled at this work. Chomsky's  sources are declassified internal planning documents, naval proceedings  documents, and the very institutions he examines, New York Times,  Washington Post etc. If there was one Chomsky book I would suggest you to  read, this would be it 
 I must admit I haven't seen the Vagina Monologues performed.  So this reading by Eve Ensler is my first and only exposure to the famous vagina revolution.  I give this CD stars because of its originality, because of its bravery and because of Ensler's passion for protecting the right of women, for beautifying what some try to keep ugly, for her outspoken activism.  Yes, vaginas aren't talked about enough and kudos to Ensler for opening up the discussion.    But this listener at least had her fill of vagina monologues after the first half hour or so.  Maybe it would have retained my attention better if the characters described had told their stories in their own words.  But as it was, I was happy to hear the essay at the end about giving birth, allowing me to move on from vaginas to other thoughts.  Whatever one thinks, this piece is guaranteed to stir emotions in listeners.  From awe to fear to reverence to shock to sympathy to pain to outrage.  It is provocative and worth listening to in order to understand the dialogue and the years of discussion that have followed it. 
 A Bend in the River reads more like a memoir than a novel -- it is that good. Naipaul's greatest gift, I think, is his lack of sentimentality: about Africa, about the Arab world, about human nature. This novel is a great "companion piece" to Achebe's Things Fall Apart, Greene's A Burnt-Out Case and Conrad's Heart of Darkness 
 Listened to the audio book. Frank Muller reads like no one else.   I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed this book. It is a classic Grisham. 
 I just re-read this book and came in to write a review, but I'm alarmed at the amount of hostility I find here!  The story follows Eskarina Smith ("Esk"), at whose birth a dying wizard is present.  He bequeaths to her his staff, amidst sundry pyrotechnics, of course, and Granny Weatherwax (See "Weird Sisters") takes the tyke under her wing.  Apparently, Wizards and Witches are quite different kinds of people, and very early on, Esk displays the "frightening precociousness" that we see later in Tiffany Aching (of the "Wee Free Men" series).  One must understand, I suppose, that many of the reviewers here have had little opportunity to get inside the head of an 8-year-old girl.  You could probably split the reviews neatly in half along that line!  Esk (and Tiffany after her) are idealizations --or cartoons, if you wish-- of how the male gender views junior members of the distaff sex.  It's hard not to like her --despite her waywardness, which flows from the intense curiosity that is present in all human beings, but which is usually whipped out of us at an early age, especially those of us who are girls.  In one fascinating scene, Eskarina, having successfully ditched Granny Weatherwax, explores the town, gets very hungry, goes into a tavern and asks for "a mug of goat's milk, please."  It illustrates, stopping right there, her kind of polite stubbornness.  There is something vaguely rural English about this temperament, which makes it hard, perhaps, for US readers to identify with.  Unless you're paying attention to what is happening to Granny herself, you miss a good deal of the gender discourse here.  There is little or no hostility in the book itself; the author presents a mirror to what happens in our society with humor and understanding, and just the right degree of impatience and ridicule.  Granny is the only spokeswitch for the entire female sex, with the gentle support of Terry Pratchett himself.  My complaints have to do with the fact that this book exists in a slightly different universe than the rest of the Discworld series (and even the Wee Free Men sequence, written primarily for children); as pointed out earlier, both Esk and Simon, and the "minor staff" of the Unseen University seem not to appear in subsequent books, except for the Librarian (Ook!).  As to the "hurriedly finished" feeling noticed by some reviewers, I think I know what they mean, but honestly, this story is a good deal better than other Pratchett stories, where he does seem to panic about 90% of the way through, and begins to improvise furiously.  But here, it works.  Arc 
 Besides being a huge fan of David Corn, 'HUBRIS' is right on the mark from the first page till the last.  The team have a similar writing style that entertains as well as educates the reader about the failed Bush Administration. 
 I'm a college student. I am studying auditing to take an AICPA exam. well, auditing is hard for me to study. I think, in order to understand a structure of auditing, reading a book is important. 'Modern Auditing' is  helpful to me.  A consistent arrangement of context, detailed indexes, lots  of figures.... I'd like to recommend 'Modern Auditing' 
 If you are someone who could care less about carbs and the Atkins diet, Splenda is an awesome sugar substitute.  Some dont have a choice on whether or not they can have sugar, Splenda is the best substitute I can find.  That includes my grandfather as well.  Thank you for Spenda! 
 R.L. Burnside has inspired many artists to create their music, and dig deeper into the blues roots. "A Bothered Mind" features two tracks with Lyrics Born; "Goin' Down South" and "Someday Baby," a few old and new untouched solo tracks, "My Name Is Robert Too" with Kid Rock, and the re-mixed classics you can get down and dirty to. The original recordings are new and old; the Mitchell archive is tapped for a few minutes, as is some 1990's Fat Possum Juke-Joint Caravan goodness with Kenny Brown and grandson Cedric Burnside. These records are important because they bridge the gap for young folks over to the dying history of the blues, yet leave the rawest parts untouched and exposed. It's another new direction with a smile for the faithful Burnside Purists, a testament to the indy rockers and punk generation who discovered R.L. through The John Spencer Blues Explosion, and a new offering in a funky electronic mindset. -All content copyright www.maximumink.co 
 This is one of my favorite magazines. It tells you about shows and new ones, movies, celebreties, and more! It also has some interviews with actors/actresses. It has fun puzzles and comics. I love the Scene but Not Heard comics. They are hilarious! Overall, I would get this magazine if I were you 
 Simple sweet book about one little boy's faithfulness to his belief that his carrot seed will indeed produce a carro 
 "Ice princess" is one of those blockbuster movies you cannot help but love. It certainly doesn't give you lots of food for thought, but it is entertaining, has good music, and at the end makes you feel happy you watched it. This movie will appeal mainly to young girls, but also to those adults that have nothing against Disney movies if they are well done.  The main character is Casey Carlyle (Michelle Trachtenberg), the classical "A" student with not too many friends and a strict mother (Joan Cusack) that encourages her to study more and more, so she can earn a scholarship and go on studying. The problem is that to earn the scholarship she wants, Casey will have to find a project in which she can put a little of herself. Even though choosing what to do seems difficult at first, Casey realizes that she can combine her love for ice skating with physics, using physics to improve the skills of talented ice-skaters. In order to work on her project Casey will have to spend some more time on the ice rink, a place where she will discover an incredible talent she didn't know about, friends waiting to be discovered, and maybe even love. However, Casey will also have to make some choices, for example what and who she wants to be.   All in all, I can say that I loved "Ice princess". It was no more and no less than what I expected, a charming movie that provides good entertainment for children and teens, and allows adults to forget about everyday problems for almost 2 hours. Of course, recommended  :)  Belen Alca 
 I've loved this book I've been a little kid, sitting in my bed, dreaming of being a pirate of some form or fashion.  This is a children's book meant for a mixed audience.  This book packs in an adventure big enough to be enjoyable even for an adult who wouldn't be uncomfortable with such a book in his or her hands.  The book maintains a set line of humor throughout so one doesn't have to worry about being too frightened by the "Pirate Ghost".  The writing style is interesting enough, and the humorous pictures are very satisfying to look at with this pleasant tale of a pirate mystery 
 First the quality of this book is great. Tutorial in this book are excellent. Anyway great book 
 This book is one of the most comprehensive latin books out.  It has nearly everything a latin student, like me, would need 
 i love my pink robe.  it's the softest thing i own.  i received it as a present while i was pregnant.  what an awesome gift.  the robe makes me feel pampered.  the matching pink slippers are also super cute and cushiony.  my other robes don't even compare to this robe.  this robe is made with high quality.  makes a great gift anyone 
 More "sound advice" from the autor of "Sever Habits of Highly Effective People". Quite a few (at least semi) practical advices in this book - building on the priveate and public victories. I think Covey once more prooved his ability to put this into a leadership perspective. Althoug it may not be absolutely necessary to read The Sever Habits in advance, it undoubtedly would be an advantage .  ï¿½ystein    "People don't care how much you know, unless they know how much you care 
 I just read "Starting Something" for the second time - this time more closely-- and truly enjoyed it. Wayne did a great job giving the personal feeling of the environment.  It meant a lot to me since I was with Neoforma from early 1998 to present (2006)! I lived through many portions of what Wayne and Jeff did, and as I read the book I enjoyed transforming many of the pseudonyms to the real people I had interacted with in those early years.  One important new twist is how NEOF has just recently been bought by the healthcare manufacturer consortium (GHX) which was originally set up to compete/crush it!   I highly recommend Starting Something to all next generation entrepreneurs, as well as former entrepreneurs - all of those who were in the world wind of power, money and control of that era.

 Man this album takes me back to those crazy Southern California drinkin', bar hoppin' nights...If you like the 80's, this album and series is for YOU!  I liked the mix of really popular and less known songs.  Great  Album/Series 
 Kelli Richards and David Battino have done a tremendous job bringing in the masters of this space to reveal where we are and we are going in this revoloutionary time. On a personal level, and as an artist/producer in this space, I found great take aways from people I have studied, admired and in some cases, worked directly with over the years including Herbie Hancock, Todd Rundgren, Don Was, Thomas Dolby and Brian Eno. I highly recommend this insightful and inspired writing. 5 stars! 
 Very informative and helpful:  10 Days to a Less Defiant Child is a gem. This book is not only easy to read but also easy to understand and apply.  I was blown away by how this ten day program really helped me respond differently to my teenage daughter.  More amazing was how she sensed the difference in my new approach and she changed her tune, for the better.  Dr. Bernstein's suggestions have really helped make our home an enjoyable place to be again.  I highly encourage all frustrated, almost burnt out parents of defiant children and teens to give this book a try.  I am sure glad I did.       
 What would you do if were being bullied at your school? Would you go   and tell you're the problem? Well, Cameron Porter did something worse   in the book Shooter by Walter Dean Myers.     Cameron Porter is seventeen years old who goes to Madison High  School. Cameron is an African American who lives in Harrison County.  In his school he got tired of the problem that went on the school and you   Will find out.      Walter Dean Myers writes the book Shooter as if he were writing a play  With the characters names beside the line he speaks. My opinion is that I   Love the way he writes. I recommend this book who likes shootouts and    then you would actually feel that you were the main character    
 These videos are amazing. The live performances are great, I bought these videos back when I was in high school. I must say they aged very well. If you love Nine Inch Nails you will love these videos 
 One of the most valuable releases. Professional, different, involving. As Nine Inch Nails always was. Performing live is one of the best things Treznor can do, but recording it is his mastery as well. People have different tastes, but I think, that this DVD is well balanced for a newcomer and a devoted fan. Trent Reznor presents something that is coherent, but nihilistic at the same time. He blends chaos, madness, hatred and pain with beauty, fragileness, weakness. And its true. And its beautiful. 
 No one has ever written anything like this, nor will. This is a perfect series with a ending you hate to lovee and love to hate it was a part of my childhood and growing up. I reccomend this to any person who likes a good book and to people who are just starting off. I will hand these books down to my children when they are old enough. Thanks stephen king for all the good months reading and the bad years waiting on the next edition of the dark tower. 
 This disk marks the first appearance on CD of two wonderful anthologies of  British country/acoustic blues:  "Me and the Devil," and "I  Asked For Water, She Gave Me Gasoline."  Originally released in 1968  & 1969 in the US on the now defunct World Pacific label, this disk  presents excellent performances of pre-war blues by Jo Ann Kelly, her  brother Dave Kelly, Tony McPhee, Graham Hine, Andy Fernbach, and several  others.  Exceptional vocals, superb delta style guitar work, some great  piano work from Bob Hall of Savoy Brown, and a generous helping of  harmonica.  While Clapton and the Stones were learning to play Muddy Waters  and BB King, these players were studying Robert Johnson, Charlie Patton,  Memphis Minnie, and early John Lee Hooker.  Digitally remastered, with  extensive new liner notes.  Fans of Rory Block, Corey Hart, and Catfish  Keith will enjoy this disk 
 This is my favorite lens. I could not carry the heavier long range teles, and it was a hard decision for me. In the end, I chose this because it was lighter than the zooms.   Having previouly used the 75-300 IS zoom, I was leary of getting another 300mm prime, because I may miss the 70-300 range of shooting. But the clarity and colors are so true for this 300 prime, I don't look back.   Easy to handle, not so bulky. Fast, impressive photos. Even when I add a 1.4 teleconverter shooting in the 500mm range on my 20D. I use the f4 alot, no problem, great clarity. Awesome lens for the price 
 Great resource book for therapist/counselors. Good exercises to incorporate in therapy sessions 
 I fell in love with this book the first time I saw it!  Not only are the illustrations beautiful, but this is a cleaver counting story.  Highly recommend 
 "Platoon Leader: A Memoir of Command in Combat," by James R. McDonough, chronicles the author's experiences as an officer in the Vietnam War from 1970-71.  His platoon is charged with manning an outpost next to the village of Truong Lam.  This is a fascinating, well-written account.  McDonough fills his narrative with vivid details that really made his story come alive in my mind.  He doesn't flinch at describing the goriest and most horrific images of war.  There are also moments of irony and bitter humor.  Also noteworthy is the informative material about tactics used in Vietnam.  And the author humanizes the story by touching on such "down-and-dirty" issues as the latrine his platoon used.  McDonough's story is populated with a compelling cast of characters.  Particularly intriguing is his exploration of relationships among the various groups he encountered in the war zone--U.S. enlisted men, his fellow Army officers, Vietnamese military allies, enemy forces, and the many civilians caught up in the conflict.  While rich in scenes of combat, "Platoon Leader" goes beyond being just an action-packed war yarn.  The book explores the ethics and morals of war.  McDonough deals directly with the danger a soldier faces in becoming dehumanized by the brutality of war.  He vividly portrays the struggle of a leader to remain wise and humane, yet also tough and resolute, under the most trying of circumstances.  This book is both a profound meditation on wartime leadership and a powerful work of American literature 
 Great book.  In the foreward, the author admits to struggling with linear storytelling, which is obvious from reading the book.  Bonanno is excellent at non-linear, though, so she can struggle all she wants.  I was concerned that she was going to get wrapped up in Vina's story as well as Pike's but she doesn't overly much (I don't care about Vina other than as an entryway to Pike).  Good stuff.  This is an author who understands Trek 
 I love it, now I can take my Idog to work with me. It fits the Idog, mp3 player, user manuals, earphones, and extra batteries. I highly recommend it if you plan to use your Idog anywhere other that home 
 Man, oh man! This record kicks the sh*t outta all those pussy Good Charlotte albums. It starts out with Adina, fast pumping and loud! This whole album rocks, though I still don't see what people have against Indestructable. Oh, well. If you like real punk, get this 
  Habif is a classic. The pictures are among the best any dermatology textbook can have. Perhaps only Rassner has comparable pictures. But Habif has much more ones. The texts are well written and directed to easily and quick dermatology reference, on a basic point of view. I think it is a good book for dermatology knowledge introduction. If you want to go further on dermatology estudies, this a good firt step ,before more profound books, like fitzpatrick or Rook 
 I was very pleased with this product, especially considering that I haven't been able to find these pieces at any store. 
 I read a lot about this, and thought it couldn't be that good. It is. "Waltz for Debby" is even finer. This was Genius at work. 
 Stanislav Grof is one of the pioneers in using LSD for psychotherapeutic research.  Personally, I'm not sure I buy it, but I read these books more for personal amusement than for any scientific content they may have.  (I give this book five stars because it's interesting, not for it's scientific content, which I believe to be virtually nil.)  In this book, Grof has thrown together some of the most bizarre and far-fetched speculative nonsense in an attempt to explain a hodge-podge of LSD experiences.  Grof gives a detailed picture of the various forms of therapy including, psycholitic therapy, psychedelic therapy, hypnodelic therapy, and his own holotropic therapy (which is basically hyperventilation and doesn't require LSD).  Grof then goes on to explain the effects of LSD.  Here, he concocts a bewildering schemata of various LSD induced states, which fit under various matrices:  COEX systems (systems of condensed experiences) and basic perinatal matrices (BPM I-IV).  This is where things get a little hocky, because according to Grof (and he gets this from Otto Rank) we can regress the individual to birth and then resolve various aspects of the birth trauma, freeing the individual of various neuroses, etc.  He throws in a mix of eastern philosophy and mysticism to explain various aspects of this regression process.  Apparently, one can go beyond even this level, into that of transpersonal experiences (here essentially all hell breaks loose and virtually anything goes).  The rest of the book is pretty much devoted to explaining various aspects of the therapy sessions, the effects of various environments, stimuli, etc. on the sessions, and much anecdotal evidence of alleged cures, resolutions of conflicts, breakdown of neurotic defense systems, etc.  I haven't made up my mind how much of this I buy into, and I don't see any easy way to do so without more research being done.  The book concludes with an appendix on the effects of LSD on chromosomes 
 For anyone who is interested in "Beauty and Truth" as a problem requiring intense evaluation, Chapter Eleven of this book starts by considering the conquest of nature "really her successful deception by  the human intelligence."  The interesting feature is "the  pleasure which the individual gets from this sham activity, in that we  regard this as a saving of vitality and, indeed, of life."  Otto Rank  associated this kind of activity with "the realm of freedom ~ even if  (again as in play) this liberation can never be wholly successful."   As an ideal, art can lead to a way of life which approaches the pathetic in  finding pleasures in pushing the envelope which maintains order for the  prone thinkers in any society.  Rank considered it a component of  "head-culture, . . . saturated with the scientific ideology"  associated with "the egocentric outlook which produced the  competitiveness and quarrelsomeness of the various Greek tribes, cities,  and heroes that is evidenced even in the Trojan War stories."  My  knowledge of the history of American psychiatry clings to the memory of the  minor role played by Harry Stack Sullivan in establishing the professional  ethics that kept Otto Rank from treating his patients as a psychiatrist  because he wasn't a doctor.  While some memory of artistic character  development clings to people's emotional problems, medical practice in the  mental health field makes this book almost irrelevant to modern treatment  of these problems, and I only mention it to show what fools we would prefer  to be as a society dedicated to the suppression of all uncommercial efforts  in the area of art, which remains a highly suspect activity, subject to  ritual condemnations by the critics in the press who can't print what the  artist is thinking.  For people who don't expect to read this book, I would  recommend the movie "I Shot Andy Warhol" as a study in character  of the wanna-be kind of people which a culture that celebrates art and  drama produces 
 This is an incredibly insightful book, tracing and understanding the promise(s) of God down throughout history.  He picks up where Willis Beecher left off in his "The Prophets and the Promise", which I also highly recommend if you can find it, and explains it in a more easy to understand manner.  Not an easy read...but well worth the effort. It will insert a fresh view into the Old Testment the next time you read through it 
 This is up there with the right wing oft-repeated diatribe that the left dominates the media--and provides as much credibility.  True, a few of the things McCarthy said may have been true. But true also that some of what Hitler's cronies said about the Jews, for instance that they may have had more influence on the German economy than their numbers would have represented. So, that makes the Nazis right, or at least not as bad as we've traditionally made them out to be, huh?  History demonstrates again and again that Joe McCarthy was a drunk. (I doubt he needed to be embalmed, he was so preserved already by the alcohol dominating his physiology!) He was once a  Democrat, then turned into a right winger when it became politically convenient. He got away with what he did because of the times in which he lived. No, he didn't start the anti-commie hysteria--and that's what it was, a pathology. But he rode the wave and took it to new heights, those from which the Nazi--or even Communist oppression analogy is still appropriately made.  He finally fell when he started accusing the military of being dominated by the evil he claimed his opponents were. Trying to fit Senator Joe into a more reasonable category is beyond absurd. It's the equivalent of the revisionists who say Joe Stalin wasn't really that bad.   It's amazing what people will believe these days.. 
 JUST LIKE I REMEMBERED WHEN I WAS A KID WATCHING ON TELEVISION. THEY UPDATED THE COLOR SCHEME A BIT, BUT EVERYTHING IS AS THE ORIGINAL SHOWINGS ON TELEVISION 
 What Happened to (I've Gotta Find You)  I thought that was one of their best songs. They will have to put out another greatest Hits now and include more of their hits 
 The Lost World by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is the source for many later movies, TV series and books.  Land of the Lost, which funny enough seems to be the source for The Lost World and Lost TV series, is one of the many shows I believe owe some of its birth to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. The idea is that Professor Challenger has found an area in the New World where such animals as dinosaurs still walk on the surface of the Earth.  Of course you know the rest.  Nobody believes him so he collects a group together to go see and, behold, tons of action, adventure and vague science stuff.  Good, solid book but either new or used will do. 
 Very interesting and enjoyable book to read.  Can't wait to see the movie that's coming out this month! 
 I don't usually read fantasy, but after reading Belgariad, I started reading fantasies. This series was recommended to me by my dad, who is also a very dedicated fantasy reader. This book, like my title says, is a amazing book, and is a satisfying end to the first chronicles.  Thomas covenanat is a leper, whose wife divorced him and took the kids. Twice before, he was called into the "Land" believed that he was the reincarnation of the legendary hero, Berek Halfhand, possessing the wild magic of the white gold. His unbelief is stern, and wanting to get out of the land, he decides to confront Lord Foul, the old enemy of the land, himself. Aided by his giant friend Saltheart Foamfollower, and Lena, a woman whom Covenant raped, he sets out to go to Foul's creche and fight him.  I'm not going to reveal too much, but you won't regret buying this amazing book. Once again, this is a fantastic novel!! 
 This is a WONDERFUL book!! I can not say enough!! Anyone that doesn't like this one, well, I can't imagine why!! If you are expecting, and want help choosing what you want at the time of birth... especially if you have an OB and want to deliver in a hospital - this is the book that will help you ask the right questions, and write the birth paln that will help you get what you want out of the experience!! It even has info. about getting what you want out of a c-section!! GET THIS!! You will learn SOMETHING, I bet! 
 The Fundamentals of Thought gives basics of life, concisely stated, that one can observe if he understands the data and honestly looks.  An intensity of truths is a good way of describing the material in this book.  Take it in fully one piece at a time and wow!  The title is appropriate 
 I have re-read this book so many times!  It is highly readable, without as many of the darker undercurrents that Irving's other work has.  It also has more adult content, with discussions of divorce and sex and teen pregnancy, as well as more frequent use of expletives.  If you are a fan of Irving because you like his heavy-handed, multi-layered themes, then this probably isn't a book you'll enjoy very much.  If you're looking for a book that will serve as a good "introduction" to Irving -- I don't think this book is for you.  But if you're looking for a fun, quick read, with well-drawn characters, a unique plot, and a fast-paced story, I recommend this book 
 The Fear Factory-esque lyrical themes of Meshuggah's second full length release deal with the concept of the next step of mankind's evolution: machines with organisms. But that isn't the only reason why "Destroy Erase Improve" is very smart; this album defines the term "math/tech metal." It is very carefully calculated and full of breakdowns, pin-point technicality, and mind boggling polyrhythms. The guitarists and drummer often play different time signatures, but it all comes together perfectly and sounds finely crafted. And since these songs are bludgeoning, relentless, fun to listen to, and the musicianship is so stellar, you don't need to be a mathematician to enjoy "Destroy Erase Improve." Drummer Tomas Haake plays super speedy and ultra precise drum beats around the guitarists crushing, seven-string riffs, and screamer Jens Kidman barks and snarls like a Doberman on steroids. All of these things make "Destroy Erase Imrpove" sound as heavy as Fear Factory (circa 1995), and as raw as Mudvayne (circa 1997). "Future Breed Machine" is, more-or-less, a good representation of the album as a whole; it's a blistering flurry of machine gun guitars and a fast double bass. Later on, "Soul Burn" and "Transfixion" have staccato riffs and solos which kind of sound like they were made by an organ. Also, "Inside What's Behind" features a bobbing beat and foreboding spoken word vocals, and "Terminal Illusions" evokes a cannon, with pounding, rapid fire riffs and simultaneous sledgehammer drumming. But the insane drumming on the grinding, lurching fifth track, "Vanished," makes that song a personal favorite of mine. This album loses out to Fear Factory's "Demanufacture" for the best metal album of 1995, but it's definitely a close call. "Destroy Erase Improve" is nothing short of a genre-defining metal landmark, and the complexity and sheer brutality of the songs makes it a Nineties classic. 
 I can really only reiterate what the last reviewer stated.  This is one of the three or four books I pull off the bookshelf constantly to reread.  Hardwick is a remarkable stylist and can evoke in a few pages (if not lines!) what it would take other writers whole novels to achieve.  The section on Billie Holliday is one of the most beautiful things I've ever read.  This is the book that made me want to write 
 Whatever reason guides our quest for information to discover small treasures, the rewards of finding writing as quiet and yet celebratory as Guy Davenport's OBJECTS ON A TABLE are immeasurable. This small volume of four essays on the intransigence of Still Life paintings and their concommitant relationship to music, philosophy, literature, history, poetry, and simply Life is satisfying on every level.  While the art world strains to design the NEW trends/schools/movements that will incite or induce controversy and a step toward the now ubiquitous Warhol 15 minutes of fame, writers and lecturers such as Davenport (and Mark Doty, Norbert Schneider, et al) offer solace in the simplicity of beckoning quietly toward the centuries old yet very much extant art of the painted Still Life.  Meditations on the significance of baskets of fruit, on 'memento mori', on non-visual artists who attempt to capture the simplicity inherent in the Still Life spill over the pages of this beautiful little book, and in doing so enhance our vision of the world about us.  The writing here is superb, the pleasures of pausing to read solitarily the thoughts of a writer so well informed about so many issues makes this small volume a fine addition to the thinkers' librairies.  Beautiful 
 A breath of FRESH air!  A positive outlook for a commonly negative subject.  With a child diagnosed with ADHD, I now have an easily understandable explanatation of why he feels "different" than the rest of his peers.  We're proud to be "Hunters" 
 Manfred Griehl's 'Luftwaffe over America: The Secret Plans to Bomb the United States in World War II' is a well researched documentation of why and how the United States was not subjected to ongoing aerial attack by the Germans during World War Two. This inability on the part of the German war machine stands in stark contrast to US and British efforts both in the European and the Pacific theaters of war.  In point of fact, it is the Pacific analogy - included early efforts in 1943/1944 to bomd Japan from India and China - that is more similar to the challenge facing the Germans: development and production in meaningful quanitites of a long-range, multi-engine bomber with sufficient payload to daamge US industry and population centers. Flying from occupied Europe to England or England to Germany was one thing; flying thousands of miles across an ocean and back was another.  Author Griehl takes a year-by-year chronological appraoch to explaining why Germany was not able to achieve this critical piece of war-making capability. His analysis shows a plethora of reasons, ranging from strategic short-sightedness on the part of the Nazi leadership; battles between aircraft manufacturers over contracts that makes current lobbying int he US look like solidarity; a strong tendency toward poor aircraft design and the inability to produce reliable high-power aircraft engines like those of Rolls-Royce/Packard and Curtiss Wtight, for example.  Along the way, we learn about virtually all efforts at developing a strategic bombing component for the Luftwaffe. Actual aircraft such as the FW-200, HE-177, and the ME-264,among others, are discussed with candor. The book also addresses more heady R&D aircraft that were technologically beyond actualization at the time. As mentioned, Griehl also comments on the difficulties with prop and jet power plants and the somewhat more esoteric issue of weaponry.  Although his European style of writing and command of English is a little bumpy for the American reader, Griehl's work meets its objective on providing an accurate and objective desecription of the Nazi strategic bombing programs, as well as a primer on weapons program R&D activities. 
 This book will not help you survive an emergency that you have not prepared for, but it will help you prepare so that you avoid emergencies in the first place.  Just as the title says, this is a preparation handbook.  It will help you prepare the place you live so that you can make it through tough times in relative safety and comfort.  No, it will not help you learn to forage for nutritious weeds, track NWO soldiers to their base in the forest, or how to most efficiently loot the bodies of the dead.  On the other hand, it will help you decide what food to store and how much, how to keep your electricity running, how to keep a working water supply, and includes a very brief section on guns.  I've read a lot of self-sufficiency books and this is one of the most well rounded that I have encountered.  If you are already a survival nut, this won't cover any new ground, but if you have people in your life you are just beginning to show some interest in self-sufficiency, there is probably no better introduction 
 If you're looking for a legal thriller, "Bleachers", neither legal nor thriller, is certainly not the drink for which you thirst! In a quiet, pastoral yet moving style of writing which he was to re-use to incredible effect in "The Last Juror", Grisham has treated his audience to a powerful, evocative novella that paints a portrait of the final years of the century in Messina, a small town in deep south USA.  The story opens, develops and closes with Neely Crenshaw, the all-American quarterback who led his 1987 Messina Spartans high school team to an undefeated season, reminiscing about the life of coach Eddie Rake, who drove his players and teams mercilessly to an unrivalled win-loss record. Much of the team joins Crenshaw - Silo Mooney, the bad boy nose tackle who revelled in hurting his opponents; Nat Sawyer, the weak link in the team; Paul Curry, Crenshaw's best friend in high school; Mal Brown, now the town sheriff - as they wait for the symbolic dimming of Rake Field's lights to signal the coach's death, relive their glory days, replay the miraculous championship game of the 1987 season and struggle with their decision as to whether they love or hate the coach's memory and the effect he had on all of their lives.  I'll admit it ... this sounds like the stuff of one spectacularly boring novel and yet, somehow, even when it is read only on the surface as a tale of small town Americana, Grisham has succeeded in telling a warm, moving tale that I found every bit as compelling as the best of his thrillers. But, perhaps even more important, Grisham has provided the fodder for hours of controversial discussion on the best and worst of amateur and professional sports in North America! The worst - the win-at-all-costs attitude; the adulation and elevation of sports heroes and celebrities to an extent far beyond any real conceivable value in this world; the punishing, physical destruction of the bodies of young people as we force them to compete in contact sports up to our unrealistic expectations; and groupies willing to sacrifice their bodies on the altar of unthinking hero worship! And the best - the colour blindness of physical achievement in sport; the translation of the drive and mental discipline of sport into other life endeavours; the camaraderie and the synergy of a team willing to sacrifice individual performance for team success!  And Crenshaw's conversation with the Cameron Lane, the "good girl" he tossed over for Screamer, the leggy, short-skirted blonde floozy who was all too willing to roll over for the team quarterback, was so sticky sweet but, damn, it was good!  What an enjoyable read! And all over in the too short space of only a couple of hours!  Paul Weis 
 I read the first book, The Pigman, and I really liked it. So when I went to the bookstore and found this book I decided to give it a try. It was a really good book. I was expecting it to be just like The Pigman, but it wasn't. It wasn't as sad as The Pigman and John and Lorraine changed since The Pigman took place(even though it was only four months). Anyway, if you havn't read the Pigman and you want to read this book, I still recomend it. The book doesn't require The Pigman to make sense 
 Like his previous book, Patriots, Mr. Langguth knows how to set the stage for a rousing and energetic look at history. For a variety of reasons, the war of 1812 has always been treated as an "oh yea, that happened too" part of our country's history. Thanks to another wholly entertaining and meticulously researched narrative, we get to know the major players, the politics, and the underlying currents of tension that envelope this conflict as a whole. I could not put it down. 
 Your reviewers experience: a few short years ago my youngest son was in real trouble. Skipping school and failing I had him tested at his therapist's request. Near genius IQ. In eight grade his math aptitude (which he failed through most of school) was above 12th grade. He was miserable and so was our family. In search of answers he was diagnosed as ADD. It was a dark dark time for me to the point I believed I might lose this child.  The book is a well written argument that the child is not defective, but rather these ADD "hunters" are forced into a "farmer" environment we have grown to demand of public school system children. It also offers helpful advice on how to deal with this issue.  The book allowed me to see that my son wasn't "broken" and if he had a disability it was because he was ill suited to the public school environment which demanded dull witted compliant students and wasn't interested at all in offering any alternative. Reading this book allowed me decide the world wasn't on my son's side, but I had to be, and have confidence that when I could help get him into a different environment it would be better.  I can now report he dropped out of high school, a thing I came to look forward to. He immediately went to take the GED and passed most scores with 99th percentile (nothing below 93rd percentile), finished his Eagle scout badge, and is starting his own craft business doing glass work. I believe the result could have been much different without the perspective of the author and thank him for it 
 Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is a story of a handsome young man and his transformation from innocence to vile, wickedness.  The story is set in London, England in the late 1800's.  Through his acquaintances and a little wish his life is changed.  Dorian's personality and manners alter drastically and thus, he begins his downfall. The novel is very descriptive and uses philosophical themes.  The use of language is extraordinary and some of the things discussed in the novel really make you think.  The story is very morbid and cynical, but beautifully done.  At times though, the descriptions and philosophical jibber-jabber can be a bit overdone.  Still, I liked this novel and would recommend it to anyone.  Once I started reading this, it was hard to put the book down 
 The single most helpful book in changing the way I thought about myself and my goals.  Buy it 
 Books on project quality are often narrowly focused - on Six Sigma, software testing, or statistical process control, for example. For anyone trying to apply the Project Management Institute's quality approach (admittedly rather limited) to a project, without getting bogged down in test scripts, the lack of a good, general-purpose project quality book has been a problem.  This book addresses the gap between domain-specific quality processes and general project quality. After providing an overview of the quality movement and key definitions of quality, the book outlines a step-by-step process for quality planning, quality assurance and quality control. The steps are specific enough to provide a quality framework, while remaining general enough that any tools an organization currently has can be slotted into that framework.  Two tools from the book that I particularly like: 1. The Wheel of Quality, which illustrates the different elements of a quality system and their interrelationships. 2. The L-shaped matrix, which can be used to prioritize customers and requirements 
 Montell Jordan has the best voice. My favourite song is "This is how we do it", it is the bomb! He can't be compared to other artist because everyone has their own sound and his is definitely unique. Keep  pumping out the albums, Montell 
 This is another CD of wonderful work performed by Collin Raye.  He even wrote a couple of songs.  He wrote the title track himself and co-wrote "Start Over Georgia" with his brother Scott.  This was the first  CD I ever owned of Collin.  When I heard it, it brought tears to my eyes.   It reminded me of when I first heard his song "One Boy, One  Girl". That was 5 years ago.  Every song he has done to date is an  exceptional piece of work that only Collin can provide.  He touches the  heart and soul.  I am not disappointed with this CD or any of his others.   Please go out and buy it.  It is well worth the money 
 This calendar is cool if you are into classic old films from the 40's , 30's 20's , 50's, 60's and 70's it's just designed well and  the artwork is eyepopping the are bright and dark in the right places. this is a excellent buy. 
 This is a wonderful little gem of a book!  Because it's a collection of tips, it's great to read in stolen moments of solitude - even 5-10 minutes at a time - although the author's style is so engaging, it's hard to put it down.  I'm not one to consider myself a princess, but I loved the tips for making an ordinary life more exotic and fun.  No matter who you are, or what your style is, you'll find ideas you can use.  Don't overlook this book as fluff because of it's title - it's a great find and so cleverly presented that it's also the perfect 'signature gift' 
 I paid $200 and free shipping for two chairs  they look like they are worth at least twice that amount  glad I ordered them  
 This was the best first introduction to puzzles for my daughter.  She got this puzzle for her first birthday.  With her love of animals, it was an immediate hit!  The pieces were large and the large chunky knobs made them easy for her to hold.  The painted picture underneath that correlates with the puzzle piece is fabulous!  Although my daughter can't always get the pieces back, she is learning the dexterity skills she needs!  It holds up well to teething, although the wood is soft enough to show indentations over time.  My daughter's favorite hobby so far is banging the pieces together!  
 Aiken's unsinkable Dido Twite is making her way back home when she finds herself entangled in the politics of a Celtic state located in the South American Andes. Taking place somewhere between "Nightbirds on Nantucket" and "The Cookoo Tree," this typically imaginative romp gives us a sleeping King Arthur, magic, and Dido's sunny disposition set in an alternative Victorian era. A must for Twite fans 
 I recently recieved this watch as a Christmas gift.  I am amazed at the amount of information this watch can gather.  I can check my altitude, see if a storm is brewing, and time each lap of my mile jog.  Everthing works great and is very accurate.  After a glance through the instruction manuel I was able to use and set all the functions with ease.  I love the feel of the band; it is a perfect fit for my wrist.  I would reccomend the stainless steel for best look and price.  This watch is truly fun to use and show off.  It is the perfect watch 
 Its good for its small scale every day stove grilling. Its very heavy and heats up quick therefore grills better than any other stove grill pan.  Its good for the price I paid.   
 After reading this book for about 2 hours and sitting with my PCs and parts for about another hour and a half, I had a fully functional peer to peer network up and running, sharing resources (and my cable modem!). At this price, you can't afford not to have this book. I even got an email back from the author within 24 hours (I had to thank him) 
 Woken Furies (2005) is the third SF novel in the Takeshi Kovacs series, following Broken Angels.  In the previous volume, Takeshi Kovacs took down Isaac Carrera on the Martian dreadnaught, giving Tanya Wardani enough time to shut down the gate.  Although Tanya stayed behind on Sanctuary IV, Duprez, Sun, Vongsavath and Kovacs departed the system in Angin Chandrea's Virtue -- a Wedge battlewagon -- for Lattimer.  There Tak had a half share in twenty million UN dollars to spend and tasks to perform.  In this novel, Kovacs is back on Harlan's World.  After a raid on the New Revelation Citadel, he is leaking blood as he returns to the warehouse district to change sleeves.  There he finds a stranger talking to his contact, Plex, and his degear/regear equipment missing.  Apparently the local yakuza has preempted the gear to replace some that had incurred seawater damage.  Setting the yakuza thug straight on who is top dog, Tak talks to the thug's exec and gets a promise that his gear will be returned within four hours.  While waiting, Tak goes to breakfast with Plex at the Tokyo Crow.  There he sees a woman acting weirdly.  Then some New Revelation priests enter the bar and harass her for having loose hair.  When the priest start to punish her for ignoring them, Tak intervenes and takes out all five priests.  Then he quits the bar, leaving behind a hallucinogen grenade to remove any interest that others may have in the fracas.  Outside, Tak joins the woman within the shadow of a loading crane and she invites him to crash in her place.  Sylvie Oshima is a command head with deCom, clearing out the military machine intelligences in New Hokkaido.  Back at her pad, Tak meets two of her team: Orr and Jadwigo.  After the yakuza shove their way into the pad and blast Jadwiga, Tak also meets Kiyoka while removing stacks from the yakuza bodies. Later, Tak meets Lazlo onboard the hoverloader Guns For Guevara on the way to Drava.  In this story, the deCom team works their way inland, taking out karakuri co-ops as they go.  Sylvie seems to be doing all right, penetrating mimint software and diverting smart shells with her command dataware.  However, she keeps quoting Quellist dogma every now and then.  After a close call with a self-propelled scorpion gun, Sylvie falls into a coma and runs a fever for longer than normal.  The team decides to cut the search and destroy mission and return to Drava.  While tending the unconscious team leader back at the base, Tak discovers that another persona occupies Sylvie body.  The other mind claims to be Nadia Makita, the real name of Quellcrist Falconer.  Where the heck did she come from?  Highly recommended for Morgan fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of exchangeable bodies, close combat and tough guys.  -Arthur W. Jordi 
 The New Whole Foods Encyclopedia is the holy grail to anyone embarking on a healthier, greener diet. Wood carries a relaxed, conversational tone through tales of sugar snap pea goodness or the brief history of quinoa, and I love her attention to detail in pointing out surreptitiously refined sugars in the most seemingly safest foods. At times, the lecture waxes a tad over-preachy, but the sheer breadth of foods covered, from South American grains to Asian legumes, makes this book a must-have for any cook 
 When this was released I had such a crush on "Belinda Carlisle", ok so I still do. This album which was her most popular, is just as good as her "Greatest Hits" as far as I'm concerned. Included are the hits "I Get Weak", "Circle In The Sand", and of course "Heaven Is A Place On Earth", but I also like "World Without You" and "Love Never Dies". Plus there's her cover of "I Feel Free", which is obviously more pop than the original from "Cream". Overall this album is one of the best from the late 80's pop scene, and definitely the best of "Belinda" 
 This album is probably the best post-punk music ever made. Even though this record was released in 1980 it is still powerful, beautiful, and creepy.  Essential for anyone with even a slight interest in post-punk or just good music in general.  A Must-Buy. 
 First off, let me say that I am a huge fan of all of James Rollins's books and have/will pick up anything he puts his name on. Having said that, this book is simply amazing. I have maintained that Black Order is my favorite Rollins book, and it is, but now it is my co-favorite book because it is now tied with Amazonia. This book is incredible both for it ligthening pace, relentless action, interesting minute details, character development, and creative plot twists. Basically, this is everything any reader could want in an action/thriller book. Even if you're not interested in the Amazon rainforest (because I definitely wasn't when I started this book,) you will develop an appreciation for it and everything in it by the books conclusion. All in all, a really great read and I'm just upset at myself for taking all this time (four years) to discover it and read it. Read this now for premium action and creativity 
 This a very good sheet music book for Kenny G. It's written for Saxophone only. Several of his other books are written for piano and violin. This book includs some famous songs of his, Song Bird, Going Home etc. It has  big font and direction of how to play and many salient features. I love  this book. To those who love sax and Kenny. G. It's a great book! Buy it  and you will love it 
 This is one INTENSE medical show. The details of the medicine are as sharp and up-close as those in ER, and the personal relationships are as in your face as those in Nip/Tuck. An excellent one-hour drama 
 This book contains a variety of short and light sketches to use as a lead-in to a sermon.  They vary from lightly amusing to slightly slap-stick. Sometimes one has to be careful about the theology of skit  books, but this one is very good with only a few that may be questionable  if your congregation is not of a fundamentalist faith 
 This was a gift and he was very pleased.  The quality was good and he really liked i 
 For safety reasons I was reluctant to purchase a bumper.  After looking at this one in person and seeing that it had ties on top and bottom I decided to purchase it.  My daughter did fine without it but I like the color it brought to the crib.  I wanted her to be able to see the cute animal design so I have the pattern facing in toward her.  Her crib has a drop down side so I have the bumper pad running across the back and ends of the crib.  I took the excess pad and wrapped it back around the outside of each crib end and tied it.  None of the solid blue shows.  I am very pleased with the quality of this bumper pad and highly recommend it 
 When my 3 sons small, it was tradition to play this (on an LP at that time) during tree decoration and get togethers with other kids during the Christmas holidays. Their favorite was "Must Be Santa" and they knew it by heart. Over the years, the LP record was damaged and not replaced. Then they grew up and had kids of their own. I thought they would like to share these very fond memories--and create their own--with their families, BUT...even searching for years, I couldn't find this Mitch Miller collection anywhere. By chance, I clicked on an Amazon email I got early in December 2006, and checked for "Must Be Santa" and there it was!!! I ordered four CDs. When I gave one to my youngest, his eyes lit up like he'd just seen Santa himself!! He said he'd been unsuccessful in finding it and was absolutely thrilled. Same reaction from my other sons. And Christmas day, we ALL sang along with Mitch, especially "Must Be Santa". Thanks, Amazon! 
 I am just a hobbyist.  This was a big purchase and a big step for me to get into this level of camera.  I still haven't mastered using it yet, and I've had it for a few months.    It does a wonderful job of taking pictures.  If you have the right lenses, it can take some of the most beautiful pictures you've ever seen.  Again, I'm just a hobbyist/enthusiast.  I use it to take pictures for work, too.  I highly recommend getting a couple of VERY good lenses to go with it.  Don't go with the cheap lenses that Canon, Tamron, Sigma, etc. make for this camera.  Do yourself a favor and get a nice zoom - spend some bucks.  You'll be happy you did.  The camera itself is pretty easy to use if you leave it on auto, but that's like buying a race car and never shifting out of first gear.  The auto settings are great, and they do a wonderful job, but you can do so much more if you learn to use the camera in Manual, Av, Tv, or P mode.  It allows you so much more creativity that you'll be amazed at the difference.  The 30D came out right before I bought the 20D, and I would probably buy it for the price now, but I'm very happy with my 20D 
 As always, Pynchon in V walks a fine line between lunacy and lucidity, and we keep waiting for him to go over the deep end: giving way entirely to his twin demons of shtick and conspiracy, as he does in The Crying of Lot 49. But in V for the most part, Pynchon keeps his balance - a funny word, admittedly, to use for this rollercoaster of a novel, veering incoherently from the great alligator hunt in the New York City subway system (so believable that it spawned a long-cherished urban legend), to Cecil Rhodes' South Africa, to World War II Malta, back to a plastic surgeon's office in New York for an excrutiatingly hilarious blow-by-blow description of a nose job. The only thread linking the narrative together is the mysterious initial V, innocuously attributed at first to the missing woman Victoria Wren but then appearing to subsume the entire century. Forget about V's identity: the novel is grafted onto Pynchon's and goes wherever its author wills. V falls somewhere between The Magus and Catch 22 in its irreverence and wild black humor, anticipates DeLillo in its fertile paranoia, and occupies its own niche in American literature for irrepressible nutiness. Among the most original - and most entertaining - American novels ever written. The danger is that anyone who doesn't write with  Pynchon's electric prose (i.e. everyone else) starts to seem impossibly tame 
 I really enjoyed this book.It was a sweet story and the characters were so real to me. I loved Paiges heart. How she gave when she truly had so little.It was a memorable book and one that I would recommend. The only sad part to me was when she would bite her daughters finger as punishment. Sounds a little cruel to me 
 Keith Urban is doing well as a country singer. However while listening to the songs you tend to get a queer feeling that his previous album "Golden Road" was slightly better. However if you enjoy country music, you're in for a treat. Good lyrics, wonderful rhythm, and good music all lend to that "easy going" kind of a feeling. A pleasurable album & a must have 
 This book continually gives me encouragement and motivation.  It helps to point out all the good things in life without having to go shopping or changing anything in my life but the way I see things.  I enjoy this book very much and recommend it to anyone looking for inspiration and validation.  The author highlights all the wonderful things in a woman's life, and literally celebrates the fact that we merely exist.  She helps with her terrific sense of humor, and her ability to admit her faults that are not unlike our own.  She reminds us of positive things we have that we may miss in the day-to-dayness of our lives 
 VH1 METAL MANIA is back with volume 2 and is just as good as the first.  One reviewer gave it only one star which is kind of bogus, because NO cd deserves only one star i would even give Ashlee Simpson's albums more than one star out of respect, anyways whats diffent about the second one from the first is that its more of there big arena,loud screaming guitar solo rock hits STRIPPED down into an acustic form. On the first one it had the ballads witch almost sounded the same as the originals like L.A. guns and Slaughter songs they were almost idenical as the ones on the original albums, but on this one you get the hard rock songs in a totally diffent style. the way this album sounds if you where to go to your local bar on a dead Tuesday night, and see two guys on stage sittin on stools with two guitars and thats it.  I would recommend this cd to anyone who grew up in the 80's and loved the hair bands back in the day and have heard there hits a million times like [round and round-RATT,here i go again-WHITESNAKE,once bitten,twice shy-GREAT WHITE....which are STILL great songs] played in a more melow bluesy kind of form, but if your a high school kid and you think the song CHERRY PIE was sung by POISON you probly wouldn't dig this album 
 I agree with R.Parklane, 1 star is uncalled for. This book is about gay erotica. It should contain hot sex, and lots of it. That they want it all the time, well.... we should be so lucky. But the book also tells a story about 2 people who love and need each other, but get lost in their own troubles. It broke my heart and renewed my faith in love.  Chris Owen told an excellent love story. 
 In case nobody knows, writing books takes time.  After all, it took Stephen King over 30 years to write "The Dark Tower", and WOT is certainly much longer and infinetely more complex than TDT.  At around 2 years per book, Jordan is writing very fast IMO.  If you are all so sick of waiting, then quit reading book series' until they are finished.  As for me, I'm happy just as long as Jordan doesn't die before the end 
 This Printer is Great for the Price. I have had it for nearly a month now and I share this printer between 2 comps and it keep on printing perfect. The first paper you print itl take about 30 sec to warm up but once thats done itll start throwing papers at you  LOVIN I 
 I'm a latecomer to Whitman's work, only really discovering it in the past decade. (I'm in my 40s.) It was Reynold's book Beneath the American Renaissance that prodded me in this direction, and, naturally, I wanted to read his more complete take on Walt.  What stands out in this book is the way Reynolds weaves together not only Whitman's life but also the context of the period, which makes it so much easier to understand what Walt was saying. Reynolds is without doubt the best explainer of this period, as it applies to literature, and reading this book is both a pleasure and an enlightening experience, providing a history lesson at the same time as it looks at Whitman's writings.  A must-read book for any Whitman fan. 
 I have repeatedly returned to my copy of this book, usually when I am about to embark on a garden chore and want a refresher course in the hows and whys. The alphabetical topics include "Animal Pests", "Asparagus", "Beneficial Insects", "Cold Frames", "Edible Landscaping", Garlic, "Irrigation", "Pelargoniums", "Trees" and hundreds more, all simple to locate as though you were reading a phone book. Each entry contains an encyclopedia-style summary with an organic method slant. Beginners and intermediate gardeners will find the info provided invaluable, but if you want an in-depth explanation, seek a more expert book.   Other features include a recommended reading list, an index of common plant names paired with their botanical names, and simple line drawings illustrating many of the book's topics.  That said, I was sad to see a mistake in the "tomato" entry as I was reading it just now... the book recommends planting dill near your tomatoes to attract tomato hornworms. Unfortunately, these are not the same species and killing caterpillars found on dill will simply reduce the number of swallowtail butterflies in your garden (tomato hornworms are a type of sphinx/hawk moth.) I advocate planting the dill anyway and leaving the caterpillars alone! The rest of the 5 pages devoted to tomatoes includes an overview on choosing plants or seeds, bed preparation and planting, tomato pruning tips, recommended fertilizers, how to make long-lasting tomato cages, a disease summary, harvesting information, recommended cultivars for organic growers, and tomatoes raised in small spaces.  A nice reference for the gardener who is in a hurry to get outside and plant 
 Killer Instinct is the story of an up-and-coming executive in Boston working for a Japanese electronics company. This book, like any good novel, will have you not wanting to put it down. The chapters fly by and the story keeps the readers attention as the main character, Jason, is helped by a former Special Forces mastermind, Kurt. Although Kurt helps Jason progress up the ranks of the company, he does so by using warlike tactics, many of which Kurt learned while in Afghanistan. Jason reaches the breaking point when Kurt crosses the line one too many times. The climax leads to the showdown between the two main characters. I am not spoiling the ending by saying that in the end, the good guys win and Jason and his new family live happily ever after - what else would you expect? But this is a decent book that will keep you reading, if you're in the mood for a quick read 
 This is an excellent book in explaining how people can continue to support a concept that is as fully discredited as anything in history. Ask our own army that liberated camps what they found. What more can be said if Amazon protects anti-semites' "right" to lie from honest discussion, especially when it is by anonymous cowards. I doubt this will see the light of day, but I agree with the author, having been grown when the war ended and the denial began in spite of the overwhelming evidence by both sides (including a huge amount of Nazi records) 
 Yam presents a very detailed yet very interesting account of the Prion situation. This is a fairly complex topic to tackle but it is done in a stepwise way that takes the reader along with it. The account seems even-handed and I think the science is very sound. Much better than the current but disappointing "How the Cows turned mad" by Maxime Schwartz 
 Island of the Blue Dolphins is book that shows the coming of age of a young girl. It tells about the survial of a young girl, Karana, who is forced to live on an island alone as she awaits for help.  Both male and female students can appreciate this book.  It is packed with emotion,mystery, and adventure.    I enjoyed this book.  I read it in elementary school, and having to read it again as an adult I can appreciate it more. This is not a book that should be looked as just another book to read for homework.  It would be worth reading for leisure.  Not only can students learn from this book, I think adults can as well 
 If you like travel books and/or motorcycle journals this is a must read but its also a lot more then that. This guy is an inspiration for his determination through hardship that would certainly defeat the majority of us. 
 I really enjoy the way Jack Kornfield approaches meditation and makes it easy for us to understand. His voice is very calming. I like the guided meditations coupled with explanations of why and how to meditate 
 I absolutely loved this book.  I have been interested in macrobiotics for over a year and this was the first book I read that made me laugh and excited to try out this way of life.  Jessica is a lovely author and makes you feel like you are talking to a friend instead of reading about health via the boring route.  I strongly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more or continuing on the microbiotic path. Cheers to all of our health 
 This book is for amateurs who want to "bring back vacation pictures that you'll enjoy looking at again and again and again" according to the back cover; and this book does and excellent job of telling/showing one just how to do that. The text style is very good, really teaches in an easy, insightful way.  The photos used for examples are superb. At the end of a chapter you can sense that you are now better than you were before. Well worth the money 
 I am lifelong photographer and I purchased this camera in January. I have taken it on several major trips. It is an wonderful performer. I have many 11x14 enlargements that I have received terrific feedback on. The quality of this camera and the Cannon optics will not disappoint. The price is right now that the replacement is out.

 This book is basically the original H.G. Wells novel brought into the 21st century. Evidently the US Mars probes have upset the Martian population and they to earth for a little revenge. The story pretty much follows the original except for a slight twist of the ending which I won't reveal. It is a pretty good story but could have been longer with more fleshing out of the characters who are pretty flat and predictable. It is a fairly quick read with lots of action. 
 This book has many,many strategies to play craps, a down to earth book for people who are not greedy,he shows mostly conservative way to play 
 I would hesitate calling Mr Eickhoff a genius, but "Fallon's Wake" is a brilliant story, complexing, yet simple in its understanding of the "Troubles" in Northern Ireland. As a resident of Belfast, I can say that if Mr Eickhoff is not a resident of the country, then he has an uncanny gift for climbing inside of individuals and becoming them. Given the tenacity and ferocity of Fallon, I'm not certain that I would want to meet the author of "Fallon's Week" as an adversary on some dark night. This is one of the best novels I have ever read by anyone about the situation here in Northern Ireland, Irish, American, or English. If not an Irishman, he should be 
 In this volume Charles and Mary Lamb turned 20 of Shakespeare's best loved plays into narratives for children , and it is a work of art in itself. Written in 1807 , the stories are still easily readable and enjoyable 200 years later. It is the ideal companion for one who finds Shakespeare hard to follow in the cold print of the play scripts but would like an easy and gentle introduction to his plays. These stories are today read not only because they are an introduction to Shakespeare but they are the works of Charles Lamb and his sister. The easy flow of Tales , the unity of style throughout , narrative sliding naturally into dialogue and dialogue into narrative , shows what talented authors the Lambs where. Sub-plots and subsidiary inicidents and characters which give richness and variety to the plays on stage can confuse and mar the narratvies.  Thus they are often left out in the narratvies , leading a Shakespeare afficionado to perhaps be alarmed that the antics of Malvolio and the wit and pranks of Sir Toby Belch and Sir Andrew Aguecheek are left out of the Lamb narrative of Twelfth Night. But if they where included they would have confused an already complicated story , one of mistaken indentity and familiar absurdity.  Charles Lamb gives his own ideas as to the sanity or lack thereof of Hamlet and often at the end of the comedies Mary Lamb writes of the characters living happily ever after , giving a longer time frame to the narratives than exisited in the plays. This fresh infusion of the Lamb's own ideas and wisdom , made this a greater work than had they been mere critiques or precis of the plays themselves 
 Loving someone who's mentally ill, August 3, 2004 Reviewer: Steph "Steph" (At large) - See all my reviews  Loving someone who's mentally ill can be a wrenching, exhausting experience. It's a big, scary stew of affection and guilt and vexation and fear, a complicated blend of all sorts of conflicting emotions. You know you're supposed to love someone just as they are, but you can't help nurturing the secret hope, however impossible, that they'll somehow shake it off and emerge whole and healthy at last, ready to be a normal person; depending on how self-aware the loved one is, he or she may hope for the same thing, and it can't be easy to reject and hate a major part of yourself. It's hard enough when the relationship is with a friend or significant other; imagine how terrifying it must be for a child - who has every right to expect to be cared for by her parents - to have to deal with the danger and unpredictability of a mentally ill mother.   In Rescuing Patty Hearst: Memories From a Decade Gone Mad, a self-styled work of "creative nonfiction," Virginia Holman describes her childhood with a schizophrenic mother. In 1974, shortly after the famous Patty Hearst kidnapping (which fascinated both Virginia and her mother), Molly Holman leaves her husband and kidnaps her daughters, eight-year-old Virginia and infant Emma, taking them to a small cottage on the Virginia Peninsula. Delusional and under the sway of hallucinated voices, Molly believes that a "secret war" is being fought all throughout America; Molly's special task is to build a field hospital for the refugee children that will soon come pouring in. She puts her daughters to work "sanitizing" the decrepit cottage and painting the windows black; she spends her days scrawling war notes in a tattered notebook, or combing the beach and forest for "clues" (schizophrenics often see auras around brightly colored objects; Molly attaches significance to the color red). For four years, Molly descends further into madness, all the while retaining custody of both children; her fitness as a parent is never questioned by the community, and it is many years until she is finally institutionalized, according to the quirky rules then in place governing involuntary commitments to mental institutions.   As Virginia herself notes early on, the obvious question is: Why was this allowed to happen? Why did her father simply let Molly skedaddle with the children? Why didn't relatives, neighbors, or friends alert the authorities? Why was Molly permitted to traumatize her children for years with her volatile moods, her delusions and hallucinations, and activities tantamount to child abuse (as a practice "maneuver," Molly drives Virginia out into the country blindfolded, then drops her off and tells her to find her way home in the dark)? The author believes that there were a variety of factors at work. First, it wasn't all craziness; although there were many bad days, there were just as many good days, or at least forgettable ones. Second, this was a rural community back in the 1970s, not unfriendly but definitely reserved; people kept to themselves and weren't so quick to question others' eccentricities - they may not even have noticed them. Third, Molly was very skilled at pulling herself together when necessary, and acting presentable enough to pass muster to any school authorities or relatives that might drop by. And, perhaps most significantly, people are very good at ignoring things they don't feel equipped to deal with. Virginia understood that her family wasn't normal and that her mother was unstable, but she also felt a certain excitement from buying into her mother's fantasies. After all, what if it were really true? Whether or not Virginia truly believed Molly's war stories, it was easier to pretend that they were plausible than to accept that her mother was insane and an unfit parent.   Virginia traces the progression of her mother's illness over the years, as well as the family's painful process of growing accustomed to her erratic behavior and - most difficult of all - learning to care for Molly while living and enjoying their own lives. As an adult, Virginia corresponds with both parents, asking them for details of her childhood and their recollections of her mother's schizophrenia. Some of Molly's letters are reproduced in the book; it's fascinating, though eerie, to see the shifting awareness as Molly slides from reality to fantasy several times in the course of one short letter.   Through the process of researching and writing this memoir, Virginia seeks to make her peace with her tortured past and her complicated emotional bond with her mother. Because schizophrenia is passed down from the maternal side, Virginia worries that she may one day develop symptoms herself - schizophrenia commonly manifests in adolescence or early adulthood, but Molly's symptoms did not appear until she was in her thirties, married and with two dependent children. Rescuing Patty Hearst is ultimately about self-understanding and self-acceptance; about being aware of the effects of the past without letting the related fear control your life and ruin your chances for happiness.   It's not clear how much of the book is factually accurate, but the prose feels genuine and consistent; it's honest and matter-of-fact, without descending into self-pity or fake sentiment. Virginia doesn't try to cast her mother either as a scary Lady Macbeth or an object of pity, and the result is a warm, loving portrait of an unhappy woman constantly battling her own perceptions. In the final scene, Virginia visits her mother at the institution, and Molly begins a delusional harangue about how Virginia's father is having an affair with the psychiatrist's "hottie pants" secretary. Gathering her courage, Virginia tells her mother no, that's not true, it's just a delusion. "Then, [Molly] sighs and says, sadly, and from some still sane part of herself, `Oh. Well, maybe that's just how I wanted it to be.'" Wanting reality to be different for ourselves and for our loved ones - surely that's something we can all relate to.      
 Kelly Hayford has written an informative, eye-opening, and highly readable book that gives the reader an armload of reasons to improve their own diet and ample ammunition for gently encouraging their loved ones to do the same.   Kelly makes a great case for avoiding what is artificial or processed and she does it in a thought-you-might-want-to-know way that presents solid data to give you food for thought. (Sorry, I couldn't resist the pun.)  This is not a diet book! This is a book to help you achieve and maintain the dietary side of fitness and health. Kelly is no stranger to the kind of marginal health that can result from terrible eating habits. Her own story, presented at the beginning of the book, sets the stage for what has become a calling for her: helping ordinary folks create healthier habits around food in a doable and enjoyable way.  Well done, Kelly! 
 Another great CD by .38 Special, although not as good as Wild Eyed  Southern Boys.  Too bad they sold out when they did Rock n' Roll  Strategy--yuk 
 Myron Butler & Levi's debut release "Set Me Free" is an addictive, diverse worship set that one can listen to over and over and not get tired of it.  Mainly because there is not one weak cut on the entire set!  The songs are both spiritually uplifting and vocally appealling as the group blends perfectly and skillfully on each song.  With songs that touch every aspect of the spiritual being, we should look for nothing but future greatness from Myron Butler and Levi as they continue to touch hearts, minds and ears with their unique blend of gospel music.  ORDER THIS CD AS SOON AS YOU FINISH READING THIS REVIEW! 
 We have been searching for a stainless steel papertowel holder for sometime now and we finally decided to purchase this one from Amazon.com.  They truly can make your shopping easier to do without ever having to leave your home.  I am very pleased with the Paper Towel Holder and Amazon.com 
 As someone who has been in China for eight years I found Joe Studwell's book a breath of fresh air among the constant hype about this market. Some reviewers have challenged his account but I would strongly agree with his premise that while it is easy to be busy in China it is hard to make money. As Studwell points out, few foreign CEO's are able to pick up on this difference.   Some previous reviewers have claimed that Studwell has been proved wrong over the past two years since release of the book as the economy has continued to grow and one reviewer mentions GM as an example of how companies have exceeded their projected growth and revenue targets. Studwell's message was not an attack on the economy necessarily but an attack on the perception that there is easy money to be made in this boom. I would have to agree with his attack on those outside China, or with little knowledge of it, who fail to carry out basic due diligence.   Studwell's point is not based on confirming "the impending collapse of China" rather a recognition that despite the appearance of a first world economy this is still a developing market, with highly protectionist ideals, that requires business managers to apply realism and analysis to succeed. Don't leave your common sense and good business practice on the plane.   The move by Volkswagen in 2005 to cut back on investment and separate research showing that car production will be 5 times over capacity by 2015 seem to substantiate his message that yes there are winners but these are often short term! 
 I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks there's nothing more epic and exciting in a RPG than war. Well this book does a pretty good job of laying the groundwork for a campaign based around battles. It's not all straightforward battlefield stuff either, a lot has to do with different tactics during war. Things like cutting the enemy's supply lines, battlefield espionage, siege weapons, arrow volleys, etc. It also has what is definitely the best and simplest system for battlefield morale that I've seen (and it's compatable with the D&D miniatures rules) and explains how Leadership and one's rank in the military play into things. Most of the feats and prestige classes are boring (though the combat medic is excellent) and some of the spells are very interesting. Overall it is an excellent resource. The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is that it's all very situational, and in a standard campaign none of this will get used. For a campaign that involves medieval warfare and big battles, it earns its pricetag, which I can say for less and less of WoTC's product line of late 
 I found this book to be very helpful and easy to understand.  Examples of what to do and what not to do are very clear and provide many "aha" moments when you realize how much better a piece can look by following the tips/suggestions in the book.  Essential reference book for any graphic designer from beginner to advance 
 The novel by John Ball is exciting from start to finish because every page is signifacant and important. The details described by Mr. Ball is so vivid that I felt as if I was actually besides Virgil Tibbs, who is a black  detective in Wells. He is convicted of a murder, mainly because of his skin  color. But mr. Tibbs proves that he is a 15 yr. vet as an investigator for  the Pasedena Police Department. He helps the inexperience of the wells  police by solving the immposible murder case. Mr. Ball uses descriptive  action verbs and adjectives that captures the readers attention. This is a  geat mystery novel because Mr. Tibbs reminds me of a great detective named  Sherlock Holmes 
 Young Alexi helps the people of his village come together to pull off a Christmas miracle in their small, deserted church.  Beautiful illustrations and a heartwarming story you will want to share time and again with your family 
 So much was already told about this book. Get it. Study it. This is THE book on combatives everyone should have. 
 We are very pleased with this TV--the clarity and color is great.  I noticed the people seemed to be squashed, but I think I can change something on the viewing to remedy that...just have to read the instructions!  Great price...I could never afford a $2000-3000 TV, so this is the poor mans substitute 
 I really did like this movie and the different kind of story. It was very imaginative and well acted. The story was very scarey at times and gorey as well. The only problem with the movie is that the director covered up Ezra Godden's nude scene with a half shot of his butt in the begining of the movie. Other than that, if you would like to see a town that prays to a fish god Dagon that wants human sacrafices and the town's people peeling off the faces of it's visitors then this movie is for you 
 This is an excellent introduction to the renown anglo-zulu war of 1879. This title of the Essential History-series is  written by Ian Knight, leading expert on zulu history and author of numerous books about the subject. Knight covers all the battles and incidents during the war, such as the battles of Isandlwana, Gingindhlovu, Rorkes Drift, Hlobane, Kambula, Ntombe, relief of Eshowe and Ulundi, each battle are briefly described and most have images and maps associated with them. I find both sides in the conflict portrayed accurately and fair by Knight, although I guess he exaggerates the abilities of the zulu impis and seem to put their estimated losses at the lowest possible numbe 
 I just had this pot rack installed and it looks great in my small kitchen. It's sturdy and functional. The finish is matte black with chrome grid, hooks and mounting hardware (all the hardware needed is included... even the ceiling hooks which are not included with some racks). The description here at amazon doesn't say how much weight it can hold. It's made by Rogar and you can get extra hooks at their website. For the price this one can't be beat... I even got it with free shipping from Target. I recommend it to anyone with limited cabinet space 
 A "B" movie that scores a solid "A".  Lean, sharp little thriller packs more thrills and suspense than movies with ten times the budget. Some of the dialogue and delivery go over-the-top, but this only adds to the film's vinegary flavor . The real winner is the story, which holds enough surprises to keep discerning viewers on point throughout. Film noir devotees should pounce on this, and the full set it comes from: Film Noir Classics Collection- Vol. 2 
 Back in the 80's when I was about 7 or 8 years old, this 2 part movie came on TV and we recorded it, of course it was on Beta back then.  I totally fell in love with this movie.  After I only saw it once or twice, I wasn't able to see it again for the longest time because my family lost the tape and TV never showed it.  So I was wanting it for years and finally in the late 90's, like 98 or 99, I just happened to look in the Disney store and saw both Alice In Wonderland (1985) and Alice Through The Looking Glass (1985) and I bought them right away.  They were on VHS but it doesn't really matter because I love them so much.  To this day, at 27 years old, I still love this 2 part film and never get bored of it.  I have watched many other versions of Alice In Wonderland and no other version has had an Alice as good as Natalie Gregory or a white rabbit as good as Red Buttons.  Even Ringo Starr is in this version.  I totally love that rabbit costume and back in the 80's, you can tell, or at least I can tell how much work the director put into this film.  Since 1985, other versions haven't shown as much detail and work like this version has.  Even the roses in the rose garden looks real.  I do hope one day, they will release this 2 part masterpiece on DVD because my tapes have gotten a lot of use in the last 5 or 6 years.  If you own any Alice In Wonderland, own this 2 part one because this one puts every other version to shame!! 
 This is a very well-done CD.  I'm happy to play a couple of the tracks live and at the club.  GREAT electronic, driving EBM beats.    I would recommend this to any fan of EBM whose not afraid of vulgarity. The only problem I have with this CD is that it's violence-centered.  Now, I'm not a goodie boi but seriously; the gore on the album art, alongside tracks with blatantly negative messages, promoting evil things (whether sarcastic or not) is just unnecessary.  It seems to negate the brilliance of the electronics. Thanks! ~DJ Raven 
 I agree with everyone else on this one I do love these beautiful scarves! they are the softest and warmest scarves I have ever bought I own 3 of them myself. Where I live they are very popular and nearly everyone I know has at least one of them. However I bought mine at the local mall for $5.99 so I would not buy them on here for twice as much but if it's convenient for you guys out there go for it 
 In a way I shudder at the idea of reviewing a book like Philip D. Curtin's "The Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex: Essays in Atlantic History" for the simple fact that a book containing fourteen detailed essays is daunting to summarize. Which essay should receive the most attention? The reviewer of Curtin's book soon realizes that such a question does not have an easy answer. Nearly all of the articles contained in this slim volume warrant far more attention than I can give them in a 1000 word review. I'll have to resort to sweeping generalization in the main, most likely, but that's acceptable considering the focus of these writings deals with a sweeping topic. Atlantic history is metahistory, encompassing as it does some three or four hundred years and stretching through Europe, Africa, South America, the Caribbean, and North America. It is also a story filled with tales of exploration, greed, bondage, and freedom. Atlantic history is a hot topic from what I've gathered, what with books like Marcus Rediker's "The Many Headed Hydra" gaining quite a lot of attention in the academic world. Then again, maybe I think it's a pressing subject since I've read several books on the theme for a class at school.  Curtin focuses on the rise and spread of the plantation complex, which he calls an "entity," beginning with the discovery of sugar in the Mediterranean during the time of the Crusades. Located primarily on the island of Cyprus, Europeans harvested sugar there for roughly two hundred years. With the reconquest of the Levant by Muslims, growers and consumers sought out new sources of the product. Enter the slow move into the New World and the introduction of a plantation structure that was feudalistic in nature, relied on slave labor, and was controlled by a political system overseas. The "true" plantation existed solely for profit, for supplying goods for distant markets, and needed slaves to operate the fields because the European populations had not yet overcome the numerous diseases and hardships found in the harsh climes of South America, the Caribbean, and Africa. Had Europeans merely waited until they built up immunity to diseases, argues Curtin, it's quite possible slavery as we recognize it today might never have existed. He also posits the interesting observation that plantations in the American South were not "true" plantations and as such receive little mention in his articles. He's more interested in the large European concerns spreading like a plague through South America and the Caribbean.  Curtin doesn't solely examine the structure of the plantation, although he does spend some time discussing the geography of a typical sugar plantation, the types of buildings found there, how the goods went to market, and how the same forms adapted to different climates. He throws in a detailed examination of the African slave trade, how it arose, who participated in it (both Europeans and Africans readily engaged in the selling of human beings), and argues that the decline and fall of powerful African states led to an increase in the number of people available for the slave markets. The author also argues that the plantation, no matter what its location, represented a form of "cultural demography" in that the Europeans who built them moved into a region and supplanted the local population (most of them died) with non-native inhabitants. The racial and social composition of our world today is largely a result of the plantation system and the demographic changes it wrought. It's an amazing claim and one that, if accepted, equals in importance the barbarian migrations that rocked the Roman world in the fourth and fifth centuries.  Curtin postulates some theories to help explain the demise of the plantation complex, too. He contends that the democratic revolutions in the New World and Europe put an end to these exploitative economic enterprises, primarily the series of rebellions that resulted in an independent Haitian state in 1804 but also including the American and French Revolutions. Even moderate attempts at democratization in England helped bring about the abolishment of slavery (remember, American plantations don't count) and thus sealed the plantation complex's doom. Also lending a hand was the emergence of the European Enlightenment, which tended to look at non-western lands and people as "exotic," a view that planted the seeds for later anti-slavery movements and increased attention to what was going on in the mother country's backwaters. By the 1880s Brazil was freeing slaves to SAVE money because droughts and laws aimed at preventing the importation of new slaves decreased their value to the point that it was too expensive to keep them around.  "The Rise and Fall of the Plantation Complex" makes abundant use of detailed maps and graphs, something that, as incredible as it sounds, many history books fail to do. I did have two quibbles with the book. The first is the atrocious editing, or should I say lack of editing, that plagues nearly every page of this book. Errors are so numerous that the flow of the text is seriously hampered. And none other than Cambridge University Press published it! My second problem centers on Curtin's complaints about "Eurocentric" history and how historians ought to look beyond that bias. That might have been a problem in 1990 when the book first appeared, but even a cursory glance at the history section in the local bookstore today will reveal dozens of titles written from a decidedly non-European point of view. Despite these niggling problems, Curtin's book is a good read for both historians and interested laypersons (laypeople?) intrigued by the subject. 
 This book was a phenomenal, well-written expose of George Bush. As one reviewer put it, it is an encyclopedia of every thing that is wrong with George Bush, and the fraud he has perpetrated on the American public.  Waldman catalogues so many facts and attributions per page, it is difficult to read so many pages in one sitting, because you want to absorb the messages. This book is filled with footnotes and appendices and nexus searches. It is impossible here to list all the things that Waldman describes in detail: his drunkeness, arrests, insider trading, favored military treatment, sleazy campaign attacks, the administration chickenhawks, and his lies about everything from WMD's to taxes.   Waldman writes well. His message is clear, concise, and easy to follow. His arguments are compelling and unassailable. If you are still uncertain, read all the one star reviews and look at what they attack: the editorial spelling of a latin phrase, or a dismissive, shrill-like, paragraph without a single, intelligent, cogent analysis, refutation of fact, or challenge of Waldman's work. That may be your best recommendation.  I hope he writes another one about the second term. I'll stand in line for it.  If you want one book that will teach you how to talk to a conservative, this is definitely one of the very best 
 Man, this cd is frieken awesome, i love the great beats that sometimes your just like , hmmm i didn't know that could happen. like the song " towards omega" has incredible beats but no tune and yet you don't need any tune, in fact i am kinda dissapointed that digweed put stuff like "air " on here and "words by pvd" it just doesn't fit with the rest of the cd. This album contains the stuff that differs from the rest of the techno world. It is keepin up to date in my book and i think it always will! Deffinately buy this 
 I could not put it down, read it cover to cover. Easy read that kept me interested 
 I am pleased with the watch.  It syncs with the big clock in Colorado every morning at midnight.  We also have a wall clock at home which does the same thing and the difference between the 2 is no more the 1 second at worst.  For $40 you can't go wrong.  Only complaint is my wrist is in between removing 1 or 2 links from the watch band so I chose 1.  It rides a tad lose on my wrist but 2 links would make it too tight.  Guess I need to lose a couple more pounds so I can take another link out! 
 V is a scarred man who has a vendetta against a fictional totalitarian government because they did some wicked experiments on him and other captives. You see how crafty and deadly he has become in his attacks on government property, and you see how he slowly warps Natalie Portman's mind over the course of the film by convincing her that his cause his just and his approach is justified.  The movie is well done, and the acting is phenomenal, especially the guy who plays V. This is a film that gets under your skin, a movie that sticks with you days after your first viewing. Recommended for mature adults.  Rev. Marc Axelro 
 The chapters on the Pentateuch; Chronicles; Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther; and Ezekiel and Daniel all by Eugene Merrill were great. As an interesting central theme for the Old Testament, Merrill presents a return to man's  dominion stated in Gen. 1:26-28. In the chapters he writes, Merrill ties  the OT text into this concept very nicely. The other chapters also have a  wealth of information, but are much less centralized around a theme. While  I recommend reading the whole book, these chapters make it especially  worthwhile 
 Lynn Andrews presents her experiences honestly and without apology. The story within is told by a master, about events that are beyond the imaginations of most. I feel that previous reviews condemning this novel simply testify that most people are not ready to accept the latent universal understanding in themselves. If you are a person seeking inspiration and are interested in Native spirituality - please, do yourself a favour and read what it is truly like 
 I thought this book was a wonderful story of tragedy, being a survivor, and forgiveness. Reading this after the recent tragedy in Pa. in the Amish community, I have to think that this book of the Morman faith and the Amish beliefs show the rest of us about the freedom they feel after forgiving someone for committing a heinous crime against our loved ones. The main character, Ronnie, doesn't understand how her parents can forgive the man who killed her little sisters. But as she continues with her life, trudging through her anger, her guilt and acceptance, the result should teach us a lot about this concept-----can we forgive those who trespass against us? It's mighty tough in the death of a child, I'm sure. This story was awesome to read. And, as another reviewer mentioned, the ending was somewhat of a surprise. This book had so much to offer----but the message of forgiveness is at the forefront. It sure makes you think about it. And any story that makes me ponder on life is a good one for me.I will read this book again and recommend it to others as one of the best reads 
  The Pocket Pharmacopoeia is the single best quick drug guide on the market today....it is great in both the hospital and office setting..  
 this is the best song ever and these two together make the best song eve 
 Goes through all the basics of trendlines etc, I really enjoy Pring's writing style and analogy's. This book alone won't turn you into a profitable trader, but will give you the core you need to seek out a good system and understand it 
 The goblin hordes who feast on flesh threatened humans and Sidhe with extinction.  To contain them in the wastelands, a silver Caul was made with faery magic by a mortal silversmith.  Now, due to the treachery of a mortal who betrayed the Sidhe prince he made a deal that enables Cadwyr, heir to the Duke of Gar, to possess the Caul.  The Goblins roam the mortal realm, eating on human flesh and Cadwyr has no plans to stop them.  He kills the Duke and claims the title but the dowager duchess Cecily flees and plots to overthrow the traitor and become queen if the people will accept her.  In the land of the Sidhe, the goblins are coming and the land is dying.  The people, mortal and Sidhe, must find a way to UNnmake the Caul otherwise both the human and faery realms will cease to exist.  SILVER'S BANE, the sequel to SILVER'S EDGE, is a fantastic fantasy that leaves no questions left unanswered or threads left for any other sequel though a prequel in which the making of the caul is told in SILVER'S LURE which is coming in 2006.  There are many heroes and heroines in this book who band together to fight the goblin horde praying to end the threat that Cadwyr poses.  Anne Kelleher has written a memorable spellbinding work.

 As with all the Moosewood books I have collected, this one is just as exciting. 
 Evelyn Waugh's book "Brideshead Revisited" gives you that feeling of autumnal-university-literature-class heaviness that you crave from time to time.  Like that piece of chocolate cake that you shyed away from the other day, it's something that is too dense and too heavy for you to eat hurriedly but something that you want to sit and take time with.  There are all of the usual literary forms in this book which employs memories of Post-WWI modernist progressivism framed by the mires of WWII meaninglessness.  But Waugh isn't doing this simply for the want of honor and tradition that seem to have been lost to progress and get-'er-done type flunkies, he's (and yes, he is a "HE") doing it for your soul.  Evelyn Waugh was an adult convert to Roman Catholicism, and you can trace both his faith as well the memories of his wrestling against faith in this book.  The book uses the protagonist of Charles Ryder to explore the lives and existential nature of the family that resides in the Brideshead mansion.  It is a look into human nature as it wrestles with all sorts of things, and especially as it wrestles with faith.  The book is one of the many that are lumped into the "hound of heaven" category.  Over and over in the book, we see that no matter how far astray or how morally and ethically objectionable people are - God's grace seeks after them and brings them back with a twitch upon the thread that connects them to God.  Although the book isn't overtly Christian, the Christian reader can certainly enjoy a deeper level of significance.  The non-Christian can also enjoy the book, especially the look into the Christian life that shows that even Christians aren't ever perfect, nor do they need to be - they know a hound of heaven who is 
 Cant believe it wasnt in the top 100 Love stories. I had this played at my wedding, and was so happy I found someone who looks at me like he looks at Jane Seymore. It was such a loss to the world when he became injured and later died. He was an excellent actor!!!!!!!! 
 Only Etta would take on a diverse song selection like this, now some of the arrangements are alittle simply but they work, Etta's voice is still strong and she brings her unigue approach to each of the songs... 'Calling You'(which has never been a favorite of mine) Etta makes it work, just listen to Etta mimic a trupment and then ends the song on a funny note, "Purple Rain" a tough choice is turned into slow blues number, "Stop On By", "Strung Out", "Holding Back The Years" are the best cuts on here, "Somewhere" is good but ends to soon. I hope Etta sticks with this direction but on the next cd have the arrangements more R&B\Soulish 
 This movie is great and white people all around the world should be forced to see it in school. Prefferably while they are still children, that way they won't have time to be persuaded by ignorant, conservative, racists like K. Tarin, a racist reviewer who wrote an article on this same page. Anybody who isn't a racist loves this movie 
 I bought this DVD based on the reviews on the pitch page. I had no expectations, and some concern that it might be a bit 'worthy', so the box sat on the shelf for a while. When I got round to viewing, however, I was blown away, like a feather out a magnum. This film will make you mad as hell ,and you should be. BUT it is also HUGELY inspirational - it seems that in a world where lies are common currency, truth can still break a buck, with a little help from decent people. It's a month after I viewed this DVD and it is still in my head. Despite the tragic subject matter, it's FANTASTICALLY gripping, edge of the seat stuff, and the final few minutes will, frankly, make your day. There are some heroes left in the world 
 I love the Vicar Of Dibley!!!  But when I got the order I discovered I already had series 3...so I returned it and have not heard anything from you yet....it was returned for over a week.....could you please look into this....thank you Joan Custe 
 Finally, a book that most can understand and enjoy.  This is a wonderful ambitious book to help all those interested in learning about the exciting young format called DVD.  If you want to create your own Home Theatre, this book will also help  show you how in plain English. I can't suggest a better book more clearly written with a special enthusiasm that only Bill Hunt could bring to his text. Even accomplished film enthusiasts will find lots of new information to feed their curiosity.  As a long time film and video editor I found it to be a welcome edition to my library.  By the way, it's also a great gift idea for the Holidays 
 This book has really changed the way that I live. Not only has it really improved my overall skin quality, I have more energy and I am more vivacious than ever before! I have struggled with acne since I was about twelve years old. I have tried everything including accutane. It as not until I found this book and began following some of the principals that I really noticed a difference. I will say this, a really do not believe that all the supplements are required for you to reach your optimum skin health. I do fine with my fish oil and ALA ( which I will not buy at the overly inflated perricone web site prices), and watching my high glycemic carbs. I also take DMAE and eat a lot of salmon. Not only has my skin cleared, the entire color of my skin is different. People began to complement me for the first time in my life telling me that I had beautiful skin. In addition to the skin clearing, i also am much more toned and dropped about 10 pounds since the start of the program. The only problem  I have with this book is it seems like Dr. Perricone really plugs his products waaaaay to much. The prices on his website are a little crazy for my taste. If you want to really save on your topical supplements go to a website called [...] With the products on this website you can make you own skin care products using cetaphil as a base. They are exactly the same thing. 
 After being forced to re-package our suitcases on the floor of the airport we decided that a travel scale was essential.  The wife's suitcase was 55 Lb, mine was 35.  The airline people weren't going to average them.  This scale is the answer.  It is designed to show the weight of the piece of luggage once it is lifted and sat back down.  You don't have to struggle to see the weight while holding it in the air. It also has a convenient measuring tape built in to make sure you meet not only the weight but also the size requirements. It is rugged and well built 
 I am a Disneyland fanatic and have been there 20+ times. However, this was the first time I decided to do my research before going figuring I needed some tips to beat the July crowds. I read about 5 Disneyland guide books and none compared to this book. I have never had such an enjoyable yet got everything done vacation! And he has different recommendations for every type of group. All of his tips are excellent; however, I especially recommend getting to the park at opening...I know it's hard for some none early-bird families but there is time for napping at the afternoon peak crowds. If you are going to Disneyland...BUY THIS BOOK...you won't regret it!! 
 Buckley has done a wonderful job with her first book and I am hoping that others will follow. This is a well-researched and well-documented biography of Christina. The queen is placed within her time period and Buckley wisely refrains from enforcing a modern view on the queen's lifestyle and decisions. Instead the author leaves the reader to make up their own mind.   And excellently written work, Buckley gives those of us with little knowledge of seventeenth century Sweden a context from which to view Christina's life. And the discussion of Karl Gustav, Christina's father, the man who made Sweden a powerful military nation, is an important part of understanding Christina's idea of herself.  For a pleasurable and enlightening look at one of the many high born (I would hesitate to call Christina powerful, except in her own mind) women floating around seventeenth century Europe, this is as great place as any to start.   
 Dick Morris worked closely under Bill Clinton since 1977, an insider.   "Part of the mission of the book is to correct the historical record and set right the omissions, distortions and self-serving interpretations that fill the pages of My Life".  "Falsehoods should not be permitted".  I found myself reading the book with Dick's voice.  It is a smooth read with a blend of wit, and the occasional run to the dictionary. The "notes" are not marked in the chapters, which there are many.   My reason for reading this book is to gain more Knowledge into Bill's Presidency and especially Hillary, since she will more than likely be running for President. It may be that Hillary will be more of a danger to us than her husband was ever capable of being.  I have also been interested in Dick's writing style and opinions.  Much of the book is already known, but Dick brings out the details, and keeps the blood boiling.   The main purpose of Because He Could is to clear up Bills distorted book.  Maybe I will someday force myself into reading "My Life".  Ask yourself for what does Dick have to gain by lying.  There always seems to be a man beside the man in power that he can't touch.  He does cover the positives along with the negatives of Bill's presidency.  I do though have a problem with some of Dick's so called positives that Clinton made policies.  Dick seams to know Bill better than Bill. He plays the role of psychologist, because of Bill's past actions.  "I think Clinton would have been a better president if he was not so empathetic or passive and trusted in himself."  A lot of what ifs.  For you Clinton devotees, you may change your mind about your beloved president after reading this.............or maybe not.  Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me (two terms)  Will Clintons' inaction of the growing terror threats around the world come back to haunt us in the future, time will tell, but it looks as if it will, doesn't it?  Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of blame to go around.  This is only one subject 
 This book contains everything you want to know about names.  You will find definitions, related names, examples of people with the name and much more.  A great resource to have as you make a very important decision 
 Housekeeping is a rural Northwest girl's quiet rebellion against modern womanhood and mid-1900s society. The pressures of family life in the city having destroyed their mother, Ruth and her more outspoken younger sister, Lucille, are raised in Fingerbone, ID, a mountain town on the edge of a lake on the edge of oblivion. When their long-estranged, thoroughly unconventional aunt Sylvie sets up housekeeping in their family home, she becomes a catalyst for the polar divergence of the girls' lives. One is disgusted by her transient's habits- sleeping with her shoes under her pillow, amassing newspapers and tin containers in the living room- the other silently fascinated. Ruth lacks social graces or any motivation to obtain them, and with the upwardly mobile society that surrounds her, and which her sister joins, she shares a mutual disinterest. As her disinterest becomes outright rejection, though, the town takes notice of her and Sylvie's embarrassing behavior, and the difficulty of being amid society but not of it becomes clear. Robinson's narrator at times seems to speak from an experience so finely attuned with the five senses that it surpasses them in a kind of universal understanding. At other points, the words are so spare as to match the harsh landscape of the girl's childhood. In either case, Ruth's story is starkly gorgeous, and justifies Housekeeping's status as a modern classic. 
 I connected the Bose Acoustimass 5 with an onkyo tx-8511 receiver and the sound is incrediable. It really fills my entire loft area with lifelike sound. Definately a great speaker 
 I am actually reviewing both Parts One and Two with this since they should be read together.The reason why I enjoyed these plays so much is because we see Falstaff in both of them.  He is my favourite Shakespearean character - big, bawdy, rough, a liar and a cheat, but again we know what he is right from the beginning, and Shakespeare keeps him so true to character.  These plays are a bit different from some of the other histories.  There are more comedic parts in them for one thing.  The plays are certainly used as a medium for introducing young Hal (who will become King Henry V).  We see him as a young man, and watch him grow and see the influences that his society and the people in it have on his development.  He doesn't appear to be growing up well according to his father because he is so irresponsible.  King Henry IV was not England's strongest ruler.  He was haunted by his guilt over the death of his predecessor, King Richard II.  In Part Two, comedy still plays a big role, and we still see Falstaff's influence on young Hal until the shocking moment of Falstaff's death.  The best part about Part Two though is the deathbed scene between old King Henry IV and his son Prince Henry.  The play leads us to "King Henry V".  Prince Hal does finally grow up and he becomes a very strong leader.  Actually King Henry Iv, Parts one and two should be read before King Henry V.  It is the correct sequence and we see Prince Hal grow and mature.       
 This book, though it is suggested reading for 4th to 6th graders, was helpful to me.  Not only am I an adult, I am in the process of getting certified to teach high school social studies.  It provided me the essentials that I must cover for any class (other than at the college  level).  The page layout is excellent; the variety in print type and color  as well as maps and pictures made it a"fun" reading and learning  experience. I highly recommend it for students, parents and social studies  teachers 
 Another great little text by Boynton. As usual her witty prose and simple but engaging illustrations are a delight to read and my children always enjoy.  One small annoyance, the book shows animals exercising right before bedtime. After reading my children want to do exercise activity and this gets them a little wound up making bed time a bit extra challenging. My solution is to read that book first, then read another more sedate themed book to help the children settle down again 
 Cahoone's soothing voice is a comforting tonic in today's hectic world.  
 I've read several dinosaur books and I've generally found them to be very good. This one, along with "The Complete Dinosaur", ranks as one of my favorites. The reason I was interested in this book was that I was looking for something that focused on the evolution of dinosaurs and how the various taxa of dinosaurs related to each other. I was also looking for something at an intermediate level. This book exceeded my expectations on all fronts.  The first two chapters mainly covered background material such as geological time scales, isotopic dating and fossilization. The next two introduced some concepts of evolution (not including natural selection, an understanding of this is presumed) and a very high level view of chordates. The discussion of clade diagrams was very through.  After a chapter on the origin of dinosaurs, the book goes on devotes the next several chapters to describing a wide variety of dinosaur taxa and how they are related to each other. The chapters are grouped into parts, each part starts off with some high level discussion of a taxon. Then the individual chapters go on to elaborate the points by describing the taxa within the taxon. The chapters usually start with a description of the taxa's anatomy, distribution and behavior. Typically a fairly coarse grained clade diagram is presented early and more fine grained diagrams are presented as the chapter continues. The characteristics that distinguish one taxa from another are also described. The material isn't just presented as facts, it is justified by evidence from the fossil record. I liked the level of detail the authors typically chose, however someone else may want more or less.  The final two chapters of the theropod part deal with the evolution of birds. I found the discussion of the origin of feathers to be very good. I especially enjoyed the illustrations (I thought the illustrations throughout the book were quite good) showing how they evolved and the structure of feathers used for flying versus those primarily useful for insulation.  The remainder of the book deals with dinosaurs as a whole. I thought the chapter on thermoregulation was very good, much of the information being useful for studying animals in general, not just dinosaurs (the same could be said for several other parts of the book too). Following the thermoregulation chapter there is a chapter on patterns in dinosaur evolution that I thought really tied the previous material in the book together. The treatment of non-avian dinosaur extinction was excellent and balanced.  My one quibble about the content concerns what I consider to be an omission. The authors address the question of "is a cow a fish". They naturally answer "yes". In my opinion it would have been nice if they had then gone on to discuss this in more detail, explaining how this means fish don't form a clade. This would have been a good opportunity to discuss the concept of a grade and perhaps paraclade too. The reason I this discussing fish as a grade is important is that basically everybody has an idea that there is a group of animals they can classify as fish and this group doesn't include cows. I think it would've been nice to help them understand what they mean when they think of fish and why it doesn't conflict with the statement "a cow is a fish".  There are a couple errors, but they are easily recognized. For example on page 77 they refer to synapids as reptiles then on the following two pages they break up amniotes into synapsids and reptiles. Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems like a contradiction.  As much as I liked this book it's not for everyone (what book would be?). Obviously it's not cheap. If you're not interesting in dinosaur cladistics this book probably is not a great choice. If your main interest is more along the lines of a dinosaur catalog with descriptions of various dinosaur ways of life you can certainly find better books, especially at the price (although I still think this would be a good book). However, if you are interested in dinosaur evolution, along with how dinosaurs made their way in the world, then I think this is a great book 
  Fifteen hours and 53 films worth of silent slapstick is a LOT of silent slapstick.  Before you go any farther you should realize this isn't the greatest 15 hours worth of silent slapstick available.  If you want to get the best - the funniest stuff - buy the boxed sets of Chaplin, Lloyd, Keaton and Laurel & Hardy, and then see if you can find a compilation disk with some Harry Langdon and Fatty Arbuckle on it.  Oh, the heavy hitters are here, but it's the inclusion of so much by the other guys that sets this set apart.  If you like silent movies and are willing to sit through some strange stuff for no other reason than to see what folks were laughing at 100 years ago, this set is for you.  I think it's a gold mine.  A sprawling gold mine, but priceless to anyone interested in the history of filmed comedy. Each disk is divided into two sections.  To give a sense of the breadth of this set, I'll briefly mention the highlights - or lowlights - of each section.   1-`Pioneers' - Section one of disk one features the pioneers of silent slapstick and contains, I believe, the earliest film in this collection, the 4-minute long `Mr. Flip' (1909), starring cross-eyed comic Ben Turpin.  Mr. Griffith hadn't invented the close-up yet so we don't get a chance to see Turpin's crossed money makers.  This film has Mr. Flip flirting with every woman he comes across and getting slapped with shaving cream, pies, etc., for his trouble.  No plot, not even a real start or end, and really not very funny, but oddly engaging.     2- `Keystone Tonight' - Ninety odd minutes worth of early Mack Sennett/Keystone Studio one- and two-reelers.  Highlight is the 16-minute `The Rounders' from 1914.  Charlie Chaplin and Fatty Arbuckle star as a couple of lushes who flee from their wives so they can continue getting sloshed in the hotel bar.  A lot of funny-drunk sight gags.  Both had and would make more memorable films, but interesting to see how these two ad-lib off each other.  This section also contains Harry Langdon's `Saturday Afternoon,' (1926, 30mins.) one of those `hen-pecked husband stepping out' movies.  Some claim Langdon was the fourth great silent comedian, and his films are generally less available than Chaplin's, or Keaton's, or Lloyds's.  As an innocent man-child, somewhat the waif, and a great pantomime, Langdon reminded me a lot of Stan Laurel. A somewhat creepy Laurel, to be sure.  There are a couple more Langdon shorts in this set, so you can decide his claim to glory for yourself.   3- `Sennett in the `20s' - More madcap mayhem from one of the kings of silent movie producers.  Because it's Sennett, coherence and continuity are going to take a back seat - or asked to take a walk - over speed and visual gags.  In the 20-minute `Circus Today' (1926) Sennett favorites Bill Bevans and Andy Clyde play a couple of bumbling circus hands.  Beauty Madeline Hurlock plays the circus bare-back rider.  Bevans is the competent, if unmemorable, knockabout comedian with the brush moustache.  Not unusual for a comedy of this era, the stars are gleefully put in harm's way every 2 minutes or so.  At one point a cage full of lions escape and, naturally, chase all the main players.  In one very memorable scene, the tutu-clad Ms. Hurlock is seen flat on the ground with a 400-pound male lion sitting on top of her.  No process shot in this one, and I'd imagine no second take, either. 4- `Funny Girls: Genders and Their Benders.' Slapsticks starring female actresses Gale Henry, Alice Howard, et al.  5- `Keaton, Arbuckle, and St. John.'  Fatty Arbuckle with Mabel Normand, a couple of Arbuckle and Keaton collaborations, one Keaton solo and one two-reeler featuring Arbuckle nephew Al St. John.  Keaton's solo outing `The Boat' (1921) is the best film in the entire collection, and a textbook example of how to build and sustain a gag.   6- `Hal Roach's Acts: Star Comedians.'  Five shorts from the Hal Roach studio, including a Stan Laurel solo project, a Charley Chase domestic comedy, and a Will Rogers' spoof of contemporary hit movies by Valentino and Fairbanks.  Also in this section are a couple of shorts starring Harold Lloyd, including his winning 1920 horror spoof, `Haunted Spooks.'  7-`Hal Roach: The Lot of Fun.' Laurel and Hardy, Our Gang, Charley Chase, and Snub Pollard.  The `Laurel & Hardy Lafftoons' was the only disappointing entry in this set.  `Lafftoons' is the only instance in which compiled highlight scenes, rather than a complete film, was presented.  Laurel and Hardy are a favorite of mine, but I would have preferred seeing all of `Angora Love,' rather than a short scene from it.  Charley Chase is perhaps the most consistently sophisticated comic in this set.  Chase uses slapstick to accent characters and situations and push the plot ahead - pretty much the diametric opposition of how it was usually done. 8- `Chaplin and the Music Hall Tradition.' Or, Chaplin and his imitators.  This sections opens with 1915's `A Night in the Show,' with Charlie playing two roles - Mr. Pest and Mr. Rowdy - whose names ought to clue you in to what kind of (inebriated) theater goers they are.  One is tuxedoed and sits in a box seat, one is shabbily dressed and sits way back up in the cheap seats.  One of the more curious shorts in this set is 1918's `He's in Again,' with Billy West - who looks and dresses just like Chaplin - as an out-at-the-heels bar customer.  West was the most successful of Chaplin imitators, and, if nothing else, this short gives you a direct example of the difference between competence and genius.  9- `The Race is On.'  Four shorts here, all celebrating speed and all featuring some of the most hair-raising footage you'll ever see.  The worst is Monty Bank's 1927 `Chasing Choo Choos.'  It's easy to take scary stuff on film when you know there's CGI or some other film trick involved.  Some of the stunts in this one defy an obvious explanation.  In one scene - the one that had me on the edge of my seat - Banks has two feet in a racing race car (one that the driver had bailed out of!) and two hands on a speeding locomotive.  Simply the most amazing stunt I've ever seen.   10- `Anarchic Fringe.'  Well, we finally get to see a Ben Turpin close-up in `Yukon Jake' (1924).  The biggest surprise, to some, will be Charley Bowers' 1926 `Now You Tell One.'  Bowers, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Buster Keaton, tells his story to a gathering of the Liars' Club.  Bowers included stop-action animation in his shorts, was really a pioneer in the field, and his story includes a rapidly growing eggplant that contains an egg and salt shaker, shoe strings that tie themselves, and other such fanciful nonsense.  
 Exellent show.Beautiful music, quite funny, true to the comics. Dogpatch is a great place, the best spot on the hill.Sorry that the girls didn't quite like Hairless Joe. High recommendation. Hurrah for the Yokum family!One can enjoy this experience without necessarily being as virile as Lil Abner 
 Van fans, this is the real deal.  An incredible performance by Van with an exceptional band.  The horn section of Pee Wee Ellis and Mark Isham are worth the price alone.  This might be the best $15 I ever spent.  I would have spent $150 if I had to.  Most of us will probably never get a chance to see Van live in a setting like this but thankfully we have these videos for posterity.  My comments are about the 1980 performance 
 My three-year old loves the Little Einsteins and he loves this book.  Rocket is his favorite, and he has lots of fun using the rocket magnifier to identify the clues.  I have been very impressed with how much my son has gotten out of this book.  
 This excellent study traces Hungary's underground music scence from the time when music functioned as the best available substitute for politics on to the present, when no-longer-underground artists are competing over accounts for the past, the kind of cultural capital they feel their past engagement entitles them to, and a new set of opponents not in the sometimes censorious state but in the multinational music industry. Anna Szemere brings in a nuanced knowledge not only of the postsocialist transformation, but also of aesthetic and sociological theory, to make for a discussion that has implications well beyond Hungary and Eastern Europe. Also, she makes a lot of fascinating lyrics available to non-Hungarian speakers 
 In David Bess's review, he says there are better books.  This might be true.  But I liked this book because, when I read it, I was not involved in any church or religion and the book did not overly "push" any certain religion upon me.  It did, however, open my eyes to concepts and things I had been blind to in my marriage.  It also convinced me to start going to church and other things.  I read the book in one night because I couldn't stop reading.  I think this book is very good for people who haven't been living like christians and who don't necessarily want a lot of biblical quotes and chrisitian teachings at first, which might, due to the fact the person isnt currently practicing faith, deter them from finishing the book.  The book has certainly changed my outlook on life, love, marriage and has even convinced me that finally the time has come to re-affirm my faith and start living like I know I should.  READ THIS BOOK 
 Note: This is part of a critical essay I wrote, which is to be found online at: idol.2ya.com  I have no ambitions and no desires. To be a poet is not my ambition, It's my way of being alone.   --Alberto Caeiro: 'The Keeper of Sheep'   Alberto Caeiro is Pessoa's first great heteronym. Caeiro is perhaps my favorite heteronym of the three; although, it is true, I recognize Alvaro de Campos poetic achievement as superior-- Caeiro is nonetheless the most endearing.   The best summarization of Caeiro is given by Pessoa himself: "He sees things with the eyes only, not with the mind. He does not let any thoughts arise when he looks at a flower...the only thing a stone tells him is that it has nothing at all to tell him...this way of looking at a stone may be described as the totally unpoetic way of looking at it. The stupendous fact about Caeiro is that out of this sentiment, or rather, absense of sentiment, he makes poetry."   In a letter written to his friend Adolfo Casais Monteiro, Pessoa described the birth of this heteronym: "[It] was March 8th 1914--I approached a high chest of drawers, and, taking a sheet of paper, I began to write, standing up, as I always write whenever I can. And I wrote thirty or so poems at a stroke in a kind of ecstatic trance, the nature of which I will not be able to define to you. It was the day of triumph in my life and I shall never succeed in living another like that. I opened with the title 'The Keeper of the Flock' ('O Guardador de Rebanhos'); and what followed was that someone emerged from within me, and whom I christened that very moment Alberto Caeiro. Forgive me for the absurdity of the following sentence: my master emerged from within me."    What makes Caeiro such an original poet is the manner he apprehends reality. He does not question anything whatsoever; he calmly accepts the world as it is. Caeiro is indeed a child of sorts: the recurrent themes, as a critic notes, to be found in nearly all Caeiro's poems are wide-eyed child-like wonder at the infinite variety of nature. He is free of metaphysical entanglements (as Campos and Pessoa himself are). Central to his world-view is the idea that in the world around us, all is surface: things are precisely what they seem, there is no hidden meaning anywhere.   He manages thus to free himself from the anxieties that batter his peers; for Caeiro ''things simply exist and we have no right to credit them with more than that.'' Our unhappiness, he tells us, springs from our unwillingness to limit our horizons. Caeiro in this sense is wise: he attains happiness by not questioning, and by thus avoiding doubts and uncertainties.   For Caeiro apprehended reality solely through his eyes, through his senses. What he teaches us is that if we want to be happy we ought to do the same. Octavio Paz called him 'the innocent poet'; true, he is innocent by our standards, and yet: does not his wisdom--experience-- consist precisely in his 'innocence'? Paz made a shrewd remark on the heteronyms: "In each are particles of negation or unreality. Reis believes in form, Campos in sensation, Pessoa in symbols. Caeiro doesn't believe in anything. He exists."   Caeiro is a wonderful invention; is there a poet before him who thinks, or rather, sees as he does? Poetry before Caeiro was essentially interpretative; what poets did was to offer us an interpretation of their perceived surroundings; Caeiro does not do this: instead, he attempts to communicate his senses, his feelings to us, without any interpretation whatsoever.   Caeiro teaches us to apprehend Nature differently; he asks of us, simply, to see what is before us. Poets before him would have made use of intricate metaphors to describe what was before them; not so Caeiro: his self-appointed task is to bring these objects to the reader's attention, as directly and simply as possible. Caeiro sought a direct experience of the objects before him.   It does not surprise us that Caeiro has been called an anti-intellectual, anti-Romantic, anti-subjectivist, anti-metaphysical...an anti-poet, by critics; Caeiro simply--is. He is in this sense very unlike his creator Fernando Pessoa: Pessoa was besieged by metaphysical uncertainties; these were, to a large extent, the cause of his unhappiness; not so Caeiro: his attitude is decidedly anti-metaphysical; he avoided uncertainties precisely by clinging single-mindedly to a certainty: his belief that there is no meaning behind things. Things simply--are.   Caeiro represents a primal vision of reality, of things. He is the pagan incarnate. Indeed Caeiro, Richard Zenith tells us, was not simply a pagan but 'paganism itself'.   The critic Jane M. Sheets, sees the insurgence of Caeiro--who was Pessoa's first heteronym-- as essential in founding the later poetic personas: "By means of this artless yet affirmative anti-poet, Caeiro, a short-lived but vital member of his coterie, Pessoa acquired the base of an experienced and universal poetic vision. After Caeiro's tenets had been established, the avowedly poetic voices of Campos, Reis and Pessoa himself spoke with greater assurance."   
 I know they run only nonfiction shows, but HGTV should rerun "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House" regularly, just as a warning to starry-eyed homeowners. Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are absolutely hilarious in this homebuyer's comedy, but the real star is their dream house.... and the hideous flaws with it.  The Blandings family live in a New York apartment, where they fight daily for closet and bathroom space. But then Jim Blandings (Cary Grant) gets a brilliant idea -- buy a charming house in the country, fix it up, and live in rural charm. Unfortunately, he quickly gets tangled up in a heap of mortgage problems, and gets cheated by the former owner.  And once those are sorted out, they get professional opinions ("Tear it down!") which lead to major demolition. Undaunted, Jim and Muriel (Myrna Loy) help design a brilliant new house, only to encounter a new array of setbacks. As Jim tries to deal with the strain, he suspects that his marriage is coming apart.  Personally I consider having a new house built to be from the fifth circle of hell, especially if you have to oversee the details yourself. Apparently HC Potter did too, since the movie is crammed with subtle jabs at demanding homebuyers, trendy decorators, and those guys who send the windowpanes to the wrong town.  The movie basically trundles along the increasingly bumpy road of buying land and building a house, although it becomes somewhat slack when Jim suspects that Muriel is cheating on him. Fortunately the dialogue is hilarious from beginning to end ("The house just needs someone to love it, that's all!" "Good thing there are two of you. One to love it and one to hold it up").   Mr. Blandings reminds me of some homebuyers I'm related to -- he has more optimism than any person can have, unless he is completely out of touch with reality. And Cary Grant makes you laugh WITH and AT Jim. Loy is solid and witty as the long-suffering wife, and Melvyn Douglas does his dry best as their best buddy.  The moral of this movie: Pursuing your dream house will probably be a nonstop nightmare, even if you look like Cary Grant and Myrna Loy. So beware 
 This is easily the best book on modern Japanese history.  Professor Pyle uses the book as an introduction to modern Japanese history.  He divides each chapter into a specific historiographical issue instead of writing one long narrative on modern Japan, and as such is an invaluable asset not only for those who know little about Japan but also as a reference for the more knowledgeable.  Pyle focuses on the trends of modern Japanese history, leaving out minor details in order to give the broader picture and context of the historical forces governing the making of modern japan.  Pyle has a knack for terse prose; not a word was wasted in the writing of this book.  As such, he has produced a wonderful book that vividly describes the historical forces that shaped modern Japan without bogging the reader down in details.   
 I came across this trimmer when I was looking for a panasonic shaver.  I am glad I bought it.  This trimmer beats shaving down there with a shaver. It is just the right size to use for the private area.  Although it is not a shaver it trims pretty close to the skin.  It works perfectly with an epilator for the bikini line area.  I use a Braun Epilator (Braun 3370 Silk Epil SoftPerfection Epilator which is being replaced by Braun Braun 5270 Silk-épil X'elle Body System Epilator)afterward to remove the excess hair in the bikini line area which works wonder.  I love the fact that this is battery operated, no need to worry about eletric shock..This is overall a good trimmer. 
 My wife and I love to hike with our German Shepherd. However, her (the dog) behavior had become an issue. Whenever, she sees another dog or horse, she loses her mind, and we lose control of her. We did not want to resolve ourselves to hike with her on a leash.   Now that we have this device she "comes" on command, and not on the second or third time we call. She comes the first time, and to my hand. Now we can hike with her, and gain control when we see dogs, horses, and those who do not share our enthusiasm for dogs.  I like to add this devise is not cruel in any form. It has a dial of 8 settings. I tried it on myself. I could not feel "1" at all. "2" and "3" tingled. "4" felt uncomfortable (not painful), and that is where our dog is set.   The only issue is at home. We have an "invisible fence", which works on a very similar principle. The issue is that when I "beep" her or "zap" her at home, she becomes very confused. Hence, we only use it primarily for our hikes, which was our desired goal anyways.  The conclusion is that I highly recommend it for hiking or rather "off-leash" walks. You may have mixed results at home, if you have an "invisible fence". Although without the "invisible fence" issue, I believe it would be very effective for any sort of training.   Bottom line is that it works and I wish had I bought this tool earlier. 
 Shakira is defintley a great latin pop singer , in English and Spanish.  Personally I like the spanish album, due to fact she sounds so much better when she sings Spanish such as the awesome latin duet "La Tortura" and the great remix they give with it.  "En Tus Pupilas" and "La Pared" start the album off with a bang great latin tunes and vocals by Shakira. "No" a great Shakira song on the album that you will just fall in love with.   "Dia Especial" and "Dia De Enero" personally are my favorite songs on the album with "La Tortura" and "No" this album is the biggest latin release in a while pick it up!   Overall Effect: 5/5 
 If you like Goran Bregovic or Johnny Cash or Roy Orbison or David Byrne or Mostar Sevdah Reunion or Zlatne Uste, you'll like this music; if you like all of the above, you'll love it. It's that simple. Indie crooning plus Balkan brass music. How come nobody ever thought of this before? 
 I don't want to give anything away, but if you like poking fun at institutionalized religions, then this is the book for you! My 3rd favorite Tom Robbins book, after Jitterbug Perfume and Skinny Legs and All. 
 this book is fabulessly written . the book is written by a man who knows what he is writing about . i didnt give him 5 stars because he says that the words have to be the same as what he has written . they dont you can use whatever names o power you want. i mostly bought it for the tecnique it gives excellent metheds for devloping psychic abilites .some spirits take practice to be able to summon .just remember use what you belive not what you dont (for the invocations to gods) i have allready orderd more of his books nocturnal witchcraft gothic grimoir and contact the dead (im not intrested in vampires)ill write some reviws for them  
 I am so glad that the Science of Sexy was written.  It has helped me to understand HOW and WHY some people look great all the time.  I never knew that there was a formula to your body type and that EVERYTHING that is in style, might not look good on you.  I've heard that all my life, but never really "UNDERSTOOD" it!  Now....I look forward to my new wardrobe, and really enjoy shopping.  Although I am losing weight (due to Bariatric Surgery), I can look good in everything that I wear!  Thank you for this book.  It is a true Godsend! 
 Edgar Rice Burroughs, well-known as the creator of "Tarzan," was also a pioneer in the realm of science fiction. "A Princess of Mars" was originally written in serial form in 1912. The story is painted in broad strokes, with generous helpings of adventure, combat, and romance. The writing and dialogue sound quaint and stilted to modern ears, and the plot tends to meander. Borroughs' science may strike us today as a bit silly, but for 1912 it's very creative and imaginative. The detailed portrait of Martian society is fascinating.  "A Princess of Mars" is a classic, and science fiction fans will enjoy it both for its curiosity quotient and its entertainment value 
 The striking title evokes a powerful image of the destructive forces at work when churches are overcome by conflict. Susek, who has first hand experience of the lasting effects of church controversy, traces the stages of conflict and provides practical suggestions for dealing with each phase. The book also includes a detailed plan of action. Susek incorporates a dimension that is missing from many materials on church conflict, that of the spiritual forces of evil that are often at work. The book begins by explaining the six phases of a firestorm and how to recognize the symptoms. Next it presents four pillars of strength that are crucial for healthy churches to have spiritual power, and helps church leaders evaluate themselves in light of those strengths. Special attention is given to how church leaders' family and psycho-social needs may be affecting them too deeply, either helping to create conflicts or hindering effective resolution. The book also helps leaders to assess the presence of a number of other factors that contribute to conflict, such as cultural resistance to authority, rapid church growth, etc. Susek also includes very helpful sections on church discipline, bold spiritual leadership, the use of consultants, care for badly burned church leaders and their families, and the role of interim ministers 
 This production showcases the talent and artistic elements of Shelia E; the Prince protege' with amazing skill of the drum. Romance is a powerful, yet seductive work of art that is sure to be a classic 
 I came to the Summons after reading only The Broker, and having seen a couple of Grisham films.   The plot of the book is quite basic - revolving around a law professor's dead father's estate - but contains some interesting twists and turns along the way. There arent a whole lot of characters to get to know, only really 3 or 4 "main" characters, the rest seem to fade into the background, and the Mississippi countryside plays a big role too, as Ray Atlee jetsets back and forth. Atlee's main hobbies in the book seem to be flying a Cessna all over the place and spending large amounts of money in casinos - 2 things I would love to be able to do.  I found the story to be reasonably interesting, as it raised a lot of questions about how Atlee should handle the little extras he found in his father's estate, which were not mentioned in the will. Should he put it in the probate, should he take it for himself, should he split it up? The predicament is interesting, and the outcome of his seemingly altruistic approach does not go to plan.  While the twist in the story is quite unexpected, it is not groundbreaking stuff. Rather, I took it as more of a fable if you like, an example of how the best intentions can look like something otherwise to those outside the thought process.  Overall, I thought it was a short, snappy read. I think that the Broker was a better read than this. If you like the Summons, definitely give the Broker a go. The scenery and characters in the Broker are a bit stronger. But if you like this genre or author, the Summons is definitely worthy of an afternoon or two 
 The game of golf in my opinion is 50% mechanics and 50% psychological. Golfers tend to get sour when they over-analyze everything from the swing to the short game. It is just as important to learn to relax and enjoy the game. Chopra brings this point home. Enjoy the game with its ups and downs as you would the game of life.  I once had a collegue at work come with me to the driving range, where I practiced my swing every other day. He took the driver and hit the ball further than I ever did, and although not quite as straight, good enough for a good lie. Completely frustrated, I asked him "How is it that you can hit the ball so good for a non-golfer." He replied, "I don't think about it much. I just hit it." I think it would do a lot of golfers well to look at the spiritual side of golf and take in the surroundings, rather than focus on just the mechanics. 
 Jolly Captain Jack Aubrey and his sidekick the bespectacled bohemian Doctor Maturin Return for this 7th book in the renowned Aubrey/Maturin series. In this segment, Maturin and fem fatale Diana Viller's romance heats up, Jack's money troubles become more pronounced, and Doc Maturin's career as a spy threatens to become the death of him.  What can I say about this great series? The character of Jack Aubrey is just SO endearing and Doctor Maturin is so priceless as the inscrutable doctor, that this series simply cannot be missed! Even the presence of Diana Villers (a character I've simply loathed for quite some time), seems less irritating.  I'm listening to the unabridged Narrated version by Patrick Tull, and this series is wonderful. Cannot be missed. Particularly love the parts where Jack/Maturin and The Swedish Envoy are in prison. Too funny! Wonderful series. I highly recommend it.  
 When the Pat Metheny Group came to the University of Virginia in 1984, I was one of the first students to get to the ticket line, not because I'd ever heard of them, or even of jazz-rock fusion, but because the man I had a deep crush on said, casually, they were pretty good and he thought he might go. He waited a couple of days, figuring no one but him had ever heard of Metheny--I did not. I got a ticket--he did not. I think he may have forgiven me by now. The man, who is now my husband partly because of that evening, ate dinner with me anyway, and walked me rather generously to the concert hall, and then left me there at the door to encounter something I'd never heard before. The group had chosen a relatively small classical concert hall with several tiers of opera seating. Chamber quartets usually played there, and Sir Ian McKellen had performed soliloquys one night...not the usual rock concert scene at the basketball stadium, for sure. And it was packed to the rafters. So I squeezed myself into a solo seat between two tweedy turtlenecked junior professors and hoped for the best.   And got much more--if you've heard the music anywhere, you know it can send you on a trek through the darkest Amazon looking for rare orchids or jar you back to your fresh awkward youth with the remembered offkey fumbles of a junior high school marching band on its first day of outdoor practice. I shut my eyes halfway through and let the music peel everything else away.  After that concert, I played the Travels album, front to back, back to front, daily for more than two years. I think I wore out a couple of needles on it. That music got me through physical chemistry, it got me through the costuming course and the late-night painting sessions that were supposed to be my distraction from p-chem, and it ended by seeping into my bones.  The loose-jointed music is perfect for writing to, you can see the great road picture flowing from your fingers as you listen. Some of the pieces are dark and sensual, some unexpectedly light-hearted, some practical and streamlined like the polished chrome roadside diner from the late '50s with the real pot roast dinner that you suddenly spot on your cross-country journey, some wistful at the knowledge that it's time to pack up again and head back to the Greyhound station. All of it is uniquely heartwood American, and absolutely none of it is worn down with false flagwaving cliches. It is brainy, casual, serious, and freewheeling in the same moment, conscious without being self-conscious, and it stirs the faint breeze of hope for America, the real thing, in a way that no Homeland Security propaganda anthem ever will. Go and get this album, now that it is on CD and won't warp like my old loved-to-death LPs. Then take your seat on the bus and start writing your own great American road trip. 
 Joseph Bayly had a unique perspective as a story teller. So often we are told a writer should just tell a story and not try to make a point, but that sure isn't the way Jesus told stories. Bayly understood you could go into a story with the intention of teaching a lesson, and yet still make his characters and his stories rich. The Gospel Blimp is, of course, the main attraction and still has much to teach about mistakes made in evangelism. The two Gooley stories are great fun, poking fun at the uncomfortable balance of being in the world but not of it. How Silently is one of the best stories ever in the "what if Jesus lived in our time" genre. But I think my favorite story in the book is Remembering John, I story that makes it clear why we mustn't forget Joseph Bayly 
 The book covers the subject well and is carefully written.  It stands  alone in that there are no other books for the prospective owner of a  single dairy cow rather than a herd.  Some of the information is dated;  recent improvements in genetics have more than doubled milk production and  changed the needs for feed.  There is a little philosophizing with a '70s  back-to-the-lander slant which I found distracting 
 I have to ask myself, "What is the basis for my scientific knowledge?"  On a daily basis, as I am a chemist.  I have often been struck by arguments for "induction" as lacking credibility, because how can one argue of probabilities with an unknown sample size?  Popper argues that a proposing scientific hypothesis is an inductive act, but it is a creative act not a logical one, but that scientific knowledge is dedective.  I agree with him.  The nature of science is such that one must put for statements about how the world works and test them.  A scientist should always try to find a way of proving himself or herself wrong.  If the predictions of the test are shown to be false, then the hypothesis must be false.  That is the basis of scientific knowledge.  The rest, the best theories we have are just "working models" and we can never justify why they work.  They're simply our best working models now.   I don't find Popper's argument disheartening.  Popper points out that we don't have to justify our search for explanations of the world, because they may do us benefit (if we happened to live in a world with stable physical laws, for instance).  I think many scientists would fundamentally agree that the laws of nature can never really be proven.  They can't, but they speak volumes about what is relevant to us as a species (which is why Popper's argument that "induction" is creative is so interesting).  All Popper asks of a scientific hypothesis is that it can, in principle, be demonstrated false by experience.  This is by far one of the most interesting and (I feel) important books I've ever read 
 When this came out in 1990 or so, it was easily THE compilation to get on Jefferson Airplane. It didn't sound too bad, better than the Jefferson Airplane CD's from previous years, the artwork was (and is) well-done and pretty cool, and the track selection was superb. However, it's been out-of-print for years, and when RCA/BMG merged with Sony, they released another two-disc compilation as part of Sony's "Essential" CD's. That set, titled "The Essential Jefferson Airplane," used the same mastering as the superb reissues produced by Bob Irwin in 2003, utilizing the original master tapes for every song and supposedly using EQ instructions given for the original Lp releases.  So what else is different? Well, the artwork on "2400 Fulton Street" is still better, a nice throwback to the late 60's (I think, I wasn't around then),  and it has 36 tracks to "The Essential"'s 32, adding a few interesting choices like 'Triad' and some early Levi's commercial 'jingles' recorded by the band. However, the sound on "2400 Fulton Street" is subpar in comparison, and the shuffled order on "2400 Fulton Street" doesn't work that well.  The only reason for buying "2400 Fulton Street" is the price - as of this writing, there's a ton of used copies ranging from $5 to $10 being sold right here. If you're on a budget, I'd pick up one of those used copies, but if you've got a little more money to spend or prefer a better introduction to the band, get the "The Essential Jefferson Airplane. 
 Balzac is at his best in this very witty tale about a devious old maid who schemes against her family in nineteenth-century France.  It's so much fun to watch the contemptible Bette manipulate everyone around her, and to follow her pathetic and ill-placed obsession for a certain young Polish character who marries her young, beautiful cousin.    Everything fun is in this book-courtesans, lecherous old men, unfaithful young lovers, and of course, the virtuous, who get treated terribly and die abandoned and alone.  Wretched Bette dies loved and valued.  You will have a lot of fun reading this book and enjoying-and getting disgusted with-all the characters 
 It's odd to give about the same number of stars to a little self-help book as to Anna Karenina, but for it's genre it's pretty good. It's probably 3.5 stars, but I rounded up.  The book is short, and as it suggests, it gives several ideas for simple things one can do that may have pay off in out of proportional ways. Some you have heard forever, and some are new, or at least stated in a new enough way to seem fresh. An example that sparked me was the advice to observe your thoughts as you would a movie- in a detached way that causes one to desensitize to the negative ones and see them lose power. Very little background is give (or probably required) as to cognitive reasons for how or why this works.   Much of the advice seems to come under the Zen notion that "desire is suffering", and some is a restatement of kharma or the golden rule, but regardless of their source, they have been hammered by the author into practical chicken soup advice.   Is is worth the read? Is it worth 15 dollars? If it helps you, and it may, to make a much needed attitude shift or deal with a blind spot in your life, then clearly the answer is yes. I would say for me personally it was worth the read based on one or two chapters, but I'm sure the rest of the book didn't hurt me any. 
 The Frenchies pulled this movie off fantastically!  This is about two French boys studying in a Catholic School,  who are in love with each other.  Im smittened by how the story adds so much character of wholeness, innocence, and bitter sweet love into these two boys (one about 15, the other about 10) to the point I didnt cringe at seeing them kiss.  And I also rooted for their love.  But alas, love so divine will be asundered, by the Abbot.  And he is bent on throwing the older boy out of  the picture, out the school. Under the pretense and (his unbelievable) denial, he claims his motives for the younger boy is out of altruism.  No, here's the twisted part, he is lusting after the boy.  Eeeew.  When the Abbot rids of the older boy, he is smug as a pug.  But only for the Superior to pull a fast one on him.  This movie goes beyond 88 minutes, as the box says.  The last 15 minutes is a didactic conversation between the Abbot and the Superior.  Therein lies the moral.  I really wanted this movie to have a happily-ever-after-end, or my definition of it.  This movie reminds me of "My Life as a Dog".  Yes, the Sverige version.    Enjoy the flavour of this movie.     
 A must read!  One of the best books I have read for a while.  The pact captures your heart and soul.  It's one of those books that sticks even after you've finish reading it.  
             I was more than proud of Gwen when she came out with this Cd. I am sure we were all worried when we found out she was leaving No Doubt behind, and whether she could make it on her own without a killer band to back her up. Well no point in worrying because this girl just kept going and showed she could be an even better solo artist then a lead singer of a band.              While her old stuff all had a touch of rock to it, she brought out a pop style that must of been buried in her before. These songs all have a beat and feel to then that simply make you bounce and feel you are some sort of 80's child or like I am listening to another Aqua track. When ever I think of this album, one word always comes to mind "Bubblegum."              The only track I really skip over is Luxurious but the rest are real smashers.  One song that everyone should watch the video of if you want to fully enjoy the song is "Cool", it will truly give the song more life, and when you listen to it on the cd you can't help but act it out. If you are tired of bouncing off your seat to these catchy tunes and feel like mellowing it down here are some songs to skip straight to. Obvious there is "Cool" (don't forget to watch that video), "The Real Thing" which is a sweet ballad, then there is "Serious" which while the beat is not exactly mellow it is a great love song to belt it out to.               If there one cd that can get you out of the feeling down and in the blue you now know which it is. I give this 5 stars and I hope I can do the same for her next cd.    
 Life at work wouldn't be quite the same without this and my shots of Buzzworthy. However, I do find it an expensive way to drink coffee (the pods are expensive here in Trinidad) and so I don't allow myself the luxury of home use. But for the office, with no grains to worry about etc., it's simply the best 
 UNA GRABACI?N SIN PRECEDENTES SOLAMENTE HACE QUE EL OYENTE QUE LA EST? ESCUCHANDO EXPERIMENTE MENTALMENTE Y ANALICE LO QUE YA ELLOS COMO M?SICOS GENIALES CREARON 
 Ok, ok, so I'm adult, but I did not know this CD had an elongated four letter word in one of the songs. Did I miss something in the c.d. description? I don't know perhaps I was more shocked than my 8 year old when the word presented itself. Was relegated to listening to the rest of it in my own company until I knew the coast was clear for sharing it with others 
 This is a must have for any Spider-Man fan.  There are great new scenes that weren't shown in the theatrical version, especially the one with J. Jonah Jameson...GOOD SCENE!  So, if you're skeptical about getting this...trust me, it's worth the $13.  
 This book takes a look inside the always exciting and fast paced culture of FedEx Express from an outsiders point of view.  The book explains the policies that FedEx used to chage the shipping industry and policies that FedEx still uses today. This book is not writtin by a FedEx Express Employee or former employee.  Interesting reading for any FedEx Express Employee or any Person(s) who are in the frieght industry 
 "The End of Faith" by Sam Harris is a book I believe every American should read.  It is a very well written book which clearly describes the contradictions between Religion and Reason in our society.  It also points out how much influence the hypocritical religious right has on our country's government, which is quite frightening, actually.  Hopefully a large number of people will read this book and over time the American people will realize that we have to work towards truly separating Church and State, which was supposed to be one of the founding principles of this great nation.  Great read, very well written, I definitely recommend it to anyone.. 
 Great compilation. Consists of many songs that you won't find on every other compilation. 
 If the anime series "Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex" and/or the Orson Scott Card novel "Speaker for the Dead" appeal to you then I believe you will love this novel. The former because this book talks at you a LOT about its ideas, which are wonderful, but the action is somewhat thin, and I can see how this might turn you off. For me, I trust Martin enough that I enjoy seeing where his ideas take you, but there is a great deal of trust needed and I can see how this book was ignored when it first came out. This is especially true for the prologue, which I would almost recommend skipping and coming back to later after you care more about the world he describes.  The latter comparison ("Speaker") is fitting to me as this book is anthropological in nature. What was the field they invent in "Speaker"? Xenothology? Well, that idea is here also, and it's beautiful and touching. Trying to grasp foreign ideas that are alien to our culture is just one of the themes here which are still very timely and important. I agree that some of the characters are not as fleshed out as, say, Jon Snow, with Dirk standing out as a truly blank slate, but maybe that was the point. It almost reads like a book of philosophy or, as I said before, anthropology, and the ideas being mined are from a genius-storyteller poet 
 That's the first ATL album i listened to and i must say that from this date, I have  listened to rap music differently...now I have all ATL's albums and they are all the best CDs in my collection. TRY IT!! and almost listen to it attentivly.. 
 This movie was good, but as usual the book was far better. I think it showed that her husband had some tendencies towards wanting to dominate his wife, which turned into full-blown abuse under the stresses of losing his job & medical license, and returning to Shiite Iran after decades of living in the United States.  I think the book shows that he wasn't this "dream husband" that suddenly turned into a monster. The warning signs were there all along - for example, she met him when he was her physician and he kissed her right on the treatment table - obviously, an inappropriate action.  What was amazing to me is that OTHER AMERICANS in Iran did little to help Betty, saying she needed to submit, what's the problem? etc, while it was the IRANIANS who understood Moody's family history & reached out to help her in a real way - helping her use the phone, finding ways for her to escape the dangerous oppression of her husband, and ultimately smuggling her out of the country.   The movie seems a little overblown, because, well, it's a movie...they dramatize things. I recommend reading the book, too, which is Betty's true story 
 Both fascinating and enlightening, this book should be read by everyone as food for thought, if nothing else. It's a shame Robert Ingersoll's words of wisdom aren't more widely known. I'm glad we at least have this collection 
 This is a timely book published just before the 40th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs. It's a great way to learn about what really happened from the first-hand accounts of the Cuban revolutionaries who defeated the US-backed invasion. If you've never read a speech by Fidel Castro, there are a couple of very good ones in this book. You'll not only learn about what happened at the Bay of Pigs, but you'll also learn why the Cuban people smashed this invasion so swiftly and decisively. Another great part of the book is the testimony of Jose Ramon Fernandez who commanded troops in the thick of the fighting. There are maps, charts, all the details of the battle. But it's not a dry or boring account. He tells what happened from a very human and personal point of view, revealing his own mistakes and weaknesses, and recounting some humorous episodes as well. Finally, the foreword of the book tells a fascinating story of how a group of young people at Carleton College organized support for the Cuban revolution and against the US invasion and what they learned about politics. I think you'll be surprised as you read the book about how relevant this forty-year-old event is today 
 When reviewing a book like this, I don't expect the author to fool me into thinking that it is Jane Austen.  I just want it to me readable and not a travesty.   Readers should be aware that this is not a true sequel, in the sense that Elizabeth and Darcy become secondary characters and Georgiana Darcy is the main focus.   Readers should be aware that the author "plays it safe" in plotting by shuffling elements from P&P, Jane Austen's life and other works.   I know that some people find this annoying, and it leads to some unfortunate plot choices and lapses in characterization.  The actions and reactions of Mrs. Hurst & Caroline Bingley in Chapter 36?  I don't think so.  I've only read a couple of other attempted sequels to P&P, but I think that this is much better than Emma Tennent both for attempting to maintain the style of writing and the integrity of the characters.  Occasionally, I found a sentence that was so convoluted I don't think that I could have made word by word sense of it, but for the most part, Barrett has captured the very formal prose that somehow results in a light and sparkling story and the sense of irony.  I have one problem with it, and that is in the relationship of Georgiana Darcy and and her brother's "improver" James Leigh-Cooper.   The latter is supposed to be a man of an unspecified modest background who has a positive genius as an architect/landscape designer.  He is touchy about, but doesn't apologize for his origins.  He and Georgiana are supposed to have an often combative relationship in the beginning, but it simply isn't done convincingly.  It is difficult to understand why Georgiana, who has never been portrayed as particularly snobbish, flies into pets over his rather low-key "insolence" to provoking people, particularly just before she asks a question that assumes that he is a member of the gentry.  The only time that I think she is understandably annoyed is when he goes ballastic over a banal inquiry about his possible relatives.   I am no expert, but I thought that English people usually hyphenated their names to acknowledge/qualify for a substantial inheritance, like Jane Austen's older brother who became James Austen-Leigh.  One would therefore suppose that Leigh-Cooper would be either of the gentry, or at least, like the Bingleys, of the wealthy middle-class.  Still, I enjoyed the book and it certainly beats most of the JA imitators that I have read 
 I'm always afraid of sounding like a grumpy old man when I say they just don't make cartoons like when I was a kid.  Actually, the cartoons made when I was a kid were pretty lousy.  The ones I enjoyed were already twenty or more years old even in my elementary school years; I would be exposed to them only through repeats, primarily in the Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show.  While there are certainly plenty of decent cartoons nowadays, there is something special about the Looney Tunes that have made them last through the ages.  The four disc Volume 2 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection provides sixty or so examples of this immortal animation.  The first disc features Bugs Bunny in various adventures and misadventures.  Bugs is the singlemost iconic figure in the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies pantheon, and these are all good to great cartoons.  Bugs contends with his usual adversaries of Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam as well as witches, Dr. Jekyll, French chefs and a number of other one-time adversaries.  Although entertaining, to me, I still think the best discs in the set are still to follow.  Disc two features the Road Runner.  Actually, the principal character is that hard-luck scavenger, Wile E. Coyote.  Because the story is pretty much the same in all these cartoons, they tend to blend together, so it's hard to remember if a certain gag occurred in Beep Beep or in Ready Set Zoom, but that's okay.  This is fun stuff.  The commentary tracks advise us of some of the "rules" of these films, especially that the Road Runner should never leave the road and Wile E. Coyote should always be done in by his own actions (the Road Runner doesn't do anything more than occasionally startle his adversary).  And on this disc, the Road Runner cartoons are only the start; we also get some wonderful films featuring less frequently used characters:  Cheese Chasers and Mouse Wreckers invert some of the usual cat and mouse gags by featuring the persecuted Claude the Cat, who would rather be left alone than deal with a pair of mice out to drive him crazy.  The Dover Boys is also a gem that features some one-shot characters in a story that has its own unique look and feel; in fact, it was "too" unique and not very well-received by some of the Warner Brothers higher-ups.  Disc three features Sylvester and Tweety.  I've never been much of a fan of the Sylvester and Tweety cartoon, and while these cartoons aren't bad, the best ones on this disc actually feature other characters and are primarily directed by the wacky Bob Clampett.  The Great Piggy Bank Robbery has Daffy Duck dreaming of being Duck Twacy; Baby Bottleneck has Daffy and Porky Pig contending with distributing babies during a stork shortage; Duck Soup to Nuts spotlights the "classic" Daffy who is borderline insane as opposed to the angry, ambitious later version; and Porky in Wackyland is utterly bizarre and delightful.  This disc also has the unusual Old Glory, a serious Porky Pig cartoon that provides a patriotic six minute history of the United States.  The final disc features celebrity parodies and music.  While some of these cartoons are merely decent with a greater emphasis on music than humor, there are also some real great ones here:  Rhapsody Rabbit, Show Biz Bugs and Stage Door Cartoon are all standouts, and You Ought To Be In Pictures is a great mix of live action and animation.  The two all-time classics, however are One Froggy Evening and What's Opera, Doc?  One Froggy Evening is a little morality play about a greedy man who finds a frog that performs elaborate song-and-dance numbers, but only when no one (besides the man) is watching.  It's doubtful that any other character other than that frog has been able to achieve such fame based on so little screen time (only seven or so minutes).  What's Opera, Doc? is considered by some to be the best cartoon EVER.  It is the perfect blend of a so-called high art  (opera) and low art (cartoons).  All these cartoons, plus a lot of special features such as commentaries and rare footage, make this an exceptional package.  It would be hyperbole to say every one of these cartoons is great, but most of them are:  on individual merit, I'd say they are roughly 50% five-star, 40% four-star and 10% three-star material.  Overall, this is easily a five-star package.  There may be good and great cartoons nowadays, but these cartoons (generally fifty to seventy years old) still need to be seen. 
 The most skillful and creative photographer=the most successful studio photographer(financially)? Wrong.  This is THE book everyone who wants his/her own studio should read.  Lilley tells how to operate a studio right.  No hold back.  Not at all.  He tells you every aspect you'll run into and what you should do.     English is my second language, and I read this book everyday and it's so interesting to read. I wish I could just use all my time to read it up and get my studio going!!  If you don't have lot of time, then read this book.  It's truely a masterpiece. I've never felt the money I spent on a book is so worthy 
 This book was my assigned text in medical school.  This book goes over all the squamous epithelial cells you can think of.  It has interesting information that is easier to learn then other subjects.  Histology is definitely one of my favorite courses in med school.  This book is written on a high level.  Yes, it requires some comprehension.  However, without this book, I would have failed my histology class.  From advice of one of the previous reviewers, I also bought, "Histology Study Guide", isbn 0971999686.  This study guide was definitely very helpful for test preparation. It gets right to the point. 
 Ruth Cowan attempts to show how technology has developed since the colonial days through the present trends of biotechnology. This is a daunting task and it is pulled off as well as can be expected. There is a lot of information to be found here but a great deal more is missing.  This book is still the best general overview on the history of technology and while more can be done this is a good start.  If you want to understand how technology shaped our society you can't go wrong with this book.    The early chapters on the colonial economy are very well done and tightly analyzed. After that it starts to spread apart a little and the technology jumps around.  The transportation revolution chapter is one of the more disappointing for me. While she does a decent job on the railroads she completely misses the significance of the canals on the early development in America.  Her chapters on innovation and technological systems provide nice summaries of the relevant literature.  Most of the chapters leading up to the twentieth century are filler that really don't address too many technological issues. The automobile chapter tries to do an amazingly quick history of cars and a lot gets left out in the process with even more wrong.  The communications chapter does a better job of showing the evolution while looking at the technologies. The history of the military-academic-industrial complex provides an interesting look at how the Manhattan Project and NASA changed the way technology was developed. Cowan does a very good job on this particular topic and it is probably her best chapter in the later part of the book.  The final chapter is on biotechnology and covers genetic corn, birth control and penicillin.  These advancements while important are not really given justice.    
 This was my first Nora Roberts book and it will not be my last.  I could not put this book down.  Her writing style allows the reader to hear and visualize the characters.  I will recommend this book to everyone 
 It's amazing again, how DS places herself & the reader in the shoes of a man.  (Most of us readers of DS are women) It's great.  This is a tear-jerker too.  But it is one of those stories that when you are finished, you feel like you've really been somewhere, seen something, learned, experienced.  Her books do that.  She's a great writer 
 This CD is exactly what I have expected when ordering it. To listen to ENYA driving alone on a lonesome road is really a joy and an experience. Absolutely satisfied 
 30 years ago I participated in the Grape Cure diet with a friend who had lymph cancer. After the removal of a lymph tumor, he developed cigar size tumors in the lymph glands under the arms and at the groin line. They completely disappeared after following the Grape Cure fast! Unfortunately my friend was not willing to stay on a raw foods diet, as indicated by the author, and within a year he was dead. I have never forgotten this book, and I was really please to see it was still available though written in 1920. It may not work for everyone, but if I had cancer, I would definately choose grapes over death. If you at all subscribe to "you are what you eat" then you will see the simple logic in purifying this way 
 The definition of entangle is to write or knit together confusedly.  This rather describes the progress of the characters in Barbara Pym's THE SWEET DOVE DIED.    Humphrey Boyce has an antiques shop.  James, his orphaned newphew, commences to work at the shop after finishing at Oxford.  At an auction they meet Leonora Eyre.  Later Humphrey plans to have lunch with Leonora who is in her fifties.  This is a novel of manners and amusement.  Leonora, whose dinner with a friend and two very young men is described as being disappointing, regrets that James is not present, too.  She finagles the interactions with Humphrey to go back to the shop to see James and accepts a ride with James because conveniently he is going in the direction of her house.  James is too young to assume that a woman living alone is to be pitied.    For Christmas Leonora receives a paperweight from Humphrey and a card from James.  She puts James's card near her bedside table.  After Christmas Leonora's new social life with Humphrey and James picks up again.  When the shop is the subject of a burglary Leonora sends flowers.  Through various machinations she actually sends James's young woman friend to Majorca, but she cannot best a male friend Ned who, for a time, captures James's attention.    I am certain Barbara Pym has been compared to Jane Austen many times.  Clearly the thrust of their works differ.  Barbara Pym is not concerned with setting up a young person for life in some sort of matrimonial arrangement.  Nevertheless, the means used, the comedy, the irony, the light touch and excellent writing are similar.  "A sweet dove died" comes from a Keats poem.           
 The band's second album is a very good one. It's good to play loud when driving or at the computer (like right now...) The songs itself are great. "Big Eyes," "Downed," "You're All Talk," and "Clock Strikes Ten" show that the band didn't lose their edge despite an almost-too-clean production. Indeed, the liner notes state that "the band has since grumbled about the pristine production." The weakest song on here is "Come On Come On," which was done better on 'Live At Budokan' and as a bonus track demo. I also have to be in the right mood to hear "Oh Caroline." Some people complain about "I Want You To Want Me" on this album and how different it is from the big live hit version. All I can say is that it's different, but in a good way. The honky-tonk piano part makes it sound like it came straight from Vaudeville. As for love ballads, they're kinda nonexistent this time around, which is a shame. The album clocks in at just around 30 minutes, so there's no real bad song on the album. Did I mention "Southern Girls" and "So Good To See You" are excellent songs? The bonus tracks are neat too: "Oh Boy" is a good song, but I personally think that a vocalized version could have been included. The demos ("Southern Girls" and "Come On Come On") show how the album would have sounded sans the super-clean production job. (Tom Werman mustn't have been to bad-he went on to do the next two albums!) The live version of "You're All Talk" is a bit of a throwaway, and the live version on 'Sex America Cheap Trick' is a lot better. That song was meant to go fast. And the live version of "Goodnight Now" is better than the one on 'Budokan.' It's a great album, just be sure to get it before you get 'Heaven Tonight' or 'Dream Police' or their debut. This album really can't compete with those three. All in all though it's just fun harmless rock, and that's all that really matters, right 
 "Peter Cetera" is Cetera's very first solo album, released in 1981, when he was still a member of Chicago. While he is known for writing and singing many ballads, both with Chicago and as a solo artist, this album shows that Cetera can flat out rock when he wants to, especially with the first cut on the CD, "Livin' in the Limelight," which is the best rocker on the album. It features a heavy bass sound from Cetera, with Toto's Steve Lukather providing great lead guitar work.  There are several other good cuts on the CD, including "Holy Moly," "Mona, Mona," "On the Line" and "Ivy Colored Walls."  Cetera has often noted that the Beatles were a big influence for him artistically, and you can hear that in this CD as well.  All in all, a very good first effort, and one that was overlooked when it was first released more than 20 years ago. 
 Great sense of timing and humor.  This was the first book of his I've read but I can't wait to buy the rest of his works.  Keeps me up late at night giggling 
 yes, i believe that this is BR's pinnacle. they were at their top game here. the album starts awesome, but kind of drops off near the last few songs....the closer "walk away" is amazing though! i think that suffer and no control beat this one, but being 3rd or 4th isnt bad. i believe that the only album to come close to the holy trinity is "stranger than fiction." i recommend this to all punk rock fans. BR was on a roll, but sadly this was the last truly amazing thing they made until stranger than fiction.  process and beleif and empire strikes first are also noteworthy 
 I must say I am appalled at the negative feedback on this book, and can only deduce that these reviews are written by those of whom this book speaks!  Granted not ALL people of any ethnic race or population are bad, Dennis is simply exposing a behind the scenes multi-billion dollar business that just so happens to be run by the Gypsy culture. The stories in here are true and not fabrications. I have had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Marlock and listening to him speak. He is a very knowledgeable individual who has certainly done his homework and knows exactly what he is talking about. I highly doubt Mr. Marlock is making millions on this, it seems to be his passion, his life's work to get the word out there so less innocent people fall victim to such cruel crimes. The honest people work hard for their money legitimately, and no one should be allowed to just take it away. To all the scam artists out there, spend less time writing bad reviews and go get an education and a real job! Dennis, continue the great work! You are doing society a favor by showing us what we might not see on our own 
 The DB9M dongle is well built and does it's single task well. The added extender cable is also a nice bonus. This device allows for a male RS-232 (COM*) cable to be attached to a USB port. While the adapter is a female connector, it oddly has screw rods as if it were a male. This in no way affects the connectivity, but simply prevents some devices from being attached with their own screw rods (unless they are very long).  The included drivers are on a 80mm miniCD, so most slot-loading drives will not be able to use them. Using a tray-loading drive and copying the needed materials was no problem for me, though. Drivers for most any version of Windows as well as OSX are included. I was able to connect my Garmin Forerunner 201 GPS unit via Serial cable to my Intel iMac without any trouble using this device 
 As with all of Mr. Herriots books this surpassed any expectation I could have. His breezy writing style and the fine watercolors made the stories into a moving slide show. Ten Cat tales that most animal lovers will devour. How many of us can relate to Ginny and Olly? The two feisty ferals who refused to accept an indoor life. Have'nt we all at some point in our cat loving lives known an Emily? The story of Buster hit home for me the most. My Calico Noel arrived on my doorstep on Christmas day, like Buster. For ten years she was the love of my life. These stories will make the reader sigh, for those we have lost, and smile for the feline loved ones we still have 
 There are four sound reasons for considering these Acorn Textured Moc Slippers:        1) They are reasonably priced.      2) They are among the most comfortable slippers I've ever worn.      3) These slippers have a lot of "give" to the material, so they'll            accommodate a variety of foot widths.      4) The basic checkered design is casually stylish.  Above all, I doubt that you'll find a more comfortable slipper for the price.  
 First, the downsides: Brock's book is lengthy, dense, and involves a huge cast of characters which is sometimes difficult to keep straight.   Aside from this, his book is brilliant--a gripping and horrifying read, meticulously researched (unlike, say, Ann Coulter's screeds), and an excellent reference resource.   Brock's site, Mediamatters.org, is a bastion of journalistic integrity; this book goes a step futher, putting neocon hogwash into historical perspective.   For anyone who still believes the "liberal media" lie, this book will act as a harsh antiseptic.  A hell of a good read 
    I am both baffled and bemused by the negative reviews of Ms Jordan's exquisite childhood memoir. The book is charming, poignant, insightful and inspiring.    One reviewer says he read the book, but I believe he did not. Another admits she did not read it at all -- then why post a review?  For anyone who truly believes (and feels) Jesus to be an approachable Being, a caring and compassionate Presence in the universe, THE BIRTH CALLED DEATH is a gem of faith and hope.    I've read the book four times, passed it around to a dozen people, and I cannot wait to hear more of Kathie's adventures on "the other side of life". I do hope that she is there when I cross over -- I would love to share some spiritual tea!  
 I read this book for a course on American Cults, and found it very informative.  The author speaks solely from her own experiences, and gives good advice for dealing with and helping people in cults.  At times, I think she includes too much of her own opinion, but then I realize that one of the purposes for the book is to share how she dealt with cult life and post-cult life.  I hope her experiences have helped others deal with and overcome similar situations 
 Having boated from the Beaverhead and Jefferson tributaries of the Missouri River and then all the way down past St. Louis in 2003 and 2004 at approximately the same time of year as David Miller did, I can verify that not only has David told it the way it was, his strategies for paddling the "Missou Lady" in the future, are as good as it gets.  When meeting in 2003, as the only guests at an out-of-the-way state campground in South Dakota, we exchanged notes and thoughts as considerate adventurers do.  In 2004, I knew through a mutual and now belated friend,that David was a week or so ahead of me, below the headwaters.We didn't meet, but later went over detail in a way that only two people sharing the same experience can do.  Of extreme importance to anyone considering a venture such as paddling the Missouri, are the threads in David's words of planning/scouting ahead, using local knowledge to revise/improve one's plan, and executing with discretion, a cool head, and a quick, sure hand.   His consistent emphasis on those things most important to a paddler is a crucial key for any would-be adventurer. I saw a great number of paddlers who would have benefited greatly from his sage advice and suffered the consequences of not having had it. The difference was that between a challenging, but enjoyable outing and a disaster.   The succinct and varied references to the Lewis and Clark expedition information data base will enrich the reader's experience greatly, if time is taken to skim them, at least, lightly before and then fully, during the trip.  Lastly, David's approach of safety considerations first and letting discretion, be the better part of valor, is right on target, since a lot of the time, only you are going to get yourself out of trouble when paddling the remote parts of the Missouri River.  Hat's off for a job well done, David.  Good Luck and Steady Winds,  Wayne A. Willkom 
 This book will take you on a journey and as you go deeper into the jungle you fall deeper into the dept of mans corruptibility.  This book is brutal and honest.  Marlow is the type of good man that does nothing and his goal is the type of man that has fallen from everything.  Marlow ends up seeing the very essence of the darkness of men.  You realize that he too could be corrupted just as easily by this evil that has stolen his targets soul. I too felt that I could be corrupted by the same evil if I was in their place.  That is the scariest thing of all.   I felt disgustingly empowered by this book and by the end I had chills down my spine at the absurdity of that perceived power and the great cost it took on all the innocents around it.  
 Finally Universal has listened to the fans of this show and provided us with single sided discs for this season. After the nightmare of the season 2 box set, wherein a few episodes would stop/freeze or simply not play at all (see the Amazon reviews), they finally rectified the error of their ways. The only puzzling thing is that Universal still decided to keep the bulky snap cases instead of the slim cases for the set, which does take up a lot of room on your DVD shelf. Now if only they would re-release the first 3 sets as single discs we could all be happy that a beloved TV show is finally getting the proper DVD treatment.   
  A classic read Michener at his best. Great history, believable and engaging characters. A recommended read.  
 This is an usual book compared to many of the others I have read recently but I like it. It contains many beautiful pictures of aquarium setups with step by step directions on producing the finished product. The various aquariums are representative of different habitats all over the world. It is a joy to look through even though you may not be creating a new aquarium 
 The remastering is excellent, the bonus tracks essential. Probably the second to last great Cheap Trick album (1997's CHEAP TRICK being the last.) Trade in your old copy and get this one today 
 This book gives a good historical account of the Riemann Hypothesis.  The book is not too technical and is filled with historical notes which are in themselves fascinating.  I also found the relation of quantum physics (energy level distribution of certain nuclei) to the Riemann Hypothesis (distribution of the Zeta function zeroes along the imaginary axis w/Re(1/2)) very interesting.  The mention of elliptic curves as the basis of a data encryption algorithm was also of interest.  In short, this book has succeeded in peaking my curiosity on a variety of mathematical subjects.  I'm only giving it 4 stars since I would have liked a more technical treatment of the subject 
 if you take all of the best songs from the the albums before and after cricklewood they would not come close to being as good as this album 
 Rabbi Dr. Asher Meir, economist and ethicist, presents The Jewish Ethicist: Everyday Ethics For Business And Life, a practical guide to morality and ethics in an increasingly complex modern world. Presented largely in a question-and-answer format, The Jewish Ethicist offers frank advice to such conundrums as "Is it ethical to buy from low-wage suppliers?", "Can I be frank in a letter of reference?", and "Are Commercial Dating and Matchmaking Services Ethical?" Rabbi Meir addresses each question in depth, discussing varying circumstances under which the given situation could take place, and explaining the rationale behind judgments of modern day morality and ethics. The Jewish Ethicist scrupulously avoids oversimplification of diverse complex dilemmas ("principles do not exist in a vacuum", Meir comments), while at the same time presenting Meir's wisdom in direct terms. Though The Jewish Ethicist scrutinizes modern morality from a distinctly Jewish perspective, its discussion and justifications reach well beyond scriptural law into the matter-of-fact realm of practical morality - actions can and are characterized as unethical not just because a holy text says so, but because they promote unhappiness, self-aggrandizement at the expense of others, or worse. Highly recommended for readers of all faiths. 
 Despite good song selections overall, I still can't give this a 5 star rating because they persist in slapping songs on there that aren't from the disco era, although in this case they keep it to just one: Irene Cara's "Flashdance (What a Feeling)". My only other quibbles are that the version of "I Will Survive" is a remix here...as is a megamix version of some other Gaynor hits tacked on as a bonus. Without these shenanigans, the series would truly nail down what kept the platform shoes shuffling in the 1970s.  The song selection here is stronger than on Disc One, making this the best choice if you're only buying one in the series. But if you really love this, you'll probably want both of them. Disc 3 is more hit and miss and probably only for diehards.  4 1/2 star 
 Jasco is the best bass player ever. come on over has sam and dave ov vocals. all the songs are amazing. it is so hard to say how good it is. he is the master of the bass. he does stuff only people dream of. this cd is a perfect 10. if you like fusion jazz or the bass go buy this.  i would say this is one of the best jazz cds ever. jaco went before his time.

  A gorgeous swashbuckler film in technicolor. Splendid sets, beautiful scenery. Technically perfect. The cast is excellent. Granger fits his role perfectly. The story is not so well developed, a little loose and childish. Makes a wonderful film for the young ones: It has enough action, duels, comedy and romance to keep their attention.  However, one would have wished they had thought more on the adults too 
 Scores, which can be compared to being the middle child of the movie making machine due to the fact that they are sandwiched in between the movie itself and the soundtrack with the commercially viable (i.e. money making songs), are an underappreciated art form which thankfully Baz Luhrmann and Nellee Hooper helped to show that this need no longer need be the case which has resulted in at least the release of two outstanding scores from contemporary movies: The Matrix Reloaded and Fight Club. While Star Wars wills always be the score that all others will be measured up to, the genius of Baz and Nellee will help to change the face of this. Helped by the fact that even if one did not see this version of the film, since most know the story, one can follow all the twists and turns in the plot solely by listening to this CD. How they have changed the face of scores forever is by incorporating different musical generals (hip hop #3, pop #10, rock #13, and techno #21) which given the scene we heard them in in the film, not only are appropriate, but adds another dimension to the film which draws you in even more. What is even more remarkable is that this was produced in 1996, prior to the rap/rock mixture and before it looked like techno was poised to become the next big thing. Genius is not only doing something very well, genius is also doing something that has very rarely been done before; and Luhrman and Hooper showed with volume 2 that the term genius could be applied to them. 
 This was my first raw foods recipe book ever purchased.  I looked at SO many and decided on this one due to the easy layout, easy to follow recipes and a nice small variety of each category.  Not, it's not the only raw recipe book you'll ever need but it makes a nice gift to someone who's new to the raw foods life (as I did for a friend). What I also really enjoy about it is that Kate Wood inserts little 'tips' and 'ideas' on each page about all kinds of random cool things, facts, projects.  For example, she suggested saving avocado seeds and making your own house-plant!  I never would have thought of that.  I now have 3 and one is already 1 1/2 feet tall and very pretty - burgundy stem and pretty green leaves.  In about 10 years, I may have avocados!  :-] What I didn't care for in this book was that she has a section in the back that is 'not so raw' - meaning it is cooked!  But, I'm the one that still bought the book, knowing that, and I'm still glad I did. I make the applejack bars weekly (and many non-raw co-workers love tehm) and there are several really good dip/dressing recipes.  They're good to use as a base and then you can add/change as you want and build from her foundation.  I have a little kitchen scale and the measurements being in ounces is actually kinda fun, not a bother at all. Good book - thanks Kate

 Get Real is a story of young love and accepting who you are. Steve (Ben Silverstone)is gay and comfortable with it, even though he is only out to his neighbor, Linda (Charlotte Brittain). Because he is afraid that the boys at school will abuse him even more if they know he's gay, Steve's relationships consist of one-night stands with guys he meets in the park. This is how he meets the local big-man-on-campus, John (Brad Gorton). This film portrays high school 'society' very realistically and the interactions between the characters is very genuine. Get Real includes the awkward silences, the social fumblings, the excitement of a first love, and the heartbreak that everyone, gay or straight, went through in high school. All of the actors deserve high marks for their performances, especially Silverstone and Gorton. The scenes after the dance and after the awards ceremony are so honest and raw that they break my heart every time. Their frank portrayals are what make this unassuming little film one that everyone needs in their collection 
 . . . for everyone. Including you, Mr. President 
   Though a slow starter like most MCS books I found it a fascinating study on Japan.        Do to the magic of the International Date Line Pearl Harbor was attacked 12/8 Tokyo time. So 12/6 was 2 days before Pearl to Harry Niles.     
 'Single white female' is about two young ladies sharing a New York apartment. There only is a slight problem: one of them is obsessed. Starting as a normal movie, the increasing tension changes 'Single white female' into a thriller.   This unusual change of tune makes 'Single white female' special. Keeping you on your seat during its entire length, its pronounced New York flavor adds an extra attraction 
 Break no bones is a fast paced exciting novel that will keep you up at night to finish it! Murder, greed, love, relationships - it has it all!   Forensic descriptions are very graphic, so not for the squeemish but you will gain knowledge of this field from a true professional - Kathy Reichs 
 Sara Rath really gets deep and into her writing in this book. I enjoyed every bit about it. I thought i knew just about every thing there was to  know about them being as though i was raised around them my whole life. I  would recommend this book to anyon 
 The recipes are easy to follow, although they require ingredients I wouldn't normally have around the house. That was the only difficult part. Then again, no one said being healthy was easy. I reccommend this to anyone who wants to eat healthy and doesn't mind working a little for it 
 The book is very informative and offers readers a great in sight into  Lebanon and what you can and can't do. If you follow the book you will  visit all attractions of Lebanon, which is truly a beautiful country. They  missed out on a resturant in Wadi Quanuobine, which I highly recommend  called Abou Joseph, a fish resturant in the bottom of the valley, the  scenery on the way there is breath taking. All in all a great publication  and a great country 
 I have loved this movie as far back as watching it with my best friend at his house in my neighboorhood, and cherishing every heart-felt moment in it. This movie made up a large part of who i am today and every second on screen makes me feel ten different beautiful moments of life breathe in through my lungs and outward into the sunshine rainbow school-house rock wonder.   In fact, I told my friend watching it, that this little boy who finds the neverending story is going to kill everybody in his school, and that he hides out in the attic of the school before he does it, and the book he reads "the neverending story" is an outward manifestation of the inner fantasy land his mind created, to cause him to commit these murders. It was funny and he really believed me.   Choose your own adventure 
 I read the Earthsea Trilogy as an adolescent. I remember loving it, although the experience was, even then, very different for me. I was a fan of C.S. Lewis, Tolkein, Lloyd Alexander. But Leguin felt really differrent. Part of this was that the novel was more intellectual in focus, more about what lies at the heart of her characters and less about overt action, heroics. I remembering being surprised that the plot moved so quickly away from the obvious. In this novel the hero, Ged, very early on makes terrible mistakes. Instead of being brave and untarnished, he's afraid and for some time runs away from the evil he's unleashed. This is not obvious fantasy fare. It doesn't fit the formula, and for that I loved it. Adolescence was, for me, a time of much uncertainty and doubt and sometimes outright fear. I really connected with Ged and appreciated being able to read about a troubled, damaged hero who wasn't always perfect. Also, I did note that LeGuin is careful to describe her character's racial diversity. This is a world of brown and black people, with a few paler ones living at the margins of society. I think people often miss this, but I didn't then.  And I didn't when I reread it recently. All the things I admired in the first place are still there on the page. That cultural diversity is still a part of it, although LeGuin may have been a little too subtle - as many people don't seem to notice this at all - including the filmakers adapting her work. Another thing I noticed now, though, that I didn't when I was younger, is how solid the craft of LeGuin's writing is. Sentence by sentence, description by description, dialogue by dialogue: she's a very good writer. She lean and economical and moves her story forward like a fine craftsperson.  This is a wonderful novel of a wonderful series. I've got quite a bit to do these days in my adult life, but it's quite a pleasure to know that at some point in the next few months I'll be able to pick up the next in the series and carry on a little ways. I look forward to it 
 Even if you aren't someone who loves the sea and its creatures, you have to love the main character for loving them. It's that contageous, and it is what gives this book its charm. It is superbly written, with depth and humor (recalling the sexually obsessed teen years). It is not a book I would ordinanrily pick, but it was recommended. I surprised myself and really enjoyed it 
 Are you ready to become a "home gamer."  Are you seriously looking to improve your current results in the stock market?   Do you have a moderate level of knowledge about the stock market and our economic system?  Are you equally concerned with preserving your capital while earning a better-than-average return?  Do you prefer a system that incorporates probability and statistics as a tool to assess risk?  Are you a believer in using fundamental analysis AND technical analysis in choosing growth stocks as your preferred investment?  Do you have adequate time and interest to devote to actively managing your portfolio?  If your answers to these questions (especially the final one) are "yes" then buying this classic might be the best 10 bucks you ever spent.  This little gem is chock-full of information and practical advice garnered over 50 years of investment experience, coupled with an acute observation of human nature at work in the market 
 According to author Robert Blair Kaiser, some popes believed the Church belonged to the people; some believed it belonged to God, and many more believed the Church belonged to them.  Today's Roman Catholic Church has changed considerably since the birth of what would be Christianity in the decades following the death of Jesus.  Kaiser gives the reader a breezy but informative overview of some of the more defining changes that took place -in thought, dogma, civic and political involvement, and so forth- and how those changes shaped and defined the Church of today, at least as it is viewed by the Roman Curia, several popes, and non-Catholics.  He also dwells some time on the influential personalities involved in Vatican II, and how those people envisioned not only themselves, their roles and their times, but also considered the future -not only the future of the Church but of Catholics everywhere and indeed, the world itself.  And there is little doubt the participants at Vatican II have had a significant impact on the Church if not recent world history.  Whatever one thinks of Kaiser's observations and conclusions, it is fairly certain that this particular look at the Roman Catholic Church in the early 21st century is one not often afforded or encouraged among Catholic Christians, and depending on one's bias it is easy to see why: The author is a clear partisan, but refreshingly lucid, fluid and engaging in his prose and, perhaps best of all, filled with hope.  He is watchful, yes, but also hopeful.  Through the varied lenses of six different Catholic prelates from America to Indonesia, readers are treated to surprisingly frank and intimate perceptions of the Church, the laity, ritual, tradition; the role of the Church in matters of social justice and politics; the role of women in the Church, and exactly what these issues mean to, and how they are interpreted by six influential men from Honduras, the United States, Indonesia, England, Nigeria -and Germany.  The candor and insight and even what some may regard as sassiness from these cardinals is bubbling, bracing, provocative, and really quite generous: Inasmuch as Kaiser has given readers this book to consider, these men have generously shared with the author -and the reader- their thoughts and feelings about the most pressing issues on their hearts and minds, offering page-turning commentary about their respective communities and cultures; their relationship with people; their visions of local and global issues as well as with Rome and what, in their opinions, will help continue to grow, heal and further unite the Church during this century.  Robert Blair Kaiser, seen by some as a muckraker spoiling for a schism is, in this reader's opinion, simply offering points of view that are not generally considered or discussed in the open -at least not by Catholics- and whatever one's opinion or vision of the Roman Catholic Church or Pope Benedict XVI, this book is in itself a reason for hope, for celebration of what it means to -as Kaiser puts it- "be Church," truly Catholic, genuinely catholic, purely human and humane in sometimes troubling and remarkable world.  Kaiser's main assertion is that in order to remain whole in the years to come, the Church must conceive of itself and act not as a noun but as an illuminated verb.  After reading this book not only did I feel more hopeful and thoughtful than I had for some time, but I was also smiling 
 Have been following the recommendations on skin care for 6 months and my face looks better than it did 20 years ago.  No longer look pale and old but  pink and fresh. Recommended treatment is inexpensive and takes very  little time. Book is well worth purchasing 
 This book will not appeal to those who think that one's own surroundings offer no advantages. I agree there are some places so remote or lacking in oppritunity that to not relocate  is rather a apathetic approach to life. Yet Mr. Conwell is trying to encourage the citizens of a huge city of Philadelphia that money can be made there just as easy as any other big city. I will not reveal how he suggests this can happen but I agree with Mr. Conwell's approach and logic. Helping people meet their goals will have a good effect on your ability to meet your goals.  However, I feel that only works if you are dealing with good people.  Ethical imbeciles don't play fair and have fun doing it. If one has the chance to meet and deal with decent people, or you encourage that side of them, then Acres of Diamonds is enchanting. I was enchanted. 
 This is the sort of movie you watch with a smirk on your face.  There is  humor, but it's under the surface, and laughter comes only with the bleakest of insights.  This is a world where everything good is soiled or misunderstood, no matter how obsessive compulsively clean we try to be.  Any chance to watch Alec Guinness is a privilege.  He suits his role ideally.  It's definately not a 50s romp though comedy like Some Like It Hot, more of an intelligent satire with base entertainment value... something a little bit more lighthearted than Sunset Boulevard 
 You memorize some obscure passage and then pawn it off as your own work? Just to impress some girls, embarrass my friend? ...you're gonna come up with the fact that there are two certainties in life. 1, don't do that and 2, you dropped a $150,000 on a **** education you couldda got for $1.50 in late charges at the public library. 
 This is a terrific cookbook that anyone who enjoys cooking should own.  More than just recipes, it actually teaches you about Italian cooking (and cooking in general).  The recipes themselves are always excellent; they always work; guests always rave.  In a few months, it has become one of my dearest favorites 
 Nison's "Beyond Candlesticks" one of my top 3 favorite trading books and provides dozens of advanced, practical trading strategies as he reveals the strongest candle patterns.  Probably the most useful part of it, is understanding how much clearer trading signals become, once you see the reasons why specific patterns reveal long/short pressure on stocks as they're moving.     Highly recommend this along with his videos -- I've become a better trader due to learning from Nison's techniques and recommend this as a personal favorite book.  I also refer my traders at Daytrading University to it, as a "must read" to help build trading skills.     Nison has been hired by top Wall Street institutions to train Their market makers and specialists, and getting this rare knowledge in his books and videos is priceless.  Get this one.   Here's how much I like it: I recently moved out of state, and this is one of the few books that "made the cut", that I'll always be keeping with me.   Superb precision trading skills revealed in this one.  It's a keeper.   
 I've been to the musical in England, the CD's gives you a feeling like you are in the theatre 
 Excellent experience with both product and technical support. Highly recommende 
 This is a great cd!  The sounds are cool & jazzy & every song is just terrific.  Personal faves are "Honey-dipped", "Definition of Beautiful" & "View From Above".  Listening to this cd reminds me of sipping a tall, cool glass of iced tea on a hot summer's day. The songs are that new & refreshing. Get this cd today.  
 This book and its predecessor, Bead Fantasies, are two of the most innovative and beautiful beading books I have seen on the market.  There are a lot of books that show basic beaded jewelry and a lot that show bead weaving.  This is the first book I've seen that does something completely different - Samejima takes simple beads, mostly seed beads and crystals, and turns them into lovely flowers, leaves, stars, snowflakes and even a crown.  The results are simply gorgeous, and at first glance, they look impossibly complicated.  But the most wonderful thing about these books are their excellent clear drawings of how to complete each piece.  The text instructions aren't that great, but the drawings are so clear you mostly don't need any further instructions. I cannot recommend this book and the first Bead Fantasies enough!  Bead Fantasies III is coming out this summer and I will get it as soon as it is released 
 I, too, was devastated, when reading this book, to learn of Orson's demise.  After reading Mr. Katz's previous books about his dogs, I did not realize that Orson had this big of a problem.  It worried me, because I, too, have a young border collie mix that has some issues with fear.  Luckily for me, though, I adopted her early enough to be able to work with her using positive methods, to help give her confidence.  If she had spent the first couple of years of her life being bullied around by someone who wanted to compete with her in obedience trials, I don't think she would have even lasted as long as Orson.  I have to commend Mr. Katz, because I believe that he did as much as he could do for this dog, and I do not believe that handing this dog over to someone else would have improved life for Orson at all, unless, by some unbelievable stroke of luck, he found someone who had all the patience and time in the world and the understanding to know exactly what this dog needed.  Unfortunately, many so-called "professional" trainers believe that they know what a dog needs, and they are often wrong and the dog ends up being euthanized anyway.  Putting him in a shelter would have been devastating for him; so many people do not understand how badly this sort of environment can destroy a dog emotionally; a dog like Orson would have only gotten worse in that sort of situation.  I loved this book, but I hated it at the same time.  No one likes to read about any animal coming to an untimely end.  We always want the best for them.  I believe that Jon Katz did as best as he could for this dog 
 This is a classic! If you want to "experience" an amazing guitarist listen to Hendrix!!! I highly recommend are you experienced!!! Some of my favorite tracks are: -purple haze -manic depression -hey joe -love or confusion -I don't live today -the wind cries Mary -fire -foxey lady -are you experienced? Go get it!!!  
 Hi I'll get write to the point awsome book I was 8 or 9 when I read it and to be honest 8 or 9 year olds don't have the best attention spands, but, the book held it. It was like I was in the jungle with him, swimming in the croc filled waters and holding my sawed off shot gun waiting for the VC, point is it is one of the best books I've ever read it is a must read, .. 
 This book purports to be a guide to imaginative sewing - which it is - but it is much, much more.  I found it to include some of the best instructions for fitting garments and adjusting patterns which I've seen anywhere.  Generally it combines free-sewing quilting techniques with clothing design, but contains innovative ideas which far outreach the book's modest premise.  If you enjoy clothing design, go for it!  
 This set of essays provides a useful perspective on the ongoing (and frequently confused and confusing) debate between constructivist epistemology and the older rationalist/positivist view of knowledge (the 'culture wars'). These topics are abstract and somewhat elusive, but are also both important and interesting.  Smith wields concepts with craft and precision. Her writing is relatively dense for those not familiar with this territory, but she is clear and ultimately rewarding. Well worth the effort 
 Samantha Mooney is able to capture the heartfelt sorrow involved in working with terminal feline patients.  Their unconditional love and the trust they place in humans, coupled with the tolerance for treatments that they must find uncomfortable but accept without complaint, is expressed so realistically that the reader will be  feeling the pain of each loss along with Samantha.  This book is truly written with compassion and lov 
 The Sixth Extinction provides an in-depth investigation into our history, present, and future.  Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin use more than enough detail to present a very convincing theory; compiling data from our arhaeoligical past and present ecological role within our planet to give every reader a sense of urgency to do something to save ourselves and other species from a dark future. Humans as the dominant and superior specie on Earth have an ethical responsiblity to live sustainably, with, not against our world. 
 I read this book because I had nothing better to do at the time, and I believe there is nothing better I could have done with my time. This book changed the way I view money, work, time, and life.  This book will not make you rich. It will not give you all the answers. It will start you asking the right questions. This book does for wealth creation what "7 Habits" did for personal development.  There are a lot of titles on offer from Kiyosaki's "Rich Dad" empire, many of which you can take or leave. "Cashflow Quadrant" and "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" are non-negotiable.  If you have any desire at all to be in control of your finances, you must buy this book, read it, re-read it, and then read it again.  Then get out there and do something 
 This is the same Cadbury bar you can find in local supermarkets & drug stores. Even tho it may say Hersheys Disp. on back, it's still the Cadbury Chocolate inside. Hershey only leases out the right to mfg and dispribute. Same Cadbury you would  buy in the UK. Most excellent chocolate. 
 I ORDERED LARGE PRINT FOR MY SON TO READ, AND YOU SENT SMALL PRINT.    PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO ABOUT IT.  THANKS SO MUCH,  CAROLYN DAVI 
 "The Adventures of Tintin: Volume 2" contains three more adventure comics by Herge, in a handy sized hardcover book. Here, we get "The Broken Ear" (1937), an adventure in a civil-war torn part of South America, "The Black Island" (1938) a chase through Britain, and "King Ottokar's Sceptre" (1939), featuring a plot against a "Syldavian" king. A few well known Tintin characters first appear in these stories. General Alcazar first appears in "The Broken Ear", Dr Muller appears in "The Black Island" and Bianca Castifiore sings her first song to Tintin in "King Ottokar's Sceptere". They're all exciting, intriguing adventures, my favorite in this bunch  being "The Black Island", mainly for the chase sequences and the island's "beast".  The text and pictures are a little smaller, but it's easy enough to read, and the detail of the pictures is maintained. It's really great value too. Here on amazon you could buy two or three of these for one normal sized hardcover Tintin. That's 5-8 more adventures for the same price!  Definitely worth picking up if you're interested 
 It's wonderful to keep this dream alive for those of us with moderate means. I'd recommend this book, along with FitzGerald's Sea-steading, as basic reference volumes for simple sailing 
 I remember reading (and loving) this book when I was about 11.  So I bought it for my 11-year old daughter and reread it myself.  While I have some criticisms of the book now that I didn't as a child (more about things that could have made it even better rather than things that were wrong with it), I still loved the book and my daughter did too.  It's a wonderful parable of love and tolerance and understanding, on the one hand, and of ignorance, intolerance and bigotry on the other.  I still would have liked to know more about Jon's world and have developed his interactions with people and animals in our world too 
 I have only been following this truly unique band since the release of `In Absentia', and have since then additionally purchased the albums `Stupid Dream', `Deadwing' and now, `Fear of a Blank Planet' (So that you know that my experience and knowledge of this band is limited, and this album will be judged on my experiences I have received from those albums.) I was largely unsure of what to expect from this ever shifting band. I simply cannot get enough of `Stupid Dream' and `In Absentia', but `Deadwing' was somewhat of a disappointment to me, turning away slightly from the Floyd-esque atmospheric prog to a more four-minuet-song-pop-metal approach (I mean come on... no one can argue that the song `Halo' was anything but a pop song). My fear of Porcupine Tree continuing in such a direction was, fortunately, completely unwarranted.   `Fear of a Blank Planet' is an absolutely intoxicating piece of atmospheric brilliance, surpassing   the brilliance even of `Stupid Dream'. The short song approach is completely discarded, replaced with only six tracks ranging mostly at the seven-minute mark, and one at seventeen. The upbeat pop flavor of `Deadwing' is thankfully watered down, only showing up for brief moments saving us from becoming too drenched in this album's aural sedative. Ironically due to `Fear of a Blank Planets' atmospheric focus, more metal has added to the mix (or rather, made heavier. There has always been metal, particularly in later PT releases, but the metal is distinctively more heavy in this one).  Fear not for you fans of Porcupine Tree's synth suffocated atmospherics, the more apparent metal influence adds some delightful contrast, and generally works very well with the synth washes, only overpowering them when absolutely necessary. This album is dangerously hypnotic, and Porcupine Tree seem to realize this by the addition, or rather, expansion of various elements to keep us on our feet.  The opening track, `Fear of a Blank Planet' is similar to most of the songs on `Deadwing', and therefore, the most `normal' song on this album. It eventually does break into some ambience towards the end though and builds into `My Ashes'. `My Ashes' is an absolutely beautiful piece, that seems to expand and breathe into a living entity. Absolutely intoxicating and beautiful, largely devoid of any metal riffage. `Anesthetize' is my favorite track, timing in at a progtastic seventeen minutes. The song begins by continuing the ambient, synth rich atmosphere that My Ashes delved in, to break into some Opeth-esque metal riff experimentation towards the mid-section. Soon the song builds into an absolutely beautiful climax of synth-drenched atmosphere, and returns to another absolutely vicious metal onslaught, ending with an almost jazzish vibe. This song is absolutely all over the map and extremely well written, making for a wonderful centerpiece. `Sentimental' begins with a minimalist piano melody, accompanied by a hypnotizing vocal harmony, and expands into an absolutely consuming, gentle atmosphere. This song remains largely the same, but is executed with such a keen ear to melody and very subtle experimentation, that it becomes one of the more emotional tracks on this album. `Way Out There' begins with a very subtle and dark synth arrangement that unmistakably reminds me of the Cure in their prime. `Way Out There' is a very dark and incredibly emotional piece throughout, that weaves in and out of walls of mourning distorted guitars and all-consuming synths. Around the four-minute mark, everything falls away except for a beautifully creepy key melody that foreshadows a forthcoming heavy part, that does not disappoint. The song finally ends in beautiful semi-ambience.  `Sleep Together' begins with a very haunting bit of electronica, that goes into a slow metal riff, that later is very nicely laced with a string arrangement. This particular track remains slow, dark, and brooding, almost brings Nine Inch Nails to mind. Around the four minute mark, everything dissipates except for the electronica sample that has been in effect since the beginning of the song, that begins to duel with some very haunting string and key arrangements until almost the six minute mark where the bass finally drops in, and the climax begins, and fades out.   Overall, `Fear of a Blank Planet' is an amazingly captivating release, combining the best elements of all Porcupine Tree, and making for very possibly the best album we will see in the grand ol' year of 2007.       
 This is a dazzling piece of cultural history about all the things people have wanted to be true about Elizabeth I whether they are or not, with fantastic pictures drawn from the plays and novels and movies in which her endlessly glamorous afterlife has been lived. It's a great book about why this enigmatic, dangerous woman matters and has mattered: it's funny, it's heartfelt, and it's scholarly too. Perfect for the thinking Glenda Jackson/Bette Davis/Cate Blanchett fan in your life, and a penetrating, witty meditation on fame, womanhood, and history 
 I am following the proceedures outlined in this book. That was my New Years Resolution. Check back in a year and I'm sure you'll find that I have made mucho dinero in 2007. It will be my best year ever, and I will more than double my income (not that hard, considering the pitiful amount I made last year).   I am trying to get other people to do this, too. But I won't wait for others to see the value of this. I believe that it will really help me, a knowledge worker, who has multiple projects, and millions of great ideas, but feels overwhelmed by trying to implement them all. This book is just what I needed, and for me to say it resonates with me is an understatement of the first, second, and third water.  
 This is one of a handfull of books I can think of that every person should read.  A classic of the highest magnitude 
 This live concert DVD is a must-see for all Nightwish fans, as well as for the average metalhead.  This is Nightwish's final, as well as best, performance with lead singer Tarja Turunen. The concert is so full of energy you'll be headbangin' along with it, as if you were in Hartwall Areena, Helsinki, yourself.  .  Just be sure to make sure you have an All-Region DVD player to watch it on.. 
 `Steal This Movie' is a well-thought, well-written well-acted, well-made dramatization of the life of left-wing activist Abbie Hoffman, probably the most famous of the Chicago Seven. (The title is a play on the title of Hoffman's autobiography, `Steal This Book', though it certainly doesn't have the poignancy of that title.) `Steal This Movie' made some bold casting choices. The lead role was given to Vincent D'Onofrio: not an obvious choice, because Vincent looks very little like Abbie, which caused many die-hard history aficionados to bash the decision. However, Vincent fills the role wonderful, brilliantly, expressing all the conflicting sides of Hoffman's personality, his sense of humor, his dead seriousness, strict political consciousness, bi-polar disorder, having to live in hiding and away from his wife and son. He makes the character come alive much more than someone else could have by simply looking and talking like him. Abbie's wife Anita is played wonderfully by SNL's Janeane Garofalo, accomplished comedian but not so as a dramatic actress.  Though it doesn't have that much cinematic value by its own right, `Steal This Movie' does a fantastic job of getting through both the spirit of the time and the greatness and difficulties of Hoffman's activities and his character - a great and fascinating person whose impact has long been overlooked. It's also a wonderful document of an important period that is practically ignored (relatively, of course). For those interested in the late 60s, in the hippie movements, Black Panthers and other left wing political movements of the time, and of course in Hoffman himself - it's invaluable, on top of being both touching and entertaining. A good watch 
 Like the title of this review says "I'm hooked".  Travis McGee is the best find I've had in fiction in years.   More independent than Spenser. Tougher than Marlowe. Smarter than Hammer.  McGee's that cool.   A great, thoughtful read with great incite into life and a few shocks to keep things fresh.  Junior Allen (the bad guy of the book more or less) is absolutely chilling. A true picture of the human predators that do exist in real life. Not the "mine is an evil laugh" stock bad guys you find in most fiction.  This was my first MacDonald book but, far, far from the last. 
 Two years later, the Red Sox fan still wakes up on the odd morning late in September thinking it never happened.  It was a utopian dream, the comfort of the drugged and sleeping.  But it *did* happen. It's here on film.  They couldn't have made this all up and - besides - I remember it. Like it was yesterday.  The producers of this DVD didn't have much of a World Series series to work with. The Sox swept the Cardinals in four.    The real drama was the American League Championship Series.  Still, the producers have done a remarkable job of building the context of the Curse of the Bambino, the tragedy snatched from the jaws of triumph in years that are branded into the thighs and brains of Red Sox fans - 1967, 1975, 1986 - the new Spring hopes that make one feel a little foolish. The mind games. The despair. The self-loathing.  It all ended in 2004.   It's right here on film.  The names now fit comfortably beside those of Yaz and the rest of Fenway's venerable ghosts: Schilling, Damon (still beloved in pinstripes), Pedro, Millar, Derek Lowe, Trot, Big Papi, Manny Being Manny, 'Skip' Francona, the undyingly heroic field captain 'Tek' Varitek, the man paid to steal one base (Dave Roberts). The gutsy trade of Nomar.  Then there were the demons of this passion play: All the Yankees, but particularly A-Rod, who played the part of a bizarrely emasculated Lucifer. And all the Yankees, again. And again.  Everybody else was just there that season for bit parts and background noise for Big Papi's walkoff homers and Curt Schillings epochal bloody sock, the crux of Red Sox Nation's unlikely redemption.  A Red Sox fan watching this DVD for the fifth time can still not suppress the goosebumps.   Where were we for this game? And that game? The true fans among us are slightly embarrassed about the fact that we remember where, a stroke of intellectual capacity that is supposed to be reserved for truly international events.  As I write this in mid-October, 2006, the Sox are at home and Detroit is facing off with Oakland for the American League Championship.  It doesn't matter.  We won. It's right there on the DVD.  Plus, the soundtrack is brilliant.  It all ends in glory after all, not ashes.  Redemption 
 My daughter loves this book! She's 6 years old and reads it all the way thru. If your child loves animals he or she will love this book. My daughter bugged me and bugged me to get this book for her. I highly recommend it 
 Strawberry Girl is a good book. I enjoyed it because of all the characters and excitment. The characters gave me a good idea of life a long time ago. I don't think I would have liked to lived in those times. Birdie Boyer worked very hard trying to be a strawberry girl. She had lots of chores to do each day plus go to school. The family worked hard too, things changed for the family when the Slaters came to visit. Birdie knew the Slaters would cause trouble for her family. The family pulled together and things turned out fine 
 This book picks up where book 4 left off, with preparation for the meeting of the witnesses in Jerusalem. Nicolae tries to prevent the meeting then tries to take it over when stopping it isn't possible. God's judgments grow fiercer when after the meeting, the first of the Angel Trumpet Woes hits, with all non-believers being attacked by hideous creatures led by the demon Apollyon. Hattie is more an more torn over the pending birth of hers and Nicolae's babies.  There is more action in this installment, with all the action surrounding the Meeting. the description of the meeting is vivid and very realistic for an event of such magnitude. The demon locusts unleashed are suitably hideous and the suffering of victims is intense in its occurrence. 
 The best thing about this book is its refusal to play games with your child's mind. Rejecting the shameless tear-jerking of so much media aimed at children, this book embraces the grand tradition of children's books that takes children seriously. This is a book about dealing with loss about about letting go, but also a book that makes the reader reflect on what is good about life. Warts and all, life is sweet. As a historian, I really appreciate that Yolen tries hard to show what her valley was like AND what it is like after the dam is built. Kids are frightened when they see orchards being ripped out for suburbs; this is a book about dealing with that kind of loss 
 This is an excellent book that will help many hopeful adoptive parents make their dreams come true. It is clear, reassuring, and offers practical steps and tips. And it was the first time I hear a compelling argument as to why you don't need to go through an agency-a concept I'd never considered before. [...] I think Dr. Burns is highly ethical, and I would recommend her book without hesitation 
 What I especially liked about the book is its move-by-move-method. So  often you see in an analysation that a couple moves are just there without  any comment, but you don't understand them. This book explains every move.  Also it doesn't say things like 'and white wins within another 10 moves'  but it actually shows the way to victory. Yasser doesn't go to deep in his  analysations, but lets the reader enjoy the beauty of the 12 games he has  selected, which indeed are astonishing brilliancies. I really enjoyed the  book, it sure improved my chess, and I hope you'll think the same of it 
 Blair and Bloom do a great job explaining classic Islamic arts. They give equal attention to architecture, calligraphy, weaving and decorative arts, and suplement their accessible yet intelligent text with attractive photographs. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to begin learning about Islamic art, as well as to those who already know the basics 
 This DVD is a master work of imagery.  In "Canyon Light" the subtle changes in colors and shadows from morning to noon are a delight to watch. Each of the twelve selections is skillfully filmed.  It is difficult for me to believe that one person is responsible for this high quality DVD production.  If you liked Mindflo you are sure to enjoy Minflo 2.  I recommend buying this DVD to relax and find the joy of nature. 
 Anything by Bolles is well-researched and well written. He is the undisputed master of the job hunt. 
 I really enjoyed Pam's "Cowboys...", but LOVE "A Little More About Me." Perhaps I envy Pam, admire her courage and insight, confusion and inquisitive nature... but I think mostly I identify with her  free spirit. She is a person who deals with self-doubt, despite her great  athletic and adventurous achievements. Her meassage to ME goes SO far  beyond adventure travel and physical ability, and rather targets her  personal need for challenge (emotional, physical and intellectual)and makes  me think about my own challenges. How is it that she has described so many  of my EXACT feelings? It is a book I have a hard a hard time putting down,  perhaps because I relate to so many of her stories, or maybe because I just  love nature (AND horses) and love her vivid desriptions and story-telling.  Can't wait for her next collection of essays! I have learned so much about  myself from reading her stories 
 I've known Bob Dorr as a friend for about a decade or more.  He and I both share a passion for aviation and aviation photography.  Bob, however, goes beyond passion when he writes books.  His unique ability is to write books that puts readers into the cockpit of helicopters or other aircraft.  You feel exactly what other crews have felt while flying missions. Bob's amazing knowledge of aircraft and history and his dogged research makes for truely unique books.  I enjoy Bob's books and encourage others to try them out.  
 Having been a fan of Larry Golding's B-3 playing for years, I was skeptical of his switch to piano for most of this recording.  I was pleasantly suprised to find something unique and unusual in place of the typical B-3 burning of his earlier recordings.  Much of the album has a very introspective feel, not unlike the trio albums of Brad Mehldau.  But he also explores many different genre's without losing focus and cohesion within the band. They tackle Monk's "Jackie-ing" with an interesting arrangement.  There's also "Dario and Bario" that sounds like a Nino Rota soundtrack.  "Hesitation Blues" with Madeleine Peryoux has a very down-home feel, not unlike most of Peryoux's albums.  Then they cover Bjork's "Cocoon," giving it an atmosphere reminiscent of an 1970's ECM record.The album ends with a version of the spiritual "We Shall Overcome," it's introspection suggests that what we have to overcome may be within ourselves.  There's no firey B-3 blazing on this album, but it takes on a whole different area in jazz.  Thank you Larry for breaking out of the box and trying something new.   
 These have been my favorite cookies for over 20 years now, both in New York & California.  I just love the shortbread and the fudgy center and have never found another cookie that even compares. Recently I moved to the Southeast, tho, and panicked when I couldn't find any Stella D'oro cookies anywhere! I'm so happy to find them here at Amazon, where I'm a regular shopper anyway; now I can add them to my order everytime I buy something! 
 Fuld's entertaining story-telling and clear analysis, and detailed explanations of useful competitive intelligence techniques, make this a book full of aha!s about seeing one's own situation and the changing marketplace more quickly, more deeply and more effectively 
 Exhaustively researched and beautifully written, this story of three young men killed in the slaughter of the First World War is heartwrenching, perhaps because so much of it is told in their own words. The boys - English, German and American -  were keen observers and articulate reporters, detailing the horrors of trench warfare in their letters and diaries. Balancing personal accounts in the book are cold numbers, among them the toll of the first day of the Battle of the Somme: 57,000 British troops 
 Warning, this is a strange CD. It's not going to fit everyone's taste, but if you are the type that likes to explore, or extremely bored with POP music, then this is the CD for you. This was created & recorded before the computer age, yet deals with the process of the computer age. Back then some Classical Experimenters used tape loops to created multi layered repetitions of rhythm & melody. I believe the high light is "It's Gonna Rain" from a recording of a Pentecosta street preacher yelling about Noah's flood. The words "Its Gonna Rain" become rhythm with something like: "Its Its, Its Gonna Its Gonna, Gonna Gonna, Gonna Rain Gonna Rain, Rain Rain...then the piece adds layers of layers of the sermon until it becomes a vast sound effect. Believe it or not I played "It's Gonna Rain" during a Performance Art piece called "Noah's Art" where I gave out water balloons & pistols to an audience while reading & then acting out the 10 commandants. The Tape loop was used to drive everyone into a frenzy to drown me with water. It Worked. Thanks Steve 
 This is a good book, about a boy who goes through many hardships,and much happiness with his two best friends, Ol' Dan and Li'l Ann. They were very special friends, not only because they were extremely cute, kind, and willing to do everything the boy, Billy, wanted but also because they were dogs! And they were loyal 'till death. It is very sad, and happy at the same time. Even though it was sad, it is still one of my favorite books. I really enjoyed it.  
 I am a newbie to perl and I'm writing an application that involves using object-oriented perl. I have not seen any other book that explains difficult concepts with amazing clarity that even a newbie like me can understand. I wish other perl books were written as simple and clear like this one : 
 A concise book written by an experienced science journalist with considerable experience and knowledge related to climate change.  This clearly written book is not about global climate change in general but about the specific possibility that rapid, rather than gradual changes could occur in climate.  Rapid in this context means events occurring in the years to decades range rather than the decades to centuries range usually discussed.  Linden does a good job of discussing emerging evidence for rapid climate change events, covering both the evidence itself and how paleoclimatologists reconstruct the past.  His descriptions of the 'machinery' of global climate are very good, though they would have been helped by a few graphics.  He describes how some reconstructions of past climate events, in both the remote and recent past, help to explain the fall of some civilizations and contributed to major humanitarian disasters.  Linden is concerned particularly with underscoring the possibility that rapid and hard to predict climate events would occur in a burst with devastating consequences.  This is an alarmist book, but Linden's point is cogent and rational.  
 Menuez combines beautiful photographs and informative text to paint a picture both of a region and an industry.  From the darkly provocative picture on the cover (of naked men working in pits of agave pressings) to those of the people and landscape of the region, he creates a sense of Jalisco (the province where all tequila is produced) that draws the reader in.  For those who know only that tequila is what goes in a margarita, the text enlightens the reader regarding the complexities of tequila and the culture that surrounds it 
 It's a outstanding novel about one family from Baltimore which opens different sides of relationships between mother, Pearl her children - Cody, Ezra ad Jennie and their father who left the family many years ago. This novel will be understandable and close to the readers in any country. It's very deep and frank drama, with very bright and realistic characters which hard to forget. It's one family  story in which many readers can find the  the parralels with their own families. Bravo 
 This is a great story about someone who goes in search of what life has to offer. I think it is a clear reminder that we can do something different and get out of a rut. This story is told in such a way that the emotions and feelings of the characters feel familiar and there is something that everyone can relate to. A really enjoyable read. A feel good book. Highly recommended 
 Even when Leiber was trying to write something serious he still couldn't help being satirical, as when he describes aerial dogfights between "angels" and "demons." Only they happen to be airplanes disguised as each. The "demons" even have horns. You smile even if you don't want to, and there's really not much to smile at in this tale of a post-nuclear-war world in which the power-hungry use science and religion to enrich themselves at the expense of a povery-striken world. It's a subversive novel, actually, because Leiber is clearly informing us than when when political power over people is involved, it doesn't matter whether people worship God or the Devil, because for all practical purposes, they're the same thing. As almost always with Leiber, there are cats involved, although in this case they are minor characters 
 I was mesmerized and not least to say, "very impressed"!  From the beginning starting with the overture for "Don Giovanni" to the finale this production of Mozart's most famous and darkest opera was sung to perfection by the entire cast and the instrumental music exceptionally and flawlessly performed by the orchestra.  Filmed at one of the most beautiful, extravagant and famous opera houses in the world (where only the best of the best perform)this particular performance will not only reach the eyes and ears but the heart and soul of every admirer of this great art form.  The orchestra is led by the infamous James Levine at the Metropolitan Opera in NewYork in one of his many what would seem to be, "a perfect interpretation of Mozart's music".  Renee Flemming gives a passionate, heartfelt and powerful performance proving to the audience why she is one of the most famous and sought after Divas in the entire world.  Bryn Terfel gives a grande performance in the leading role as,  "Don Giovanni" not only with his musical talents but also with his character performance as well becoming one of those people you would love to hate.  Paul Groves sings, "Dalla Sua Pace" in what I would say is the most beautiful version I have heard to date.  A standing ovation also to the rest of the cast, the camera men, sound engineers, costume designers, set designers (for their realistic and somewhat haunting stage settings) and to everyone else involved in this wonderful production.  This DVD also has the option of listening to the performance in DTS digital surround sound. English and Italian subtitles are also available.  I would like to end this review with some words of comfort and that is, "You don't have to worry,this opera does not contain too many notes" 
 I love McEwan's writing enough to forgive him for the few faults this novel almost conceals.  At its best, the prose evokes Fitzgerald's effortless beauty.  At worst, it feels showy, or show-offy:  18 pages to describe a squash match?  No need.  We GET it.  Ian knows squash, Ian knows fine wine and food, Ian knows Neurosurgery, Ian knows Blues.  The problem is that the novel Hangs too long, or too deeply on each of these subjects.  Ok, so the book is only about one day in this guy's life, one 24 hours of his hyper-consciousness, and as a result it HAS to go deep.  Still, I felt at times like McEwan was showing off, not just showing 
 "Death Dujour" is the second novel in the Temperance "Tempe" Brennan series by Kathy Reichs. In this installment, Tempe's case stretches from Montreal to the Carolinas as young teaching assistant disappears, an arson fire attempts to hide the murder of 7 people and a long dead Catholic nun is about to receive sainthood.  "Death Dujour" was an excellent read! The synopsis may sound a bit convoluted, but it's really not. This novel didn't grab me the way "Deja Dead" did when I first picked up the novel. I had to allow "Death Dujour" to progress a bit before the story became engrossing. Lots of surprises and twists in this novel. Definitely worth reading 
 MAN'S SEARCH FOR MEANING by Dr Viktor Frankl  I was introduced to an earlier edition of this book after I had watched Joel Barker's video, 'The Power of Vision' during the early nineties.  The book captured the author's chilling & yet inspirational story of his personal struggle & eventual triumph against unspeakable horror at the Auschwitz concentration camps. His entire family (His father, mother, brother & his wife) perished in the camps, except for his sister.   [Frankly, I did not realise the magnitude of the author's horrendous sufferings - & the Holocaust as a whole - until I personally visited the Auschwitz concentration camps, in the town of Oswiecim, situated about 60 kms from Krakow in southern Poland, with my late wife during the mid-nineties. Auschwitz was actually the German name for the town. I was told by my guide that about 6 million people died in the Auschwitz camps, more than 90% of whom were Jews.]  Because he was a psychiatrist, he was able to observe behaviours at the camps. He noticed that the healthiest, youngest, smartest, & best looking were not automatically the ones who survived.   At this juncture, I would like to quote exactly what he wrote:   "Even though conditions such as lack of sleep, insufficient food & various mental stresses may suggest that the inmates were bound to react in certain ways, in the final analysis it becomes clear that the sort of person the prisoner became was the result of an inner decision, & not the result of camp influences alone. Fundamentally, therefore, any man can, even under such circumstances, decide what shall become of him - mentally and spiritually. He may retain his human dignity even in a concentration camp. I became acquainted with those martyrs whose behavior in camp, whose suffering & death, bore witness to the fact that the last inner freedom cannot be lost...  ...Everything can be taken from a man but one thing; the last of the human freedoms-to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way...  ...Most men in a concentration camp believed that the real opportunities of life had passed. Yet, in reality, there was an opportunity & a challenge. One could make a victory of those experiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or one could ignore the challenge & simply vegetate, as did a majority of the prisoners...  ...What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves & furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us..."  According to him, in the final analysis, the most significant indicator of survival was that all of those who made it through had something significant yet to do with their lives. In other words, if one has something significant or purposeful or meaningful yet to do with one's life, the chances of survival against hardships, obstacles, setbacks & even death threats, will be much higher. That is to say, man's primary motivational force is his seach for ultimate meaning. Joel Barker calls it the power of vision. According to Barker, a positive vision of the future is what gives meaning to life & a meaningful vision empowers us to solve problems & accomplish goals.  Another productive learning experience for me, from reading the book, is this: one often cannot change the circumstances of one's encounter with any situation, person or event, but one certainly has the power to choose how to interprete it & how to respond to it.   Put it in another way, one's attitude or outlook on life certainly has ramifications on how one can survive - & thrive - in the longer term.  I think I can now appreciate better about what Anthony Robbins once said: "It's in your moment of decision that your destiny is shaped." He added further:   There are three decisions that control our destiny:  - our decisions about what to focus on; - our decisions about what things mean to us; - our decisions about what to do to create the results we desire;  Viktor Frankl had also made another profound observation in his book:   "Don't aim at success - the more you aim at it & make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, & it only does so as the unintended side effect of one's personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself."  This resonates very well with what F Buckminster Fuller, recognised as Planet Earth's friendly genius (he created the Geodesic dome), called 'precession' or 'precessional effects' is his book, 'Critical Path'.  On the whole, I have enjoyed very much reading Viktor Frankl's 'Man's Search for Meaning'. Thanks to Joel Barker for the timely introduction! 
 Every time someone asks me about John McPhee (I am, I admit a total fan) I find myself saying "Look, Here is a guy who can take a subject like, say ORANGES, and make it fascinating."  This is the book where he does just that. I gather that ORANGES started out as a short magazine piece & like so many of McPhee's books became an obsession. Here we can get the history, the ecology, the landscape of orange groves along with discussions of the effects of oranges and orange growing on both the culture and the surroundings, all in McPhee's eminently readable prose. This is a fast read about a subject that you probably haven't though much about, but you will walk away from this book not only better informed about the fruit but also taken with the infinite possibility of the wonder that can be found in what seem to be every-day things 
 This is the second one I have purchased, I love it. I can have all my information in one place and with kids sometimes it can be hard but this helps alot. Wonderful product 
 Smiley Smile - The "released" version of Smile is here in a smaller scale. If you ever wanted to hear what the Beach Boys would sound like on Hashish and laying on their backs while singing harmony stoned, get this, it's really good.  Wild Honey - White soul before there was white soul and 10 years before Hall & Oates and the white Philly soul movement, The Beach Boys did it in 1967. 
 Many readers know that there are authors that release books under a second pen name like Stephen King has his writing alter ego, Richard Bachman, and the late Evan Hunter also wrote under the pseuodnym Ed McBain.  Another such famous writer with two famous sides in Nora Roberts, a well-known romance novelist who also writes under the name J.D. Robb.  Over the course of more than 20 plus books (counting the book Remember When, which is an ambitious "co-authoring" by both Roberts and Robb) Robb has given readers an adventurous look at the future of crime and detectives in the form of Lieutenant Eve Dallas, one of the best officers of the NYPSD in the middle point of the first century of the current millennium.  Throughout the series, Dallas is a tough as nails cop that has definite vulnerabilities due to the fact that she was sexually abused when she was a child by her father and has little to no knowledge of her life save for that.  The only constants in Eve's life (besides work) are her close friends and her lover Roarke, who was originally a suspect in the very first book, Naked in Death.  In this, the third book of Robb's "In Death" series, the story picks up nearly immediately after the events of Glory in Death when Roarke proposed to Dallas.  We find the she accepted the proposal and is trying to balance trying to get ready for her wedding with the help of Roarke and her closest friend, Mavis.  When Dallas goes to visit Leonardo, Mavis' boyfriend and a top designer who has agreed to make Eve's dress, she unwittingly gets involved in an altercation with a high fashion model named Pandora, who reveals that she is Leonardo's lover.  A few days later, Pandora is found dead in Leonardo's shop and due to an argument at a party, Mavis is the prime suspect.  With the case now getting personal, Eve must try her best to solve the case while trying to remain impartial, get her wedding arrangements in order, and uncover a secret drug ring within the world of high fashion involving something called Immortality.  This book has some unique page-turning moments and shows us that for Eve, life as a police detective who is about to be married to one of the richest men in the known world is going to be somewhat difficult but as she has shown in the past, she will be able to handle it her own way.  This is one time that being Immortal is worth it.. 
 This book is a pretty good account of Miles Davis' life and music.  For the most part most of the information about Miles' life has been covered in  other books, and is covered especially well in his own autobiography.  The  author of this book does know a lot about the music of Miles Davis, which  takes center stage in his musical analysis of each album.  The appendixes  of this book are very well done, I especially enjoy the appendix that has  highly detailed information on each album that Miles has played on.  For  musicians there is an appendix which gives examples in musical notation of  Miles Davis' solos. Another element that helps this book is the vast amount  of quotes from people that knew Miles personally such as his musicians and  friends.   All in all, this biography gives a good account of Miles' life  and is a great source for information on his music.  Read Miles Davis' own  autobiography first, then pick up this book 
 This was, for the most part, a very good book. Story wise, it was great, however fact wise...a little sketchy. While I'm certainly no expert on the Great Hurricane of 1938, there were some facts that I double checked that were a little off. The main reason I picked this book up was because 1- this Hurricane slammed right onto my hometown (albeit 1938, LONG before I showed up) and I was interested in learning about it's destructiveness...and 2- I'm fascinated by weather, especially hurricanes.  Imagine waking up to a beautiful mid-September day, after a summer of oppressive heat and torrential rains, only to have it turn into the worst hurricane the Northeast has ever seen...and with absolutely NO warning. I was riveted by the individual stories of the people that survived this storm, and the hell they went through trying to survive the day, and was saddened by the enormous loss of life due to total lack of any warning what-so-ever.  About half-way through this book, I came onto Amazon to see what other people had to say about it, and was somewhat dismayed to find out there were so many slight factual errors within (which is why I began checking some of them). But for the most part, as I said, story wise...the book was really good. It read very much like a novel (though more depressing, because you know this actually happened).   In the end, I got out of it what I had hoped...to be more informed about the horrific, and totally destructive 'Great Hurricane of 1938'. However, if you're looking for downright facts, and and a expert version on what happened September 21, 1938...I suggest you look elsewhere for your information as this book focuses mostly on the inhabitants of the R.I., CT, and MA residents that were caught up in this '100 Year Storm' 
 I had been avoiding reading Matthew Scully's Dominion for months. Avoiding it because I knew it would enrage, upset and embarrass me. And once I did pick up the book and commit to reading it, my predictions were dead on. This powerful, emotionally draining and gut-wrenching book about the systematic abuse and widespread slaughter of animals enraged me as a compassionate person, upset me as a lover of animals, and embarrassed me as a human being who has blindly taken part in the chain of abuse.  Scully, a former Special Assistant and speech writer to President George W. Bush, surprises me first and foremost in that his background as a Republican is not something I would immediately associate with animal rights. Yet he clearly feels deeply about the subject, and that comes through loud and clear in this intricately detailed, impassioned examination of the ways we humans have abused our guardianship position and made animals into virtual slaves of our own needs, desires, passions and greed.  From the horrors of factory farming, where massive numbers of cows, sheep, pigs and veal calves are treated like machines to produce our food, to the disgusting antics of the wealthy hunters who pay tens of thousands of dollars to kill exotic wildlife, to the brutal slaughter of seal pups, lab animals, precious and rare elephants, and whales (called "living marine resources" by the men who clamor for more lethal means to kill them with), this book leaves no stone unturned in its unflinching look at the myriad ways humans mistreat other life forms. Scully also spends a lot of time countering the ridiculous arguments of religious leaders, scientists and even sportsmen that animals do not feel pain, have no souls, and therefore are ours to do with as we please.  Scully takes us into whaling commission meetings, hog farms, science labs and canned hunts, and into the minds of the men who get their kicks - and even their paychecks - from brutalizing other living things. We listen to the reasoning and excuses of people who think animals are find to torture and kill because they don't think like us, talk like us, or feel like us. We hear the excuses, the arguments and even the motivations of those who engage in the suffering of animals for prosperity, knowledge, thrills and cheap hamburgers.  Eventually, the book leads us to the conclusion that we as a species have utterly failed our fellow creatures in every way. That we have been given a sense of dominion over the beasts of air and sea and earth seems to have given way to a righteous attitude of ownership, whereby we kill millions of animals each year for our own consumption, pleasure and control.  Dominion is not a book written by some animal rights wacko. It is written by a respected journalist and former literary editor of National Review, and a man who has worked under some of the most powerful Republican leaders. It is written with respect and restraint, honesty and directness, and a deep compassion for the creatures we have enslaved, even as we seek more, faster, cheaper, easier ways of living - all at their expense.  Scully's book is devastating, and will upset many readers, so be forewarned. This is not easy material to sit through, but it is important nonetheless. This call to mercy is one of the most powerful books I have ever tried to avoid reading. Denial may save us for awhile, but in the end, we need to face the truth, and then do something about it. As it says in the Book of Proverbs, "A righteous man regards the life of his animal." This book is a reminder that dominion and domination are two completely different things 
 This book was the required text for my Intro to Philosophy course. In addition to being very informative and easy to follow, it was a pretty good read.  My only qualm concerning this book was the lack of pretty colors. Pfft 
 Two weeks ago we packed our four kids and this book and headed west. We spent two days in Disneyland, one day in Disney California Adventure, and one day in Universal Studios. We followed all instructions in the book about when to arrive and how to use fast pass, and most importantly, we followed the itinerary (which rides to do and in which order) with only a few changes to suit our tastes. The result? We flew from one to another to another ride with minimal or no waiting. Our longest wait ever was a half hour, and that was in the afternoon when we wanted to repeat a ride we'd done in the morning. ("Soaring over California" is not to be missed.)  We'd never been to a theme park before, mostly because we had heard about the horrendous lines, but this was a breeze. We shudder to think, though, what it would have been like had we not used this book.   We want to add a recommendation that the author might even like to include in the next edition: if you're flying west, stay on eastern time if you can. By doing so, the kids were willing to get up at the crack of dawn and hit the parks before they open. Waiting a little while on line before the park opens is way better than waiting on ride lines. (It maximizes the number of rides you get to do, it eliminates standing on line at security, and it's cooler in the morning.) Furthermore, on two of the four days, we discovered upon our arrival that the park was opening sooner than they had posted!  We also appreciated all the ride descriptions. Knowing what to expect enhanced the experience, and on a few occasions, helped two of our family members decide against a ride. At those times, we found an alternative ride nearby by reading the book and checking its map, and the family split up temporarily.   We rate our experience at these theme parks a ten on a scale of one to ten, and it's because of this book. If I were forced to choose either my camera or this book, I'd leave the camera home and bring the book.   
 The Last Queen submerges the reader into a world of ambiguous morality, tumultuous politics, and an epic struggle against the weavings of fate woven so tightly that the fabric can barely be stretched, let alone torn. If anyone ever dreamed of being a European prince or princess in the late 1400's this novel will surely dispel the fantasy. As an amateur historian I have intellectually accepted the difficulties of ruling well and conceded that few had the power to overcome the corruption of power or had the intellectual acumen to succeed as a royal statesperson. But in Christopher Gortner's novel you feel this viscerally. To succeed against the odds was a miracle when it happened; which is probably why we can count the reigns of the truly noble on our fingers. Juana was, as we say now, set up for failure, but her struggles against her fate were epic in scope. From the first realization that she was trapped by the inertia of her royal lineage to the love/hate relationship with Phillip to the ultimate clash with the misogynist Grandees of Spain. This is not a book that will cheer you. But it is a novel that will tear at your soul and follow you into dreams 
 After my diagnosis with breast cancer five years ago at age 28,this book was part of my salvation.  Reading stories of otherssurvival helped me to realize that cancer is beatable.  I now recommend this book to other cancer patients 
 For an anthology of that claims to be "the poetry of our world", this book has suprisingly few poets represented.  The editors chose to include poetry from about 25 countries and mostly include poetry from only  one author per country.  But that is intentional:  the editors wanted the  quality and richness of the poetry to be the track their sled runs in.  In  doing so, they have succeeded in creating a collection that is bursting in  energy and emotion, with poetry that is a pleasure to read and reflect on.   It is a very strong anthology that is sure to finish very highly, if not  win, any poetry Iditarod 
 I'd seen the film adaptation of this book many times, and when I finally read the book awhile back, I could not believe how good it was. It was if I could remember everything as it had happened in the film. If you've seen the film, read the book, and if you haven't, read the book first, then see the film.  It tells the famous story of Doolittle's raid on Tokyo, as seen through the eyes of Captain Ted Lawson, one of the pilots. We learn about Lawson, his crew, and his plane, affectionately known as "The Ruptured Duck." We read of the preparations for the raid, and then the raid itself. Lawson and his men crash in China, and their harrowing journey to safety, and ultimately back to the USA is told in a gripping style, making you feel as if you were there when it happened.  One of the best WWII books I've ever read, and I've read a lot of them 
 I like the use of this product. i think it did solve solve the problem my computer cd/dvd drive was facing which was slow reading the cds... with the low price its a must for every computer owner to use this 
 Dr. Wagner has produced a guide for parents, living with OCD in their family, that is both easy to read and straight forward. Her style, found in all her publications, is written for the lay person as well as professionals. Dr. Wagner walks the reader through the various stages of diagnosis, treatment and follow up, in a way that demonstrates that Obessive-Compulsive Disorder is treatable. The focus of treating children with cognitive behavioral therapy provides the child and their family with the tools to empower themselves with strategies which will help them overcome OCD: deal with it on a daily basis, and in the future, if OCD once again interferes with their daily living, they will have gained the knowledge to recover more effeciently.  I highly recommend any of Dr. Aureen Wagner's books to anyone interested in treatment of anxiety disorders, including Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder 
 This is the first Joshua Redman CD I've had the opportunity to hear. Man, this guy's got it. I read some of the other reviews and a couple mentioned this is not as good as other CDs he has released. I absolutely can not imagine it getting any better than this.   This cat reminds me of Monk, Byrd, Hancock, the Headhunters, and Cannonball all wrapped up in one. It is a throwback with great respect for the masters. It is a grand relief from the blind purchases I have made of so-called new artist whose work sound as scripted and redundant as a Broadway play.  This cat can improvise, he is versatile, and the short cuts leave you begging for more. If he is smart, he would take those very same short cuts and develop them to full length on a future CD.  But since others say this is not as good as other releases, I am compelled to order the older releases to see for myself. If they are correct, then I can only say it will be money well spent 
 At the back of the book, a reviewer is quoted: "What a great demolition job!" And it really is. It puts Freud and all of his theories right where they belong: On history's scrapyard. The seriousity of this book is evident to the reader, one does not doubt that Websters side of the Freud story reveals some long hidden truths. Webster shows that all of Freuds "scientific findings" were nothing else than the thoughts of a very small man who hated mankind, and hated children most of all. Unfortunately, Freud also had a natural authority that made others fear and respect him, and tragicly enough, also believe him.   Had Freud lived today, he would have been bancrupt hundred times over from loosing lawsuits, and perhaps also would have been put away behind bars. What Freud has done to patients is really an outrage. Webster also writes that his book is just the beginning - he has opened a door to the biographical facts, where most people have hesitated to go in before him. Freud protected himself from all future critisism by raising the self-made shield: "If you question Freuds truths, that proves that there's something psychologically very wrong with you". Now everyone can search without being brandmarked and stigmatized in this way. And as more people will start digging, the more we will see of the damage Freud did to his patients. And it will become more evident the damage he has done to the conception of Man for a whole century.   After the demolition job is done, Webster concludes: Man is nothing even remotely what Freud has described us to be. And he follows up with the most important question of all: When we are nothing of what has been the dominating psychological view for hundred years - who and what and how are we then? And he encourages each and every one to join in the creating of a new and ultimately much more optimistic understanding of Man 
 I am so tired of all things slick and polished and perfect and manufactured and sanitized. Making a 'zine is a great way to be imperfect, original, dirty and raw. This book shows you how. It is quirky and fun and inspiring. Love it!! 
 If you are a liberal you will probably want to skip this book but it should be an enjoyable quick read for anyone who likes to see hypocrites strung up.  Don't expect anything too deep as each person gets only a couple of pages 
 This book is a one of the books that has changed how I think about the world. As I study how religion and people interact, this book gives a  framework to work within. At times the material is clearly written for  other professors and professionals. But dispite the work it takes to get  thru some of the material, the content is very  valuable. This book is  having the same kind of  impact for me that "Diffusion of  Innovation" had 
 For example, my favorite Franklin quote about taxes - which is so very true today - is this:  "Taxes are indeed very heavy [however] we are taxed twice as much by our Idleness, three times as much by our Pride, and four times as much by our Folly."  You have to think about that one for a second to realize how powerfully true it is. For all the time we waste complaining about taxes, it would be better to just work hard and not waste our money, and instead save as much as we can. (Not that I'm a fan of taxes, mind you. Just saying...)  And the book is full of so many other deep self-help truths like that. Get Poor Richard's Almanac but beware! It's not the kind of text you can speed-read through. Instead you must digest everything slowly 
 Read SPIRITUAL GARDENING by Peg Streep at  your own risk.  After seeing an excerpt in Oprah's magazine, I purchased and read this exceptional book.  It truly changed my life.  I will never be the same.  It took me outside, introduced me to the place of gardens in history, the value of gardens, the many kinds of gardens, and the love and care of gardens.  It inspired me to read magazines on gardening, buy hundreds of dollars worth of gardening books--which I cherish, "delve" into the philosophy of feng shui, evaluate my backyard, enhance my backyard into a garden creation--perennials, benches, statues, chimes, birdfeeders, a gazing ball, and enjoyable dreams of more beauty to come therein.  It's a passionate and fun obsesssion! SPIRITUAL GARDENING is my favorite gift to give to those I care about.  The book is beautiful.  It is full of color photographs of varied gardens.  The writing is inspirational and full of memorable garden quotations.  It's one of my most valued possessions 
  It is a stunning story of a 20 year old black youth, Bigger Thomas, born and raised in Chicago slum in a fatherless home. He has known prejudice, white scorn and poverty all his life, a life without hope future or any meaning. When he gets a job as a chauffer in a good Samaritan white family, he is happy and yet bit resentful of their patronizing, their condescending manner. On the very first outing with their young daughter and her communist friend, tragedy strikes due exclusively to Bigger's sub- conscience fear of association with white women. Once he commits the ultimate crime, inadvertently as it was, it spirals out of control and one need not wonder about the denouement.  When the case goes to trial, Bigger's attorney makes eloquent, convincing case of three hundred year history of slavery, bigotry, hatred that resulted in such inevitable tragedy. He concludes Bigger was a victim of society, a world at large with its own rules and customs where he was a pariah from the day he was born. Bigger could not comprehend that not all whites hate blacks and harbor bigotry.    It is a fascinating account of racism in the twentieth century America. I wonder how much progress we have made since the book's first publication in 1950. It is a must read.  
 I read "How to Date" cover to cover, often wishing that it would just go on forever. Diane Mapes is a great humorist and wordsmith. Wisdom and incite flow from every page. I have always thought she was funny and fun, as I have worked with her and met her on occasion at professional meetings. But knowing her just a bit did not prepare me for reading "How to Date."   I read it mostly on my daily bus commute which made for some pretty funny looks from various onlookers. At times, people would start reading over my shoulder and I was forced to give it to them until I left the bus--that was the only reason it took longer than usual to read as it was a real page turner.  I have proudly convinced a number of folks to pick it up because it's not just about losers trying to find themselves or the new, new thing on how to get someone. It's about how we are today and how we actually might be better with each other if we could step back and take a look. We could all use a little more Diane Mapes in our lives.  Looking forward to the next one 
 If you were taken by the music from the trailer . . . a beat driven techno piece . . . then do not buy this soundtrack, that song is not included here.  I have not heard this soundtrack and have nothing against it, but if you liked the song from the trailer then buy the STIGMATA soundtrack by Billy Corgan.  The song from the  FROM HeLL trailer is by B. Corgan and is on the stimgmata soundtrack  . . . it's called "Reflection <whispers> trees".  Hope this helps the people looking for this song 
 Poor Romeo.   Watching Romeo meander his way through the play is like tailgating a drunk driver. At any moment he could crash, and in the end he overcorrects his assumptions by swallowing the poison, and in some ways his death must be a relief to his troubled mind.    Romeo's status in the story changes with nearly every scene, whether by his own doing or by an external entity.  However, his circumstance reflects in almost every case his willingness to succumb to his passions. From his love of Rosalind to his love for Juliet to his exile, he is a bundle of nerves. Taking a time out would slow the pace, and instead Shakespeare quickens it by transplanting Romeo's moment of joy with Juliet with a moment of action and consequence: the death of Mercutio.    Giving Romeo the chance to be happy might damage his character.  A great tragedy yet today.  What makes it great is that the basic storyline pulls everyone in, and once the story captures, we can start to appreciate the minor characters, like Capulet and the Nurse.       
 I WILL REPAY, a sequel to Orczy's novel THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL, is a delightful romp through fields of adventure, danger, betrayal, daring rescue, and true love.  Orczy's weaving of the love motif amidst the events of the plot, events that threaten at any moment to bring down the wrath of Robespierre's Committee of Public Safety upon our protagonists, a wrath that would inevitably and quickly lead them to the guillotine, is adroitly done.  Her weaving integrates threads of misunderstanding, misinterpretation, and erroneous conclusion with those of attraction, trust, adoration, and longing to produce a tapestry replete with the darkness of betrayal and the brightness of redemption.  As in THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL, women in I WILL REPAY are both the cause of the novel's crisis and the reward after its resolution.  Juliette Marny's naivete and innocence in the ways of the world lead her to agree to a terrible oath when her brother is killed, in a fair fight one must note, by Paul Deroulede.  Her unquestioning religious beliefs overcome her yet immature judgement and compassion and give that oath, taken many years earlier, the upper hand and lead to the denouncement of Deroulede to the deadly Committee of Public Safety in revolutionary France.  Juliette is not the only character to suffer from the "weakness of a woman's heart."  The strange, malformed little Anne Mie contrives to betray Juliette just as Juliette betrays Deroulede.  While Orczy's women are the betrayers and instigators in these novels, none is of truly evil disposition. Their betrayals are the result of their "feminine weakness," a characteristic that may appear strange to a 21st century reader who is accustomed to seeing contemporary women as at least equal to men if not, in many cases, their superiors.  However, such was not the case when Baroness Orczy wrote in the early 20th century and was certainly not the norm in 18th century France, historical exceptions such as Joan of Arc notwithstanding.  Orczy's women, therefore, are weak and are subject to all the frailties in judgement of their sex, but they are as much innocent victims of this as are those whom they betray because of those frailties.  After the multiple misunderstandings and betrayals, we find both Juliette Marny and Paul Deroulede condemned by the court, in the cart surrounded by the National Guard, and en route to prison, through which they will quickly pass to the embrace of Madame Guillotine.  How can they possibly escape?  Readers who have already made the acquaintance of the Scarlet Pimpernel in Orczy's novel of that name will understand that very little is beyond the wiles of this Englishman bent on thumbing his nose at the revolutionary government by spiriting its prey to the safety of his own country.  His swashbuckling plan to rescue the condemned is the epitome of derring-do and is fully worthy of this surprising English gentleman.  If I find anything in this novel to rebuke, it may be Orczy's incessant painting of the revolutionary government and of the Parisian mobs in the darkest, filthiest, and most noisome colors she can create.  Not to sound as an apologist for the horrors of the First Republic, but I did find the constant portrayal of its proponents as the most loathsome and nastiest of creatures to be annoying after a time.  In this regard, Orczy not only made her point early but kept making it at every turn in the story.  The plot would not have suffered from a little less vehemence and less heavy-handedness in her descriptions.  One can find, amidst the swashbuckling adventure of this novel, a few moral lessons, too, especially one relating to the title.  It is Juliette's oath, which she allows to supercede God's injunction to leave vengeance to Him, that is the root of the major crises in the story.  Of course, had she followed God's word, rather than that of her dying and revenge-bent father, there would have been no story.  I am reminded that the first novel in the Pimpernel genre was originally written as a stage play. It is an easy transformation to see I WILL REPAY recast as a play as well, and it would be a most entertaining diversion.  In either case, whether reading it in its actual form as a novel or playing it on the stage in one's mind, one will enjoy the experience of being in the audience as Baroness Orczy's story unfolds 
 I read this book in 3 days.  I love Koontz & this was another page turner.  The ending was a bit "blah" but the beginning & middle were captivating.  Read if you're a Koontz follower 
 Well worth the $, but mostly if you want to relive the beautyof the movie. This has all the scenes and breathtaking backgrounds inone book. It makes a lovely addition to a library, movie, or anime collection. It is a joy just to feel its slight heaviness in your hands, flip through the pages, and wonder at the artwork.  The artwork itself is a collection of cels, image boards, sketches, story boards, and other of the like. It is interesting to see how the main characters were designed, and what went into this film that is now so loved. Several pages of the book are also dedicated to the history of "Princess Mononoke," Studio Ghibli, and Hayao Miyazaki.  For people interested in the computer graphics, there is a section in the latter part of the book that tells of the steps taken to create certain scenes.  Also an added bonus, poems written by Hayao Miyazaki are included to describe the characters of the film.  All in all, every aspect of this book is a treasure, and will be greatly appreciated by any fan of anime or fine art.  EN 
 There seems little point to classifying this music. When standard tunes from the American Songbook and jazz idioms such as swing and bebop spark little to no recognition among the general public, music that could once be called "experimental" or "avant garde" necessarily defines the modern mainstream. If there are similarities with early landmark recordings (e.g. Miles Davis' 70s fusion groups),  "Lawn Chair Society" would definitely qualify as the less raw and extemporaneous, more polished and civil descendant of its once-controversial forebears.  Aside from electronics and musical synthesis, three qualities in particular stand out about this music: composition is emphasized above improvisation; creativity and craftsmanship count for more than interpretation and invention (both of which require a standard repertoire); tonal colors, dynamics and humor receive the kind of attention they enjoyed with Duke Ellington, before the "bebop revolution."  Lest any listeners require the "jazz" label to enjoy this music, Kenny Werner has called on the A Team for this multifarious collection of tone poems and programmatic pieces. The trumpet of Dave Douglas and bass clarinet of Chris Potter descend on "Lo's Garden" like a busy, darting pair of humming birds (joined at the hip, naturally). Soon a more vegetative pace is established by Scott Colley's firmly grounded bass while Brian Blade's percussion alternates between following movement at the sub-particle and quantum-field levels. Meanwhile, Werner's keyboards paint patterns in waves of sound, moving from prepared piano to phased Fender wahs, with a dab of string synth for highlighting.  "Burble_burble_spleek" is as onomatopoeic as the title--wind chimes, telephone rings and Douglas playing some of the most vocalized (and intestinal) trumpet sounds this side of Clark Terry and Rex Stewart. "Uncovered Heart," a calming guitar-like ballad in E Major, is soon followed by the ambitious title number-- a collage of funked-up chatter, vocalized demagoguery by each horn player, some thoughtful discourse by Werner on piano, a ghostly dirge-like refrain intoned by unison horns, and finally the faint sounds of birds and hunters (certainly not a reference to a familiar White House-Halliburton figure?).  Closure comes not with a bang but with "Loss," essentially a richly-textured chorale by synthesized strings, followed by "Kothbiro," an extended peaceful incantation based on a simple African melody.  In conclusion, if "Kind of Blue" and Bill Evans' Vanguard Sessions are in your blood, this one is unlikely to replace either one.  All the same, it's well-conceived, smartly-executed, cutting-edge mixed-genre jazz 
 This book is one of the clearest explanations of the creative process of an artist available anywhere. Shahn speaks of painting, of course, but his lucid, interesting text, his ideas and explorations, apply to artists in any field. Highly recommended 
 This short and focused book offers five suggestions to help lower our society's overall healthcare expenses, improve availability, while putting it on a more sound footing for controlling future cost growth.  Discussing healthcare is a complicated issue and much of the public discussion is distorted by various kinds of self-interest, lack of knowledge about the technical aspects of the problem (both medical and economic), and different views of what the desirable outcomes would be.  This one hundred-page book is a wonderful basic foundation so we can discuss the health care issues from a common ground.  Our present private health care system suffers from several market distortions that prevent efficiencies.  First, it arose from a wartime wage & price controlled economy in 1942 when companies began offering "fringe benefits" since they couldn't raise wages.  The next biggest problem is that what we really have is pre-paid healthcare rather than true insurance.  Insurance is based on the notion of sharing risk not the notion of no-risk no cost.  Imagine if we have pre-paid lunches.  Wouldn't the natural inclination be to consume bigger lunches than you normally would?  Maybe even combine two meals of the day?  You would not want to be paying for something you weren't getting the full benefit from, so you would over consume and costs would rise.  That would spur the desire for more consumption and a vicious cycle gets worse.  The notion that healthcare should be provided at no cost is pernicious.  The government has no money of its own so we have to pay for our healthcare even if the government "provides" it.  But worse than the payment problems this causes is the notion that we should be free to use our income on everything else but healthcare and that somehow when we use our own income for healthcare we view it as a kind of oppression.  However, we use our income for many less necessary and some very foolish things.  The amount of money we waste on foolish things like diet fads, pills, patent medicines, magnets & bracelets that do nothing, and various quack treatments has got to be a large fraction of our actual health care expenditure.  We need to spend our money on health with greater awareness and understanding.  So, what are the five recommendations the authors make in this book?    1)	Change the tax law to reduce the preference for medical-care purchases through employer-based insurance.  This is an important change because it will allow for people to make health care purchases with their own income and buy their own insurance with PRE-TAX dollars.  As it is now, everything is biased towards shifting it to the employer program because anything we pay for is AFTER-TAX and therefore much more costly.  Since everything is pushed to the employer pre-paid healthcare it exacerbates the over consumption problem.  2)	Reform regulation markets for health insurance.  This is about lowering costs by making national insurance pools and reforming state specific regulations that add unusual costs to the insurance market through specific popular mandates.  This is the suggestion I am least comfortable with, however I do understand the notion and think it is definitely worth investigating.  What we don't want is a national reform that solely benefits the insurance industry shareholders at the expense of the insured the way our, say, sugar supports keep us paying four times the world price for sugar.  3)	Expand provision of health information.  This has two components.  The first is to limit discoverability of information that flows between organizations with the purpose of quality improvement.  The second is to rate organizations and doctors in a way that provides good information to consumers of healthcare.  While I like the notion in the simple abstract, the real problem with this is, for example, that not all cardiologists have the same risk profile of patient.  Nor are all the same in their approach to patients.  All systems of "grading" are subject to gaming and I wonder how this will be prevented in such a national system.  4)	Control anticompetitive behavior by providers and insurers.    Yes, we do need real markets for market forces to do their work in cost containment.  But, yes, businesses and businessmen (and women) do want to limit competition and enhance profits (rent seeking behavior in economic terms).  So, one of the very most important things our lawmakers and regulators can do is ensure that a strong market and strong competition exists.  There is evidence that hospitals and insurers are working to limit competition and using their influence with lawmakers to strengthen their position and raise costs.  This is quite important.  5)	Reform the malpractice system.  There is no question that the lottery approach to non-economic damages has driven up insurance costs to the point that access to health care providers in some states is impaired.  We definitely need to control non-economic costs of malpractice lawsuits.  The other aspect of reform, since these kinds of mistakes are well known and the process well understood, is to do what we can in holding down legal costs.  This is fought tooth and nail by trial lawyers because they make tens of millions of dollars from these lawsuits.  However, those tens of millions of dollars going to lawyers do not help the healthcare of anyone except the lawyers and the families and their employees.  You can see that I have difficulties with some aspects of the proposals in this book and you will likely have some of your own.  However, I think they make a great place to start the discussion we must have for the reform that will come one way or the other.  I just hope we have the will to make it a strong, active, and constructive reform rather than a passive contraction that will do much more harm than good 
 These shorts are very comfortable. and would reccommend them to everyone. I will be odering another pair soon 
 This is great. First of all I love Tamilee's "no fluff" style, she is concise and to the point. This is a great toning video that I do on days when I'm not doing aerobics. The first workout hits all the major muscle groups, the second is weak on abs, but hits everything else, and with the workouts being only 15 minutes each, I usually do some additional toning exercises or videos to round it out. Very good video 
 Today the material covered in this book would be called real and complex analysis.  Given the deepness of the subject, it is a fairly well written measure theoretic book which should supplement books like Rudin or Royden.  The material contained is not only essential for deeper forrays into functional analysis, but serves as a foundation to mearsure theoretic probability theory essential to understanding the pricing of stock options with the Ito calculus Why?  As options are modeled by stochastic differential equations, their quadrature requires a much more general theory of integration than even the Riemann-Stieltjes integral.    Only warning: The tack taken by this book seems to be old fashioned relative to the standard analysis texts of both Rudin and Royden.  Sincerely,  Alex Alaniz Ph.D.  1. Please see the reviews of my own strong science fiction book: Beyond Future Shock about the near-terms perils and promise of advanced bio/nano technology in a world still roiled with Middle Age religious conflict and ever growing extreme wealth gradients.  2. I have REVIEWED many books from undergraduate to graduate in: PHYSICS, MATH, ECONOMETRICS, and HISTORY among other areas 
 "The Return of the King" completes "The Lord of the Rings" history as two books with the first reporting the assault by Sauron's evil forces against his enemies and the final book following the covert mission of Frodo and Samwise the Hobbits.  The author successfully combines individual emotion and vast warfare in a dark yet delightful fantasy.  Various fascinating events transpire, Gandalf finally displays awesome powers, King Theoden of the Rohirrim becomes a stronger secondary character, and even Merry and Pippin the Hobbits become independently formidable.  The storyline shows every character having an important part and making heart-wrenching sacrifices to ensure a victory in the fight against evil.  "The Return of the King" resumes the divided separate group plotlines from the original Fellowship instead of intermixing them down a chronological perspective.  The method might be confusing but minor references and a moderately short time span helps organize the proceedings.  Not only does the reader comprehend the lasting effects of the epic battle years later, presenting a thorough account of actions and the consequences, but also discovers the enormous depth into the genealogy and language inside the different cultures in the appendices.  The collection I own has "The Hobbit" along with all books of "The Lord of the Rings" and contains inside the final novel a comprehensive appendices and index, the ultimate standard for any author wishing to compile a comprehensive series.  As with about every film-based novel, I would suggest at least not watching the movie prior to reading the book if not forgoing the movie (although it is one of the greatest movies of all time) thereby leaving the story entirely to the imagination.  I highly recommend the book collection to any fan of the fantasy genre.  Thank you 
 I was surprised to see the results the prior reviewer had in using these music CD-Rs.  I have been using the Maxell CD-Rs for three years and I have never had a problem.  The home audio CD Recorder that I use is the Sony RCD-W1 and I get a perfect copy every time with the Maxell CD-Rs.  I know some CD burners on PCs can use music/audio CD-Rs to make copies but I know that there are occasional burn/read errors when using them.  In that situation, I suggest sticking to regular CD-Rs.  I have a stack of burned Maxell CD-Rs that I am alwasys listening to in my car and to date play flawlessly 
 I do agree that "The General" should have been on the top 100 list. Buster Keaton is the icon of the successful comedy writer/director/actors in the 1920's. It just so happens that "The General" is a history lesson as well, and scholars at the time felt that this movie was about as authentic looking as a Matthew Brady photograph of the Civil War. It contains the most expensive stunt done up to that time-the locomotive plunging into the river (not a model). The movie was a labor of love from Keaton and crew and deserves to find a place in movie history long after other silents of the era have disintegrated. After viewing this movie, go on to "Our Relations" and the other fine(and perhaps funnier) movies that Keaton made, and discover the two-reelers, especially "Cops". But this one is special. It is right out of your history book.   
 This is clearly one of the best collections of Gershwin's ever-lasting musical masterpieces. Rhapsody in Blue is a favorite piece, and the cd contains many songs sung by some of the greatest singers, including Ella Fitzgerald. If you've been searching for the perfect gershwin cd, consider purchasing this particular one 
 anyone interested in a truly good book.  I believe a person who has had to overcome obstacles are sources of inspiration for those who want to learn from her struggles.   My husband, who has never read any of Dr. Maya Angelou's works can't wait to get his hands on this one.  I will purchase this book AGAIN for my library collection and add it as a must read to my children's school curriculum 
 I absolutely LOVE this book.  I grabbed a pile of books at the bookstore and looked through each one carefully before selecting this one.  It is the only best-selling guide written by a doctor with millions of copies sold.  And I know why now that I own it!!  I don't see the negative like some readers do.  It is written by a doctor, so it provides a lot of info that you'd get by talking with your doctor every day!  So there are things that you should know about even if you don't want to hear it or don't think it will happen to you!  It explains things such as bleeding during pregnancy, some common medications to avoid to prevent birth defects, pollutants to avoid and why, STDS during pregnancy, nutrition and sources/serving sizes, how your actions affect your baby's development (vaccinations, smoking, xray, falling, safety, etc.), possible tests, required tests, lying on your back, rh-sensitivity, douching, sex, backaches, exercise guidelines, air travel, car safety, breastfeeding, pregnancy discomforts (hemmorhoids, constipation, backaches, foot swelling, dizziness, breast itching, cramping, contractions), infections, hot tubs, jaundice...  It really is like having a doctor's advice for each week of your pregnancy.  It relieved alot of the worrying about symptoms I was experiencing, realizing that I was "normal".  It is very exciting to read each week's development and be able to check out the illustration of the baby's actual size and shape, read what I may be expecting (nausea, ultrasounds, testings, baby kicks, belly size, wt. gain).  Every week I sit on the couch and read aloud to hubby and we marvel at all the changes and progress this book explains each week.  Sometimes I even read ahead a few weeks because it reveals so many interesting changes occurring that you couldn't possibly know otherwise.  There are tips provided for each week and common concerns addressed that are very important during each week of pregnancy.  It is an invaluable resource!  I've learned so much from this book, I highly recommend it 
 ONE OF THE BEST CD'S I HAVE EVER PURCHASED.  LOVE IT!!  LOVE IT!! LOVE IT! 
 This is a great Lee Marvin classic with lots of pace. Script is excellent and Lee plays his part as the done wrong gangster to the hilt. As good as some of the Dirty Harry movies. Rent it before buying to be on the safe side 
 I was a bit hesitant to listen to this book after reading so many negative reviews here.  Maybe it translates differently on audio than it did to the reviewers who read it on paper because I thought it was a wonderful and heartwarming story about two very likable journalists who find love and healing in the face of war's tragedies.  Secondary characters added further depth and interest, as do the detailed settings and the journalist's eyewitness descriptions of the more personal side of war.  Highly recommended 
 It was in v. good condition and the book was useful for us in building some web standards through our organizatio 
 I had a baby six months ago and I have never in my life had a problem with losing weight.  For some reason, I was not losing the weight and I was eating right and working out.    Due to my time constraints with the new baby, going to the gym was not happening.  I wanted to be able to work out at home.  I was watching the travel chanel and they had a segment on getting back into your summer bathing suit.  At this point, I would be happy to just get back into my jeans.  The author of 6 weeks to a Hollywood Body was on this show and was showing some exercises that was simple and could be done with just an excercise ball.  I got the book and read it cover to cover.  Great book.  What was even more interesting was that I had a question about how to do one specific work out move and the book has an email address where you can send questions to the author.  2 days after sending the email, the author responded and answered my questions.  Very cool!  I have already seen changes in my body and perhaps it is because I am hitting areas that I have never used before and my body is responding to it.  Ladys, if you just had a baby, you need this book.  
 While working on my BA in Religious Studies at CSUF in '74 I took a course in 'Jewish Mysticism' taught by the distinguished and late Rabbi Joseph Kalir. Our one and only textbook for that class was Gershom Scholem's 'Kabbalah.'  This is not an easy read by any means, not one of those recent releases that have become so popular in the last couple of years. One of those, 'Living Better Through Kabbalah' pieces of trash. This is the real thing. 'Kabbalah' will demand your time and attention to read and understand, but if you put in the supreme effort you will be rewarded with real knowledge and depth of what awaits for the true devotee. It's a book you'll keep in your library and refer back to over and over again because there's no way to remember so much.  One of the essential texts on the subject. If you haven't read this, you aren't a kabbalist. 
 Book in perfect condition and came fast. Thank you so much! 
 I liked NIGHTMARES and DREAMSCAPES better.  Personally I thought the selection of stories were better more in terms of Horror.  Physical Horror.  That being said, EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL is still a wonderful collection of short stories from the Horror master, Stephen King.  Each tale flows nicely through the entire book, not one story feels out of place.  "Dark Tales" is the perfect description of what kind of stories are in EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL.  Leaning more twords horrifying situations rather than Horror stories (in the physical sense), the book goes for more of a realistic type of Horror.  Psychopaths and torture instead of demons from another world in otherwords.  Thats not to say EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL dosn't have it's fair share of truely horrifying stories, full of monsters and demons.  The tale "1408" is a brooding and creepy story about a haunted hotel room that haunts the readers mind long after finishing it.  "Autopsy Room Four" is another terrifying story about someone trapped in their own mind and about to under go the knife.  My favorite story of them all is "The Man In The Black Suit" which feels the most like "classic" Stephen King.  Over all, this is a great collection of his work (I think alot of these stories were written during different years) and is a perfect addition to anyones Stephen King collection.  Personally speaking, if your new to the world of King I think you should start with NIGHTMARES and DREAMSCAPES (short stories seem to win people over) and then buy EVERYTHING'S EVENTUAL.  The two books almost feel like they belong together.  Horror fans, check it out!    
      The perfect collection of Samuel Beckett's shorter works. A resource that no home library should be without 
 Kat Larson weighs 217 pounds and wears a size 18, and she's not happy about it.  Her online boyfriend, gorgeous British journalist Nick, thinks she's a size four (a fact that is only confirmed by the picture Kat sent him, which she doctored with PhotoShop).  Nick's been pressuring Kat to meet, but Kat knows that's not possible at her current size.  So when a friend tells her about a new reality show called 'From Fat to Fabulous,' Kat jumps at the opportunity to audition.  It's the perfect chance for her to finally become the size four Nick already thinks she is.    But when she is cast on the show, Kat begins to realize that there's more to the program than just losing weight.  Her journey 'From Fat to Fabulous' isn't going to be all smooth sailing -- especially not with a vindictive, snobby castmate, the knowledge that the media has dubbed her "Kat the Brat," and an unpleasant surprise that turns her world upside down.  This was such a fun book to read.  THE NEXT BIG THING takes readers behind the scenes of a reality television show, revealing the manipulation the producers engage in to achieve ratings.  The interaction between the contestants on the show is authentic, even though sometimes the dialogue is questionable.  And Kat, although at times she can be whiny and unreasonable, is a well-written heroine.  Her narration is thoughtful and honest, and I'm glad she got her happy ending.   If you're a fan of chick lit, THE NEXT BIG THING is a must-read.  Johanna Edwards has written a witty, entertaining, heartfelt treat of a book about two of life's most major addictions:  food and reality TV. And at the same time, Edward's touching on a major issue for many women today --  the issue of body image and weight -- and she does so with both sensitivity and irreverence.  While she's not quite at Jennifer Weiner's level yet, I'm sure we can expect lots of great escapist fiction from Edwards in the future 
 PURE GERSHWIN is just that, pure!.  Feinstein interprets Gershwin the way it was meant to be performed.  This is pure delight 
 This scholarly yet extremely accesible study of anxiety--from philosophical, social, theological, literary, cultural as well as biological perspectives--was first published in 1950, and updated by May in  1977. It is still the widest-ranging, richest, most intelligent and  insightful exploration of anxiety currently available in one volume. In  this postmodern era of hyperbiologism (which presumes anxiety and other  symptoms to hold only physical meaning) and resulting wildly popular  pharmacological treatments for anxiety, May reminds readers that anxiety  has much more than mere biochemical causes and physiological significance:  anxiety, insists May, is not necessarily pathological, but rather, a  meaningful, necessary, vital and ultimately inextricable aspect of human  existence 
 Ever since I first discovered the original Ghosts of Albion production on BBC Online, I was hooked in by the dynamic duo of William and Tamara Swift, created by the equally dynamic duo of Christopher Golden and Amber Benson.  Accursed is a continuation of the original tale of a reluctant brother and enthusiastic sister who prematurely inherited their grandfather's magical birthright as the Protectors of Albion (England) from supernatural evils. Along with the spirts of Lord Admiral Horatio Nelson, Lord Byron, and Lady Bodicea, the two fought a great demon and now fight to free their father from the possession of another demon.  In Accursed, the two are back fighting more evil while trying to also balance their own lives. William is the straight man, more responsible and more reluctant to accept his role as a Protector, while Tamara is headstrong in an era where such an aspect in a woman was discouraged. The two manage to work together well, even with their frequent bickering as brother and sister butt heads.  Accursed is gripping and entertaining. It was difficult to put it down. Golden and Benson are an excellent team 
 This is a great film, period! If you have not seen the film, get it at your video store and rent it. I own it, but as CRITERION DVDs can be a little expensive, I don't wish to urge you to buy it until you see it. I am sure, however, that once you do, you will purchase it. Especially if you are a lover of history or politics. The film has been discussed here at length, and I must admit, they are some of the best reviews I have ever read on DVDs. There are some very intelligent reviews on this particular DVD. I remember first watching this film in a class on Nationalism and Colonialism, while I was an undergraduate at UCLA. This film is great, and I have always remembered the discussion following the film.   The events of the film takes place during the period of the French occupation of Algeria, from 1954-1957. What amazed me about the film is that these are not actors. [Not professional]. This is the real deal here. No manicured nails and chauffer driven stars on this set. The Algerian government intended this film to be as realisitic as possible. Their victory over the French was not going to be some silly parade of stars. No way, this was for prosterity: And the film shows it. The film is done in a documentary style, so that the viewer gets a better feel for the events the would eventually lead to Algeria's independence. There is also an ugly side to the conflict as the French are hell-bent on keeping Algeria. The film is shot in black and white, and this was a very wise decision. It is much better with the grainy black and white than you could ever imagine. Highly recommmend. [Stars: 5+

 I bought this DVD for a trip down memory lane and ended up splitting my sides laughing.  I knew going in that the production values were lacking and the editing worse.  I was there in the clubs in the 70's & 80's and I remember the SuperFly wannabes in their Sammy Davis suits .  The bad, and I don't mean good, wardrobe in the film will have you talking to the TV. And Dolomite is no clothes horse.  With that big butt and waist he certainly doesn't look like a kung fu master. Pimp?! He's pigeon-toed and walks like Andy Griffith. The love scenes are cut so poorly you'll howl!  The music resembles nothing I ever heard in that era and in the club scenes, the entertainment will have you screaming with their choreography & costumes. With the overt racism, sophomoric profanity & too many other corny things to count, this movie is great for a laugh when I am bored.  This movie should be on a list with "Plan X from Outer Space 
 The Big Sky is not just a masterpiece, it's probably THE masterpiece of the genre of western frontier fiction.  This is unusual because it deals with a moment in time that isn't really dealt with that much - the Rocky Mountain fur trade during its golden age of about 1820 - 1850.  The cowboy era has been responsible for most of western film and literature, partly because the images and events that happen in that world are recognizable to us: the economic and social issues you always see dealt with in "cowboy" movies mirror our own experiences in many ways.  The cowboy has also been said to be an image of freedom to Americans, when actually nothing was further from the truth.  Cowboys were regular working stiffs, about as romantic as carpenters or plumbers in their own day.  They didn't consider themselves "free", nor would they have spent much time thinking about it during their brutal 14 hour work day.  They did what they did because they loved horses and riding and cattle and it was good honest work that paid a living wage, and there was a bit of swagger to it - people in town recognized cow hands for the tough-as-leather men they were, especially with their characteristic boots and hats and general flair for the dramatic that many had.  But it was backbreaking work, and the entire cowboy heydey lasted less than 30 years.  I said all that to say that "The Big Sky" really is about freedom, and really is about the West.  It's about the true, wild, primitive west, before the plow, before roads, when there were still huge, intact Indian cultures in place with armies of horsemen and enormous herds of buffalo.  So it's interesting to me that this genre is largely ignored, but I can see why - there are no set-piece plots just begging to be turned into movies - no "new sherriff in town" characters, because there are no sherriffs, and no towns other than a few trading posts.  There is only the land and the sky and the interaction between a few incredibly brave white men and all those Indians.  If you don't already know, this is the story of Boone Caudill and his friend Jim Deakins, and several important side characters, but it's basically Boone's book.  He's driven west by an aching need for wildness and freedom, and is pushed out by a brutal father.  He makes his way west to St. Louis, along the way befriending Deakins, in hopes of meeting his uncle Zeb who had become a trapper years earlier.  The rest of the tail is complex and interlaced, and not a simplistic good guy/bad guy plot at all, and what stands out is the crystalline depictions of the people and places and over all, arching like the sky itself, is freedom.  Freedom to roam at will in that beautiful country is the main character of this book.  Freedom is the religion, the politics, the philosophy, the recreation - it is everything that is important.  The trappers are there to trap - sure - but they're really there because this is a wild, free place, where they will not be hampered by rules, where they can be natural men.  It sounds over romanticized, but it really did happen that way, and from what we know, that is truly the way they felt about their lives and why they endured the agonies of that existence.  Despairing that new settlers are moving west and building farms and towns, Boone cries "Lord, Jim - remember the Tetons standing proud in the sun, and the Seeds Ke Dee...don't you remember her when she was all purty and new and not a man track on her save Injun?"  This novel makes you sob like few I've ever read.  The sense of loss, the closing of an age of the world, hangs in the air like mist.  They are going to be the last to see something so precious, and for their pains they get to watch their world wither and die under the press of settlement.  The movie "The Mountain Men" with Charleton Heston comes close to capturing a tiny bit of this book, and you can tell it's inspired in many ways by it, but no other book or film has ever come close to truly painting the world of the mountain man as has this novel.  "Jeremiah Johnson" is another good film, with many fine touches.  But if you want to follow the water up stream, back to its source in the mountains, then please, before you grow too old, read "The Big Sky" and open your heart to that time and place and the wild, brazen beauty of the America few Americans know ever existed 
 This book allows the non sewer to make all sorts of great things. I just built a new house, and I wanted to decorate without spending a lot of  money.  I saved over $500 making these things rather than purchasing them.  I do not own a sewing machine, but I made pillows, lampshades, draperies,  and much more.  This book tops my "Best Buy" list.  Incredibily  easy to follow 
 Get ready for this workout. The beginner DVD's are butt kickers for a 1/2 hour workout. The advanced DVD's are killer. I definitely got my money's worth with this set. There's no excuse not to be in better shape if you have this product. 
 For the reader that is tired of the same old stories of tough, hard-drinking detectives in Los Angeles or New York, Lynda La Plante offers a refreshing detective in a tale from London that has a gratifyingly authentic flavor. There is a hint of La Plante's excellent Prime Suspect television series, and a hint of Jack the Ripper in this story of bright, young Detective Sergeant Anna Travis, daughter of the late Detective Chief Superintendent Jack Travis. Anna is chosen by Detective Chief Inspector Langton to join his team investigating a series of murders of prostitutes. There is almost no evidence identifying anyone as the killer, but the team continues to dig until they uncover puzzling clues pointing to a handsome, famous movie star. It seems unlikely that this wealthy man is the murderer, but as the investigation continues, he turns his charm toward Anna. Or is he stalking her? Suspense builds until we reach a gripping climax to a most enjoyable story 
 Though the language is contemporary for its time (1860), and it is written in the style of a serial (thus in the author's interest to make it extend out a bit), this is a good story.  The plot device is quite inventive, the story gets better in the second half, and the final chapters are quite entertaining. 
 My husband and I have loved doing the "date nights" in this book.  I feel so special when he is planning and carrying out his dates, and I feel so close to him while I am planning and carrying out my dates!  This is a great plan and so easy to follow!  I highly reccommend it! 
 Dalbey doesn't just assess the problems with masculinity in America (and the American church) today, but gives incredible insights on how to turn things around in your life.  I wish more men would read this book and apply its message 
 Richard McMurry takes a look at the two largest armies in the Confederacy in what is, as the title indicates, an extended essay. The Army of Northern Virginia, ably led by Robert E. Lee, was able to compile a large number of impressive victories during the war. The Army of Tennessee, led by various men of less than stellar ability, was only able to win at Chickamauga, and even that victory proved barren strategically. The author considers various factors that affected the two, including geography, logistical concerns, leadership on all levels (particularly among lower level officers), pre-war militia systems in Virginia and Tennessee, and even the Federals who faced each army. He concludes that in every case, the Army of Northern Virginia benefited from these factors while the Army of Tennessee was negatively affected. I have seen it stated in several places that McMurry is saying that the men of the Army of Northern Virginia were better than the men of the Army of Tennessee. I did not get this sense from my reading of the book. Instead, McMurry is stressing that the men in leadership positions in each army were very different. The vast majority of the men who had graduated from military schools such as West Point, VMI, and the Citadel were concentrated in the Army of Northern Virginia to that army's immense benefit. The Army of Tennessee started out with many men who were untrained in the art of war, and that army's problems were exacerbated as casualties started to deprive it of even the small number of leaders who had that previous military experience. In other words, McMurry believes the raw material was there to work with, but the Army of Tennessee did not have experienced men available in large enough numbers to work with this raw material.  The last chapter of the book discusses the views of historians Thomas Connelly and Albert Castel on Robert E. Lee and also looks at the ways in which the Confederate government, specifically Jefferson Davis, could have prosecuted the war. McMurry sides with Castel in defending Lee from Connelly's attacks, and stresses that the Confederates were right to try to win the war in the east. With that said, the author believes the war was eventually won in the west by the Federals. I found it somewhat odd that McMurry would quote Connelly's entirely negative opinions on the western generals and agree with them while at the same time defending Lee from the same negative opinions. In a way, this did make sense, as it fits McMurry's own views on the generals of each theater. Perhaps Connelly is just a negative historian in general, however. Reading this book has increased my interest in Connelly's two volume history of the Army of Tennessee, and that set has moved much higher up my reading list as a result.  Overall, I enjoyed McMurry's short work, finishing it over one weekend in just three sittings. It really is startling to see how many trained military men ended up in the Army of Northern Virginia for various reasons at the expense of other Confederate armies. Likewise, it was illuminating to see all of the other advantages, intentional or otherwise, which were routinely provided to the Confederacy's largest army. This particular book is directed at students of these two largest Confederate armies and of Confederate grand strategy during the Civil War. I definitely recommend it to any student of the war 
 The cover design is well made based on the requirements. The problem according to me is the device not be able to avoid the dust on the LCD screen because of the openings on both the sides. In my opinion, compared to all other covers, this is a simple design and will allow you to easily insert and remove the BlackBerry out of the case 
 This book is about a boy named Billy.  He chose to take a dare from his friend, Allan.  This dare has to do with Billy eating 15 worms in 15 days and getting $50.00 if he wins.  Billy takes the dare because (1) he wants a minibike that costs $50.00 and (2) he takes any dare.  I do recommend this book because you will be surprised to know what will happen...will he win or lose the bet, or will he get sick trying 
 Sweet made some amazing predictions about postmodern culture in this boo 
 In a series of erudite essays, author Alain de Botton recognizes travel to be more than the act of physically transporting oneself to another place. The travel industry is quick to tell us where to go but not how and why. It should be cathartic and emotionally fulfilling, yet many feel that once they arrive at their destinations, that the pleasures of travel takes care of itself at that point. For example, the author shares in one essay how he found himself in Madrid for the first time and admitted to the paralyzing fact that he cannot bring himself to go alone to a restaurant. His solution is to eat a packet of crisps from the hotel mini-bar. On the following day, instead of exploring Madrid, he lies in bed dreaming of his flight home. Moreover, when he decides to enjoy the sights, he decides to take a tour bus to avoid doing any research on his own.  His anecdotes raise good questions about the true art of travel - that we should not be tyrannized by guidebooks, hypnotized to see great sights no matter how personally dull, nor hamstrung by souvenir purchases as disposable reminders of exotic locales. What de Botton does particularly well is give voice and meaning to the multitude of epiphanies brought about by his own voyaging and mixing his own experiences with observations made by the great artists and writers. The author points out, for example, how we can learn the poetry of train journeys, gas stations and half-empty cafés from Hopper and from Wordsworth, we can certainly improve our appreciation of landscape. De Botton's writing flourishes when he describes the detail of images, even if his insatiable desire for revelation can get a bit wearing and trite. For example, he can look at the particular font and color in the signage at Schipol airport and see a certain level of exotica which lends insight into the culture and history of the Netherlands.  Interestingly, for all the minutiae presented, the author omits one of travel's most fulfilling aspects, people. There is much to be learned from the locals, perhaps over a drink at a cocktail bar, but this seems to be more burdensome for the author than he feels it is worth. Apart from his solitary mode of travel, the problem lies in the diversity of his subject. We all travel for different reasons, whether it be relaxation, work, adventure or self-fulfillment. He doesn't really acknowledge what motivates certain journeys for some people. Regardless, de Botton knows the fundamental fact that the pleasure we derive from travel is more dependent on one's mindset from the outset rather than the destination to which we travel. Finding the rewards from travel, no matter how much closer the world has gotten to our doorsteps, is as difficult as ever and just as rewarding 
 I got my movie in great time and it was in great conditio 
 These were different than what I had read about or expected.  I found that removing the discs a bit awkward...requiring that fingers touch the recorded surface....if not careful. Some people might find it a bit difficult. Ideal for minimum storage space...etc 
 This is perhaps Regardie's best book concerning high magic. The author begins by explaining the connection between the mind and the soul, psychology and magic and how the practice of magic can aid both spiritual and emotional balance. Also detailed is the alignment of the psyche on the Qabbalistic Tree of Life. Regardie goes on to explain how and why one should perform The Ritual of the Middle Pillar. Part two consist of further clarifications and techniques by the Ciceros, who knew Regardie well and are senior adepts in the Golden Dawn System. I highly recommend this book 
 Start with the reader having a very very British accent and add the magic that was (is) The Beatles and you have a audio book that often had me staying in my car just to finish a chapter. For the superfan, not a ton of new info on the boys (although the story about Yoko taking George's biscuits was golden) but hearing about the recording sessions from Geoff Emerick's perspective was well worth the price of admission.    
 Sleeping Murder begins with two newly weds making a living change from New Zeland to England. Gwenda begins to see visions in the house, such as the house appearance. She then find out this was once her very own house. She after begins to see visions of a woman being strangled. In the end the truth comes out, sometimes for the best and sometimes for the worst 
 For the baby boom generation, Woolworth's is a place of happy memories. From ice cream to records to toys. Woolworth's was the place to go. Remembering Woolworth's is a blast from the past about a delightful store  that is gone but never forgotten. Remembering Woolworth's chronicles the  origin of the stores and the importance of Woolworth's to our nation's  history 
 The book is good, but it is the book of two men, a young and an old, who are not the best of collaborators.  I think the young man to whom most of the adventures happen would have been more gossipy and excited about things were he not held in place by the distinguished older gentleman Ted Chapin of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization.  For example, if you read between the lines, it seems pretty clear that the young Ted was pretty much crushed out on the glamorous Hollywood hasbeen Yvonne de Carlo, who came to New York City in full glamor mode and took Ted out on a series of dates to the Stork Club et al, and that when she left his life she left a big hole in it.  But the older Ted sees ruefully that if it was a romance at all, it was pretty one-sided and potentially embarrassing.  So the issue is tabled.  I loved hearing all about how Sondheim created the score as the show was in tryouts; when it began only perhaps twenty minutes worth of music was finished, and the rest was created under intense pressure on the road in hotel rooms and coffee shops.  I liked hearing about Mathilde Pincus, the music copyist, and the book gave me a new word I had never heard before.  "She [Pincus] used a flat pen with black ink and wrote on 11" by 14" sheets of opaque paper called deschon, which had the musical staff lines printed in reverse on one side.  Writing with ink on the other side allowed for errors to be erased without affecting the staff lines."  I guess I had seen 'deschon" but never knew what it was, just like I went to see "Follies" with De Carlo, Smith, Collins, several times, and never really knew how it came to be created.  Thank God for Ted Chapin, the young one and the middle-aged man as well 
 I first heard about The Wailin' Jennies on "A Prairie Home Companion" on NPR, I think.  That one listen got me hooked.  Then I got a note about their new CD in an Amazon email, and I had to have it.  It's really great - they have clear, beautiful voices and the music is simple but gorgeous.  I have enjoyed it very much and listen to it often 
 As an artist, I knew I was going to a raised eyebrow or two when I installed Mathematica on my computer. Math isn't art, the naysayers would chant. Au contraire! And at last I have the book to prove it! Reading through normal Mathematica manuals gives you the briefest of cursory introductions to what the software can do in terms of graphics. Mr Trott's opus, however, was an answer to a prayer. In excruciating detail he takes you step by step, teaching you how to develop the graphics that indeed show you that Math is Art! Page after page took my breath away, both at the complexity of the math involved and at the bauty that results. Thank you 
 This is the one, the one book I feel anyone serious about herbs should have in their collection. It has proved invaluable to me in so many ways. It includes cosmetic and medicinal for most any herb you can think of. It is also good for information on traditional uses and background knowledge. It can be a bit overwhelming at first but once you get a grasp on how it is organised (it didn't take me long) it proves indespensible 
 To fully understand the movie, you'd have to read the book first.  But to fully appreciate the movie, its best to have not read the book and have an open mind to the differences.  The plot:  Charles Freck (Rory Cochrane) is covered in aphids. At least he thinks so.  Freck hangs out with Barris (Robert Downey Jr.) and Luckman (Woody Harrelson) and Bob Arctor's girlfriend Donna (Winona Ryder).   What Bob's roommates don't know is that there is more to Bob than his trivial job and his addiction. Bob Arctor is a narc called Fred (both played by Keanu Reeves), working for the Narcotics Division undercover. Whenever Fred enters the station to report, he wears a "scramble suit", so that he can't be identified. All narcotics officers wear them. When Fred is assigned to stake out his own identity in the drug world - Bob Arctor - things begin to fall apart for him.   At first, Fred finds it ironic that he is staking out himself, but as the drug corrodes his brain, literally splitting the hemispheres apart, Bob/Fred separate and reality twists into shivering fibers of uncertainty. Barris and Luckman start to behave strangely.   What will happen to Bob/Fred if he doesn't stop using Substance D? Why is Donna so standoffish if she likes Bob as much as she claims to? How deep can Bob/Fred go before something snaps inside his head? Or has it snapped already?   'A Scanner Darkly' is classic the author Philip K. D!ck. In his book, P.K.D. vividly paints the funnier antics of substance abuse, and the tragedies that follow. The conversations between the men when they are high are both pathetic and hilarious. It's pretty obvious the author had some experience walking the pretty path of flowering hallucinations.  In the movie, the dialogue fails a bit from P.K.D.'s formula.  It's harsher rather than poetic, as if to be more easily understood.  There's also limited time to bring the viewer into the world P.K.D. painted in the book.  A highpoint of the movie is the way it was filmed with real actors and then painted over to appear animated.  This worked extremely good to portray the "scramble suits".  It also lends itself to the surreal world-view of the addicted.  There's plenty of deception, and an ending that will leave you a bit surprised.  Overall, even if you've read the book and loved it, give the movie a try.  My recommendation is to rent before buying.  Enjoy! (My apologies on altering the name of the author, Philip K. D!ck in such a fashion, but Amazon believes the author's last name is a naughty word)  
 A more nearly accurate title would have been "A History of the western Christian church."  Johnson writes as though the Orthodox church had never developed.  This is not a fault, but readers should be warned at the beginning.  On the positive side, he describes in some detail the pre-Latin churches, whose existence has been glossed over by the modern  establishment, e.g. the Montanists and the clashing sects of North Africa.  Some of their views compare quite favorably with the stodgy Latin dogmas.  These chapters are some of the most enthralling.  The book is indeed written for the literate layman such as myself, but it contains a treasure trove of information; Johnson is no one's toady, in spite of the ad hominem attacks on his personal life.  It does not begin exactly where his "History of the Jews" ends, and the latter is considerably more interesting than the former.  I need say no more; the previous, excellent reviewer has said it well. 
 I've read all of Colleen Coble's books and I have to say, this one blew me away!  Using a protagonist with a handicap was a stroke of genius. . .makes you root for the heroine all the more. And the surprise appearance of some of Ms. Coble's favorites was a welcome delight. I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves romantic suspense--you won't be sorry 
 I started it Weds and I finished it Thursday.  I couldn't wait to get to the end but now I am sad that I did.  This is a story written with so much emotion and heart.  I am making my husband read it and when my kids get a little older I want them to read it too.  Great, great, great book 
 MaryJanice Davidson's book of short stories with all the characters being reflected around the Wyndham werewolves.  As usual in her books, the heroines are tough, loudmouth and ballsy chicks.  And I for one, really love reading about each and every one of them.  I bought the book for the story that links "Undead and Unreturnable" with "Undead and Unpopular".  The latter has the romance between George and Antonia already established where the former has really started forming the character of George.   After I read this, I was interested enough to hunt down a copy of Derik's Bane, which I also loved.  Not that I was that surprised!  I haven't yet found a MaryJanice Davidson story I haven't loved. 
 The title to this book is "blah blah blah SMALL-BATCH Preserving" not small container preserving. There isn't anything misleading about this book in the least. As someone who has canned huge and small quantities of fruits, vegetables, meats, sauces, chutneys, vinegars etc etc for more than 40 years, I know my way around the canner and the cookbook. This is a great book if you have just a bit of this and that or want to make your own chutneys for example. The chutneys in the store aren't fresh and are full of preservatives. You can gather up the ingredients fresh and in one short afternoon, have yourself some wonderful jars of condiments etc to share with your family and friends. This is a good book-you won't be disappointed if you are looking for recipes that will provide you with 2-3-4-5 half pints etc of whatever it is you are putting up. If you are a large scale canner like me but aren't interested in small quantities, this isn't the book for you. It's also great for just experimenting with new recipes you can develop into larger quantities later if you decide you like the 
 The premise of James M. Buchanan and Roger D. Congleton's book Politics by Principle, Not Interest is Buchanan's usual theme that majority-rules democracy inherently leads to less than perfect outcomes.  In theory, politics is driven by principles of fairness and justice.  In practice, however, politics is the outcome of a process in which various parties (voters, politicians, lobbyists, bureaucrats, etc.) are all tugging in different directions in pursuit of their own self-interest.  The outcome is unlikely to reflect the kind of political system to which most citizens would agree if they were designing it from scratch without regard for their own actual short-term interests.  The authors suggest this problem can be fixed in part by extending a legal principle, generality, to politics.  Generality refers to a lack of preferential treatment: people are to be seen as equals before the law, and equal treatment is to be the proper norm for the rule of law.  Discrimination is not acceptable, whether based on gender, race, ethnic background, or otherwise.  If the principle of generality were applied to politics, majority coalitions would no longer be allowed to treat different individuals and groups differently.  "The proper principle for politics is that of generalization or generality.  This standard is met when political actions apply to all persons independent of membership in a dominant coalition or an effective interest group.  The generality principle is violated to the extent that political action is overtly discriminatory in the sense that the effects, positive or negative, depend on personalized identification." (p. xix)  The authors discuss various applications of the generality principle to politics.  "Policy arguments in support of free, open, and nondiscriminatory trade; flatter and more uniform taxation; nonparticularized standards for environmental regulation and public-goods provision; devolution of political authority to more adequately defined areas of special benefits and against means testing for transfers--indeed against discriminatory treatment of any sort--these arguments find common philosophical grounding in the rule or norm for political generality." (p. 199)  Introducing generality in politics would not just increase fairness.  It would also increase efficiency.  Currently, vast amounts of money are spent on the effort of lobbying elected officials in order to gain an advantage in the tug-of-war of competing demands in the political process.  To the winners of this process, this is money well spent, but to society as a whole it is essentially a waste of resources that could otherwise have been used more productively.  A generality constraint would no longer make it worthwhile to spend money in this manner.  The book is less abstract and therefore perhaps more readable than some of the earlier volumes in the Buchanan Collected Works series.  The book is summarized in the paper "Generality as a Constitutional Constraint" in volume 1 of the series (pp. 419-428).  Note: Page numbers refer to the Buchanan Collected Works edition. 
 The brilliant author/writer/wordmaster Pat Conroy has always been my favorite all-time author.  I love his style, his way with words, his storylines, dialogue, description, and masterful similes.  Another Conroy fan once e-mailed me, asking if I knew anyone else who wrote as well as Conroy.  Well, I did a search and asked some of Amazon's top reviewers and they admitted they couldn't find anyone comparable in style, etc.  Well, now I have found Jodi Picoult and I think she's in the same league with Conroy.  Her style is decidedly different, but just as brilliant. MY SISTER'S KEEPER is a real page-turner and frighteningly thought-provoking.   For details of why this book is so great, please read Eileen Rieback's great review posted here.  She hits the high-points of the book much better than I ever could; all I know is that in author Jodi Picoult I have FINALLY found the PERFECT BOOK, comparable in brilliance to Pat Conroy.  I especially admired pages 308 through 322 where one of the Fitzgerald teen-agers enjoys her first boyfriend, her first "prom."  Picoult certainly understands teen-age angst.  If this chapter doesn't move you from the heights of joy to utmost sadness, nothing will.    Even in the midst of a long-awaited vacation I found my eyes glued to the pages of this book, abandoning many of the recreational plans I had made ... even abandoning work on my fourth and fifth novels.  Even as much as I hated for Picoult's amazing story to end, and the Fitzgeralds' family trauma to be resolved, I'm pleased to get back to my own writing ... and my personal vacation pursuits.  I have many author friends who have come out with potential best-sellers recently, but this book is undoubtedly the very best I have read since Pat Conroy's BEACH MUSIC.  It's a sure-fire winner with believable characters in a very timely, controversial situation that has been well-researched by Picoult, brilliantly and powerfully written.   The NEW YORK TIMES wrote following her debut novel, SONGS OF THE HUMPBACK WHALE (twelve books ago): "Picoult spreads her wings and catches an updraft."  To that I add: With this novel (her thirteenth) she now soars with the eagles. ... On second thought, make that angels!  WOW!  Wish I could write like her ... which is the same thing I've always said about Pat Conroy.  Now I have two favorites to aspire to.    Next I plan to read another of Picoult's books, THE TENTH CIRCLE, but NOT on THIS vacation. 
 A book not meant to do everything for all movie fans, but for its intended audience, highly useful - not as a replacement for Maltin's main book, Leonard Maltin's Movie & Video Guide, but as a supplement and complement. Don't buy it as your main guide or you will be disappointed: it has no movies newer than 1960. Also, the title can be confusing: classic here means old movies, not best movies. Some other reviewers here obviously did not understand that, and understandably felt cheated. For 31 years, I've found it hard to imagine selecting movies to watch on TV - and more recently movies to rent or buy on DVD - without Maltin's Movie and Video Guide. For handy, short reviews, it's usually reliable - at least for my taste, which runs from action to romance, mainstream to arty, foreign to old Hollywood. Probably like yours if you bother to read reviews. However, with newer movies forcing out older ones from the main guide, Maltin decided to create this one, allowing him to add back some he'd had to drop over the years, and also add in some there was never room for, because they were more obscure or not as good. (That includes some of the old B westerns of Rogers, Autry, Hopalong and early John Wayne.) There is not an extensive list of directors and only a partial list of the main stars. The idea of this book is to be able to haul it into the store, or keep it by your TV, to get a quick idea if a movie is worth catching. And, of course, for just pleasant browsing. For more detailed reviews or complete filmographies, you'll have to go to other books or websites. For newer movies, you'll need a different book such as the main Maltin. But if you think Turner Classic Movies is the greatest network in the universe, grab this baby 
 When three popular girls in high school (Courtney, Marcy and Julie) kidnap their best friend Elizabeth Purr on her birthday (as an innocent and friendly prank), they accidentally kill her by gagging her with a jawbreaker.  Stunned, the three still went to school that day and pretend nothing is wrong.  After school, they carry her corpse to her house and make it seem like she was raped.  When Fern, the school nerd goes to Liz's house to drop off her homework, she finds Elizabeth dead in her bed.  To make Fern not tell (and to save Courtney's reputation from going down the drain), Courtney makes Fern "one of them", flawless and beautiful, and uses her to replace Liz.  Vylette (Fern's new name given to by Courtney) goes day by day "beneath the stars" so to speak.  Fern was inspired by Elizabeth and wanted to be just like her, beautiful and popular.  One day, her parade was rained on when she did something to make Courtney and Marcy look bad, so Courtney took away Fern's popularity.  Her fifteen minutes of fame were up.    Since Courtney refused to tell the truth about Elizabeth's death, Julie decides to take matters into her own hands and find out a way to tell everyone.  One night, as Julie is going through some of Elizabeth's stuff, she comes across a voice greeting card.  Julie opened it and the card said, "I killed Liz, I killed the teen dream, deal with it!"  The card was of a previous prank.  Earlier in the movie, when Courtney, Marcy and Julie were at Elizabeth's house, Courtney accidentally rerecorded the message on the card.  On prom night, Courtney gets picked as prom queen.  In the middle of her speech, Julie's friend rewired the speakers, so that when Courtney paused, the whole school heard the message repeatedly: "I killed Liz, I killed the teen dream, deal with it!" 
 So, I bought the book to understand my child's learning style. Instead, I learned about mine. Is that so bad? No, not at all. I still can't classify my son's learning style. Oh well... 
 Instigator, insurgent happy punk Edwyn Collins almost died this year when his brain ruptured twice. Early sidekick James Kirk surfaced from nowhere last year to release an album that floated out into the ether and vanished. And here, at this late date, comes the re-re-release of one of the loveliest batches of singles a little indie kid could ever hope to drop on his virtual 45-playing platter. I came to these records back to front, starting my run and love affair with a 12-inch disc with a hyperbolic but infectious take on the old Al Green nugget "L.O.V.E" backed with the rave-up Intuition Pt. II and Moscow. From there I found, already obscure in the early '80's, the 45 singles: "Simply Thrilled Honey," "Blue Boy," "Poor Old Soul" and each was a revelation with a B-side every bit as good as the A. Here, in the middle of the punk heydey, with the corporate new wave reaction already developing (and, as a digression, a wonderful piece of work corporate rock never got credit for -- there were some great bands on the bigs back then and the labels must be given their due)come four Scottish boys not too smart for their own good, but very smart and very good, deciding that, using the Velvet Underground as a building block, they would turn punk on its head and ear by turning angry rebellion against the staid status quo into a celebration of awkward, crushingly in love, romantic youth. And they would do so with a delight in language and word play that was wrapped in a bundle of jangly, propulsive guitar joy. They were lo-fi and sweet and cute and if you got it, you loved them, and those who didn't loathed what they could not loosen up to enjoy. Stateside, they made narry a dent, except to lucky souls like myself who got switched on by a music head pal (and co-cab driver, who, like me, at the time, pretty much drove taxis as an excuse to listen to the radio all day without looking like a loafer). So, again, here we are, what? Twenty-some years later? And someone has seen fit to put this wonderful stuff out again -- and in America no less. Maybe they think Edwyn's brilliant but flukey late-model smash "A Girl Like You" still resonates with the music-buying public. Come on; no way. But still, if you have stumbled this far, and you fancy yourself playful and unabashadly pop loving and want to know where, say, Tiger Trap came from (let alone the ubiquitously name-checked Franz Ferdinand, who I don't particularly like), click this into checkout. All others: If you know Orange Juice and don't have these early gems -- buy, as well.  Note: The complete album included with the singles, the aborted "Ostrich Churchyard," really doesn't do it for me, hence a one-star deduction. The right proper release, "You Can't Hide Your Love Forever," is the true gem following the great singles, and is sited by many fans as a favorite album. Only curmudgeonly cave dwellers could insist that "Ostrich Churchyard" should have been the first album. It just isn't that hot; it has distant and echoey production; and is only intermittently as moving and fun as the early singles. Again, this is, for my ears, some of the best of the best, but not all of it. 
 This game did what the prequels couldn't for me... it drew me back into the Star Wars universe with a vengence.  I am not a real big gamer, and really don't like console games but this game is a must have for any fan, casual or hardcore.  Knights also comes in a PC version for those who don't have access to a console or like me don't really care for them.  In fact the PC version has more Mods available for it I believe so I would probably recommend it first.  Knights, or Kotor as it is known in the fan community is set 4000 years before A New Hope.  It's the sweeping tale of a talented Padawan who comes late to the Force and holds the fate of the galaxy in their hands.  Since this is an RPG the best part is the Jedi is YOU!  What really drew me to this game was the well developed storyline and the flushed out characters.  The other members of you party have backstorys that play directly into the plot in the form of sidequests during the course of the game.  You almost feel like they are real and I found myself becoming emotionally attached to the party memebers as the story progressed.  Their responses are also influenced by your dialog choices, and can even affect the main character's relationships with the other party members.  This is a Bioware game as well so there is the option to romance one of the other party members.  You can also choose which side of the Force to follow.  The player can either be the quintessential Light Jedi, evil as Palpatine, or somewhere inbetween.  Your choices throughout the game affect your alignment in the Force and also what powers are less exhausting to use.  The dialog is fantastic and rarely comes off as cheesy (unlike certian prequals which shall remain nameless) and the voice actors who portray the other characters are wonderful.  Even the dialog for the main character has the option to be funny without necessarily gaining you dark side alignment.    The game gives you the choice to play as a male or female character which actually influences what side quests you can pick up, as well as having a minor effect on the main story.  Personally I thought this was the most gratifying aspect of the game.  I got to play as a kickin female Jedi who holds the fate of the galaxy in her hands.  Due to this as well as the ability to choose your alignment there are four possible endings to this game.  Knights has been able to hold an excellent replay factor as well due to the number of Mods available for the game from other fans.  LucasArts actually encourages and even supports fan mad mods on thier website.  When you get bored with the main storyline there are mods out there that change everything from looks to clothes to Force Powers and even dialog.  There's even a Mod out there that restores the cut fifth ending that was only available as a female character.  The game mechanics are pretty easy to get a handle on.  The combat options give you the ability to either choose what attacks each character in your party use or leave them automated.  Those who aren't real familiar with computer games should be able to pick up the basics fairly fast.  Those who like first person shooters may find it a little frustrating as the attacks themselves are automated.  For me this was a plus as I'm not a fan of "button smashers."  A work of advice to someone who hasn't played the game or isn't familiar with it's storyline, avoid searching on the internet for info on it as much as possible.  This may be frustrating if you are someone who likes getting walkthroughs but believe me, the storyline's twist is not something you want to spoil.  You'll enjoy the game storyline much more if you don't spoil the surprise.  There are gaming sites where you can get cheats and only cheats if your a cheater like me.  Not only will teen players enjoy it but I know plenty of 20 and 30 somethings who adore this game.  It does a great job of capturing the feel of the Original Trilogy.  If you like Star Wars at all, run... don't walk and buy this game 
 This movie would be easy to confuse with the movie "Rio Bravo" bacause both movies carry a plot thread involving a drunken lawman who must be sobered up in order to keep him alive, but don't be deceived. These are two different movies with entirely different story lines. I have both titles in my collection and am glad to have both. In this one James Mitchum gives an outstanding performance as the drunken marshal with John Wayne coming to his aid. John Wayne and James Caan sober him up with a witches brew of which, thank the Lord, we don't have to watch, or smell, the effects. Mitchum is trying to protect a family of ranchers from the schemes of a land grabbing cattle baron played to cynical perfection by Ed Asner. (this was before he bacame beloved as Lou Grant on tv.) Before the movie is over the plot twists and turns like a coyote covered with fire ants, but everything comes out all right in the end. (except for Ed Asner, He's dead.) In all a good action adventure, with some violence.  It is interesting to note that John Wayne is shot early in the film and is still suffering life threatening effects at the end.  A relief from so many movies of the period where the hero suffers major wounds and a couple of days later shoots down a herd of villains and whips the bad guy in a fist fight. It is also worth noting that while this movie takes some humor from devices to sober up the co-star, neither this movie or "Rio Bravo" treat alcoholism as a humorous condition. In both movies, it is treated as a life-threatening and humiliating condition, with lingering and painful side-effects. Sorry, neither Dean Martin, Angie Dickinson, Rick Nelson, or Walter Brennan appear in this movie. It doesn't need them.  If you want to see them, buy "Rio Bravo 
 Just a nice book to have around.  Quick little stories to warm the heart. 
 As an avid listener to this CD it struck me how little of this brilliant effort makes it into the samples. Golub consistently takes the listener on a journey with more twists and turns than any Raiders of the Lost Ark  movie. It is his genius in combining his ideas, bending the direction and  changing the flow of the music that makes his work so worthwhile. Combine  that with a fluid and soulful guitar style that matches any sax and you  have an experience that gets better and better with each play. A small  sample just does not do justice to this music 
 I was lucky enough to find the book in one book sale. It was funny though it also showed the reality teenagers were facing during that time.  It was an eye-opener and at the same time an interesting, fun read 
 Movie: *****   DVD Transfer: ***   Extras: ***1/2  Director Edward Dmytryk's stark, hard-hitting examination of a hate crime was way ahead of its time in 1947, and has lost neither its topicality nor its punch in the years since.  Based on a Richard Brooks novel ("The Brick Foxhole") about the senseless murder of a gay man, the script dropped the book's sub-theme of homophobia to focus on the more cinematically "acceptable" topic of anti-Semitism.  Despite this concession to the Production Code, what emerged was a mature, pungent indictment of all crimes motivated by discrimination and blind hated that was nominated for five Oscars: Best Picture, Director, Adapted Screenplay, Supporting Actor (Robert Ryan), and Supporting Actress (Gloria Grahame).  Also deserving award consideration were  top-billed Robert Young (arguably giving the best performance of his decades-long career as a taciturn police detective) and supporting actor Robert Mitchum, as well as J. Roy Hunt's masterful black and white cinematography.  The Warner Brothers DVD release of this classic film noir is, in all honesty, a major  disappointment, mainly because the film-to-video transfer is not up to their usual high standard of quality.  There is very distracting jump in one of the earlier scenes, apparently caused by a break in the film which was subsequently spliced together by an amateur; one or two scenes are unacceptably grainy; and there is a flurry of horizontal visual "snow" toward the end of the movie.  Surely such a key title deserved a little restorative work before being transferred to DVD!  (That's a statement, not a question.)  Furthermore, the DVD does not include a Theatrical Trailer; however, it does contain a very informative snippet from an interview shown on TCM featuring director Dmytryk reminiscing about the film's production.  There is also an audio commentary by film noir authorities James Ursini and Alain Silver.  Overall, despite the inadequacies in the master print, "Crossfire" remains a must-see film, and therefore this DVD edition is definitely recommended 
 This is a well built toy that my son loves to play with.  I love that underneath has pictures of words associated with the letter.  And the pegs make it perfect for my 21 month old's little fingers to gra 
 Jasper Fforde is seriously bizarre and it shows in his incredibly creative premise for the Thursday Next series.  All of these books are very well written and can stand on their own (as complete novels), but if you read the books in sequence -- Thursday Next's story becomes better and better.  Each book answers questions that I did not even know to ask -- and the story becomes even more satisfying.  I refused to loan the books "out of order" to friend, because I felt that she would enjoy the entire series -- not just the one title that she asked to borrow.  I highly recommend the entire series -- and so far -- anything else Jasper Fforde has written.    
 Just the photo makes me want to rush out to buy this item 
 This book is the sequal to The City of Ember. You need to read City of Ember first though, because the books begins where City of Ember left off. I think The People of Sparks was a great sequal, yet not as great as it's prequal. It's not as adventerous as the last book or exciting, but it was good and it has a great message in the end. It think this book was great especially if you read the city of Ember first. If you're giving this as a gift, great choice! But I would give The City of Ember along with it 
 I ordered this for my daughter who is a sophomore in college majoring in Geology & Physics. She loved it! She has several field guides but still enjoyed receiving this one. She said it was great. The pictures are very good and it had good information 
 This is a great guide that every woman should own. It not only tells and explains how to have orgasms, but also tells you about how to enhance them. I liked the author's honest, straight-forward approach. The details were too detailed or mundane, either, which made it a quick, easy read. Definitely recommended to all women, along with "Good Sex, a woman's guide" and "Supersex" 
 One of the most telling lines of the film.  If you want great, go watch something else.  If you want On The Dark Side, watch Eddie and The Cruisers.  This is a cult classic that shows what a great band can do when they just play what they love.  It also shows the dark side of the world when someone writes something that the record producer may not like at all, and the effects that has on an artist.  A great way to see a young Tom Berenger and Joey "Pants" 
 My son loves these books.  And he enjoys the ones with lessons 
 My daycare kids love this book.  I love reading it aloud.  About the complaint of the song being hard to sing as long as you make it silly it works.  If you read it through yourself once before reading it aloud you can make it flow.  All the Tacky books are great 
 I agree with the other reviewers...the DVD is an absolute gem.  But to have this finally available on CD, and to be able to listen to it on my iPod on my daily walk, or to blast it in the car...priceless.  Carl was so energized and into this session, and obviously SO touched by the affection and admiration that the "youngsters" had for him, and that vibe is evident throughout.  Of course it's now bittersweet to hear George Harrison playing with one of his idols, but George's joy is also so clear to see and hear.    The CD and DVD are both worthy additions to anyone's music collection 
 It was nice to re-learn the old adage to "not judge a book by its cover". I had been reluctant to read the book by the title alone and what a missed pleasure and educational experience that would have been. As some other reviewers have noted, the title is not entirely indicative of the topics explored. The wealth of knowledge of the new discoveries of human nature, good government, and historical shifts due to the 'changes in the means of production' (i.e. capitalism) abound from Lord Kames to Adam Smith during the Scottish Enlightenment. Also, if one is interested in the genesis of North America and other Democracies, one should not bypass this book.   The book is divided in two parts, of the "Ephinany" (I call it Human Nature discovery) and the "Diaspora". This 1st part and I believe the heart of the book primarily explores the Scottish Enlightenment of the Protestant ethos from Francis Hutcheson, Lord Kames to Adam Smith and David Hume of 'man as a product of history and that we are ultimately creatures of our environment' and 'the way people earn a living shapes the character of their laws, their government, and their culture'. The 2nd part is the Diaspora of the Scots due to the 'clearances' or 'famines' and other reasons and their migrational impact and contributions to other societies.   As for many reviewer's concern about the footnotes or lack there of, such items like the origins of 'blackmail' or 'redneck' are easily found or verified by completing a search with multiple sources identified within a few seconds. However, I do see their point with respect to the many quotes within the book, but don't believe this takes away from the theme of topics the author explores and appear to not have been challenged since publication.  All in, a worthwhile read and high marks if nothing else than for just the 1st part of the book with the exploration of themes on policies for good government and the 'changes in the means of production' and its impact on history 
 This volume is the complete volume by Richard Maurice Bucke... this book is excellent, and presents more than enough food for thought.  Applewood books has printed a version that contains only the first four chapters, and thus misses the most important part of the book........ I cannot recommend the Applewood books 
   For those who come to Heinlein's epic Starship Troopers after having seen the movie of the late 1990's, expect to find a novel as rich in thoughtfulness as the film is filled with mindlessness.  Starship Troopers is an exploration of societal values and the role of the free-willed individual within society.  I find the science fiction aspect is largely incidental to the crux of the story.  The fact that there is a war on with the Arachnids provides some action sequences and a sense of urgency for the plot; however, what really matters in this story is what Heinlein's characters say about the society in which they live and what they say about human behavior.  Some have argued that this story is anti-democratic or even pro-authoritarian.  In the world of Starship Troopers, the right to vote belongs only to citizens.  Few of the people of this world are citizens, however.  Only those who serve in the military become citizens and thus gain the right to vote.  Thus political power only belongs to those who are willing to serve their society and place themselves in harm's way for it.  Heinlein's argument thus is that the brightest humans are not the ones who are the most fit to make decisions for humanity.  Only those who are willing to fight for a society should run it.  Heinlein goes further and outlines the failure of democracy.  His characters discuss the difference between the natural rights of democracy and the earned rights of the citizens of Starship Troopers.  The people of democracy learned to obsess over their rights and ignored their responsibilities.  Heinlein's political construct forces those with rights to acknowledge their responsibilities by granting key rights (the right to vote) only to those who have placed their lives on the line for the society.  Whether one agrees or not, Heinlein makes a very good argument for the virtue of this kind of arrangement.  Heinlein also illustrates infantry training in a military that wants to wash people out instead of getting as many as possible through the system.  As an infantryman recently returned from war (which is where I read Starship Troopers), I can say that I would not care to go through the course of training Heinlein shows the reader.  However, I'd prefer to see something more like what Heinlein shows us that the system we have today.  A higher attrition rate in basic training would ensure a better product for the Army of the real world.  The characters are smart.  They are thinkers.  This is one of the aspects I like most about the story because it's how I'd like to see the military.  The military shouldn't be masses of ill-cultured, unreflective knuckleheads, which is so often the case in line units of the Army.  Soldiers should be smart and tough.  The leaders should be even more so.  Heinlein shows us the advantage of a small, all-volunteer force made up of people who are truly devoted to service to their society by making the characters who lead the protagonist into perceptive, capable individuals.    A few aspects of Heinlein's infantry are rather silly.  For instance, there are no dedicated staffers.  All staff officers do their staff job and fight.  There are no separate maintenance people in the unit.  While this does mean the infantry unit is completely composed of "trigger-pullers", it means that someone who is not part of the unit has to do the maintenance on the equipment, provide service support, and so on.  There's no conceivable alternative if all the infantry are training and fighting.  There are other unrealistic ideas like this one; but overall these aspects detract little from an otherwise splendid treatise on how the infantry should be run.  As a work of science fiction, Heinlein's Starship Troopers is excellent specifically because the story is fantastic without the science fiction setting.  The story is about politics and human nature.  Whether one agrees with Heinlein's position or not, his propositions are well worth reading.     
 A lot of books on relaxation and stress-reduction are complicated and time consuming.  Mindwalks is so simple.  The concepts are easy to understand and they are not easily lost when you begin your journey.  Start off slow  with the book because it is so easy to read the whole thing through.  Read  a couple of different mindwalks and actually attempt them on a walk.  It  makes the book so much more enjoyable.  Two thumbs up to Mary Frakes for an  excellent, simple, and inspirational book 
 Whether you're a beginner or an experienced cook, this book will add to your culinary accomplishments. It has sections on pasta types, making your own pasta (and different variations thereof) and some incredible - and incredibly simple - recipes. The Basilico e Pomodora has become a staple in our house. These recipes are so simple, and so delicious, that my cupboard will never see a jar of pre-made sauce again 
 This is the second in the series set in Yorkshire and featuring DCI Alan Banks, a London refugee just beginning to adapt to Northern ways. The story this time is set in a small community up the valley from the market town of Eastvale, where the police station is located. A retired academic with a mania for industrial archaeology and the inheritance to indulge it has been killed and his body left in a farmer's field. His immediate circle includes a local entrepreneur, an ex-folk singer returned home in disillusion, the local doctor, and another "incomer," an author of mystery novels (which allows Robinson to get in a few tongue-in-cheek digs). But then a teenage girl whose precocity and theatrical ambitions lead her to poke into matters on her own becomes the second victim. Where the first book spent a lot of time on the Chief Inspector's wife and family (necessarily setting the scene and establishing the characters), this one is much more the traditional police procedural, focusing on the murder itself, the suspects, and Banks's tireless efforts to pin the former on one of the latter. The denouement isn't exactly a deus ex machina, but I didn't think the reader received sufficient clues to even begin to logically identify the culprit. Robinson's beautifully orchestrated background narrative about life in rural Yorkshire, however, is worth the price of admission all by itself 
 I am known for discovering extraordinary series that are often missed at first by audiences. "Dead Zone" is one of those series.  It airs on the USA Network and I've been a fan since the beginning.  "Dead Zone", based on characters created by Stephen King, is a mix of drama, fantasy, action and comedy-although not all apsects are found in every episode.  "Dead Zone" is about Johnny Smith, who, by appearances, has psychic powers through touch due to an accident-discovered when he awakens after being in a coma for 6 years.  Johnny is a 21st century hero.  He consistently tries to help people and change horrible ends, despite opposition by unbelievers and ignorance.  Anthony Michael Hall (well known for his role as the "Geek" in the movie, "Sixteen Candles") excels as Johnny Smith. Believe me, he is no longer a "geek".  "Dead Zone" is a well written drama with incredible special effects.  The timing and flow create a non-stop thriller-which is addictive. I hope "Dead Zone" will be produced for many years to come.  I won't miss an episode. 
 This whole series is just delightful.  Very well written, well developed storyline, well developed characters.  Just absolutely great!  Huge books, but you'll blow through them fast.  Don't be discouraged by the size or the fact that there's a time travel aspect to it (I put off reading the series for 7 years because of these 2 things).  The first one is more of a romance, the second is more historical fiction, the third and fourth are more adventure, the fifth and sixth go back to being more historical fiction, and they all have just about every since genre woven throughout.  So it doesn't matter what genre you prefer to read, this series will fit into it 
 This book has been one of my daughter's favorites for a year.  We first got it from the library when she was 6. She loved it so much she wanted her own copy and got one for her birthday. Now she reads it to me!  My daughter loves the smart, polite, yet mischievous Matilda.  She laughs out loud at the funny passages in the story.  Be prepared; this is a typical Roald Dahl book, and the humor is a little quirky.  Matilda is the exceptionally gifted daughter of parents who think she is a "twit" and a "scab."  They either ignore her or verbally abuse her.  Matilda gets back at them by playing tricks to "punish" them.  My daughter says that I should warn you that your child might learn some tricks from this book.  These punishments are things that you would not want your child trying at home!    Matilda finds a heroine in her teacher at school, though Matilda becomes a heroine to her teacher, rescuing her from her own problems.  We won't give away any more of the story, but good triumphs over evil in the end 
 While this book doesn't exactly go deep into the mind of Warren Beatty, and probably castigates him too much for his sexual desires and the numberous paramours he has had, it's a great book about a truly enigmatic genius, who should go down as a much better actor, director, producer, and writer than he will ever be given credit for. While it details his difficult relationship with men, his sister, and the numerous women he has spent time with, it never gets to the core of Warren Beatty and what is truly on his mind. I have to give this book 5 stars because no one else has ever even come close, and this book makes a hell of a stab....Worth the time if you are a fan of Old Hollywood 
 I found this book very useful for understanding everyday language.Idioms are not given at all or found very rarely in standard learning books or dictionaries but used widely in spoken language.The translation of french idioms into similar english ones is also wery helpful  
 My first year of riding was 1985. I used the book beginning in 1986. By 1989 I was racing Cat 1-2 Pro races fully sponsored by Team Spago in Los Angeles, CA. Call me 'old school' but I'd still recommend it for any entry level rider that dreams of racing with the best. 
 Steve Pond's "The Big Show" belongs on the bookshelf of everyone with any interest in the Academy Awards. I've read pretty much all the books on the Oscars, and this is one that really doesn't compare to any other. Most of what I was reading here I was hearing for the first time. This books complements every other account of the show, because this is the first book to actually tell the story about the show itself, not the movies or stars.   Trust me when I say you have no idea how incredibly difficult it is to put this television show together. Unless, of course, you've been there.  It's surprisingly well written; it's a easy fast read.  It's gossipy, but pleasantly so, and often funnier than all get out.   My favorite Oscar book is still "Inside Oscar" (the first one...as the second is a bit more vitriolic and less, oh, affectionate...) but THAT book and THIS book are the only ones I will read more than once. "Inside Oscar" gives us an account of the year in film, and then goes through the telecast, followed by events that happened in the weeks to months after the show. Here, you get that crucial few days right before the show, and then all the fascinating details surrounding what you actually saw on TV. They're a perfect fit.  Each chapter is a year, covering the process of putting on the Oscar telecast: how are the seat-fillers handled; who makes those decisions for those horrible dance pieces; how much thought is put into set design (a lot, but not all the time...)...the stories behind the rehearsals I found to be the most interesting of all.  This period covers the switch from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion shows/Shrine shows to the Kodak Theater. Having a permanent "home" now seems like such an obvious idea, but it clearly wasn't.  I discovered things about certain stars that surprised me. I will leave you to discover them, but suffice to say, there's a story involving Celine Dion which made me respect her in ways I would have never imagined (although her music still makes me itch).  I loved the insight into each host...so many things are known about them, yet this book assumes that. It assumes that the reader already has a healthy knowledge about Hollywood and film, and gives you the stuff you probably don't know.  THAT'S why I love this book 
 It's been awhile since I've read a Nevada Barr novel and I'd almost forgotten how much I enjoy her stories.  After just a few pages, I was reminded why she is one of my favorite authors.  Park ranger Anna Pigeon has been transferred to Fort Jefferson on Garden Key, a small island fort that was used as a prison during the Civil War.  Anna's great, great aunt Raffia was the wife of the Captain of the fort and Anna has the letters Raffia wrote home to her sister telling her about her life in the fort.  While Anna investigates a boat explosion off shore, she is also deeply into Raffia's letters and the reader gets two good stories for the price of one.  With some authors, landscape descriptions can be tedious and even annoying, but Barr is a master at this and her descriptions are so rich and real they transport the reader effortlessly to the places in the story.  From diving amongst the coral reefs to walking the parade ground of the fort during the Civil War the stories unravel.  The danger in Anna's and the danger in Raffia's world increase page by page until the suspense is almost unbearable.  This book goes to the top of my Nevada Barr favorites list 
 HEARTS IN ATLANTIS by Stephen King  THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON by Stephen King   Two reviews in one? What up with that? Well, I read HEARTS IN ATLANTIS some time ago and, beyond "rah rah go read this," I said it exposed my inadequacies as a reviewer. How stupid was that? I'm going to try again.   I finished reading MY LIFE by Bill Clinton late one Tuesday afternoon, then immediately picked up THE MAN WHO LOVED TOM GORDON. I figured my old friend Stephen King could clear my exhausted mind. He immediately pulled me in, and I read it in a single sitting. It's gripping stuff. Incredibly realistic, insightful regarding human nature, and it'll scare your pants off. The Master is most definitely at the top of his game with this book. Ditto with ATLANTIS.   Authors, how do you feel when you spend months (years?) writing a book only to have some reader say he polished it off in a single evening? Actually, I think you oughta feel good. No writer, not even Isaac Asimov, could/can be sufficiently prolific to be the only one a reader ever needs. I think this is very cool, and I love working with fellow authors to promote this thing we do.   Okay, back to my book review. King was always great, right? But there came a point where a certain sameness crept in. It's hard to define, perhaps, but you know what I mean. I don't think he was having as much fun as he used to, and after a time, neither were we.   Then came ON WRITING, which I never run out of breath raving about, and now books like these. He's scaling back the supernatural, which never bothered me at all, because he's found even scarier things to write about. The Master has raised his game, and it's a joy to know I've got a big old pile of unread Stephen King novels downstairs. Expect more rave reviews.   Oh, and Stephen, if you're reading this, and you ever get the desire to raise your game yet again, just let me know. I'll go rent a truck and hit you with it. (It's a joke. Just like the idea that YOU subscribe to MY rag. I know you'd rather read DAVE'S RAG.) 
 Although an old movie,unlike many,was before its time. It still carries a punch enhanced by spices of island mysticism

 I love this movie. The song Colors of the Wind speaks to me like none other. Being Native American myself, I can honestly say this movie does all Native American's justice. I think Disney did well with their version of this story. I am glad I bought it and I recommend it to all people of all ages. 
 "De-mystifying" a musical genre is a favorite practice of many historians, educators, and musicians, and has been overdone. Unlike them, but not unlike a master performer, Palmer is able to strike a balance between technique, feeling, and authenticity: He is historically and musically adept without denying the Blues its inherent mystery and evocative nuance.  Palmer put his life into this work and it shows; he without a doubt "convinces". I highly recommend his Deep Blues. 
 This is a terrific movie; full of action, passion, heroism, and derring-do. From the opening credits to the final scene, the viewer is in suspense - at times on the edge of the seat and others applauding out loud for the bravery and heroism of young Americans with a can-do spirit.  Whatever the critics might say, this is a joy to see.  Our heroes are diverse, young, knuckle-headed kids who are willing to risk it all for a casue they dimly understand and a country they do not know. Their skills improve just quickly enough to save their skins; mostly. It is alternately sweet (there is romance) and adventurous (the flying fight scenes are breath-taking).  The family will enjoy this film 
 I enjoyed reading this book. Another book by the same author- 'Grow younger, live longer: 10 steps to reverse aging' is a practical guide to implement what Ageless Body,timeless mind talks about. I highly recommend readers to read the later 
 My 14 month old is quite a handful, except when he is watching Sesame Street.  He is especially fond of this Kids Guide to Life video!  The story revolves around Telly and Elmo and various muppet monster and child friends  who are in Gina's Family Daycare, Sesame Street's child daycare center.   All are discussing how great the circus is.  Some children and monsters  already went and some will be going that evening, including Gina.  Telly  feels very left out.  Gina proceeds to read a story about the boy who cried  wolf while Elmo takes a nap and dreams he is in the story and is  responsible to help the muppet boy watch the sheep, with results that teach  children it is very important to tell the truth for many reasons.  This is  illustrated by the muppet boy "crying wolf" so many times his  muppet family does not believe him (and of course Elmo) when the real wolf  comes.  If you have the Learning to Share video, you will recognize the  wolf, but he has a bit of a French flair to him, which is quite  entertaining.  Before the story has ended, back at the daycare center,  Telly has decided to say that his Uncle Tommy (played by Dennis Quaid) is a  ringmaster in the circus, in order to feel important and gain attention!   Of course, this is not true, and he then has to "fess up" and  tell his friends that what he said was a lie, even though he is nervous  that no one will want to be his friend anymore.  The musical numbers and  comedy, which is also aimed at adults, is very well done.  This video is  suggested for all children and parents, as we all have to deal with truth  versus fiction in many real-life situations each day 
 I bought this to read to the grandchildren. It would make a great gift as well. I'd guess it is a second grade reading level if bought for a child to read on its own.  Creative and colorful pictures to keep the little ones interested if read to 
 Great answers, right to the point, and really empowering, Stop Being the String Along is timeless, with how to get out of pain answers. It shows you how to love yourself, and how to give and receive equally in a relationship instead of giving a lot and receiving little in return. It's the best relationship book I've ever read.    
 Being a Klutz craft book addict I highly recommend their Shrinky Dinks book and of course the refill packs are a must. My children and their friends have spent hours making magnets, earrings keychains and all manner of things with these shrinkable plastic pages 
 Excellent book from the 1950's on how to build a log cabin in the deep woods. Designed to take advantage on site materials requiring only simple non-power hand tools for construction. It doesn't reguire onsite delivery of comercial materials. Doesn't cover fancy plumbing, the newest elec. systems : solar panels, generators, inverters, etc. Nothing on the latest super insulation or energy saver appliances. If you don't want or need all the modern conviences, these cabins are great. Covers a number comforable functional "log" cabins using local materials for walls, roofing, flooring, fountation, furniture and stone fireplaces for heating. Not a book for log cabin "kits" 
 I received this magnificent disc today and gave it a listen. Having previously read the novel and comic of the same name, not to mention played the video game, I found this soundtrack to be an excellent companion the Shadows of the Empire storyline. Not only does it stand on its own as an inspiring piece, but it adds greater depth to the story by tugging at the emotions as all great Star Wars music does. This soundtrack helps the reader imagine all of the story's scenes in their mind, almost allowing the reader to create their own movie in their head.  The concept of this soundtrack, which is to be the film score to a film that only exists in the form of a book, was a risky undertaking on the part of the composer, Joel McNeeley, yet he accomplished this task very well. I highly recommend adding this disc to your music library. 
 This studio recording of "Bright lights, Big City" is a revised version of the 1999 off-Broadway musical by composer-lyricist Paul Scott Goodman.  While certainly not without flaws, it's an admirable attempt at a serious rock musical based on the famous 80's novel by Jay McInerney.  The cast is impressive and includes Patrick Wilson as the self-destructing protagonist Jamie, along with Sherie Rene Scott, Jesse L. Martin, Eden Espinosa, and other notable or up-and-coming musical theater performers.    I like Goodman's overall approach for the musical, at least as presented on the album (which appears to be somewhat different from the original stage version).  The focus is placed squarely on Jamie-- both his drinkin' and druggin' lifestyle, and his internal struggle against self-destruction.   This means the other characters exist almost entirely from his point of view-- it's unusual for a musical, and it creates some interesting dynamics.   The characters who represent his disconnected downward spiral--  his partying cohorts and ex-wife-- are depicted as appropriately shallow and one-dimensional, while those who can potentially redeem him-- his brother, a potential love interest, and his (deceased) mother-- are seen with much more humanity.   The Jamie-centered approach also provides an opportunity for some neat drug-fueled hallucinations in the form of his constantly flowing memories, as well as a missing girl from a milk carton and the headline-grabbing "Coma Baby."  The result is a musical that is more introspective than most, and  displays some genuine understanding about the nature of drugs and addiction.  While it's unfortunately not able to escape clich entirely, especially towards the end, there is still a lot that rings true.    Goodman's pop-rock music is mainly very enjoyable; he does a good job evoking the 80's time period and successfully shifts between fast numbers and slower ballads.   I have mixed feelings about the lyrics, though-- sometimes they are quite effective and clever, but at other times they can be jarringly silly (the worst moment for me: Jamie and some club-goers proclaiming with all sincerity, "I----I-----I----I  WANNA HAVE SEX TONIGHT! COME ON!").  As much as I enjoyed this recording, it does feel a bit unpolished, especially the second half.  The performers, though, are very good throughout and give the recording an extra degree of quality.  Their presence, along with the mostly fresh musical approach, should make "Bright Lights, Big City" a popular album among fans of modern musicals.    
 "The Wire" is further evidence that HBO has produced some of the best television ever shown in the States.  Whether "The Wire" is better or worse than other hallowed series such as "The Sopranos," "Band of Brothers," or "Rome" is immaterial - this series is, without hyperbole, magnificent.  Creator David West and co-writer Ed Burns, along with the rest of the bunch, deserve all the praise heaped upon them.  Essentially, "The Wire" is a cop show set in Baltimore.  The drug trade is ruining this troubled city - not for nothing does Episode One open with a cop cynically discussing the fate of a dead kid with a local, and then follow it up with a murderer being acquitted because a witness has been bought off.  The lone witness who testifies is murdered almost immediately thereafter. A frustrated cop, McNulty (Dominic West) discloses to the judge that a local drug ring led by Avon Barksdale (Wood Harris) is operating with impunity, including buying off and murdering witnesses.  The judge authorizes the titular "wire" - wire-taps on project payphones - to nail Barksdale.    The judge also raises a beef with the police force, a close-knit, regimented fraternity where rogues like McNulty are despised.  So, to keep the judge happy, the cops assemble a rag-tag squad of cast-offs and rejects, stick them with the basement, and assume the investigation goes nowhere.  But thanks to some stellar detective work, the wire starts to produce results.  So far, so good. That's all to be expected in a police procedural.   But what elevates "The Wire" is that we don't just see the good cops tracking down the bad drug dealers.  We see the dealers and those who live with them in all their humanity.  There are good guys who deal drugs in Baltimore because that's all they have done for generations.  Adding further spice to "The Wire" is the rampant corruption of Baltimore police and politicians.    "The Wire" keeps the viewer jumping from plot-line to plot-line, which include such varied threads as a dealer struggling with his conscience, a cop fighting for visitation rights to his kids, a trigger-happy cop learning while on suspension that he's got a gift for data-crunching, a dealer forced to work with the cops to avenge his murdered lover, and a druggie struggling to clean himself up.  None of these plot lines is forced to walk a straight line, but all are allowed to bob and weave through the characters' lives.  Through it all, "The Wire" remains true to itself, and no notes ring false.  Here's looking forward to Season Two.  If you have a significant other who will get frustrated with your dedication to this series, just watch the first episode of the first season, and you will both be hooked.  And grateful 
 My first time to rate anything. I just love this book. Truly shows how to easily alter a pattern without destroying the shape 
 I really like the Women's Murder Club, if you're a woman and like crime stories than this series is for you!! 
 The Ape in the Corner Office is an interesting, entertaining and often too truthful a read. It appears we cannot divest ourselves fully from our instinctual ancestors, the Ape and even the Rat. We share too much biological similarities.Richard Conniff has researched and written a credible account of how our ancestral behaviors play an important role in establishing and maintaining a sense of safety, social hierarchy, community and competitive advantage. This could be a terrifying thought, yet, Conniff's storytelling ability, vast business experience (reads like a who's who in business), well-cited research and humor serves to pacify the reader, at least momentarily.   As a trainer and speaker I want to beware The Ape in the Corner Office, lest I become buffaloed by a passive, yet, hostile audience. This is a book I will return to for insights anytime I see the furry face rising in either myself or others.  Conniff candidly shares how his behaviors have at times prevented him from endearing the client and gaining the contract. His advice: if you are going to let your beast roar, compete or fight consciously, be aware of the risks, rewards and lasting implications your instinctual behavior may have. The book is entertaining, thought provoking and a useful tool for people who want to know the human and beastly side of their business.  And we are not out of the woods. Just because humans have verbal communication, a relatively newly acquired form of communication, it only serves to cover up our more instinctual responses. Despite polite words and social appropriate manner it is still our nonverbal communications that reveals the truth.   Armchair Interviews says, after you read The Ape in the Corner office, you'll have a pen handy to jot down any of the great contacts and resources the author gives you to navigate the river of commerce that runs through your office jungle.   
 When I was a high school student, I loved math, but hated math classes, with their tedious emphasis on going over things until even the most mathematically ungifted either got the stuff (or gave up!) the repetitive teaching necessary to inculcate it into the densest heads, and the problem solving that went on long after I had "got it."  Would that I'd then had this book.  Boyer has written a great introductory work to both the history of math and math itself, which you can read at your own pace, study until you get it and then move on, with lots of references if you for some reason want to understand something even better.  By grouping the chapters around eras of mathematicians, and various mathematicians, he makes the history of math approachable even to those without degrees in mathematics.    This is not necessarily THE book you'd want to read if you're working on a masters or PhD in math, but the sort of book you'd really love to read as a bright high school student or undergraduate student.  All in all a great book, but, as other reviewers have written, not exactly the Encyclopaedia Brittanica, but then, how many people read the Brittanica for pleasure 
 This book is a great resource for even the most seasoned real estate professionals.  It is refreshing to see a scientific approach to site selection that successfully integrates the art of real estate qualitative analysis 
 Historian Norbert Elias' classic works Court Society and The Civilizing Process had presented a problematic view of the Early Modern monarchies and courts. In his "Myths of Power. Norbert Elias and the Early Modern European Court ", Duindam concluded that Elias' approach to the early modern European court containes many misunderstandings, especially those connected with the much-heralded rise of the middle class and its inseparable companion, modernization. In this descriptive world, the author does not aim at providing a new model to understand European courts, but simply to compare the French court and the court of the Austrian Habsburgs, probably trying to show that there is still much work to be done before rendering any new general theory. The book is no very engaging, but it is not dry either. It can be savoured by the professional historian, and perhaps, by the educated layperson too.Therefore, my rate is 5 (content) and 2/3 (pleasure of reading).    Other books that I would recommend would be "Kings or People: Power and the Mandate to Rule by Reinhard Bendix"; "State and status" by Samuel Clark; "Monarchy, Aristocracy, and the State in Europe, 1300-1800" by Hillay Zmora; "Nobilities in Transition 1550-1700: Courtiers and Rebels in Britain and Europe" by Ronald G. Asch; and "The Persistence of the Ancient Regime" by Arno J. Mayer (this last one covering approximately the 1815-1914 period).  
 it rocked my socks off. i cant believe it. i was bored one day at my mothers house and i read it. WO 
 If you're a fan of Russian novels, you'll really enjoy this book.  It is excellently written, full of suprises, and a very enjoyable read.  That is, of course, until you get to the end.  The end is dissapointing, horrible, and while it might be what you expected, it definately isn't what you wanted.  So, read the book, skip the ending, and make up your own.  It will be much more satisfying.  Also, don't believe a thing that Daniel Handler (aka Lemony Snicket) says about this book on NPR, he obviously hasn't read it yet.  Isn't sad when popular authors pretend to have read books that they haven't.. like no one will notice?  If you see him around... give him a dirty look for me 
 This book was an awesome book by Ann Rinaldi. This story takes place during the time right after Lincoln was assinated. A girl named Emily has a mother who is deadly ill.  Her mother knew that she was about to die and she told Emily that she needed to live wih someone.  Emily wants to live wiht her aunt in Philidelphia, but her om wants her to live with her good friend next door.  Emily's uncle Valintine comes into town to see Emily's mother.  Valintine tries to tell Emily that she needs to come live with him.  emily's mother doesn't want Emily to go live with him.  Emily decides to go visit her uncle.  While she is there she meets an old crazy black lady that lives upstairs.  She tells Emily that her uncle has a big secert and that Emily needs to help get the old lady out.  Emily is told that the big seceret is in her uncle's shed where NO ONE is allowed.  To find out the secert you have to read this awesome book!! 
 Simeti does a great job of talking about her adopted home.  The story works well on two levels - discussing the mythology, history, and culture of Sicily, but also weaving in her responses, frustrations, fears, and joys about her life as an American woman turned Italian wife and mother.  One of my favorite books about Italy 
 excellent recording, very destictively colored music....I was impressed and am listening to it quite frequently. 
 Rather like scientists who argue tentatively from "inference to the best explanation," John Pollock mitigates his speculations with what seems a broad scholarship and familiarity with relevant topography, historical accounts, archeology, biblically cross-referenced clues and implications, and hermeneutics. The result is an outstanding biography of the first century evangelist who influenced the course of human history more than any political figure has. At one point, discussing "a certain political event in Ephesus" during an account of what is known as Paul's second missionary journey, Pollock describes his method in these words: "Paul's story enters a brief though vital period when the facts are obscure. Luke turns very discreet." After citing a highly plausible political explanation for Luke's discretion, he continues: "What happened must be pieced together from clues scattered aground the New Testament and in secular history. . . A biographer has to decide between slowing to a halt here in a bog of conflicting possibilities which can never be resolved, or striding boldly across a causeway of conjecture. I choose the second course and, without stepping aside to discuss all the alternatives, tell the story as I see it. Paul's next eighteen months unfold somewhat as follows, though the tone of assurance in my narrative must not disguise that some of its conclusions are tentative and disputable." (p 192) This excerpt furnishes a good picture of Pollock's approach when some speculation is necessary to flesh-out the story.  The book is an extremely enjoyable reading experience. This from chapter 15: Paul, Silas, Timothy, and Luke, "probably in the last week of July 50 [AD]," under sail from Troas: "They did not think of themselves as passing from the  continent of Asia to Europe. The terms were in use, but the  Aegean was Greek on either side. They had, instead, the  excitement of approaching a new province, bringing them  nearer Rome. They knew that beyond Macedonia they could  reach Achaia and Italy, and the vast lands of Gaul, Spain,  Germania, even the mist-bound island of Britain lately added  to the empire: all save Rome untouched by the Good News.  They were not bringing force of arms or a political program:  just four men -- and Another, invisible, who had known these  seas and shores before Achilles or Agamemnon or Ulysses;  who could demolish empires and cities by the breath of His  mouth, but who had chosen to humble Himself and come to  Macedonia as quietly, as weakly as, in the flesh, He had come  to Bethlehem half a century before. " (p 124)  Sea routes, roads, typical seasonal meteorology, local flora, the lay of cities, ports and provinces, physical features of the landscapes, political liaisons and intrigues, local deities, the art, architecture and practices of pagan worship centers, the identity and motivations of opposition, philosophical schools, regional industries, first century seamanship and vessels -- Pollock descriptively reveals all of these elements of the New Testament narratives. While a typical reading of the New Testament virtually ignores these features of context, to better recognize them is certainly a boon to understanding. This is one of the great values of this book. Pollock also manages to reveal Paul's characteristics, tendencies, reasonings, knowledge of Greek literature and philosophy, personal interests and personality traits; he does this rather speculatively, but based on cited references nonetheless. An example: "they took the ship through the islands of the Cyclades, beautiful in a wine-colored sea. Paul could enjoy it. Because Acts has no place for his personal feelings he has been considered indifferent or loftily superior to scenery. Yet he writes of the beauty of the stars, how one differs from another in glory; he was aware of the beauty of the human body and he notes how in great houses he visited some of the vases and bowls were works of art, others merely useful."  The texts I've chosen to quote should give a sense of Pollock's biography of Paul, the fearless advocate, ambassador, mediator and counselor who modeled the understanding that "Christians must outlove, outjoy, outthink, and always welcome those who oppose them." I recommend the book, bearing in mind, of course, that direct textual statements have been augmented with inference and speculation. Two or three times I thought that Pollock's 'inferences' were likely not correct, but these are exceptions. Where speculation is unwise, unsupportable or unnecessary, Pollock generally steers clear. For example, regarding the possible Pauline authorship of the NT letter/book of Hebrews, Pollock says, "some hold that Hebrews was composed" during Paul's confinement in Caesarea in 58. He then briefly explains other views (p 265) without personally endorsing any of them. (The only biblical evidence of the authorship of Hebrews is 'textual' and, I believe, indicates that Apollos, the Alexandrian scholar, is the most probable author. Claims for Pauline authorship are inevitably attempts to explain why the letter doesn't sound/read as though Paul had written it, while the most likely explanation is simply that he did not. On the other hand, it does sound/read like the writings of well-known Alexandrian theologian/scholars [thus our obvious candidate is Apollos, as Luther believed]. Pollock reservedly states only that this particular question cannot be finally resolved.) I enjoyed the book on two levels, it ties together what often seem like disjoined narratives, and it is also a valuable series of contextual insights 
 THE Aussie answer to the beatles , could rant and rave for line after line , but i won't because best way to find out is buy it NOW!!! 
 This is a superb tell all on how to inject the best of  Hollywood into your business. From Broadway to Sunset Boulevard, this is is the new Ogilvy On Advertising. Bravo 
 I really loved this book because the writing put me into a city which I had never stepped foot: New Orleans. (And since Hurricane Katrina has wiped out much of NOLA this book can serve as part of its rich history.) The character development is superb; I really cared about each person, from the primary to secondary characters. The detail Ms. Crain gives to her beloved New Orleans paints an eloquent picture for the reader of  the rich tradition of the French Quarter, the architecture and its unique people. Bill Holcomb, the book's main character, brings vitality into what is normally a depressing subject of the human excesses of addiction and its depressing toll on those whose loved ones -- even friends -- are affected. It's my personal opinion that RRR would make a great miniseries on one of the pay channels to fully explore the depths of each character without holding back the true feelings of those around them due of FCC censorship. 
 i was unable to put this book down! Mr. Summers Congrats on a very fine job. After reading I felt like I knew her,  this is the most accurate reading I have done on MM. Summers truly shows how her life was the most  glamorous and the  saddest at the same time. I have never felt so sad for  someone as I did MM 
 I first saw this when i was like 6 years old.  I remember renting this with my mom and cousin.  Like a lot of people, my mom had no idea who David Cronenberg was.  Well, had she known, i'm sure she would not let her 6 year old son watch that flick.  The main thing I remember in this was the guy getting his arm torn off and the baboon getting pulverised.  Those are pretty gross scenes.  However, i did buy this recently, and realized, yes it still is gross, it did not age extremely well.  But, I must say, Jeff Goldblum was pretty good.  He was a bit too quirky at first, but I figured they wanted him to be this geeky guy so that when his fly-like abilities started kicking in, it would show the extreme opposite of what his original character was.  This would also cause sympathy towards the end even though he became, basically a dick by the middle of the movie.  I suggest buying this, especially Cronenberg fans 
     If i hear Little Richard Pop Off One More Time About How He Invented Rock & Roll( "i'm the the ayatolla of Rock & Rolla"!),i'll throw the cd and vid of "Caldonia" at him and tell him to SHUT UP!! The Imodest and Full Of Themselves always Steal and appropriate from others.Jelly Roll Morton also claimed he invented Jazz,and great though he was- he,Like Richard,was more concerned with self promotion and personal myth making.The Boastfull are never the first string artists.That takes sincerity and humility.And p.s. Jerry Lee Lewis(entertaining and raw as he is)got much of his deal from the Boogie Woogie piano playing-singing of Harry "The Hipster" Gibson-also from jordan's era.Why do these guys egos prevent them for giving credit to their progenitors 
 This is a great book on the art of tai ji quan (tai chi chuan).  It offers an excellent overview of the internal martial arts principles of Wu style tai ji quan, and addresses the aspects of the art that contribute to good health and longevity.  The history of the Northern Wu is very interesting and includes rare archival photographs.  The form and practical application of the postures are well presented, as is the section on the Wu sword form.  This is the kind of book you buy to keep as a lifelong reference as you develop the skills of tai ji quan - from knowing the techniques (zhao shu), to understanding internal energy and gaining tai ji quan power (dong jin), and progressing to the advanced level where the spirit is calm, happy, relaxed, and free to use flowing techniques at will (shen ming).  (See Chapter 8.)  I can't wait for the authors' book on Bagua, due out this summer 
 My wife tried to get me to read this book soon after we got married. Being a guy, I didn't want to read some girly book about love though! O what a mistake! Nine years later, I had a change of heart and discovered that I had missed out on so much in the last nine years because I didn't understand the language my wife was speaking. If you want to be able to show your spouse that you love them and/or you are confused about why they don't seem to show you love, then read this book. It will open up a whole new world of understanding for you 
 A fine book on Vermeer with good repros and short but to the point commentary on each painting by the author. I've seen Vermeers in the Rijksmuseum in the original, and although no color plate can do justice to them, these are pretty decent. Vermeer's rich, saturated colors and use of transparent and translucent glazes are impossible to really reproduce in print, at least at a reasonable cost, not to mention his amazing treatment of specular highlights. But the plates in this book are still pretty good.  The book shows all known Vermeers, of which there are less than forty,  usually with several paragraphs of commentary on each painting. The author does a good job of placing each painting in the context of Vermeer's overall oeuvre while discussing the painting's special or unique points. No doubt you'll recognize many of your favorite Vermeers here.  Vermeer's masters are still a mystery although Carel Fabritius, Rembrandt's most famous student, and others have been proposed, but without conclusive proof. We may never know who trained him, but one thing is for sure, early on after being certified as a master of the guild, Vermeer turned from the more dramatic subject of historical paintings to painting the intimate and understated works he's known for, in which people are treated almost like inanimate objects in a still life and the light permeates whole volumes of space with liquid effect. Forever a girl stands in front of a virginal, or pours milk from a pitcher, while the light dances and plays around her.  Someone once noted that Vermeer's spaces are quite empty and uncluttered, but this makes sense if you think about it. Since Vermeer was fascinated by light, and the way different surfaces and textures reflected light, Vermeer would not wish to clutter up any space and interfere with the propagation and reflection of light throughout the space. Vermeer was nothing if not a painter of light and lighting effects which he treated more like a dynamic and fluid medium which literally molded the space it touched rather than simple lighting in that sense.  Vermeer also often liked to pose his models playing musical instruments or reading letters, using the act of reading a private communication to create a more intimate mood or identification with the person.  The author also provides a brief introduction and history of Vermeer's life and work, which is about five pages long in this large paperback format, so it's probably more like ten pages in a normal book. Overall, a brief but very well done book on Vermeer 
 I'm 2/3 done with a garage that's based on a plan in this book.  I'm using this book for pole barn-specific info, and "Building a Multi-Use Barn : For Garage, Animals, W..." for the rest.  Together, these two books give me enough information, without going overboard. Good luck to you; I'm having a blast 
 An old style performance, with dashing Gallic flair and elan.  More recent performances, most impressively from Gil Shahan, have not replaced the authority and understanding that these great old French stars bring to this beautiful music. Paul Chihara Professor of Music, UCL 
 Another reviewer, Mr. Robert Steele, really hit the spot on "Squandered Victory." He offered a quote from Sir Winston Churchill describing how Americans end up doing the right thing, after trying everything else first.   Another quote from Churchill seems to fit our effort in Iraq as well as any I've seen -- "What enterprise that an enlightened community may attempt is more noble and more profitable than the reclamation from barbarism of fertile regions and large populations? To give peace to warring tribes, to administer justice where all was violence, to strike the chains off the slave, to draw the richness from the soil, to plant the earliest seeds of commerce and learning, to increase in whole peoples their capacities for pleasure and diminish their chances of pain --- what more beautiful ideal or more valuable reward can inspire human effort? The act is virtuous, the exercise invigorating, and the result often extremely profitable. Yet as the mind turns from the wonderful cloudland of aspiration to the ugly scaffolding of attempt and achievement, a succession of opposite ideas arise. Industrious races are displayed stinted and starved for the sake of an expensive Imperialism that they can only enjoy if they are well fed. Wild peoples, ignorant of their barbarism, callous of suffering, careless of life but tenacious of liberty, are seen to resist with fury the philanthropic invaders, and to perish in thousands before they are convinced of their mistake. The inevitable gap between conquest and dominion becomes filled with the figures of the greedy trader, the inopportune missionary, the ambitious soldier, the lying speculator, who disquiet the minds of the conquered and excite the sordid appetites of the conquerors. And as the eye of thought rests on these sinister features, it hardly seems possible for us to believe that any fair prospect is approached by so foul a path."  As for the criticism that the author is not an Arabic speaker -- I too regret that more of our policy makers and senior advisors do not speak Arabic. My belief is that a knowledge of the culture and language would have saved us from any involvement in this debacle from day one. All in all though, I'd prefer policy makers, diplomats, bureaucrats, generals, and majors who at least read Churchill [and the Geneva Conventions], even if they have not learned to pick the brains of the Arab world in that ancient and beautiful language for new insights on democracy.  
 There is little new to say of this book other than to mention what an excellent light it sheds on Waugh's other, very different books.  Although dismissed by Waugh as the product of Spam and blackouts (wartime privations), Brideshead endures because of its superb structure, characterizations and ultimately heart.  It is this last feature which gives evidence of the human depths that inform all of Waugh's novels even those whose satire keeps these depths at a clinical distance 
 We are delighted with our new chairs and table.  The products were well-packed and came in excellent condition.  The chairs are sturdy, ample and comfortable even without the cushions.  The cushions that come with are very nice, but too thick for my liking.  The chairs have an additional feature of leveling pads on the bottom of each leg that can be screwed in or out to accommodate uneven surfaces.  The table is big enough for a full dinner for four, but small enough to still feel intimate. We now spend a lot more time on our patio 
 This is a good product for cleaning circuit boards and other electronics in areas you shouldn't touch. 
 I am a strong, believing Protestant, and you won't find many Protestents who pray the Rosary.  But I was mysteriously attracted to the idea of it, and as if in response to a prayer, this little book came to my attention.  I bought it, and ordered myself a Rosary.  Using John's suggestion that I tailor my prayers to my own comfort level, I began to "pray the Rosary."  My prayer life is much stronger than before, and more intentional I guess is the word he uses.  I had no problem with his theology; since I'm not Catholic, it didn't sound at all like heresy. Rather it was a moving testimonial by a sincere and devout human being, whose desire it is for us all to have a relationship with God, and a strong prayer life.  Thank you John for this profound gift 
 Rasputina's "Thanks for the Ether" is a hard to describe, hard to absorb, but ultimately brilliant album.  The band is comprised of 3 cello players, and as far as classification, it's classical, orchestral cello music in more traditional rock song structure.  For many like me who listen to mostly contemporary music, it's almost like a different language and could be an acquired taste.  Charismatic frontwoman Melora Creager makes the album (and the band), with her incredibly detailed and descriptive lyrics, usually descriptions of some event, person or situation.  She also has a wicked sense of humor, evidenced in her stage presence and the spoken word interludes on this album (including one insisting that the term "settlers" implies the "willingness to settle for a meal of human flesh").  More subtlely funny moments included the purposely mumbled and indecipherable lyrics of "Sister Sleep".  Song topics range from the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire to a mysterious note signed 'Mr. E. Leon Rauis'.  Oh yeah, and she's an awesome singer, with a distinctive sound, range and a lot of vibrato.  There are a full 19 songs on this album (even the spoken word pieces have cello accompaniment) and none of them are at all weak.  My personal favorites are the lively "Stumpside", and the more melancholic tunes like "Any Old Actress" and mysterious "Dig Ophelia".  There's a catchy melody at the root of every song here, and a ton of diversity.  There's also some covers of older songs, Melanie's "Brand New Key" and "Why Don't You Do Right".  For all the cleverness and humor, a lot of these songs have real emotional effect on me.  The feel is often one of nostalgia and conjures up images of the Victorian times that they're so enamoured with.  The difference between this and later Rasputina is that on later albums such as "How We Quit the Forest" (also great) they were literally playing classic rock songs on the cello, distortion and all, and the arrangements were simplified compared to the full blown harmonizing and intricacy of this first album.  So, there's my bad attempt at describing this band / album, which is a lot more than just a novelty.  "Thanks for the Ether" is highly recommended to anyone looking for something different, and if you get the chance to see this band live, it's an experience you'll never forget 
 I have this boxing manual for more than a year now. It's perfect if you tend to shadowbox to work your boxing skills. You get a good workout yet boxing correctly in its format. Perfect manual for novice to advanced boxer. It also goes well with Hatmaker's other manual on Savage Strikes, more of freestyle, NHB fighting. I read this boxing manual numerous times when I have time available and tend to shadowbox as a workout to work on my boxing form and getting my cardio that way. So if you have some boxing skills, whether you've been taught by your dad or mom in some cases or at a boxing gym this book is perfect to go along with your skill to improve boxing. Sweet science at its best 
 "Gettin' In Over My Head" may not be the new classic Brian Wilson album, but it does have some glowing moments. The opener "How Can We Still Be Dancin'" is a brawling old-style rocker where Brian kicks out the jams and lets us know the old guy's got energy and fun. "Soul Searchin'" spent a number of weeks in my personal top ten this summer and has a wonderful lumbering doo-wop rhythm that builds into a joyful pop jewel with the expansive background vocals on the bridge, "Why, oh, why did I ever, ever say goodbye? I must be out of my mind; I keep walkin' & I'm wonderin' & I'm looking for a sign." The title track is nicely layered with one of Brian's better dreamy romantic melodies. "City Blues" is another great classic with Eric Clapton on guitar and Brian punctuating the melody with some Neil Hefti-type riffs. "Make A Wish" is a strong song with the wall of Beach Boys background vocals on a laundry list of things desired, "Finding cures for all disease, forest growin' brand-new trees, need clean air for us to breathe, purify our lakes & seas." "Saturday Morning in the City" is a lighthearted carefree ditty that celebrates the joys of the weekend. "Fairy Tale" comes across as a sweet post-hippy ballad. Some of this set's lyrics are a bit clunky, but they always embody Brian's loving vision of a better world. This is a set to relish with some classic moments. Enjoy

 At first I was bugged by how sticky this was, but boy did it work! They gave me 1/2 ounce tube in the hospital (and charged me $9 for it, but that's another story!) It moisturizes and protects your nipples from chafing while nursing, and doesn't bother baby a bit. Take my advice, bring your own tube to the hospital to avoid being over-charged! 
 perfect cables for perfect price.  same cable @ WorstBuy $30 got it here for less than $2.  Works perfectl 
 Outstanding book....a real page turner.  You will not want to or be able to put the book down.  A very enjoyable read.  Highly recommended!  
 This selection of three short films has been a longtime favorite of mine, although I could do without the third piece (Woody Allen's Oedipus Wrecks) and feel just as satisfied.  Scorsese's bit is by far the best and although it's portrayal of ego and the New York art world left me wanting more, it was just the perfect length and depth. The character of Lionel Dobie rang true to many artists I know, along with his never realizing that his art is his true wife. The soundtrack (the continuous loop of "Whiter Shade of Pale") was a natural fit.  Coppola's piece was a charming and cinematically gorgeous little fairytale. It's not deep, just full of simple brilliance. I was bewitched by the father as a flautist.  I've never gotten through Allen's film, so I can't accurately characterize it except for the fact that its unwatchability might be evidence enough.  This collection, however, is one of the many reasons that point to the fact that New York City is, in the end, where I will hang my hat 
 It's not the best grill in the world, but for the price it does the job well enough.  It cooks unevenly.  The front and the back of the grill are hotter than the center.  
 Susan Carroll did an amazing job of capturing the reader in a romantic and dangerous scenario.  I have read all three of the books in this series, and all of them are amazing.  The author does an excellent job of describing the love between the two characters, Ariane and Renard.  I was awed and amazed at the titilating and thrilling desriptions provided.  Carroll provided excellent desciprions of the characters and scenes that makes the reader want to be there and experience the emotions of the characters.  The history was intriguing and all of the writing flowed well from one part to the next.  I found the main chanracter, Ariane, to be a strong and amazing woman whom I admired.  Carroll does a wonderful job describing all of the points of view so the reader is better able to understand the situation and make their own assessments.  Overall, I loved this book and I recommend it, and all of the books in the series, for anyone who enjoys romance with adventure all intwined with history.  I was not able to stop thinking about the book, and it was difficult to put it down.  Wonderful!!!   
 Since I discovered this wonderful relish in England a few years ago I have tried to buy replacements in this country. It is served at most pubs in the UK as part of a Ploughman's Lunch along with various cheeses and other goodies. It has a wonderful taste and texture, unlike anything in this country. I recommend every one buy some. I've found it only on Amazon 
 These Tommy espadrilles are the cutest shoes I bought all summer.  I get so many compliments on them.  They go with everything.  You can't go wrong with them.  I am between size 6 & 6.5 and I ordered 6.5 and they fit perfect 
 "The Seven Up Series" for those who aren't familiar with it is a documentary style series. A group of British 7 year olds from different classes and walks of life are brought together. We learn about their backrounds but the most telling is seeing them interacting with each other and being interviewed. We are again introduced to them seven years later (7 Plus Seven). They are now 14 and they are interviewed again about their lives. We see them again in 21 up and so on all the way to 42 up. This is the most remarkable documentary series you will ever see. It is for everyone. You will learn pracically everything you'll ever need  to know about life. It will come and go in your thoughts for the rest of your life 
 just what my husband was looking for; service and condition was more than what was promised.  thank 
 There is much to be said in praise of any book that revolves around a giant rampaging chicken.  It's one of those images that sticks so nicely in the brain.  In the case of "Looking For Bobowicz", this is just the latest in author Daniel Pinkwater's poultry chronicles (the first being, "The Hoboken Chicken Emergency", of course).  In this tale you may meet delightfully eccentric adults, sane reasonable children, a mysterious phantom, and the memory of a chicken who rocked a town with its flutter. 	 To his chagrin, Nick (real name Ivan Itch) has moved from comfortable Happy Valley to uncomfortable urban Hoboken, New Jersey.  Nick is not pleased with the move (his mother didn't want him growing up with bad suburban influences) but quickly finds some like-minded pals living next door to his new home.  He also gets his bike stolen by a mysterious phantom.  Before he knows it, he and his friends Loretta and Bruno are rushing to the library to solve the mystery of the phantom and to get back what once was theirs. 	 In a lot of ways, this book definitely harkens back to Avi's, "No More Magic".  Same reading level.  Same mysterious being stealing the main character's bike right at the start of the story.  Same otherworldly feel to the tale and peculiar kids banding together to solve the crime.  And like Avi's book there's a slightly disjointed feel to the narrative.  This isn't to say I didn't enjoy the book, though.  I mean, a book has won my instant admiration if it contains, at some point, a father telling his son (who is going to try to capture a bat), "if you should get bitten, tell me at once so I can arrange for the series of painful shots".  And there was much to enjoy in the tale as well.  What kid can't relate to the wonders of exploring a basement full to brimming with mysterious junk?  Or reading comic books (of literary classics, no less) while munching on sandwiches and Dreamsicles?  Or following a series of clues to a mysterious cave deep below the earth?  	 There were definitely some odd choices in the story though.  The mom of Nick often remarks on the wonderful influences of the big city on kids, which I assumed was a play on those mothers who think that way about the suburbs.  The book doesn't dwell much on details and has some of the shortest chapters I've ever encountered.  Also, adults' actions are left somewhat mysterious without reason.  And there are some definite inconsistencies between the text and the pictures drawn by Jill Pinkwater.  Little niggling things like the books saying the chicken was riding on a tricycle when it is CLEARLY riding a two-wheeled bike.  But these are tiny matters.  In the end the real question is whether or not this book successfully enthralls.  And the answer is yes.  Yes indeed it does. 	 So if you are looking for a work of fiction that is a little older reading than your average "Cam Jansen", but you don't want to hand your children something as complex and high-handed as "His Dark Materials", "Looking For Bobowicz" is an excellent alternative.  For any kid that loves his or her average chicken mystery, this one takes the cake.  It's sly, inventive, and cocky.  Ha ha. 
 I'm foremost a Star Wars fan, with the Star Trek universe being very foreign to me. But this movie (along with Search for Spock and Voyage Home, which form the trilogy) came highly recommended by a friend, so I gave them a spin. Plus its absolutely essential for any movie buff to see Shatner's now-legendary scream of "Khaaannnn!!!"  I liked this one. Not being a Trek fan a few small details were lost on me, but overall the movie does well referencing the episode on which it was based without being slaved to it. The Genesis Project creates a lot of moral and ethical questions with its science, exactly the type of sci-fi that Trek is best known for. Good special effects, and good acting - it's telling that the conflict between Kirk and Khan feels real despite the fact they never meet in person. "Khaaannnn!!!" drew me in. The touching finale sold me. Good stuff.  Solid dvd, with lots of good information. Some of the bonus features come off a little dry, as they're nothing but "talking head" interviews for the most part. But again, they show you just how much more of the Trek universe was apparantly established with this film.  So I wouldn't count myself as a Trek fan yet, but Khan definitely made me excited to check out more Trek adventures. And that works for me.    
 If I could give this book 10 stars I would. When I read the first couple of pages, I knew this was just the book I was looking for. The book was not boring and every chapter has something useful. I have finally figured out why some of my group policies were not functioning properly and the intellimirror chapter was awesome. If you don't have this book please purchase this book as a reference are a problem solver 
 The product is easy to use.  Like how it intergrates with MS Office applications.  It's been a great tool for providing documents to my clients 
 This is our child's favourite CD (along with the 2 other Elizabeth Mitchell CD's) - we don't leave home without it.  And we love listening to it also.... I honestly cannot rate this CD highly enough 
 One of the harder Hiaasen novels to come across, this 1989 Florida adventure revolves around the lucrative and unlegislated world of plastic surgery.  Hiaasen as always has created surreal and dim-witted villains along with other characters that only his mind can.  Skin Tight isn't as fast paced as Hiaasen's masterpieces such as Sick Puppy, Skinny Dip, Lucky You, Stormy Weather, Native Tongue, Strip Tease and Hoot.  Those books from the first page you just could not put down until the final page. Skin Tight lacks that but is a worthwhile read, just not in the same league. Skin Tight also does slightly touch on the Florida environment but the passion for conservation Hiaasen normally includes in his work is no where near as strong here.     If you have read all of Carl Hiaasen's novels and are still hungry for more of the same then check out the author C.J. Box who writes similar surreal novels set in Wyoming instead of Florida with passionate extreme environmentalists, corrupt public officials, dim-witted rednecks and other Hiaasen style characters.  Open Season is a good book to start with.   Fellow Floridian and Miami newspaper writer Dave Barry has also written a few fiction books which are very close to Hiaasen in style especially his masterpiece Tricky Business.  
 I must say I am glad that I read the other reviews so that I was prepared when I purchased this item. It is a bit misleading that the CD contains files in EPS format because they act just like a placed image in Illustrator. HOWEVER, with a program like Adobe Streamline, the images are absolutely GORGEOUS. I highly recommend this item along with Streamline. In the end, the quality workmanship of a Dover book is found in this product 
 Detailing more than two dozen gardens, Front Yard Gardens is instant motivation for anyone tired or mowing, weeding, watering and fertilizing lawns. With the author's short history of lawns and their demand on us and the environment it is clear to see why many may be happier if lawns went away. But Primeau certainly does not demonize the practice and fully admits that the problem is certainly not the plants - it is the way most of us choose to care for our lawns that impacts the land. Primeau's own garden was a decade long labor of love proving that eliminating a lawn can be arduous - but more arduous than lawn maintenance? Probably not. While the garden vignettes focus more on the individual space's history than providing how-to information, it is clear to see that diverse multi-species gardens can be immensely more entertaining than a single species mono-culture like turf grass. Several of the front yard gardens detailed in the book do maintain a small lawn space but most seem to have completely eliminated their lawns opting for lush garden plantings combined with hardscaping practicalities like paths, steps, fences and driveways, and, in one instance, even artificial turf, as well as fun garden features like ponds, bird houses, and sitting areas. Full color photos by Andrew Leyerle provide multiple views of the gardens, in some cases even highlighting their seasonal changes. A book for every garden style, level, and interest, Front Yard Gardens should not be missed 
 This is a solid product with 8 pegs (4 upper and 4 lower).   I like the lower pegs because it's easy for small children to hang up their coats.  The only reason I rated it as 4 stars and not 5 stars is that when I rec'd the coat rack there were two of the bottom bars enclosed so I could not use the bottom pegs.   I called the number on the instruction sheet and just had to leave a message with the order number and what part I needed and they fed ex'd it right away.  I had the middle bar to attach the pegs to within 2 days 
 Rarely has a film drawn me in so deeply that I remain affected days after I viewed it. "The Son's Room" is profound in its ability to create its moods especially in the latter half of the film. I feel that the director's presentation of this happy family, in the film's first half, is what allowed me to feel the result of an impending tragedy so personally. I kept thinking that I wanted everything to go back to the way it was before. I  shared their grief as if it was my own.  I also applaud the presentation of an Italian society which is unlike the comic opera Italian experience presented in American films over the past decades going back to the silent era. The film may not affect you as deeply as it affected me, but I highly recommend the absorbing story that is presented.  
 Good service.  Quick turn around.  Book in very good condition as stated.  No hesitation to do business with these people again 
 This book is comprised of three parts; 1)Morris's growing up in Yazoo, Mississippi 2)His time spent at the University of Texas, and 3) His moving to New York, and becoming an editor at Harpers magazine.  The first section is absolutely fantastic.  I was drawn in and couldn't put it down. Morris is a great storyteller, and the tales of his growing up are a great look at life in the South in the 1940's.  If you enjoyed "My Dog Skip", you would love it.  The second section starts out interesting, but then gets bogged down with Texas politics.  Interesting,but not exactly a page turner 40 years later.  And finally, his time in NYC was interesting, a Southern boy plunked down in the middle of America's biggest city. Many of his concerns of the time we are still wrestling with here in 2000. Our era is not as unique as many would think. I would highly recommend this book, even if you only read part one-it's that good 
 Dip into Simple Abundance by Breathnach for reminders to take care of yourself, your mind and soul.  There is a different essay for each day of the year.  One can read at random, choosing the topic most meaningful for the moment.  Maybe it is "Setting Your Own Pace", "Playing Hooky" or "Quieting the Wants".  When you feel harried and overwhelmed, pause and look at what you are doing.  Don't work harder, longer, more frantically, hoping you will catch up.  Don't let your life become one endless "To Do" list.  Americans are noted for their industriousness.  They are also leaders in heart attack statistics.   Is there time to "stop and smell the roses"?  There is time, but only if you make that a priority.  Maybe this book will help you find time for the important things in your life 
 I enjoyed the book, especially the middle part (the majority of the story) about the first Celia and Stephen the monk.  They had a truly sad ending, my heart especially broke for the fate of Stephen.  Maybe it is just me, but the last part of the book just didn't flow well for me, but I can't put my finger on why.  All in all an enjoyable read, but it definitely isn't Katherine, which all lovers of historical fiction should read -- that one deserves 10 stars at least 
 At first glance, this book seems quite exciting, judging from its colourful presentation format, with visually appealing photographs, breezy light text  & catchy phrases.  After perusing it, I regret to find that it offers neither breakthrough ideas nor revolutionary approach.  In the field of business writing, the concept & philosophy behind ABT (what I would term as perceptual sensitivity or acuity) was first broached by Edward de bono in the early 70's with his series of lateral thinking books, starting from the ground-breaking `Mechanism of Mind.' His former discipline, Michael Hewitt-Gleeson from Down Under went on to expand his former mentor's ideas by introducing the CVS2BVS equation in his book, `Software for Your Brain.' He even created a web-based School of Thinking to teach his stuff.  Many business consultants/authors have since then come out with their own insightful interpretations. They include, to name just a few, Joel Arthur Barker (`Future Edge'), Jerry Wind (`The Power of Impossible Thinking'), J Philip Kirby (`Thoughtware'), Moshe Rubinstein (`The Minding Organisation'), Mark Brown ('Dinosaur Strain'), & Luc de Brabandere (`The Forgotten Half of Change'). A few others even introduced some creative twists to the original concept, e.g. Wayne Burkan's "Wide Angle Vision' (or 'Splatter Vision')& George Day's `Peripheral Vision.'  Coming back to this book, I would like add that I actually enjoyed reading the inspiring stories of real people & also doing the workouts & reflections, some of which seem absurd to some readers. At the end of the book, the authors have provided some ABT cards which one can pull out & create laminated cards for sharing the ideas with others. The authors have also incorporated one last visual challenge at the end of the book, What Do You See?.   I am particularly intrigued as to why the authors did not include a bibliography or references at the back of the book.  On the whole from the standpoint of enhancing perceptual sensitivity or acuity, I would rate this book a 4 for its colourful presentation, brilliant simplicity & catchy phrases, although I am quite inclined to rate it a 3 in the light of what I have just reviewed.  For those readers who have not read any of the books mentioned in this review, this book is therefore still worthwhile to be read & played with.   Additionally, I would recommend:  - Playful Perception, by Herbet Leff; - How to Use Your Eyes, by James Elkins; - The Playful Eye, by Julian Rothenstein;  for those readers who are keen to explore further. 
 I've read books by Philip Pullman before but this one really suprised me. This is deffenetly not a childrens book, but I thought is was very interesting and I couldn't put it down. Pullman has held his spot as my favorite author 
 The product was as advertised and delivered on time 
 Fry is best known for his comic writing and acting, but there's nothing whatever funny about the plight of seventeen-year-old Ned Maddstone, privileged (but far from wealthy) member of the British upper classes. He's bright (though naive), well-liked (by most), well-educated and headed for Oxford, and his father is a government minister -- and he's in love with a gorgeous young woman, so the world would seem to be his oyster. But two peers he thought were his friends, and who envy him the ease with which good things come, conspire with the girl's American cousin, who wants her for himself. Next thing he knows, Ned has been set up and busted by the cops for drug possession. But he's also innocently carrying an IRA communication that brings him to the notice of a thoroughly loathsome member of Britain's secret service, and Ned is soon plunged into a hell that causes him to disappear from the world and which destroys his life. This first part of the book is gripping and wince-producing as the reader witnesses Ned's destruction. The middle part, based closely on _The Count of Monte Cristo,_ is a little harder to accept -- but, hey, maybe being locked up for twenty years in an asylum with nothing else to do could cause this sort of flowering, given the right sort of fertilizer. In the latter part of the book, we follow Ned's quest for vengeance -- which he makes sure is his, not the Lord's. He really has gone insane, just as his original tormentor intended. And this completes his eventual destruction, in ways he could not have foreseen. As ever, Fry is a master of language and mood, and he doesn't try to convince you that Ned is "right," only that his mania can be understood 
 Forty to fifty years ago economists and political theorists did much armwaving about what makes nations competitive. In the past 20 years  tools like analysis of patents, R&D expenditures, the numbers of scientifically educated people, have provided more quantitative insight. To these tools Porter adds realistic analyses of top industries in various countries - from shoes and couture in Italy, to Silicon Valley in the U.S. He points out that the fastest growth comes when favorable factors are concentrated in centers where diverse groups - industrial, academic, sometimes government or traditional industries come together and have intense interactions. This book glitters with insights and ideas. The author is among the leading US analysists of economic performance, heading a study discipline at Harvard and working with the National Bureau of Economic Researc 
 Alistair's book is one of the early books on Agile Development and written quite closely after the signing of the Agile Manifesto. His book originally intended to be about Crystal, but the title got changed. This you can still notice at places.  The book is an eye opener for the software development profession. He discusses very much things which sometimes have come up (by people like Jerry Weinberg) but never really made it in the mainstream. This is what this book has done, bring them out. These are things like different skill levels of people, cost of not being colocated, different processes for different size groups, impact of skills on the size of the group etc.  The book is sometimes abstract though. It doesn't always takes concrete solutions. If that's what you expect then you might be dissapointed.  Now 5 years after publication, this is still relevant and still in the top 10 list of Agile books. A must read 
 Barbara Curtis has really struck a chord with me.  Her writing is heartfelt and genuine without any of the sappiness that usually accompanies Christian authors when they talk about parenting.  She offers a wonderful blend of personal anecdotes and practical advice to illustrate the points she makes in her book.  I feel like I have been allowed into her home for a glimpse of what mothering twelve children actually looks like.  She is not ashamed of her past and she is ready and willing to admit her mistakes and what she has learned from them.  Based on her teaching in the Montessori method of education, she gives several suggestions as to how to better know children.  By getting down on the level of one's child and seeing the world through their eyes, we are able to better facilitate opportunities for them to learn and grow.  While she uses Montessori as a sort of framework, she fills in the "gaps" with practical lessons and examples from her own family life to illustrate her points.  Although I doubt she would give herself this label, I would suggest that Mrs. Curtis practices "grace-based parenting" and her ideas are totally consistent with attachment parenting.  My son is 9 months old and lately, I've been mourning his infancy.  Its gone by so fast!  After reading Mrs. Curtis' book, I am absolutely thrilled at the wonderful work that is to come.  I can't wait to use what I have learned from this book.  I can start even now.  After reading this book, I find myself more excited by the plethora of opportunities I will have each day to teach my son, to help him feel secure in this big world, and to create a joyful, loyal, and memorable home-life.  This is a newfound excitement and I am grateful to Mrs. Curtis for her willingness to share her wisdom and wit with us all.  Its a great read as well... it almost reads like a novel in that I didn't want to put it down.  However, the sections are short enough that its easy to read with a little one crawling around.  Pick it up.  You won't regret it and it will totally bless your life 
 A very impressive travel book that mixes humor, history and travel anecdotes into a delectable concoction that'll hold you in rapt attention and inspire you to plan something similar on your own. A history undergraduate from Cambridge University, William Dalrymple embarks on a 12000 mile long journey that retraces Marco Polo's epic 13th century journey along the Silk Route (from Jerusalem to Xanadu). His journey takes him through the glorious Mongol empire (founded by the very enigmatic Genghis Khan). However, now the Silk Route passes through Israel, Syria, Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and China. An overland passage through these closed countries is an incredible travel feat.   William writes very witty humor and there were many occasions when I was almost rolling on the floor clenching my stomach. I am impressed by William's rich & deep insight into the history of the region; the book can very well double up as a history textbook. The writing gets progressively better as William treads into deeper territory.  I have done a fair bit of traveling in the last few years. There is something intoxicating about traveling on a whim, taking unplanned detours, confronting tough immigration and above all doing it all on a shoestring budget.   
 I was quite worried after reading The Color of Magic that I had just spent all that time enjoying myself, but I knew that book #2 would be a let down and so I'd be okay and I could get back to work and/or literature or at least wasting time on shock wave games.   The Light Fantastic (book #2) I'm horrified to say was even funnier than The Color Of Magic (book #1), and there are 30+ books in the series. If the progression of humor is any where near linear, I may be in actual physical danger. I could asphyxiate from laughing long before I reach the end.  I may have to get one of those bracelets. 
 I loved reading the Ludlum's covert one novels and read all of them and was disappointed that there weren't more until I saw that this one by Larkin continued the series.  It brought back all the adventure and spine tinkling situations that I had read in Ludlum's books.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and am looking to read more of these.  I'm hooked and love it 
 I had originally read this novel, and its continuation Fall of Hyperion, in the early 90's shortly after discovering it won the Hugo award.  It was an engrossing read, I finished it satisfied with the quality of Hugo award winners at the time, and then continued on to reading subsequent award winners.  So here it is some 15 years or so later, I'm re-reading it after hearing others rave about it (I've had people exclaim to me on a bus to Poland even), discover that it is now a four-book series, and has the status that Dune had in its generation 25 years or so ago.  (So if the 25 year cycle continues, then it's only 8 years or so until the next Dune/Hyperion sci-fi novel.)  Hyperion was published before the ubiquitous presence of the internet.  Just to give an idea of what it was like then, it was a time of logging into the internet for the very first time in one's life and having conversations such as: `ok first type in http', `why', `just do it and make sure it's http not hhtp or htpp ok then type in colon and backslash backslash and make sure it's backslash not forward slash', `a what-slash what there are two types of slashes... who thinks of these things', `and make sure you type in two backslashes', `why two why not three or four', `just type it', `ok now type in three w's', `oh so *now* we type in three continuous characters'.  Yes, it was an amusing time.  So this book was published before most of these conversational interactions, so World Web in the novel takes on new meaning from a re-reading.  And terms like fatline could have been taken from Apple's use of  `fat' software codes that was written be compatible between their older hardware and their newer Power-PC-chip hardware that were being incorporated into their computers in the late 80's.  So Simmons was really on the cutting edge of things when he published this novel.  Like Dune, this is a sweeping epic novel part of a sweeping epic series.  As others have commented, Hyperion/Fall of Hyperion (FoH) are not separate books, they are one book that was split down the middle and published separately.  That means it's really a 1000 page novel.  That may seem daunting, but for a serious reader of SF, you'll want to read this, and more importantly it's hard to believe you wouldn't enjoy reading this.  There'll be a point in your life, if not already, where the additional $8 will be insignificant and the time it takes to read this will be precious, so if you have the time now then now's the time.    There are some novels that seem to have more meaning when read at some point in one's life.  This novel to me personally takes on more meaning now that I have advanced in my career.  I can identify with many of the characters; their professionalism, occasion disillusionment, screw-ups, and achievements.    There are things from this novel that sticks with you through the years.  Definitely the Shrike.  (The shrike by the way is an actual bird that impales worms it's caught upon thorns and such.)  Also the ending of the Fall of Hyperion I remember.  From the ending of Hyperion/FoH, and Simmons comment on the destruction of Maui-Covenant, not by military action, but by the tourists `smelling of suntan lotion and cannibas', Simmons is disillusioned by the effect of quick and far ranging travel to places of unique status and human-masses eventual erosion of what had made that location unique.  The ending that he writes will certainly work in his futuristic universe, but is he suggesting a parallel event in ours?  Is it that we should remove jet engines from our collective consciousness'?    Is this a bold comment on the possible overpopulation of our planet, now at 6 or 7 or 8.4 billion at this time?  Is this a comment on this now almost untouchable subject (overpopulation), with considerable population increases foreseen not in the United States or Europe but rather on the Asian continent and in such cities as Lagos.  Well maybe not; maybe it's on what can be done within the United States itself, with its hideously ugly ubiquitous strip malls within a short distance of any region with physical beauty.  Although it's unlikely anything will change, it may not be a bad thing to hope for.  Considering the ending of the Hyperion/FoH epic, this may be the point of what he has written.  482 pages, published 1989, 4-1/2 star 
 A lot of reviews focused on the history covered by this book, but what I found most compelling was in fact the second half, which discussed the "formation" of a serial killer.   In the first half, the author goes back a few centuries to uncover gruesome truths of serial killers across Europe. With every chapter, he steps forward in time, narrating the lives and biographies of famous and not-so-famous killers, from Jack the Ripper to the Boston Strangler. Every page delivers a shock, as the lives and practices of the killers are revealed.   If you manage to survive through the photos in the center without passing out at the gore, you'll find the second half even more gripping. It explains how a serial killer develops, how his behavior differs from others in childhood, how he strikes his first victim, and the pattern that dictates his life from there on. There is plenty on the many types of killers and their various approaches to murder.   A fair portion near the end of the book is dedicated to criminal profiling and crime scene investigation. The book closes with a chilling chapter on how to survive if you find yourself at the mercy of a serial killer.   A very engaging read if you have the heart for the gruesome details! 
 This was the first book I have read by T.C. Boyle but it will certainly not be the last. I would have never expected a semi-historical account of the exploration of the Niger River to be so entertaining.  An excellent read 
 Pixar has proven its animation metal a few times. FINDING NEMO and THE INCREDIBLES are their most notable achievements, pulling off excellent scripts mixed with fun animation and great star-power voices.   But the one thing that animation studios (including Pixar) have trouble with is displaying human beings within their animation. Many times they look plastic or stilted. The Incredibles avoided this by harkening back to animations-of-ol' but applying new styles. Finding Nemo didn't have many human faces so it wasn't such a hurdle. With CARS, Pixar did something very wise: they didn't show a single human face. Personalities were under the hood (so to speak) of the automobiles which juxtaposed nicely with their humanity.  The story follows a cocky up-and-coming race car named Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson, WEDDING CRASHERS) who's triple tie win forces a showdown in California where the three would-be winners will face off. Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton, FIRST DAUGHTER) and The King (racing icon Richard Petty) are the other two contestants and they make it to California without any problems. They are ready to win "The Piston Cup." But Lightning's driver Mack (John Ratzenberger, CHEERS TV series) falls asleep on the road and Lightning slides out the back (also while asleep) while on "the highway." Lightning soon wakes up and tries to find Mack, but stumbles upon a one-cylinder town along abandoned Route 66 called Radiator Springs. Unfortunately, Lightning also tears up the town's road and must do his civic duty by pulling the paving machine for the length of the city. Stuck without any resources, Lightning grudgingly does the job, but not before learning to slow his rpm's and smell the proverbial roses. He meets up with Radiator Spring's city attorney Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt, MONSTERS, INC.), a sexy little Porsche model whom he finds himself oddly attracted to. There's also Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, THE STING) the town's physician/judge who harbors a big secret; Ramone (Cheech Marin, TIN CUP), a low-riding, paint-shop owner; Luigi (Tony Shalhoub, GALAXY QUEST), a tire store proprietor with a love of Italian cars; and, of course, Mater (Larry The Cable Guy), the rusted out but trustworthy tow truck who adds the most hilarity to the film.  Cars gushes with family friendly messages but no one should hold that against it. Animation features, by their very nature, are directed toward younger audiences and allowing that innocence to come out in Cars is pulled off well without becoming achingly super-sweet. But we've also learned that adults enjoy these movies and Cars does an admirable job of entertaining them, too. Most kids probably won't know what cow-tipping is, so might not understand the slow natured tractors that double as cattle and are tipped over by Mater and Lightning. But adults with experience in this area will probably laugh themselves silly.  That there are no human faces in Cars also aided it immensely. Suspending disbelief was easy and will allow kids and parents alike a great ride throughout 
 This is the first Tom Waits album I've bought.  This is a fantastic album. Folk, jazz, piano, guitar, unique voice, poetic songs. If you like acoustic music and bob dylan/neil young type voices, i expect you'd like this. No lyrics on this CD unfortunately. This was made in 1973 - it has a timeless appeal. Get this one, especially if you've never heard him before or if think you hate Tom Waits. You might change your mind 
 Let's face it:  today's schools are so busy teaching political correctness, they skip over the basics, like fundamental English grammar. Even those who once learned how to parse a complex compound sentence get confused over words like "effect" and "affect." Dave Dowling's "Wrong Word Dictionary" has compiled all these annoying little buggers into a handy, concise manual that should be kept right next to the computer. Look to your laurels, Strunk & White, Dave Dowling has a book on usage that we can really use! 
 Several reviews have covered in minute detail the excellence of this project.  I have to agree, plus I have to express my sincere gratitude to those engineers who are bringing matieral of this caliber back into circulation via remastering and digitalizing.  It's wonderful to be to enjoy the sounds of the masters during their heyday, plus listen to alternate takes, and other bonus material from the sessions.  Thanks and hats off to a bunch of dedicated "philes" of the process.  Respectfully g 
 This is an amazing book.  If you are a fan of zombies at all, this is part 2 of what many consider the Bible of Zombie (The Zombie Survival Guide being the other half).  There are not words in my vocabulary to describe the awesomeness of this book.  The intricately woven stories make you go back and re-read previous portions to stay on top of everything.  The way everything goes together so well is just pure genius.  And the fact that this is 100% genuine material, not some ha ha funny joke kind of thing.  God, it's so good.  Go read the Zombie Survival Guide as well 
 I heard about this book after all the hype about it being banned from some schools because it talks about a homosexual family.  First of all, this is a true story, and second, get over it people!  It's a story about two male penguins that formed a bond and were given the opportunity by the zoo keeper to hatch an egg.  I definitely wanted to get it to read to my children.  We have a close family member who is gay.  My children are too young to understand the other alternative family type books yet, but this was perfect.  It opens up the concept to them.  On a purely, scientific point of view, it's also a lesson of how animals can thrive under unnatural conditions (the zoo!)  
 Matt Ridley does a good job of explaining the origins of virtue as pro-social, instinctive behaviors that serve individual or genetic self-interest via a cohesive and cooperative group. The flip-side of this is tribal 'us' vs 'them' thinking and behavior which can lead to the horrors of war and genocide.  Free-trade is seen as the way to improve relations between groups. Reduced state power with private or communal property ownership is seen as the way to improve conservation of resources and to improve relations between people who are then equally engaged in exchange. Exchange is built on trust which is the foundation of virtue.  Ridley acknowledges the problem that the recognition of the motivation of self-interest in people can lead to people becoming more selfish.  My greater concern is his assumption of exchange being between equals. Or, indeed, how decision-making power will be shared equally considering, for example, how much authority men have had over women throughout evolution and history. Can women be equal exchangers considering their reproductive and 'caring' roles in society that are so difficult to cost or even for men to value? Ridley himself says that tribalism is more of a male problem so is this all really just directed at men and traditional male activities? If so, where does it leave women, children, the elderly etc? The practicalities are far from clear.  Nonetheless, this is a strong argument and Ridley is a very entertaining writer. Certainly well worth reading 
 Like many other people, Cujo is the first Stephen King book I ever read.  It's shorter than most of King's other work, but it's a great story.    Before reading it, people obviously have an idea what it will be about.  When reading it, you know how it's going to turn out later on in the story, it's just a matter of when it will happen.  Stephen King really builds up the suspense based on the readers knowing something bad will happen later on.    From my memory, the first 30 pages are good.  We are introduced to the characters.  The story becomes less scary about 30 pages in, but the suspense is built upon the readers knowing Cujo is about to go on his rampage at some point, we just don't know when.  The story becomes a little bit slow in the first half, but the character development is great none the less.  The first part of the story focuses on marital problems in two different families.    The part with Cujo's rampage and the situation two characters get into is loosely related to these problems.  How is it related you might ask?  The best answer is to read the story and see how.  While it might seem slow at first, Cujo becomes a gut wrenching story at the half point, and it ends with a tragic, heart breaking ending.  I won't give away the ending, but I will say that the movie ends differently, which really disapointed me when I watched it.  Cujo is great for those who are new to Stephen King.  It's pretty well paced, even during the slower parts.  It's a great story too, and is much deeper than it looks on the surface.  It also hits home to certain people, since the story is realistic and doesn't involve anything supernatural 
 This book is a mass of contradictions. In my mind it did not live up to the unatainable hype it has recently recieved. I had not previously come across a book where Richard Russo, one of my all time favorite authors, wrote gushing praises over another writers work on a dust jacket before. In many ways, Russo is the perfect writer to pass a judgement on Walter's work "Citizen Vince." Walter uses his gift for prose in a weaving manner that is straight out of the pages of 'Nobody's Fool'. Walter also starts with a meandering narrative that is fascinating, though about 150 pages in it straightens out and the story becomes not only predictable but lethargically focused on the ending.   This is not a mystery that deserves any praise whatsoever for its mystery plot. Its strained and not very well thought out. Instead it is in my mind to be praised as a very revealing book that shows considerable strength on the authors part. It shows that Jess Walter might have a strong and creative career ahead of him, and that Citizen Vince is an admirable step along the way towards achieving that goal.  One thing that really got to me while reading this was that besides Vince, the main character, Walter uses up about a third of his pages telling the story of a very young police officer. Thinking back on it, I really don't think that any of this added to the story and instead served only to break up the prose pertaining to Vince. Many of Wlater's characters beyond Vince are only barely fleshed out.   I think that this was an ok book, but am awaiting further efforts by Walter with anticipation 
 Based on a Louis L'Amour novel, Tom Selleck is convincing as a cowboy named Raif who keeps a promise to a fellow sailor, Charles Rodney, by helping his widow hang on to her ranch and keep an eye on the widow as well. But a rich scoundrel has plans to talk the widow into marriage and get the ranch for himself. What he doesn't tell her is that he's responsible for her husband's death. Things get real tense for Raif and his friends as the expose the rich man for the cheating liar he is. A well written screenplay adaptation and lovely scenery. The dialogue is also superb (I especially love the Irishman's jokes).  Chrissy K. McVay - Autho 
 Halper & Clarker deliver a meticulously researched and valuable account of the rise of Neo-Conservative thinking, tracing the ideology's origins from the educational ivory towers that conservatives love to hate, to its current prominence in the White House.  Retired officials from the Reagan and H.W. Bush administrations, the authors stake their positions on current U.S. foreign policy.  And with breathtaking ease they dismantle the mosaic of fables, exaggerations, and lies that has allowed a small coterie of intellectuals to commandeer control of key policy decisions.  The overriding theme is an important one:  there is nothing conservative about "neo-conservatives".  Theirs is a radical new policy of jack-booted militarism and blind optimism, a break with tradition that would make Woodrow Wilson blush and Edmund Burke - a classical conservative - sneer in contempt.  This tour-de-force will blow serious and thoughtful readers away, whether liberal or conservative.  A must-have for any collection 
 I haven't heard the audio book for "October Surprise," but I did read the hardbound book when it was first published.  Perhaps the negative review from "M.P.T." of AudioFile can be explained by the book author's inability to reference virtually every sentence with footnoted sources as he did in the full, paper version.  Failing that excuse, the blurb and referenced to a fault, and he used no information from his investigation that he did not have at least two or three unrelated sources for.  Though Sick doesn't draw the conclusion in the book, he leaves enough clues for the reader to figure oseems typical of the disinformation reviews written by the small army of media-spinners who enjoy two paychecks--one from their unsuspecting publisher or TV/radio station, and one from a certain U.S. Government agency who wants to discourage the public from knowing about self-serving black bag operations.  The fact is that Gary Sick's story is meticulously detailed ut that it was not Ronald Reagan, but likely another still-living former president who was behind the treasonous actions recorded here--someone who still has powerful friends to help quash the truth any time it tries to raise its head.  Read or listen to this book, and then buy "Plausible Denial" written by Mark Lane to see what other high-profile shenanigans this same group has been up to.  It will also explain just how much control these folks exert over the media to steer the public away from the truth.  I very highly recommend both books 
 STUD is both fun and a nice overview of the horse racing and breeding industry. One of those rare books you tend to share witty quotes from with your friends.  The writer does an excellent job of telling us about the industry, horses and people - while rarely, if ever, boring us with the "I'm special 'cause I was there and you weren't" flavor common to many horse racing industry books.  A rare find, I was sorry to reach the end. 
 Edgar H. Schein is Professor of Management Emeritus in the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is a real academic heavyweight having written numerous books, articles and papers. In 1969 he published 'Process Consultation: Its Role in Organizational Development', of which he states that he "was writing more in anger than with perspective". In this follow-up book he tried to explain and clarify the concept of consultation and helping  which was outlined in the first volume. "The goals of this new book, then, are (1) to reaffirm the concept of process consultation as a viable model of how to work with human systems, (2) to clarify the concept were needed, and (3) to introduce some modifications and new ideas that elaborate on the original ideas."  The book is split up in 3 parts. In Part I - Introduction and Overview, which consists of three chapters, Schein introduces the common grounds of managers and consultants (which is the helping orientation), process consultation, and "the process" itself. He introduces a definition of process consultation which "is a set of activities on the part of the consultant that help the client to perceive, understand, and act upon the process events that occur in the client's environment." Whereby he emphasizes that the concept of process central is to understanding consultation and management. "Process refers to how things are done rather than what is done." He continues, "Process is everywhere. In order to help, intervene, and facilitate human problem solving, one must focus on communication and interpersonal processes."  In Part II - Simplifying Models of Human Processes, which also consists of three chapters, Schein examines several models of consultation and argues that the process-consultation model works for consultants as interveners and is potentially most useful for managers. "The most important thing for managers or consultants to understand is what goes on inside their own heads." He introduces the basic ORJI cycle, which is based on the fact that our nervous system observes (O), reacts (R), analyzes, processes, and make judgments (J), and intervenes in order to make something happen (I). He later updates this cycle into a more realistic depiction of the ORJI cycle, through the introduction of 4 traps. Schein than states that the cultural rules of interaction is possibly the most powerful determinant whether a viable helping relationship will be established. In the final chapter of this part, he examines in detail a simplified model of the change process: (1) Unfreezing; (2) changing; and (3) refreezing.  In the final part of the book - The Consulting Process in Action, which is also the longest part of the book with five chapters, the author examines in detail the strategy and tactics of intervention. "The most important point to be made about clients is that the consultant must always be clear who the client is at any given moment in time, and must distinguish clearly among contact, intermediate, primary, and ultimate client." Schein discusses what the consultant or manager can actually say or do to accomplish some of the goals of process consultation. "The strategy and tactics of intervention have to be guided by the ultimate assumptions underlying the helping process." In addition, he provides categories of types of interventions and discusses the possible dilemmas that can arise in the consultation processes. "The skill of intervening is to be so tuned in to what is going on that one's sense of timing and appropriateness is based on the external events, not one's internal assumptions or theories."  Yes, this is a good book on process consultation. I was somewhat concerned when I started reading this book, due to Schein's highly academical background. However, the book has been a revelation. It is highly practical and has good tips on which can be put in practical use. I believe that it useful for both consultants and managers, as the author set out from the start. I believe that the three parts can be read in any order, whereby the last part is possibly the most useful as it is the most practical. Please note that the writing style is now somewhat outdated and academical. Highly recommended to consultants and managers alike 
 After winding down in the late 70's after a series of classic lp's on the small Ode label, Carole King signed to a major label (Atlantic Records) and made this stunning debut lp "One To One" which is equal to her finest work but strangely "One To One" received no airplay and seemed to go unnoticed except by us hard-core fans who recognized Carole classic songs at there greatest and most creative plus Carole is clearly in her greatest vocal form.  Soul-stirring passionate vocals such as "Life With Love" and the great title "One To One" illustrate why Carole is a legendary singer-songwriter who is second to none...funky rhythm drive "Lookin' Out For Number One" which features a hot burning vocal from Carole while "Golden Man" is a musical journey that is haunting and gorgeous and in my Top 5 all-time favorite classics from this great legendary musical wonder.  Every song in this magnificent set is incredibly great and this tremendous collection is a masterful one not to be missed...thank you Carole King for this great musical treat which today sounds fresh and timeless!!!!   Bravo Carole Kin 
 Wow! This book is unbelieveable. I had never heard of Rees Howells before reading this book. But as I read, I was challenged and convicted, by his faith and his willingness to do whatever God asked of him.   I disagree with the reviewer who said that this book has a theological problem. The things Rees did (like not wearing a hat and growing his hair long) are things the Lord asked him to do. They are things that he didn't just decide to do on his own. I think that is an important distinction to make. I also believe it is impossible to effectively intercede unless you walk a mile in their shoes. There were occassions when Rees did this in a literal sense. But it seems to me, that he did it more often in a spiritual sense.   I found myself identifying a lot with Rees as I read. The man was not perfect, he definitely had faults. I don't mean to imply that I think he didn't. But the Lord used him in a mighty way and I think Rees has things to teach us all.   I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to break out of complacent Christianity. This book will change your life and your relationship with the Lord, if you read it with an open mind and an open, teachable heart. This is a book to read slowly. You will want to take time to digest and meditate on it. I would also recommend reading it more than once. I have often found that I always gain new insights on the second or third time through. This is one book you will want to glean every possible insight from. There is so much here.   This is one of the most life-changing books I have ever read. 
 Brief and objective way to keep updated in general clinics. It is probably one of the best ways to keep updated, when working specificaly in a defined field. As an otolaryngologist, it is always a good source of information in other fields. The chapter of AIDS and HIV, gets longer every year. The first time I read it, it was in 1983 with few pages related to it, and now the chapter has pages and pages, enough for a non AIDS/HIV specialist (I hope!) 
 This is one of the richest collections of short stories I've ever read. The author's sparse yet deep writing style kept the pages turning. I highly recommend this book 
 The length (my version is 1500 pages!) did scare me at first but it far surpassed my hopes in bringing my state to life - I felt as if it were my personal history and made me proud to be a Texan, born and raised.  It was informative and educational without being dull or preachy, and made me genuinely interested in the characters - both the historical and the fictional ones.  Also made me a bit homesick.... all in all incredibly entertaining!! 
 yet another wonderful hellboy tale. great stuff if you're into sci-fi and old legends and things. a good mix of characters and the best darn visual storytelling in the industry today, care of mike mignola 
 This may be the best Junie B. book yet, at least from a grown-up's perspective.  The rivalry between Junie B. and Tattletale May escalates in this book until it threatens to ruin the Christmas season for both of them, and the choices Junie B. has to make as a result of this are wonderful.  Without giving anything (or at least not too much) away to those who have not read this one yet, let me just say that, as a mother, I was so proud of Junie B. at the end of this book.  Hooray to Barbara Park for yet another great look inside the head of a spunky kid 
 I really enjoy this tape and use it often.  I particularly favor the 'zoning' or waves as she calls it.  3 zones that progressively get harder and each one definetly build on one another.  The end is a killer when your 'popping' up in the middle between side squats!  Defintely a worthwhile tape that uses time efficiently and pacts a lot of cardio into its zones.  I think having the weight training at the ends is a good idea, but dont think you're going to use heavy weights- more for toning so stick to the lower weights.  
 I liked all the insider gossip; I'm an anglophile so I got a lot of the references, but I wonder if my fellow Americans who don't listen to BBC religiously would get a lot of the inside stuff?  I decided not to read the end of the book so I'll never know what happens. My idiosyncracies.  Thank you Mr. Fellowes. I look forward to more more more!! 
 Recorded in 1941 at Monroe's Uptown House and Teddy Hill's Minton's Playhouse, this recording  is considered to be the first and one of the only recodings of the early transistion to Bop.  If you do not know there was a recording lockout in the early to mid 40s and only V discs were made.  These were big name artists and bands.  The transitional music that was going on in the clubs was pretty much left unrecorded.  It was only because a private collector, Jerry Newman, brought his own recording device to these clubs that these recordings even exist. Before these were even put to LP originally,  Jerry Newman played the discs he made over and over.  That accounts for why the sound quality is not quite perfect.  Bebop didn't happen overnight but there is no recorded history of it. But this recording does exist and speaks out for the rare talent Charlie Christian had.  He helped make the path along with others like Dizzy for the creation of Bebop.  This does not deserve anything but 5 stars. This recording is a rare piece of history.  Big bands didn't call for long uninterupted solos like were allowed to be performed here on this CD.  Minton's was also a jam place for among others Parker.  BOP WOULD HAVE NEVER EXISTED IF IT WERE NOT FOR JAM SESSIONS LIKE THIS.  AGAIN I SAY THIS IS A HISTORIC RECORDING.  NOTHING ELSE LIKE THIS WAS RECORDED IN THE EARLY TO MID 40S.  THIS IS THE EARLIEST BEBOP. No one played like Charlie in the early 40s.  His and Dizzy's talent shine on this disc. Hope this is helpful, Norman W. Nonnweiler.      
 George Eliot spent two years preparing "Romola", and the result is a rich, densely detailed "Tale of the Renaissance".  Never a facile writer, here she is concerned with one of the most intellectually  challenging (not to mention politically complicated) periods in history;  and she paints the panoply and power struggles as a background for the  personal tragedy which is the novel's crux.  While not an "easy  read" in the Sir Walter Scott sense, "Romola" presents in  sumptous detail the banquets, the festivities, and the famous bonfire of  vanities that one associates with late 15th Century Florence.But from a  purely literary viewpoint, the most important thing about the book is its  delineation of Tito Melema, the young man who in the opening chapters is  the story's hero, but slowly, irrevocably becomes its villain. Neither Sir  Walter nor Charles Dickens has psychological insight (in the modern sense)  as sharp as George Eliot's, and this study of a fictional character's  downfall is one of the most stunning depictions of corruption in English  literature. That he is the husband of the heroine, a sensitive, finely  sensual woman, makes the tragedy all the more poignant.  Scenes involving  historical characters (including Savonarola and Machiavelli) tend to be a  little stiff in costume movie style.  Oh, and because the story takes place  in the 1490's, one must imagine the Piazza della Signoria without  Michelangelo and Cellini. This must really have frustrated a connoisseur  like George Eliot 
 I'll make this short and to the point.  This release is a MUST for any Rush fan, ESPECIALLY if you own a 5.1 or DTS surround sound system in your home.  Each one of these concerts is worth the $30 price tag, but to bundle all three and then throw in a live CD of the Grace Under Pressure is just awesome.  I've had Exit...Stage Left on VHS, and to own it on DVD in DTS is very cool.  
 A brilliant piece of research.  China is in the news these days, but very few people know the true story of Mao.  Jung Chang's book is clearly polemic, but it is based on enormous factual research.  One of the book's strengths is that typically such a carefully researched acadmemic piece would be a dry and dusty read.  By contrast, the prose is clear and the story is gripping, which makes the huge quantity of information easier to plough through.  
 This number 93 tri-color ink cartridge by Hewlett Packard is an essential for those of us who use the HP Deskjet 5440 printer--or any other printer that accepts this cartridge.   The three colors of yellow, red and green can be combined by the printer to produce a wide array of other colors very effectively. The cartridge takes up little space if you care to stock up on them and it comes well packaged so that it won't break during shipment. Moreover, the installation and removal of the cartridge is very easy so when changing the ink cartridge you will rarely have any difficulty.   My only complaint is that the ink goes rather quickly and thus the cost of this ink over the long run can be expensive. I rarely print and nevertheless just about every two months I still have to buy another cartridge. I will take off one star for that to make this a four star review.   The price is absolutely right compared to what stores in my area charge for this product. If you care to save some money you can buy this ink cartridge in the same package as a black ink HP 92; this would be even more cost-efficient.   Overall, the quality of the ink is rather good despite my one complaint that the ink goes faster than I would like it to go. The cartridge provides you with the ability to print a multitude of colors on your paper and replacement is easy.  SMILE 
 This episode of Star Trek, "The Man Trap" is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise. Truthfully, "The Man Trap" terrified me (I was maybe two, or three, although I am sure by that time the series was limping along in it's third season and I was seeing a repeat for the first time); Star Trek was considered "adult programming", and as such I was not allowed to watch it - I used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights I stayed at their house, then would lay awake in my bed scared by what I'd seen, but excited just the same. Like another space show I enjoyed and was terrified by (Lost in Space), I didn't recognize Star Trek as anything but a world I wanted very much to be in, but remained frightened of anyhow (I was, as I said, very young).  
 I am going to refer to the original text version written by Adam Smith: This was absolutely a brutal read; however, it was more or less a paradox described as painfully interesting. The mind of Adam Smith is incredible, and I encourage an interested reader to duke it out as you'll most certainly come out of the book more informed. I would recommend Wealth of Nations to anyone who has a mild interest in Economics.  Brian Ole 
 A great book showing and impressive number of patches but also of tabs. It depicts a large number of variants and some inverted designs for combat veterans (righ shoulder). No classification by era (WWII, Vietnam, etc.) but by army, corps, division and arms (including some battalion patches). The book is principally on Army units with 6 pages on USMC units, and 2 about the Navy. Rangers tabs and SF flashes are well depicted (no airborne flash). A good part on Army Aviation (8 pages). A great reference for patches collectors showing a large number of patches I don't see elsewhere 
 Miles Vorkosigan's cunning plan is to court the widow Ekaterin.  Unfortunately the only way he knows how to take on projects is through military precision.  Miles is an idiot.  Mark Vorkosigan's cunning plan it to create a new enterprise using "butter bugs", a genetically engineered bug that produces an edible tofu like substance.  [Miles calls it "Bug Vomit"]  Mark wants to help Kareen Kouldelka earn her way back to a Beta Colony school where he and she can continue exploring their relationship without cultural impediments.  Ivan Vorpatril's strait forward plan, [Ivan isn't known for 'cunning',] is to propose to the Lady Donna.  Lord Dono has something to say about that.  Lord Dono has a cunning plan.  But who the heck is Lord Dono??  Surround the whole story with the pending marriage of Emperor Gregor and the Lady Laisa, and the Vor are dropping like flies on bug butter.  This Vorkosigan adventure has no military campaigns, no threats of death, [well...not really.] It does have all of the intrigue and mess-pionage that you could expect with the over abundance of cunning plans.  You'll suffer for Miles, and then cheer at the inevitable outcome.  Ekaterin is no shrinking violet!  Don't mess with her!  A Civil Campaign is a terrific read!  [A previous reviewer commented on the cover's inaccuracy in depicting Mile's stature.  Actually I believe the couple on the cover are meant to be Emperor Gregor and the Lady Laisa.  It's their wedding after all.  If that's the case then the cover would be okay.]  Shards of Honor Barrayar {Hugo Winner} The Warriors Apprentice The Vor Game {Hugo Winner} Cetaganda Brothers in Arms Borders of Infinity Mirror Dance {Hugo Winner} Memory Komarr -A Civil Campaign- {this review} Diplomatic Immunity 
 I love this book's format - short, digestible pieces. We all carry so many pre-conceived notions about networking, Dr. Misner and Mike & Mike did a great job of busting those myths. My favorite is "Treat people like they want to be treated". Nope, it's a Delusion 
 I rarely like contemporary fiction, but this is a beautifully written love story.  I had watched he television adaptation, and looked for the book. No comparison. CBS missed the central point. Creel doesn't have Jane Austen's wit or bite, but she writes about domestic life and self-discovery with uncommon insight. The result is a work that is a bit reminiscent of the Austen classics 
 This was a helpful book. I appreciated the real examples of how to incorporate music into my child's life.   Author of The Truth aboutt Cafffeine   
 No other book has been able to accurately describe the Mexican psyche as Paz has done in this book. His eloquent prose style captivates the Mexican spirit in all its grace and in all its sadness.  He brings all of Mexico's  conflicts and taboos together and strips off all its masks to reveal the  Mexican.  I found his style to be poetic, eloquent, and majestic. Never had  I read a book as powerfull and truthfull as Paz's. It is no wonder Paz was  honored to receive the Nobel prize for this work.  Any individual willing  to read this book will finish it understanding Mexican culture and history  better 
  	Many will remember the superb reading of McDermid's "The Distant Echo" delivered by Gerard Doyle.  His is a voice that can't be pigeon-holed - he can easily adopt any number of accents and is equally deft at performing a variety of genres.    	With "The Torment of Others," a stunning thriller, few will forget hearing, "Just because you hear voices, it doesn't mean you're mad........And just because you did all that stuff that made the jury look sick to their stomachs...."  	And so begins McDermid's foray into the nether world of a psychotic mind.  A prostitute is found murdered, a gruesome killing that confounds Chief Inspector Carol Jordan as it is a replica of killings that took places several years ago.  For these murders Derek Tyler was apprehended, brought to trial and committed to a mental institution.  He remains there, existing in almost total silence.  	Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Tony Hill doesn't believe a copycat is at work.  All his experience as a criminal profiler leads him to believe otherwise.  It has to be Tyler, which is impossible.......or is it?  	Jordan believes the answer may be found with an undercover operation - a dangerous, perhaps deadly decision.  	First rate listening!          - Gail Cook 
 I enjoyed this quick read.  I did skip over a few chapters that I didn't feel were pertinent to me, but still really enjoyed this book.  If you are looking to see if you are on the right path in life, read God Winks.  And then, start paying attention, you'll be surprised at what comes to mind! 
 Produc in good condition, easy to use. Best price, comparing it whit other selling companies 
 This is an awesome DVD and a must have for any Donny Osmond fans.  I was SOO impressed with the concert footage and at how wonderful Donny still sounds.  I loved the documentary section and being able to see how humorous Donny is behind the scenes and how supportive his family is.  While watching this, I had the TV turned up so loud it sounded like I was at the concert.  Donny - PLEASE come to Dallas for a concert!!!!  Buy this one!! 
 I played this album a lot in the eighties, mainly as background music. I like the rhythm of the album, which is predominately up-tempo. Bruce wrote all the songs and his voice, though limited in range, is ideally suited to the music. I never paid too much attention to the lyrics back then, feeling no need to back then. That wouldn't make for much of a review, so when I finally got round to reviewing the album, I decided to find out what the songs are actually about. As with Bruce's other albums, the songs here show that Bruce is very observant. He sees things that happen in life and uses his incredible songwriting talent to capture what he sees in song. Many of the songs are melancholy (even some of the rocking up-tempo songs) but there are enough lighter songs to provide a contrast.   The album opens with The ties that bind, about a woman afraid to commit herself to love, yet yearning for true love, or so it seems. Sherry darling is about a man who loves a woman but finds her mother irritating. Jackson cage is about a woman trapped in a situation she can't get out of although Bruce leaves open to interpretation exactly what the Jackson cage is. Independence day is a very sad song about a son leaving his father's home after years of not getting on with each other   Hungry heart, about escape from the wife and kids, provided Bruce with a major American hit, also giving him his first (minor) UK hit. Out in the street is about a couple meeting at the weekend after a hard week's work. Crush on you is about a fantasy. You can look but you can't touch is (as you might expect) a song about various situations in life where all you can do is look. I wanna marry you is a very touching song in which Bruce observes an unsmiling single mother struggling with her children and sees something in her that is not immediately apparent. The title track is about bad memories that won't go away.   Point blank is about a woman who ends up in the wrong company and comes to a bad end. Cadillac ranch, by contrast, is a fun song I'm a rocker finds Bruce offering to rescue a woman from another man with whom she seems to be unhappy. Fade away is about the end of a relationship. Stolen car is about a relationship that has gone cold but not ended. Ramrod is a fun song in which Bruce tries to tempt a woman to go ramrodding. The price you pay is about the consequences of pursuing dreams and what can go wrong. Drive all night is a simple love song. Wreck on the highway is about Bruce's memories of an accident and how he reflects on it.   This album works brilliantly as background music, but as I discovered when I looked deeper into it, there are a lot of fascinating songs here. My favorites (some because of the music, others because of the lyrics) are Cadillac ranch, I wanna marry you, You can look but you can't touch, The price you pay, Sherry darling and Independence day, but you may have different favorites - there's a lot of great music here 
 Probably my baby's favorite of the Einstein DVD series.  The music, characters, simple shapes and colors are the perfect combination to amuse and relax a child.  Yes, the entire series is worthwhile.  If you were only to pick one, make it this one 
 The best of the B&W days otherwise known as Mickey's Golden Age.  STEAMBOAT WILLIE, PLANE CRAZY, MICKEY'S SERVICE STATION.  It's all there.  Only one problem:  they should have released B&W Volume 1 and Volume 2 with proper chronology in place.  Very minor 
 Anne Perry writes with a spectacular passion and grasp of our world as no other author in print today. And she does it with both style and finesse. First, she has the widsom to provide highly absorbing and entertaining plots, as well as characters in her new series thus far with "No Graves As Yet" and "Shoulder The Sky." But she continually creates these gems with an impossible multi-faceted approach.   Indeed, there are profoundly important layers of insight contained within each and every development in the story itself -- along with her characters, who gently but effectively take us to a very real no-mans-land. In this way, Perry makes it clear that the world today faces the same evil her heroes in "Shoulder The Sky" must brave: like a New World Order, so to speak, where freedom of the individual along with his or her diversity of race, culture, faith, mores, tradition and even country are being tagged, labeled, and manipulated by truly sinister forces, with an eye to a one-for-all meltdown. Perry masterfully shines the light of truth on such lack of vision, compassion or even hope in order to bring about the ultimate in controlling the destiny of virtually everyone, and everything.   In this respect, "Shoulder The Sky" could not be more superbly prophetic for our time. And time itself, just may be running out for all of us. So, if you are an Anne Perry fan like me -- do not miss out on this new series as a classic in English Literature. And if you have never read a single book by this brilliant author, both "No Graves As Yet" and "Shoulder The Sky" are must-purchase books! For if world history has taught us anything, it is that at one time or another -- events, people, places, and things inevitably slip beyond our control to the point where all we really can do is carry on, while keeping hope alive...as if we were literally shouldering the sky.    
 I have been recommending this book for years.  Informative, insightful, and entertaining, this book is a must-read for English majors and Shakespeare fans. Saccio does a marvelous job of putting the English history plays in the context of the contemporary understanding of the events and people Shakespeare portrayed, with a discussion of the primary source texts.  Along with this, the book examines the political situation of Shakespeare's own day, with which Shakepeare's audience would find parallels to the events of the plays.  Saccio also addresses the more recent understandings of the underlying historical events. While the book is offers a detailed and knowledgeable analysis, it is accessible and engaging for a casual reader.  Saccio as an essayist is second only to Saccio as a professor 
 Richard Rohr dives below the surface of rational Western culture in a dialog about God's Kingdom, being poor, social justice and living in a deeper place of simplicity where we are at home with the Jesus in us.  The thoughts in this book are profound, simple, and challenging.  This book truly captivated me.  I did not want to put it down.  My mind was stretched and my heart defibrillated as I began to see how simple it all really is...  Blessed are those with very little...  Blessed are those who have lost something...  Blessed are those...  Is the Sermon on the Mount just imagery of a life which is unobtainable to us now?  His Kingdom seems to be up-side-down.  And as Jesus said, "The Kingdom is here now!&quot 
 An excellent introduction to the world of Computer Networks 
 Fantastic for any and every iPod user. Top quality headphone from a top quality company. These headphones are nice and light without feeling flimsy. And the price is ultra reasonable. Don't think twice about getting these and, maybe an extra for a gift 
 I bought this book for my son and I to do over the summer.  It is so much fun.  It gives a description of the artists and there style.  Then it tells you how to imitate their style.  It has been a lot of fun! 
 I can't remember when my 18 month old wasn't interested in this book.  We have to read it every day, along with Peek a Zoo. It's been great to teach her animals and their sounds! I have however has to glue and tape pages back together because the flaps are just paper.  But I still highly recommend both Peek a Moo & Peek a Zoo! 
 I am fascinated by human behavior and why we can all be so different from one another. I found this book to be so insightful I bought a second copy and sent it to a friend who I knew would love it too. Must read. 
 'Don King - Only in America' chronicles the life of the very first African-American boxing promoter in the history of the sport. The titular character is played by Ving Rhames and there are several other noteworthy performers here such as Keith David, Loretta Devine, and Larenz Tate, all of whom are interesting in that they would go on to star in the motion picture 'Crash' seven years later. I really liked Larenz Tate in this role. For the first and probably the only time, he is playing a character who is not a thug, a gangster-guy, or someone who is going to jail, or getting shot. I only wish that he would choose more roles like these and less like his characters in 'Dead Presidents,' 'Crash' of course, and 'Why Do Fools Fall in Love.'   I would have given 'Only in America' a 10 but the part I didn't like was the scene where Rhames' King promises to give those two young ladies $100 each for helping him skate across the ice, but then only gives $100 to just the one, which IMHO, doesn't seem impartial. For that, I subtract two-tenths of a point.  The KAB score: 9.8 excellent 
 A very good source, especially for those who have read about the Crusades and understand the context of the writings.  This book is not an overview of the crusades or of a single crusade; it is selections from the writings of Arabic historians placed in a chronological order.  Easy to read, detailed and engrossing; both useful and enjoyable 
 Ms. Kingma gives engaged couples excellent advice and options over the traditional ceremonies. She includes examples for divorced couples, couples with children, couples who want to honor other family members and friends, even couples who have been through abuse and addictions to find love. Also given are wedding traditions and readings from around the world that brides and grooms can incorporate into their personally tailored ceremony.   If you truly want a wedding from your heart, with vows that truly bind, then this book is for you. The suggested ceremonies can be tinkered with and tailored to your taste and honor your personal beliefs. Thanks, Ms. Kingma, for reading the hearts of engaged couples everywhere! We're using this book for our own wedding this year, and I just can't praise it enough 
 I purchased this book through amazon to help my 6 year old son with his reading problems. The book is a perfect guide to teach a lay person how to help their children.  All parents have their childrens best interests in mind and want to help when they are struggling, but sometimes we don't know how to help.  I don't have an education degree and had no idea how to help my son.  Reading the book gives us "dummies" somewhere to turn for help.  The book lays out a practical plan for helping your child that is easy to follow.  Thank You Tracey!!!  This is a must read for anyone that has a struggling child.  My son is SPRinting his way to success! 
 Comparisons to the 1937 classic are inevitable. Story-wise, there is little difference except for the colonization of the remake. Many of the frames are carbon copies of each other. This reviewer feels that the b&w format of the original added to the suspense. The original cast is clearly superior especially the male leads of Ronald Coleman, David Niven and C. Aubrey Smith. Also, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. outshines James Mason as Rupert of Hentzau, the main bad guy. (I wonder if a stunt man performed that high dive.) A nice gesture is the cameo role of Lewis Stone,  the star of the 1922 SILENT version. It is the 1952 female leads who compare most favorably: Deborah Kerr comes very close to equaling Madeleine Carroll as the lovely Queen Flavia, with her strong (!) sense of duty. And Jane Greer probably surpasses Mary Astor's 1937 role. Both Mary and Jane are key to the plot. Watch them closely! Blessedly, despite the many frame similarities, the remake does not carbon copy the 1937 fadeout, with Ronald Coleman's gallant wave of farewell. On its' own merits, the 1952 version is a very credible adventure story indeed. It only suffers from comparison to an original classic it cannot possibly surpass 
 This sandle is very comfortable and attractive.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for this type of sandle 
 This book is about a man named Chalrlie Gordon that hasn't mentallyand emotionally grown up. Charlie is 32 with an astonishing low I.Q. of 68. He is so determinded that he agrees to undergo an operation to increase his ability to learn but what Charlie learns is that the world is not quite what he thought it to be all his life. He learns that after all these years of thinking that his co-workers were his friends "laffing," (as he calls it) with him, they were only making fum of him to make themselves seem surpirior.  Charlie Gordan's tale was much of innocence and as the story develops you start feeling how cruel the world really is. It was very touching and I give Daniel Keyes 5 stars 
 Tobacco Road must be one of the funniest and yet heart breaking American fiction I have ever read. The patriarch, Jeeter Lester,  twentieth century Don Quixote, also a predecessor to Al Bundy, selfish, lazy procrastinator, who would do anything , say anything to have his way. Every year he would plan on tilling his land to grow cotton but he is so broke that no body would lend him any money for seeds or a mule for this endeavor.  	 He and his wife live in a ramshackle house with two children,18 year old Ellie May who has a congenital deformity and a 16 year old imbecile, Dude, along with Jeeter's mother, who is completely ignored by the family. They had 17 children, 5 died and the rest  flew the coop as soon as they could from this mad house except Ellie May and Dude. They have an equally comic neighbor, Bessie, a widow in her late 30's, who ends up marrying Dude. She lures Dude by promising him a brand new car with the money she received from her husband's insurance. She is a promiscuous nit wit and pretends to be a preacher! This "preaching", she contends is inherited from her husband.  Using this logic she wants to marry Dude and make him a preacher.   Jeu d'es-prit of the book is when Jeeter, Bessie and Dude take the brand new automobile to Augusta to sell wood and end up spending the night in a sleazy motel, where Bessie is taken to different rooms by various men. Jeeter and Dude sleep in one bed, wondering why the motel owner keeps changing Bessie's room and why don't they leave her alone so she can get some rest. However, Bessie never complaints.  The book reminded me of Steinbeck's unforgettable paisanos of Tortilla Flat. It is a MUST read. 
 I read McIlwain-Bruce's book "Pain-Free Arthritis" and thought the "Pain-Free Back" looked good as well. I have been very pleased with both books. The resistance exercises, low-carb "pain-free" diet, healing foods and alternative therapies fit well into my daily routine. Great book and mostly great relief from pain 
 While most of what the other reviews state is entirely true, they fail to include the fact that the questions are horribly inconsistant.  Some seem like desperate attempts to hit some quota derived from marketing folks, as they ask silly things as who owns Crayola or questions obviously from other eras What was Jackie O's maiden name?--she was married in the 50s).  Other than that, it's quite fun.  I'd prefer 25% fewer questions if they were 100% consistant 
 The book is beautiful.  If you are a dog lover, I highly recommend it.  It will make you cry and make you know how special our 4-legged buddies are.   Thank you for documenting these stories and sharing them with us.  It helps to remind us, beautifully I might add, of one of the darkest and most horrific days in our short history.  This is a day we should never forget.  
 I really enjoyed reading this book. It is very well-written and thought provoking. Like Armstrong and Sheard's first book, In His Grip, the illustrations in Playing the Game are beautiful 
 Well it was a fine book it made a little sence to  the story.Well it was about a teacher when she  asked the class to see what states they where expert on.Well a girl she tells about her aunt live in Branks,NY and thats  the story Bye. Reader,Nichola 
 This is a wonderful book for either the beginner.  You will learn how to fish, what to fish for and what tackle you will need to take along.  It does not go into any great depth on any topic but this is not what the book is designed for.  It is an introductory text and a solid overview.  A bonus is the beautiful photography 
 Great read, read it pretty much in one day because I can't put it down.  Perfect for anyone's Sophie Kinsella collection.  If you loved Shopaholic books, you'll love this!  If you haven't read any of these books, what are you waiting for?!?  It's sharp, funny, and an all around great girlie novel.  Not for the stuffy that take themselves too seriously 
 Just got back from the Tennesse Deer show where Greg gave a seminar. He has some of the best knowledge anyone could ask for to be a succesful hunter. He also backs up what he says with the proof in all those great  photos. Bets thing you will learn from Greg is respect for the Deer you are  hunting and respect for the sport of hunting and its positive impact on the  family 
 We bought this book for my son's required reading in school, but my husband and I also read it on his recommendation. Our son is only 14 and he loved the book, and he is NOT a big reader. Even though the book is over 500 pages, he couldn't put the book down, nor could we 
 Sailors of all experience levels will learn from one man's experience cruising around the world.  You'll also learn why some things work, and others don't 
 *Carefree* is one of my favorite of the Astaire/Rogers series. I like this one because Ginger is not her usual skeptical self about poor Fred, who's usually trying to woo her. She falls in love instantly, and it's convincing. After that, he can't really help himself. This film has some pretty good dance sequences and some great comedy 
  I'd heard about LYRA in a discussion on handmade and altered books, so I bought it for its physical attributes exclusively. I knew nothing about the story.   The book itself is beautiful (sturdy, compact, good print quality) but the real value is the wonderful tale of a student, Lyra, and her daemon, Pan. I read this quickly, then went back to savour the illustrations and uncover clues. I soon realized I needed the whole trilogy, "His Dark Materials", to really get it. Back I went, to the beginning!  So while unconventional, the fact that I could buy this book for all the wrong reasons (image) only to fall in love with the story (substance) suggests this is a story worth telling and an author worth reading. Engaging characters, terrific plot, strong visual writing. Highly recommended.  (BTW, I'm not sure I understand the complaints about the cost of this book. Mass market paperbacks average USD$7.99 and they fall apart overnight; this is an illustrated, fabric covered, hardcover volume. 
 Ben Webster was originally influenced by Coleman Hawkins and during his Ellington days was noted for his aggressive swing and raw tone. As he moved into the 1950s, Ben began to develop a gentler persona and became renowned for his ballad playing. This recording catches him in transition. There are some wonderfully mellow performances on Tenderly and That's All. However, there are also more up tempo tracks where Webster's solos are full of vigour and exuberance, tearing out like a buzz saw. All in all, a very satisfying disc combining echoes of the swing era with Ben's later after hours style playing.  
 Elvis' use of the "N-word" was not hateful; it was familiarity. He had grown up on the border of the Negro community in both Tupelo and Memphis and he was comfortable around them. He used their language and euphimisms and certainly emulated their style in clothing. Elvis was fascinated by Black culture and music, as well as other philosophies and backgrounds and he embraced humanity. In the words of Martin Luther King, Jr., judge the content of his deeds. He had respect for many Black artists who were also his pals. Sammy Davis, Jr.; Muhammad Ali; James Brown; Jackie Wilson; Sam Cooke; Rufus Thomas; didn't think Elvis was a racist, so who cares what this reviewer asserts? His maid Mary Jenkins was treated like family, as were many other Black staff workers. He bought them jewels and Cadillacs and homes. He had a close relationship with the Black female singers in his group. While flying to Washington to meet the President of the United States, The King of Rock & Roll gave a Black soldier coming home from Vietnam $500.00---and apologized that he didn't have more with him for such a brave man. I'm sure he wouldn't have been pleased that his daughter married a former Black man, but that does not make Elvis a racist. As June points out throughout her fabulous book, Elvis was all about love . .  
 This book presents a series of essays on Paul in relation the Roman imperial world in which he moved and the result is a refreshingly different view of the onset of 'Christianity', something that didn't really exist yet at the point of discussion. The supposedly 'a-political' Paul focussed on the transcendent is suddenly living and surviving in highly stressed world of the Romans where the response to need, the revolution that is impossible, is met by rising 'ekklesia', which doesn't yet mean church, of the not yet 'Christians'. In the words of the editor, Christianity was a product of empire, but what became the established church of the empire started as an anti-imperial movement 
 I've got all three complete years.  I'm enjoying them all over again & my grandkids are loving them also.  Buy these 
 a great guide to colors and figure flaws...gives lots of suggestions for those lost in their current wardrobe selections...alot of common sense that most women just don't think abou 
 I can relate to this movie better than most people I think. My Mother comes from the Black Forest in Germany where the Legend Of The Werewolf originated. Children kept getting lost in the Black Forest so the adults inventd a story about a Werewolf who lived there so after that the kids never strayed too far from home. This is very similar to the Premise in this movie. A group of people in the 19th Century live in a small village and live in fear of the monsters that lurk beyond the boundaries of their town where 'Those We Don't Speak Of " dwell. Bryce Dallas Howard , in a powerhouse performance risks life and limb to venture to the towns outside the village in order to get some medicine for her fiance , the verbally challenged Joaquin Phoenix who is very ill due to being stabbed by a jealous simple  minded rival for Bryce's affections. This movie left me reeling with it's surprise twist which I didn't see coming. Bryce and Joaquin are backed by fine performances by Sigourney Weaver and William Hurt who both live with a secret or two. This movie is a gem!!! 
 Outstanding book! The amount of information included makes this book well worth its price. The month-to-month calendar of what one can eat from their root cellar is especially helpful. The pictures, and descriptions, of several existing root cellars in various parts of the country was especially appreciated, and will definitely be utilized when I build my own root cellar. If you are interested in being self-sufficient, this book will be of great assistance 
 I am an MBA student at USC looking to get into the I Banking field and this book has really been helpful.  It has been consistent with the terms and concepts I've learned in school and through networking with people.  Once I start interviewing, I feel confident that I will have a good inside perspective of the profession as a result of this book.  Understandably, it leans toward the bulge bracket firms, but doesn't ignore the niche players.  Definitely a good read for anyone looking to learn more about Investment Banking 
 I read the book in a day which is something I rarelydo due to my wanting to savor it. I just could not stop I had to keep turing to see how it was all going to turn out. I thank the author for every word and every page. I would now consider myself a fan of Mr. Pearson 
 In the year of 2008, a volcano explodes, and a sixteen year old by the name of Miles Newell and his family try to survive through the chaos. 	Fuel and food has become short throughout the U.S. There is also a lot of crime happening throughout Minneapolis. 	Miles is known as a kid that goofs around, and is not taken seriously, but Miles is a smart kid with a good memory. 	The eruption ever since 2006 in Washington Mount Rainer is still causing problems, and Miles and his family have to go to a cottage in the woods. Throughout this trip they deal with people who are bad, and prices for food are high. Miles wonderful invention called the Ali Princess helps the Newell family travel. When they reach the cottage, there is a shock when the Newell family goes inside. 	Will Miles memory help his family through the future, or will the crimes take over the cities? 	What I disliked about the book was that in the beginning it didn't give too much information about the volcano, and where it is going to hit. Some things I liked about the book was that it had a lot of adventure, and it makes you think about certain situations in the book. I also liked how the author makes it seem so real. 	The people who would like this book would be people who like adventure books, and people who like books that are full of action. Any person whether it's a boy or girl could read this book. 
 Aside from the 4 songs Alan released on this album, listen to songs like "From a Distance." If he released that song today it would be a top 5 hit. This album will stand the test of time. Great songwriting as  well 
 The historic quaintness of its grammar informs me and often makes me titter while reminding me of my birthright. No home should be without a copy no matter who the reader or their diction 
 The title captures the essence of the book. Albom does and excellent job of weaving a meaninful story around this premise. This book will challenge you to examine your own life, and possibly change how you interact with other people. I was so moved, I bought an additional copy for a friend 
 For every upgrade of Photoshop, I've purchased Deke's "Bibles".  If you follow his book methodically, you will build a solid base of understanding of Photoshop.  It is a great base on which to build your expertise of this endlessly fascinating software.  So, if you are floundering and are not making much headway understanding Photoshop, buy this book and start on page 1 and eventually all your fears will fade away and most of your questions will be answered 
 One can know the numbers and even various details of the Black Death, but Connie Willis makes her reader feel it in personal, human terms. The book is a world (or two worlds, since it is half in the 21st century and half in the 14th) of its own which catches the reader so that you cannot let go until the last page. Willis breathes wonderful new life into the old SF trope, the time machine. Typical of Willis' stories, characters are constantly ensnared in a mass of little problems that make it almost impossible for them to deal with the big problems-- a crummy phone system, an absent administrator, fogged up glasses, etc. (today's readers will notice the notice the lack of cell phones, now ubiquitous in Britain as elsewhere, but not extant when Willis wrote the book). Willis' 14th century episodes have the virtues of the fine historical novel: meticulous accuracy in terms of what is known, plus vividly imagined characters and situations. 
 I found this book riveting.  The messages come from firsthand encounters with people rarely covered by the U.S. mass media.  The concern for economics and business is a valuable complement to the excellent writing of Karen Armstrong, with her profound insights into religious and cultural patterns. The value of this book is magnified given the drivel, propaganda, and ideological/theological obsessions that characterize most U.S. reporting and analysis of the Middle East. 
 I recently bought this lens amid trepidation that the 85mm focal length would overwhelm the x1.6 crop factor of my Digital Rebel XL. My worries were needless: just a step or two back from the subject plus some getting used to the telephoto perspective were enough to turn this lens into the most effective portrait lens that I have.  When attached to my EOS Elan 7n film camera, however, the lens really truly comes into its own, as the full frame 35mm SLR delivers the entire focal range of this lens.  The focused image is incredibly crisp compared to any other non-L grade lens.  And I agree that this lens deserves the red ring of courage around it, like the L lenses have.  This glass is absolutely essential in a very short list of affordable lenses, and should give many of the non-affordable ones a run for their money. Solidly built too, with an old-fashioned no-nonsense look to it.  I highly recommend it 
 " Analysis incarnate " , no other more suitable words probably can describe the incomparable power of Euler, as his contemparies called him. Concerning the usual style of Dunham to write this stimulating book, other readers have made many comments and I think there is no need to repeat that. What I want is that Dunham to write another book, perhaps volume 2,3 etc and also write a thorough biography of Euler, one the greatest mathematicians in the history. ( To me, for mathematical ability, his should be at the same rank with Newton, Archaemedes, and Gauss, even Einstein concerning the mathematical and theroetical aspect, is below par compared with Euler  
 This is an exceptionally well written, well researched look into not only AIDS and black America, but into some of the darker corners of American life itself.  Levenson writes with clarity and empathy while answering the tough questions that until now, only a few have known how to ask.  This book is an absolute must-read for anyone interested in our society, the spread of AIDS and how black America got left holding the bag 
 This book was one of the first one the scene in term of reading people. Granted, some of the material may seem outdated, but much of it is grounded in good basic pscyhology. If you want something a little more cutting edge, then check out David Lieberman's You Can Read Anyone. Lieberman's book is filled with specific techniques for many different situations, and his stuff is always very practical. 
 I manage a medium-sized network and support a large number of fairly savvy users. That is, most users know how to do their specific tasks very well and are willing to learn new things. But they are not willing to sit down with a book full of dense text. This is where the "Quick Steps" books come in handy. I keep a number of these books on hand and when a user requests assistance, I give them one of the books with the appropriate page bookmarked. Steps are outlined in full color with lots of pictures and pointers and tips. Additional information is set off in side boxes so users can learn more if they choose. What I have found is that once a user completes a task successfully, they get fairly excited about the experience and browse the book to learn more. The books really stimulate users to experiment with things they would not normally bother to learn. And that is where this book excels. It is a "browser." Users don't feel like they need to start at the beginning and read through to the end. I get lots of grumbles when I ask for the book back so I can pass it on to others.   This book is also great for new users. I tell them to spend a few hours working through the steps, which are easy to follow and can be done at a fairly fast pace. Most users think the full color layout is fun to work through. The down-side is that like any book, space is limited, especially with the fully-illustrated format, so you're obviously not going to find everything in these books, but I do feel they contain a good balance of material and are appropriate for corporate libraries.  Marty (the concept author for the Quick Steps series) and I are fellow writers and that is how I learned about these books. I must say that they have helped my users enormously and relieved my support task. Hey, it's the 21st century. Anyone working in an office should know how to work with operating systems and common applications. Most people can do that if they have easily accessible references and refresher material like these books. Thanks to Marty for developing the "Quick Steps" concept and to McGraw-Hill for publishing this series.   
 Absolutely incredible... A must read for anyone who's into mystical Christianity and the western mysteries.  Guaranteed to become a Spiritual classic and source text for Christian Kabbalah!!! 
 As a warning, this book isn't a standard biography. Reading it as an introduction to Lincoln would be simply disappointing. Instead, Carwardine has written a tightly focused essay on the president in the context of moral authority and power. The story centers around the development of Lincoln's moral thought, his growth as a politician, and how Lincoln's ideas and actions played out against the grand conflagration of slavery.    This is why Lincoln's earlier political career makes up a relatively large portion of the book, as it was then that Lincoln clearly distinguished his political positions. At this time what distinguished Lincoln politically was his refusal to allow any compromise with slavery's expansion into new states: he refuted the idea that slavery could coexist with the idea of a nation based on individual liberty. Where others (such as Stephen Douglas) were trying to negotiate compromise, Lincoln staked out a position that slavery allowed no in-between with freedom; the country must "become wholly one thing or the other."   Carwardine is particularly excellent on 19th century politics, describing in detail how political parties operated at that time, how the political public was formed and how electioneering was so different from today. He is also very good at describing the political maneuvering that resulted in Lincoln's election to the presidency - showing it not as a surprise win by a dark horse but instead as a deliberately plotted, calculated event.  Where this book might frustrate some is the narrowness of its focus - for instance as it lacks much discussion about of the military events of the Civil War, the book seems strangely detached from it. There is a brilliant chapter on the moral authority of the Union Army itself, but beyond this and the more usual descriptions of Lincoln's arguments with his generals, the war seems an oddly distant event. 
 Sinclair Lewis was the first American writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature with a remarkable collection of books including Babbitt and Main Street. I have to say that he writes clearly most of the time. There are times that I wished that he would just get on with it. Zenith is small town America and that is where the protagonist and family lives. George is supposed to be satisifed with his mundane life but he isn't just like Carol wasn't in Main Street. Small town life seems suffocate George and Carol and that is theme in Lewis' novels. If you despise your hometown or small town life, then read Sinclair Lewis. I am just surprised that there is no movie based on his works. Maybe they would not work because it is character driven and not plot driven today. I know that Sinclair Lewis novels like Elmer Gantry and Dodsworth were adapted to the screen. Classics like Babbitt are timeless and should be taught in schools and adapted to the screen. American Classics like Babbitt and Main Street seem to be disregarded in favor of lighter, inferior fare for the audiences. We have to stop dummying down the audiences' mentality 
 This is a very good book and goes by its self-explanatory title. It was very informative and easy to read. It gives good instruction on leading AND being a part of the team, without being just a YAHOO type of book like some others. Good for leading small units from military to paintball 
 Outstanding read!  It was nice to be able to see what really happened.  My take is that Mr. Tarkanian got short changed in the settlement with the NCAA - should have been $25 Million!  It also opened my eyes.  I always thought John Wooden was the culprit.  Now, I know it was J.D. Morgan!  Thanks to Jerry for taking the time and making the effort to write this fine book 
 I've just listened to this record twice and it really surprised me.  The last Loose Fur record played liked Yankee Hotel Foxtrot's laid back cousin -- great songs done in extended acoustic jamming style with all the electronic flourishes but a sunny, stoned disposition.  It was a revelation of relaxation.  This record leans more toward songcraft, but there are a few excellent moments of pure chillin'.  What is here that was missing last time around are tightly arranged tunes: what was a shambling, shiny, beautiful mess on the last record is more focused and succint.  This makes sense when you think about it: the first Loose Fur record was recorded during the YHF sessions -- that record is focused and precise......this new Loose Fur record follows A Ghost is Born which is itself a shambling, shiny beautiful mess...anyway, my point is that Tweedy is using the Loose Fur project as a way to express himself in ways that don't fall into the parameter of Wilco (if Wilco indeed has paramenters).  And anyway that Jeff Tweedy decides to express himself is gonna be good.  As a side note, Tweedy plays a lot of bass on this record and he smokes....remember when he was the bass player for Uncle Tupelo?  No?  This will remind you 
 Stewart asserts that "male masochism was a rhetorical strategy through which men asserted their cultural and political authority paradoxically by embracing the notion that they were (and always had been) wounded and suffering." A bold claim which the author largely backs up with reference to the works of von Sacher-Masoch, Freud and Wagner, showing that, in her words, "masochistic scenarios, whether in literature, music, the visual arts, or medicalized diagnoses of the fin-de-sicle malaise, stage the male as one who submits to an aestheticized and eroticized gaze and voice." More or less exactly what I feel when I enter Milady's dungeon for a brutal flogging 
 This CD is sooo gooood, i just had to write another review for it.  I mean if you don't buy this CD you will never know how far you could have gone in life. This CD explains some of the harder things in life, it shows you how to get through life in a action packed fun filled way. Smoke that 
   Alan Furst has written other novels of the dark days in Eastern Europe as war approached. In "The World At Night," his subject is France just before its cowardly "defense" against German invasion and the immediate aftermath of France's surrender.    Furst is, as always, a master at depicting the oppressiveness of German occupation. Private cars are requisitioned. Radios must be turned into the authorities or their owners face imprisonment or far worse. The simplest things of life are rationed or unavailable. And always the German occupier and its French collaborators are at hand, threatening.    For a while Parisians try to get on with their lives. Jean-Claude Casson, a producer of B-movies, continues to move on with his lovers, his falling out with his true love Citrine, an ex-wife and her husband and their circle of partying friends.    Bit by bit, some in the circle fall into the orbit of the Germans, profiting handsomely while the French police and their German masters root out Jews and other enemies of the New France.    Casson tries to fight back by becoming involved with British Intelligence --- and a dangerous double-game with the German SD security service.    The plot is thinner than other Furst novels. Still excellent, but it lacks the feeling of oppressiveness and ever-present danger that I've felt in his other work. Casson is, to a certain extent, something of a lightweight and almost extraneous to the story of Paris under German occupation.    Overall, that porrait --- a people who weren't prepared or willing to defend their freedom --- and living with the consequence of such cowardice is the real story here. Furst never fails at painting the dread a subject population must feel every day. But Casson neve quite makes it as a sympathetic or particularly heroic character. He is just sort of an "everyman" caught up in a swirl of events much larger than himseelf. Not unusual in a Furst novel, but not as well-defined either.  Jerr 
 This book brings to life a survival struggle that is often hard to fathom.  In addition to the sailors story the author adds interesting information on a variety of topics including history, science, geography.  Book is worth reading.   
 This book is very detailed and easy to read. You can actually design your own system after reading this book. I like it and recommend it 
 Big Book with no plot, the thing that makes it a classic is that Naipaul seems to write without any prejudice, from a very cold perspective this book changed my life like any other book. It is simply amazing 
 Viewers (this includes most of the professional reviewers) who saw this movie as the last day of freedom for Kotov, an up-from-the ranks Soviet hero, beloved by his men and honored by a grateful nation, saw only half the movie. The charming family enjoying a lazy summer day in the country, the devotion between Kotov and his daughter while doubting his wife's fidelity and his  growing realization that  his friend, Stalin, has ordered his arrest is movie enough! But there is more....  At second look, the family life is far from idyllic.  The family (the dacha is theirs, not Kotov's) are the wife, daughter, relatives, friends of Boris the famous Bolshoi Theater conductor.  They are retired artists and intellectuals who had mingled with the royal family before the revolution.  They regard the Soviet regime as a kind of occupation and must be careful about what they say in Kotov's presence. Clearly he would like to assume Boris' place as head of the family, but they regard him as declasse', a braggart, and a bully.   In the famous boat scene, the hero father has only platitudes to offer his daughter.  His view of national progress lies in technological advances.  He plays baby games with this exceptional little girl who longs for the kind of challenge that Mitya will offer her.  The second hero is Mitya, beloved of Boris and his family, who greet him as the prodigal son, coming alive to his laughter  and music. They see him as Boris' rightful heir, a kind of Hamlet-- home to clean house. Unlike his adopted family,  he has been unable to escape direct conflict with the Soviet regime.  As an White Army exile, he had made a deal with the devil, the infamous NKVD, in order to return home. But Kotov has sent him away again, for a total of almost 20 years abroad.  At the beginning of the film he gambles his life against taking his misery home.  When he finally agrees to go, his aim is to clean up his act (the washing of the steps in Red Square).  He is not an assassin-IT IS STALIN WHO ORDERED THE ARREST--but he will take revenge on the man who robbed him of his life.   Although the men engage in competitions (including a dance competition!) throughout the day, Nadya (literally) leads them out of the woods of such futility. Both men will lose.  Only Stalin is the winner! Neither man is a villain; both deserve compassion. Poor Kotov finally broke--I believe it was because of his acknowledgment of his own complicity in the truckdriver's murder--groaning his way to Moscow. But the dirge in the cellos was for Mitya, signalling the death of his soul. Supported by his family's love, he had almost achieved redemption, but the incident with the truck driver demanded the concentration of the NKVD man.  His series of errors in the car led inevitably to the truck driver's death. I hated him so much as he gathered his white coat about him and entered the car on the opposite side, that his suicide had little effect on me.  So why did I mourn him for weeks and weeks?         
 Educational and entertaining. If you love this, you will love his new book about "Genghis Khan". This complete and concise reintroduction of 850 years of glorified Mongol history will be shocking and eye opening experiences for you. According to his long journey of tireless research, Genghis Khan had established our modern civilization. What a history, what a extraordinary work 
 I am not going to duplicate this review by writing same thing for Part 2, so listen up! If you like symphonic rock - and of course, I mean here only the best of the genre - then run and buy this CD. Could be kinda hard to do that outside of Europe but I think Amazon still has it in stock.  First of all, compared to a lot of prog/sympho/hard rock albums this one has very very decent lyrics... this is not up to Mary Stewart standards but what did you expect?  Secondly, quality of melodies is extremely high - it is obvious that Gary Hughes put a lot of effort into it. Kinda makes you wonder why his Ten albums suffer from monotony and noticeable lack of musical diversity... who knows? Perhaps he simply was inspired in this case, eh?  Best numbers: At The End Of The Day, Shapeshifter (with stunning voice of Irene Jansen), King For A Day, Lies (Part 1); Kill The King, I Still Love You, Demon Down, Once And Future King (Part 2).  Also there is a bonus track which I have but its name is missing so I have no idea... it is also really good! Perhaps it just didn't gel with the other numbers so it is missing on both standard issues (Europe and Japan).  Hughes managed to gather an amazing ensemble of performers for this undertaking and it paid off. He himself sings King Arthur's part, then we have here DC Cooper of Royal Hunt fame, Lana Lane, Bob Catley from Magnum, Sean Harris from Diamond Head, Arjen Lukassen on keyboards (of course), Dougie White, and bunch of other well-known professionals.  Overall athmosphere is just right and, once again, truly one of the best albums of the decade 
 Perhaps this book would more accurately have been titled: "Relating Cross-Culturally".  Beyond its emphasis on "the servant attitude of Jesus", it would seem to contain little about ministry per se.  However, it paints a humorous and humble picture of a sometimes inept cultural anthropologist seeking to come to terms with some awkward cross-cultural situations.    In keeping with the stated purpose of the book, it seeks to "reduce or even resolve tensions in interpersonal relations" which might arise in cross-cultural situations.  In this regard, the focus is on "cultural and social backgrounds", rather than spiritual orientation or moral struggles.  Thus the question arises as to whether deeper sources of "tension and conflict" might exist than those which are "cultural and social".  There is the sobering example of a man who likely lost his life through the negligence of islanders -- yet Lingenfelter gives little or no indication that this might have involved anything more than a misreading of "culture" or a "particular orientation" on their part.    Lingenfelter states that the Bible "speaks to all people and all cultures".  This would appear to mean that the Bible speaks to us by showing us the faithful example of Jesus Christ.  Through Jesus Christ, it provides "values and orientations", "value biases", "values and lifestyle patterns", "principles on which we can build more effective relationships and ministry".  Lingenfelter states: "The particular focus of this book is on priorities or values people use."  However, there is little indication that the Bible might provide more than a source of values -- for instance, a Christ who may be worshiped, or an encounter with the Holy.  We are simply "following the example of Christ".    Lingenfelter draws on "the model of basic values" developed by Marvin K. Mayers to analyse personal priorities.  Mayers' model is "a significant tool for understanding others in their own community".  "Our way of life is often equated with godliness", and this may unnecessarily create "conflict [and] confrontation".  The model assists one in identifying potential tensions -- e.g. between task orientation or person orientation, dichotomistic or holisic thinking, and so on.  Having said this, the book would seem to be best suited to minorities within a larger culture (e.g. a missionary family), rather than large groups from different cultural and social backgrounds, as one so often finds in the Church.   The book held a personal interest for me, in that I myself have both lived and ministered cross-culturally in Micronesia -- the region from which most of the book's illustrations are drawn.  For those who, as Lingenfelter suggests, might tend to equate their ways "with godliness", this book might represent a useful corrective.  
 I am wondering if all the negative reviews are partly because the reviewers are not from the UK- I think it is very evocative of a place and a time, and full of specific cultural values(white middle class,urban, academic). I found this book profoundly interesting and moving. I felt that all four family members who were so stuck at the start of the novel, developed and moved on by the end. Smith managed to create four entirely believable voices and at different points I felt sympathy for all of them.The various writing styles are sustained brilliantly and I felt that each character's story  was  equally strong. It felt very much a story of the UK now and the struggle for families to stay together and understand each other in the face of a difficult and depressing world. It definately warrants a second reading. As to whether Amber is real, a device or a ghost, she is an amazing force and stayed with me long after I finished the book. It is not straightforward, or an easy read- you are made to think and puzzle and reflect- and a good think that is when most of the time we are not challenged by books, tv or film 
 The importance of this band on music can not be overlooked.  They really were one of the first bands to make it ok to record your record so it sounded like you were playing percussion on a basketball but it still sounded great.  Oh and don't think it gets 5 stars only for importance to music it is also loaded with great songs.  "Tally Ho," "Oddity," and "Diamond Shine" are personal favorites, but there are many other great songs that you will constantly be putting on your mixes with Beat Happening, the Chills, and Simon Joyner.  Get it soon though, I doubt it will stay in print for long

 If I had only read the author's preface to this book, it would have been worth it.  This book in meant to be read a paragraph at a time and savored.  Piper's immersion in the Word of God produces a man after God's own heart.  Highly recommended for anyone who aspires to the preaching or teaching ministry, particularly the emphasis on the desire to see the Word applied to their own life and those who are being reached by their ministry. Give it to your pastor 
 I love this record. This album takes us music lovers on an intimate and sometimes explicit journey into both sides of his interestingly opposing split personality. He named this album, you know it, because of the experiences he was facing while recording this record. This album is up-tempo driven and lovemaking songs. This album shows that he has perfected the ability to blend old school soul with an edgy hip-hop sound creating songs that appeal to us music lovers. THIS ALBUM DESERVES BETTER PROMOTION 
 Some people say L can't rightfully fight for the greatest of all-time title, because he was only able to record one full-length album in his life time. I don't agree with that at all. It takes multiple albums to be great? Chingy's put out three albums, does that mean he's a more qualified contendor to the throne? It's ridiculous that people believe you need to put out a dozen albums to go down as a legend. Let me ask something; how many times do you find yourself listening to this album? I find myself listening to this single album more than I listen to anything 2Pac or Jay-Z ever released put together. More than B.I.G.'s two classics, more than Nas' star-studded catalogue, more than MF DOOM's 10 classic releases under different aliases. That's just how great this album is.  The only person who deserves the "G.O.A.T." title more than Big L is GZA, and that's the only reason I can't declare Big L the undisputed heavyweight of the hip-hop world. However, let's not argue for days on end about who the illest emcee in the game was, or is; let's focus on this classic album, which is one of the greatest releases from any era of hip-hop.  If there's one thing I can say with the utmost confidence, it's that Big L, to this day, remains the punchline king. That's a title no one will ever take from L; the man had a knack for metaphores, both complex and simple, both hilarious and deadly serious. One moment he'd be threatening to have your family dressed in all black, and the next, he'd be quipping that he "wouldn't give a chick ten cents to put cheese on her Whopper."   He had a voice, and flow like no one else. L's voice was commanding, yet smooth. When he spoke, you had no choice but to listen - yet, at the same time, he didn't just use this to draw the attention of his foes and fans alike, but he used this skill to pick up fly honies, too. His flow, and posture are still unmatched today; he had this confident swagger that was just so evident in his music, and his flow was crisp, and clear. He'd also put an emphasis on the final sylabble of each rhyme, adding that extra force to each of his rhymes.   Every track on here is a standout. There is no singling out, simply for that reason. The production was handled by an all-star team of underground cats, who provided the perfect music to compliment L's flow. Grimey, and dark, much like everything else coming from New York in the early-to-mid nineties, yet funky, and soulful enough to seperate it from the rest of the pack musically. Whether Big L was proclaiming he was the Most Valuable Poet on the M.I.C., visiting Da Graveyard with Jay-Z and his crew, or the Danger Zone with Mase, Big L brought the heat like few can

 This is an awesome ending! Midnight Sun is a definite must read for anyone who has read The Captain's Bride and Deep Harbor. When I finished the first two, I felt like I was in the middle of a great movie and the electricity  went out!  I couldn't wait to see how things ended with Karl, Elsa, Kaatje,  Tora and Trent. I only wish that Karl has resolved things with his father.  Overall, an excellent book. I'm looking forward to her next book 
  Artemio Cruz owns a vast empire in Mexico, encompassing newspapers, land, construction and more. He has a beautiful wife and daughter, both of whom he cannot stand, nor they him. His aide, Padilla, a man he trusts with his empire, and one he has grown to love as the son he lost so many years ago. He is so important, so respected, so necessary to the Mexican country that the President tries to impress him, rather than the other way around. But Artemio Cruz is dying, painfully and slowly, and it is while dying that he has a chance to evaluate his life, to take a good look at himself and what he has achieved.  Cruz is a complicated man. As a youth, he fought in the various, chaotic revolutions and counter-revolutions that periodically caused Mexico to cease functioning as a nation, becoming little more than a series of loosely connected fiefdoms. Using his intelligence and daring, he was able to secure a command in the fight against Pancho Villa, but more importantly, he also knew when to leave the life of a soldier for a more solid existence. As a young man, he met Regina, the woman he was to love until his dying day.  As an older man, he is respected and influential, but also cold and distant. Gone are the passionate, poorly thought-out heroics of his early adulthood. He no longer loves like it doesn't matter, or cares much for the reality of another person. At his annual New Year's party, Cruz retires early to a comfortable leather chair positioned so he can watch everyone else have fun. The unspoken rules of the party forbids guests to talk to him at all, other than to pay their respects. His wife lives in another city, and a prostitute shares his bed this night, as she has every other night for the past eight years.  The three technique Fuentes uses in painting Cruz's life are quite interesting. In the present of the novel, when Cruz is dying, the narration is first person, disjointed, and very, very personal. No physical details are omitted, no matter how disgusting. Thoughts are fragmented, jumping from place to place, from time to time. The first few instances of this are difficult to follow, because we do not yet know Cruz's life, but as the novel progresses, the chaotic mental ramblings of the present become clearer, if not for Cruz but for us.  The second stylistic method used are the second person sections. These are generally short, but are the harshest and most self-critical. It is as though Cruz has stepped back from himself, created a 'you' for him to pour forth his bile, resentment, anger and also satisfaction about himself and his own life. These sections are just as personal as the first-person chapters, but in an emotional sense. He probes at the reasons he did this, or why he would think that. These sections are almost entirely devoid of other characters, it is simply Cruz with himself, condemning and praising, remembering and trying to forget.  The third - and most plentiful - type of chapters are in third person, dated, and taken from various times throughout his life. It is here we learn of Regina, here we learn why the phrase, 'We crossed the river on horseback' is so important, why his wife hates him, and more. In these sections, we are almost never shown his thoughts, nor those of anybody else. They are very detached, expositionary scenes, helping to explain the intimate thoughts and ramblings of the second- and first-person chapters.  Towards the end of the narrative, as Artemio Cruz approaches his death, the 'you' and the 'I' narratives start to merge, fuzzing and growing indistinct. He rails against himself, then defends his decisions over the years, then praises himself for the love he has, even now, for Regina. The sections - interspersing the 'you' and 'I' and even 'he' of Cruz within the space of four sentences - could be confusing if done earlier, but because we are familiar with his life and thoughts, they make sense. There are pages long sequences of broken thoughts, flitting between time and place without warning or explanation, and surprisingly, these are effective and do not come across at all as a gimmick. Rather, it is the character of Cruz - presented elsewhere as so strong and stable when old, so mercurial and romantic when young - breaking apart, unable to accept his death, unwilling to leave his life, even if it will mean re-uniting with Regina.  In the end, what we have is a character study. The setting - early 20th century Mexico - is rich and colourful, although at times, it does fade into the background as Artemio Cruz's character takes over. This is by no means a negative, as Cruz is a wonderful diverse man. He has weaknesses and strengths, and the novel spends as much time of his flaws as it does on his achievements. It is a credit to Fuentes that the vibrancy of Mexico shines through in what is, primarily, a journey through the mind of a proud man, a lonely man, a dying man: Artemio Cruz 
 Yes, my mock Amazon name is Dirk Diggler(long story), but this is "Boogie Nights". I can't say this movie was "over-looked", because it wasn't. In fact it is really amazing that a film with this content was recognised for what it was and is, "Fan-f**k-ing-tastic". Burt Reynolds is back at the top of his game in years, Marky Mark can act(Dirk himself), Heather Graham, and all the rest are in top form. What can you say?? Kinda a mock story of John Holmes/70's/80's porn scene, but you really start to care about these people. Soundtrack represents the time and it all just works. I can't hear "Sister Christian" by Nightranger without thinking of that scene.(Some of you know, others will) Get the New Line 2 disc version. It's impressive. If you have an open mind and can take it for what it is, this will become a favorite, I guarentee it 
 Born in Kenya in 1954, Philippa Gregory moved to England with her family at the age of two and was educated in Bristol. Philippa now lives in the north of England with her husband and two children. She has written a number of highly acclaimed historical novels and her latest ones revolve around the rich tapestry provided by the Tudor period. I have not read all of the authors books but  Earthly Joys and Virgin Earth were among the ones I have read and I found those two fascinating. In the novel The Virgin's Lover the church bells have rung out across the land to let the people of England know that Elizabeth is queen. The people are happy to hear the news. There has been much unrest in the country since the death of Henry VIII. But one woman is not so pleased to hear the bells, Amy Dudley the wife of Sir Robert knows that once the queen is settled on her throne, Sir Robert will be called back to the intrigues of the Tudor Court. Amy's hopes that the Dudley families ambitions had died with the death of Robert's father, had ended. The bells were once more summoning her husband to the power struggles of the court.  Elizabeth has inherited a land in turmoil, close to rebellion and her chief advisor warns that she can only rule if she marries a strong prince, but the only man that Elizabeth is interested in is her childhood friend.  Robert Dudley is sure that he can make a name for himself and discover is destiny at the side of the queen and as their love for one another grows, Dudley begins to think that the impossible could happen . .  
 If you're looking for a faithful adaptation of Dracula, this is not it. This is not a movie to be taken seriously. It's a fun, popcorn movie that will not make you think. At all. Seriously. Not a thought in your head, unless it is to marvel at the best thing to come out of Scotland since kilts, Gerard Butler.  Butler brings a frustrated sensuality to the role of Dracula not seen since Frank Langella's campy 1970s performance. If you're not in love with him already, you will be after watching the DVD extras. His interviews are charming and fun. Though watching his audition reel, where he tried to emote wearing full "Atilla" hair and make-up, was sort of uncomfortable.  So if you like wire fight scenes, new intrepretations of old myths, Mardi Gras beads and pretty Scots, this is the movie for you. If you want to think, there are plenty of documentary DVDs available on this site!  Cheers 
 Paul Theroux is one of only a few writers for whom I will immediately buy their new hardcovers based on name only, with great anticipation. This one does not disappoint, and I'd rate it right up there with my favorites of his, "My Other Life" and "Sunrise With Seamonsters." His writing on how to travel and how to write and thus how to live one's life is outstanding and inspiring, including the fact that he wrote "The Great Railway Bazaar" in the four months that the train trip took 
 "Dibs in Search of Self" is the story of a little boy named Dibs and his struggle to open himself up to the world. Dibs has no mental deficiencies, but hardly ever speaks. When Dibs does speak, he speaks very little and speaks of himself in the third or second person. He also doesnt get along with the other children, biting or scratching those who go near him. He begins to go to play therapy sessions with Miss A. At first, he is afraid but she tells him not to be. During the play sessions, Miss A. sees significant changes in Dibs. He quite often plays with a doll-house family pretending it is his own. Dibs father and mother also see changes in him. He begins talking more and more to his parents and responding when they ask him questions. At his school they notice that Dibs plays more with the other children and wants to be included in activities. I enjoyed reading this story immensely and read it every single day. It was a very well written and interesting book to read. I recommend this book to anyone interested in going into child therapy. What surprised me was that it took such little effort to bring out of his shell. He only went to therapy once a week and after three sessions there was already an improvement. This was a little hard to believe for me 
 I'm in agreement with the other reviewers here: this book is extremely well researched and written, if not a little on the long side. In any case, it was definitely an interesting read. The book though doesn't really offer any advice or guidance to students like me who want to get into Ivy League schools. It's much more of a history or sociological account than it is a college guidebook. For a book that does the latter, I'd recommend a new book from College Prowler: "Untangling the Ivy League." It offers a bit more in terms of insider information that might be helpful for college bound students and their parents in the application process 
 This book covers everything. It's a serious must for film students. I got a complete idea of how to put ideas on the screen and how it affects peoples views. This book never covers up anything. I enjoyed it and it's worth the mone 
 This book has some hidden jewels in it.  Col Hammes does an outstanding job of summarizing insurgent warfare history from Mao to OEF/OIF.  He writes a very good analysis of insurgent characteristics, and how, if done correctly, their messages will differ depending on their audience.  Unfortunately, this theory also applies very well to tyrants.  (The relationship between insurgency and tyranny is a great topic of discussion in its own right, by the way.)  He also makes valid points about the likelihood of future threats and some good ideas about restructuring the DoD.  Unfortunately, the present DoD is both a child of our political system (maintaining much of its DNA) and an organic growth out of wartime necessity (one of his favorite theories, "chaos theory," could be easily used to describe the DoD's evolution).  Such a huge change would require a group of incredibly strong leaders to find themselves at the highest positions of government at the same time, a proposition only slightly easier than getting the Founding Fathers together back in the late 1700s.  Hammes' weakest point is his main one:  his "generational" model of war has too many holes.  He tries too hard to make history fit into his mental model.  I prefer the concept of "levels" of warfare that forces can engage in, depending on their objectives/strengths/weaknesses and that of the enemy.  At the end of the book, he contradicts himself by saying that the generations speed up in their evolution, and then says that 4GW has been going on for several decades, so we must be entering 5GW.  Why not 6GW?  Why can't the interations vary in their intervals?  Maybe subnational insurgency was 4GW, while trans-national insurgency in the al-Qaeda mold is really 5GW.  The point is, it's not the model that's important here.  Hammes does makes a poweful case for the effectiveness of human-networked warfare (as opposed to computer-based or net-war), and he gives a good glimpse as to how to structure our national assets to counter this threat.  I would have liked to hear his thoughts on the possibility of a future sub-national insurgency inside the U.S. centering on the fast-growing hispanic population (both legal and illegal), but I'll take what I can get.  Overall, a great read with some real jems inside.  I highly recommend it.  Just don't swallow it hook, line and sinker 
 Answer: the author Richard Bradley, not Harvard president Lawrence Summers.  Reason. The cause of the fear is that West might accuse Bradley of being a "racist" and ruin his career. If you are one of the Harvard faculty who hate Summers, you are probably afraid of West too. Some of you may have witnessed Bradley's fear and trembling on C-SPAN 2 when he discussed this book in the presence of West. He acted like a hostage in Iraq.  Truth. The truth is that Summers had the guts to stand up to West and Henry Gates. He rejected their racial fantacies because they could not cite any credible supporting evidence. He rejected the politicizing of a great university. He reaffirmed academic freedom. Of course, Bradley did not intend to make Summers look good. But the facts speak for themselves. Read the book in a bookstore, but don't buy it and enrich an author who is afraid of Cornel West. 
 An excellent, detailed and comprehensive source for beginners and experienced alike 
 This is a very warm, youthful portrayal of an African American family and their experiences in Flint, Michiga and Birmingham, Alamaba.  The book is jovial and centering on the theme of youthfulness, it also has some corny humor. It indirectly touches on racisim. This may be a good book to introduce young children to some of the social and moral issues pertaining to racism. Getting involved in the story naturally leads one to thoughts on racism, though rather indirectly 
 What would happen if a group of interstellar pioneers going on a multigenerational journey to another star system forgot they were on board a ship? Heinlein explores this possibility in action packed story.  Generations ago, a mutiny took place on the rocket ship (a very large ship - over 5 miles long) which ended with the deaths of all the astrogation officers. As a result, the ship has drifted aimlessly through space with little hope of it ever reaching its destination. The people currently on the ship have forgotten most of this history. And since none of them has ever been outside the ship, to them, the ship is their universe. They exist to farm, raise families and battle mutants that inhabit the upper levels of the ship. Hugh Hoyland, a young man intent on becoming a scientist is captured by mutants and presumed dead. Can Hugh unravel the mysteries of the upper decks of the ship and convince the crew to resume their journey?  Although it is a short novel, Heinlein packs a lot into it. He explores and reviles the prejudice shown towards the mutants in a way that was fairly revolutionary for 1951. He also explores the folly of blind loyalty to ideas and religion, even in the face of incontrovertible evidence that a person can see with his own eyes. The story moves along quickly and comes to a satisfying (if expected) conclusion. I think this is one of Heinlein's finest novels. Some readers may be put off by his portrayal of women in this novel (they are not even second class citizens) 
 This pasta is very good.  It works great in salads, casseroles or regular pasta dishes.  I've only been gluten free for a few months and I think this tastes very similar to wheat pasta.  Granted, I've only tried one other kind of gluten-free pasta (made all of brown rice) but this pasta is FAR better and I like it enough that I feel no need to keep shopping around and trying other kinds 
 This is a wonderful collection of recipes.  This has brought me, my mother and my daugther closer together.  Every week we make new recipes from this book as well as the Emeril's There's a Chef in My Soup book.  It is truly great for the entire family 
 This book should have a subtitle: Vegetable Gardening in Northern Climates. The author assumes that every reader has snowy winters and hot summers,  and that every reader is a vegetable gardener. If I just described you, then without question, you should buy this book! I live in a cool coastal climate of California, where temperatures are generally between 50-65, regardless of season. I'm not trying to grow vegetables, simply trying to replace the weeds in my yard with no-watering-required wildflowers, herbs, etc. If this describes you, then I will say that the book is still good for basic seed-starting tips, fertilizing, etc., but that at least 70% of the book will not apply. FYI, here are a few of the things I've learned in the past several months: Birds eat seedlings/baby plants. Really. I've sat with coffee in hand watching them. Bird netting must be raised up at least six inches and stretched taught to keep them away, but then it is dangerous to wildlife. I took it out after I found a young possum caught in it, and had to cut him loose. He had badly wounded himself trying to get free. I've replaced it with basic clear plastic from the hardware store, the kind we californians all have around the house for flood control. So far, it is working great 
 My wife, two daughters ages 14 and 16, and I are currently working through a chapter a day with this book.  I read aloud the chapter and we discuss points brought up and expierences from our own marriage.  It works very good for this.  The chapters are not too long except for chapter 5 "Fundamentals of a Christain Marriage" which we broke into sections.    This would be a great way to hold a study with your children as my wife and I are doing, with young couples, and with singles who hope to marry one day and go the distance.    My wife and two daughters do not see any demeaning of women as a couple of the negative reviews indicated.  Those two people must be seriously biased for some reason.  Highly recommended for those who want to go the distance with a life long mate 
 Ethnic Nationalism: Genealogy, Politics, And Legacy by Gi-Wook Shin (Director of the Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center) explores the roots, politics, and legacy of Korean ethnic nationalism. Descriptively analyzing the separation and differences in the communist north and democratic south of the Korean peninsula, Ethnic Nationalism addresses the general identity formation of the two Koreas. A core addition to academic library International Studies reference collections, Ethnic Nationalism is strongly recommended to the attention of political science, sociology, and cultural anthropology students studying the contrasts and similarities of North and South Korea through their collective history of anti-colonialism, civil war, authoritarian politics, democratization, territorial division, and globalization. 
 This concise and lucidly written book deals with a series of key events in 1918-23 which conditioned the rise of modern Turkey and decided the fate of the Cauacsus.  By using new data Gokay subjects them to a new and well-integrated analysis that provides a clearer perspective about the policies of all the forces involved in the struggle for the Caucasus and Anatolia.  Convincingly an coherently, he demonstrates how the Bolshevik ideology endangered new strategic realignments and turned Russia and Great Britain into enemies.  Gokay uses pactically all the existing literature in Turkish and Western languages and a variety of primary sources.  In fact, he is one of the first scholars to make use of the Russian sources and thus bring forth new information on Russo-Turkish relations, including the activities of Enver Pasha, one of the Young Turks' leaders.  The result is a balanced, objective, informative, and truly scholarly first-rate work - in fact, the best available succinct study of the subject 
 Upon first reading a brief synopsis of this book, I honestly thought it seemed a rather boring story line, especially for a master like Crichton..."A book about turbulence on an airplane?" I thought. It didn't exactly sound "gripping." I was wrong! He never fails to entertain. His works are always thought-provoking, and so well written and researched as to almost make the "unbelievable" seem well within the realm of possibility.  This particular work could IS quite possible. It seems to be a pretty accurate, albeit cynical insider's look at the TV news media.  It reinforces the old saying "Don't believe everything you see on the news. 
 My kids have this video and they love it.  Especially my daughter.  My son still hides away in his bedroom to watch it.  Everyone is right about it being one little Christmas episode but it's cute.  The only thing I didn't care much for was how Howie Dorough of the Backstreet Boys portrayed Santa Claus.  He used the stereotypical "mexican" slang accent and as the mother of half hispanic children, I found it almost offensive.  Even my son pointed out that Mexicans don't talk like that 
 I have owned multiple different mice including Microsoft 1.1, Logitec mx500, 510, 518 and the Razer Copperhead.  I have no hesitation in saying this Razer Death Adder is the best mouse I have had yet.  I am an avid gamer and focus on FPS games and this is exactly what I have looked for in a mouse.  Be sure to download the latest drivers and firmware and you will never regret this purchase 
 The book is brief, the language is simple, and the best of all...it works.  This handy, and concise book will teach you how to manage your life (Not only your Work!!), and thus reduce your stress, simplify your life, and get the work done in less time.  What you will find in this book is an easy to read story, that quickly teaches you three very successful and practical management techniques: One Minute Goals Setting, One Minute Praising, and One Minute Reprisals.  Its story format makes this book readable and light,.. but yet very insightful and effective. You will want to read this book over and over, just for the pleasure of doing it. I bought this book 13 years ago, and I still enjoy reading it 
 Wow! This is probably one of the best purchases I can say I've made in a long time (and I make a lot of purchases!). I am a Graphic Designer and I have a Home Staging and Redesign business as well. I bought this for the Home Staging business as a tool to use with clients who need additional help visualizing and conveying their idea of colors and tonal ranges. It has been a life saver! I have used it with everyone so far and they all comment on what a great item it is to have with the business and to help communicate with customers. This book screams BUY ME!!! You won't regret it 
 Obviously, from the reviews here, people want/expect different things from their guidebooks but my wife and I have done a lot of traveling to a lot of places and found this one of the best we've ever used.    This book covers everything a traveler could need -- where to stay, where to eat, where to shop; and whatever your taste in activities, from museums to water sports, from golf to horticulture, it's well covered here, with full details of the where, the when, the phone number, and any little quirky info like "avoid Tuesdays," or "be aware of the riptides."  (Is there anybody out there who WOULDN'T want to know there are riptides?)  It's also very comprehensive -- not too surprising, of course, when it only has to cover a relatively small island - some books this size cover a whole country 
 It was an amusing book which I picked up for the hell of it. Never had heard her music, only vaugely recalled having read about her back when she was making albums. To her credit, I found it thoughtfully written, with a fair amount of open-mindedness as to what things played a role in her downfall. Trynin's finger points at herself most of the time actually, but never with a depressed "what was I thinking?" tone--usually it's a "shucks, it seemed like a great idea at the time" grin instead.   And that's really what makes the book--the lighthearted, if not always lightweight, look at her travels through the music biz. Trynin has a knack for description, giving you just enough to place you right there in the setting without overdoing it or stalling the narrative. Her recounting of a particularly awful radio interview is the highlight of the book, just flat-out funny; conversely, a section describing life at home during a respite from touring, noting how difficult it was for her to reconnect with the people in her life, was particularly enlightening and thought-provoking.   My only suggestion for the potential reader, then, is that if you've never heard her music before, finish the book before you go hunting for her CDs. I picked one up ("Cockamamie," the main one written about in the book), and it was bloody agony to listen to. I wouldn't have enjoyed the book nearly as much had I heard her music beforehand; I mean, it's almost as wretched as the Pixies, but I digress.   So, to sum up: fun book, so-so musician, I hope she has another book (but no more songs) in her. Like many reviewers here, I also read "So You Want To Be A Rock & Roll Star," and while I agree it's a more dramatic tale, I'd say they're both rather well written and would easily recommend either one 
 I cannot praise this book enough.  I have been dealing with my Husbands depression for the past ten years.  I had been pulled down in to the black hole with him, believing it was all my fault how unhappy he was.This book has made me realise that it's not me, and its not him, its this awful illness he has.  On bad days when everything seemed so hopeless I could read another chapter of this book and feel uplifted.  It was like someone had written this book about us!  It offers no end of helpful suggestions for yourself and the one you love.  It has helped me bring it to my husbands attention and encourage him to get help.Fantastic! 
 From "Times They are A-Changin'" to "Hollis Brown," to the long and excellent "With God on Our Side", this is a protest record thru and thru. It's sort of a call to arms. "Get up, do something, make a difference," this record seems to be crying out. We should listen. Bob Dylan, with his work, has made a difference. This record is proof of that. 
 Ms. Chatzky has done a lot of research, not only on the financial habits of Americans, but on what truly makes us happy, consulting with many leading happiness experts.  No surprise -- beyond a certain income level that provides the basics, money doesn't really make us happy.  In fact, stress over money -- even if we have more than enough -- can make us miserable.  She encourages us to take control of our money, which will help us take control of our lives.  Many of her suggestions are simple, but practical:  organize your papers, pay your bills when they come in, don't buy things you don't need, track your spending...  But she frames them all in the discussion of finding happiness in your life, melding the practical with the philosophical.  It's true; this book will be more useful to people whose finances are way out of control.  But I still learned a couple of things:  some guidelines for portfolio composition, that I could probably track my spending more closely, and that I should do some estate planning.  If you're not sure you need this book, live one of Ms. Chatzky's mottoes and don't buy it:  check it out of the library instead!  
 I say 4 stars only because all things pale just a tad when placed next to the original trilogy.  If I could have said 4.9 stars, I would have.  As usual, Mr. Bantock is is brilliant self with Alexandria, furthering our love and curiosity when it comes to Griffin & Sabine and dragging us into the mystery of yet another pair of star-crossed souls with Isabella and Matthew.  I highly recommend that you read the Griffin & Sabine trilogy first, but definitely continue through this series as well.  So far, with The Gryphon and Alexandria, it's fantastic 
 Bill Bryson is a genius. This book is absolutely hilarious. I was never much of a reader, but i got this book for a present and when i started reading it i couldnt put it down. This is a must read. Bill Bryson, please right more (italy, islands, etc.)!! 
 I've been waiting for an opportunity to post this review of Eric Benet's first album since it was first released in 1996.  At the time I worked for a national record store chain and was doing everything I could to promote his album, including buying my own copy when I could have gotten a free promotional copy from the label rep and letting everyone know it.    "Eric Benet is one of the most exciting young singer/songwriters to come along since Brian McKnight burst on the R&B music scene in 1992.  His songwriting is prolific, mature, and socially conscious without being sappy or overly sentimental.  Benet wrote or co-wrote all but one of the tracks on his debut album, and his vocal delivery in each song is moving and convincing.  From the funky opening groove of the title track, to the beautiful orchestration of "While You Were Here", a bittersweet, tearjerking ballad (dedicated to the memory of his daughter India's mother who died tragically in a car accident), Benet manages to capture the heart, mind and soul of the listener for the duration of this album.  The musicianship of his album personnel is often reminiscent of superband Mint Condition, and serves to enhance Benet's powerful vocals.  The evidence of the influence of Stevie Wonder's vocal and arranging styles come through on this album, too, but not often enought to limit Benet from carving out his own niche in the R&B world.  If this isn't this young artist's best work, then he and his fans are in for a long, enjoyable career."  Recommended tracks: While You Were Here Let's Stay Together Femininity Spiritual Thang I'll Be There   I had the pleasure of meeting Eric Benet at a live performance/autograph signing at a local club called "The Warehouse" in Detroit, MI, when "True to Myself" was first released.  Benet struck me as a very down to earth individual who was a very humble and talented artist.  Of course, all this was prior to his very public courtship and marriage to Halle Berry and their subsequent break up.  Even though the circumstances surrounding his split with Ms. Berry may have left some of his previous admirers questioning his character as an individual, his talent as an artist has not diminished and TRUE fans of his music will stick by him because his talent is undeniable.  I have yet to purchase his latest album, "Hurricane", but I will be buying my copy soon! I love what I've heard of it and if the title track is any indication, Benet's fans have gotten another great set out of an accomplished artist whose musical growth has been borne out of his life experiences.  
 Dont be thrown of by some of the other reviews. If you start of by stating that Adorno is a Marxist and therefore must have had an agenda, your doing exactly what you have accused Adorno of. Furthermore this book wasnt single-handedly written by Adorno, far from it, and whether or not Adorno realy was a Marxist is irellevant since Adornos latter ideas have little or nothing to do with this book. The Authoritarian Personality remains a very interesting study in human behaviour and nature. It has clearly been written as a reaction to the horrors of what was happening then in Nazi Germany and the authors tried to come up with a full explanation. Although I dont doubt the integrity of authors motives, they did obviously not succeed in there goal to come up with an extensive theory for the existence of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich, because the focussed almost entirely on the personality of the individual and disregarded the unique social en economical circumstances in Germany after WWI, that have undoubtedly played an important role as well. The fact that, in hindsight, it has become apparent that the authors have not succeeded to live up to the overambitious conclusions does, however, certainly not make The Authoritarian Personality any less interesting. A lot can still be learned about the causes of ethnocentrism from this book. It is unique in its scale and historical value and should not be disregarded by anyone who wants to learn more about ethnocentrism as long as you keep the books apparent short comings in mind. You should, however, also keep in mind that the criticism this book has received is certainly not allways justified at all, but caused by the fact that a lot of it's conclusions still remain valid, but these are not always pleasant for everyone 
 This marvelous book offers to the reader a seductive marriage of ideas, at once original and so "right" that suddenly it seems the only way to view art and science.  As a science teacher I want all my colleagues and students to get to know Categories on the Beauty of Physics.  Particularly impressive: once the artwork gets and holds the eye and the mind, then the science writing seems so accessible that the whole intellectual sensation is one of joyous comfort with the broad ideas and deep concepts of physics.  Also important:  the reader can put the book down often, or open it to any page, or read it for long periods at a time, and get the same rush of recognition of rightness. Additionally, John Morse's artwork is gorgeous in its own right and edifying to the concepts.   
 This disc contains three works by Russian-Tatar composer Sofia Gubaidulina, an artist of deep religious sentiment as is apparent in these titles: "In croce", "Silenzio", and "Sieben Worte". The common instruments in these works are the cello and the bayan. The latter is a type of Russian accordian played here by Elsbeth Moser, who performed in the Western premier of "Sieben Worte" and to whom Gubaidulina dedicated "Silenzio." Cello is played by Maria Kliegel, who has performed under the approval of Rostropovich.  "In Croce" was originally written in 1979 as a piece for organ and cello, but it is represented here in a 1991 arrangement for cello and bayan by Elsbeth Moser which Gubaidulina has approved. It is an exploration of "vertical" music (the organ or bayan) intersected by the "horizontal" (cello), thus forming the cruciform symbolism so common in Gubaidulina's work. Personally, I prefer the performance of the cello and organ version by Ivashkin and Hicks released by Chandos, for the organ just seems to work better than the bayan. Still, Kliegel's cello work here is deeply moving and worth hearing, less restrained than Ivashkin's but perhaps more passionately religious.  "Silenzio" is a fragile, insubstantial piece for bayan, violin, and cello in which the vast majority of the work is played pianissimo. It consists of five "miniatures" which all maintain the same rhythmic proportion 7-2-5 in varying ways. It is an interesting experiment, but it results in the least interesting item on this disc, and it's technical brilliance comes at the expense of religious power.  "Sieben Worte (Seven Words)" for cello, bayan, and strings, is a crucial piece in this disc, and in Gubaidulina's oeuvre in general. I have said before that the composer's "Johannes-Passion" may be the greatest work of Christian piety of our time, but "Sieben Worte" follows not very long behind. It is an acknowledgement of the tradition of religious composition, and contains quotations from Heinrich Schuetz and clear influence from Haydn. Nonetheless, the bulk of the piece shows the originality of Gubaidulina through and through and has an elaborate technical basis on the cello which is too long to quote here, but which is included in the liner notes. The strings of the Camerata Transsylvanica (ironically based in Budapest after the emigration of its members) under Gyorgy Selmeczi are intense and unfaltering.   As is unfortunately usual with Naxos discs, the weak point is the liner notes. The English and German are, inexplicably, two different commentaries instead of a common text translated from one or the other. Keith Anderson's English commentary is quite interesting but poorly edited and unprofessional. Teresa Pieschacon Raphael's German commentary tells something about Gubaidulina's place in the Soviet music community which English readers too should have been able to enjoy. Though Naxos was kind enough to provide commentaries in two languages, the profile of the performers is only in English.  These three pieces, especially the last, make an excellent introduction to the work of this superlative composer, and at an economic price. This is one of the finest works in my collection, and I sincerely and passionately recommend it to just about anyone 
 This is book is great i don't own it but all my friends do so could the publishers please print it again pleas 
 This new soundtrack release for the 1968 family musical classic, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, contains all of the songs from the movie, albeit some have instrumental parts edited from the tracks. It contains several performances of the title track, as well as classics such as "Toot Sweets," "Hushabye Mountain," and "Doll On A Music Box." The sound is fairly crisp, clear, and mostly free of flaws.  I took one star off, however, for the simple reason that these 16 tracks don't even add up to 40 minutes of audio, which is why the exclusion of the demos that are included on the 2-Disc DVD baffles me. I made myself a copy of the CD with both the songs from the CD and the demos from the DVD, and it came to just under 70 minutes. It'd be nice if in the future, a new soundtrack was released with the demos, or even just the full songs, including the instrumental breaks. It's about time these record companies started taking advantage of a CD's ability to hold up to 80 minutes of audio.  Despite any flaws, I wholeheartedly recommend this soundtrack to ANY fan of the film. It presents all of the classic songs in a satisfactory presentation, and is wonderfully nostalgic. The songs aren't as good as the songs you'll find in any great Disney classic, but they're still fantastic fun 
 I have over 200 books on metaphysical, paranormal, biblical, gnostic, healing, channeling, etc.  This book, Messages From Your Angels: What Your Angels Want You To Know by Doreen Virtue, is my all time favorite source of inspiration and guidance.  Written exceptionally well for comprehension and offers great light into its messages.  This book sits high above all the rest, simple, gentle loving information for all who seek that connection to the spirit world.  Especially for anyone like me, a spiritually deaf child of God, finally, words I can hear and recognize as the light of truth 
 This book gives practical advice for happily married couples who need to spice up their sex life. I liked this book because it focuses on sex-related issues rather than fixing troubled marriages 
 Tony Hillerman once again takes us into the world of the Navajo with Jim Chee and the legendary Joe Leaphorn of the Navajo Tribal Police. I read this for the first time some years ago, and this entry in the long-running series is very exciting. It has a lot of atmosphere and Leaphorn and Chee are fleshed out more than usual in this terrific read.  Both Chee and Leaphorn are dealing with personal issues as this one begins. Chee hasn't quite figured out how he feels about Mary leaving him because he could not leave his Navajo way of life behind and move to the city with her. He is smitten with a pretty Navajo attorney named Janet but she's with someone else. Leaphorn meanwhile, is on terminal leave and retiring after the unexpected death of his beloved wife Emma. Niether he or Chee can explain his obsession with finding a missing pot hunter named Eleanor Friedman-Bernal. No Navajo would be involved, as stealing pots like this would make one a "Thief of Time" according to Navajo tradition.  Chee's letting a rather large backhoe get stolen right from under his nose will have ties to Leaphorn's investigation, and once more Chee will be helping Leaphorn all across the Navajo territory. This one will stretch all the way into Utah and down the San Juan River. Leaphorn will be reminded of a young boy's death by drowning before this one wraps up, and it will have unexpected ties to his search for Eleanor.  It seems Eleanor was looking for pots made by the Anasazi, a tribe that simply vanished from the face of the earth. Pictographs and petroglyphs of Kokopelli, the "Watersprinkler," will play a vital part in this mystery. But Eleanor's interest is also anthropological, and someone thinks what she's discovered is worth killing for.  Leaphorn and Chee will be hundreds of miles apart when they reach the same conclusion in this complex mystery. One will have to race to the other as things turn ugly, and two very different men will find commom ground when Leaphorn asks the unexpected of young Chee.  Hillerman's descriptions of the thousand foot cliffs along the San Juan River at night, under a sky filled with Navajo mystery, will enthrall you. This is a good mystery and quite possibly the best in the series. You don't want to miss this one 
 Cotkin has done a wonderful job of taking a very complex subject (one which seems to attract bad writers as well) and turning it into a good story.  Best of all:  He writes in jargon-free English.  Perfect for a Senior seminar in American intellectual history.  How was existentialism received in America?  Read the book 
 I negotiate retail and office leases as part of my law practice. This book is an excellent guide to the points that need to be considered when negotiating a lease. It will help attorneys as well as business people and brokers. The author does a good job in explaining, often in detail, the business reasons behind the different positions that the landlord and the tenant take. Understanding those reasons puts you in a much better position to create satisfactory compromises. Also, this book doesn't just address the major points - I was surprised to see how many subtle points the author addressed. Overall, an excellent book and a great value at this price. 
    We all know of Frank Abagnale's personality; arrogant, yet kind with class. Among all the different characters that he chooses to play, whether he's a pilot, doctor, lawyer, or a college professor, i believe that Frank is somewhat confused of who he is. Frank "ran away" from home at 16; the age of teenager who is only halfway through high school. At 16, most people don't know where they are in life or what to pursue in the future. One thing was for sure; Frank wanted money and women.     I believe Frank's unique personality came from the way he was brought up. Having endured his parent's divorce at a young age was a life changing experience for him. It all started with his father; Frank Abagnale. During the process of his(Jr.'s) parent's divorce, his father still loved is mother. So Frank(Sr.) would try to get his son to say things like "Talk to her son...tell her I love her. Tell her we'd be happier if we all lived together. Tell her you'd be happier if she came home, that all you kids would be happier." His(Jr's) father led him to the first step of manipulation.     Frank stayed with his father after the finalizing of the divorce. Since his father was quite a rich man, he had a whole variety of rich friends and Frank(Jr.) would come in contact with his friends quite often. This is where Frank learned the "attitude of the rich", with confidence.    Finally when Frank did his first con with his father's money, Frank(Sr.) forgave him. "Look, son, if you'll tell us how you did this, and why, we'll forget it. There'll be no punishments and I'll pay the bills." Frank probably felt that he could get away with anything at this point and without any punishment, he didn't believe this to be a huge mistake.     With confidence, manipulation, some class and little fear of breaking the law, we come to Frank Abagnale Jr.  
 I'm a big fan of the Frostburn, Sandstorm, and Stormwrack series.  If you're not planning to DM, the books provide interesting alternatives for your characters.  If you DM and plan to do your writing for the campaign, these books are an excellent way to add flavor to your campaign 
 Having owned cheaper keycases,  I have to say this one seems sturdier than most.  It is a bit harder to insert keys initially,  but if this makes them more secure, it is worth it.  Be aware that this case is larger than some cases; in fact it is almost like having a second small wallet in your pocket.  But the extra length helps to contain the longer car keys that are made these days.  My car key used to stick out of the end of my old key case, and would wear a hole in my jeans pocket.  Not a problem with the Rolfs case.   The quick-release feature may become a weakness after some years of wear and tear, but so far after 2 weeks of use there have been no problems with keys falling out 
 We are living in a period of time that almost defies words.  It is a time of profound transition.  Yes, each moment of time is just that a transition to the next.  The seconds that become minutes, the minutes that become hours then days then weeks then months then years and thus the cycle and circle of life. There are however more defining moments of transition that are born from all the cycles of time and the culmination of those that that precede them.    Almost everyone I speak with on and off the air is very aware of the fact that we are already in the advent of the beginning of this shift and that there is much more to come.  My radio work has given me the access and privilege to speak with and interview many who have responsibly done their homework about the changes and shifts we sense, feel and are going through.     Dr. John Jay Harper has, with this book, given us the gift of the larger picture that frees us to understand and see the true significance of this moment.  He connects the dots of past, present and future in a read that is compelling and life changing.  He has given us a true picture of this every changing canvas of how our past and present connects to our future thus free us to embrace without fear the changes and the new meanings that will be born from this moment of great awakening.    This new awareness is a gift.  Dr. John Jay Harper has given us a deep and meaningful clarity in his book "Transformers: Shamans of the 21st Century".

 Wendell Berry has continued the story of the people of Port William and their common sense, appreciation of the meaning and fullness of community, and wiseness about their place in the world.  The story is told through Hannah Coulter's eyes as she looks back on her life in the arms of that community.    People in Port William don't live in fear.  "It was getting on toward dark, but I could see the car well enough, and I didn't recognize it.  I hesitated a minute.  The country is full of strangers now, and you hear tales.  There are , no doubt about it, some people who would knock an old woman in the head more or less on speculation.  But I thought "What of it?" and went on out."  Hannah's accounts of the two loves of her life and the deepness and fullness of that love are the best descriptions of mature, lasting love that I have ever read.  Hannah looks to the future of Port William with some sadness as the lines of generations  of farmers have been broken.  This is reflected in the paths chosen by her own children.  "But did we tell the stories right?  It was lovely, the telling and the listening, usually the last thing before bedtime.  But did we tell the stories in such a way as to suggest that we had needed a better chance or a better life or a better place than we had?  I don't know, but I have had to ask.  Suppose your stories, instead of mourning and rejoicing over the past, say that everything should have been different.  Suppose you encourage or even just allow your children to believe that their parents ought to have been different people, with a better chance, born in a better place.  Or suppose the stories you tell them allow them to believe, when they hear it from other people, that farming people are inferior and need to improve themselves by leaving the farm.  Doesn't that finally unmake everything that has been made?  Isn't that the loose thread that unravels the whole garment?  And how are you ever to know where the thread breaks, and when the tug begins?"  Wendell Berry's writing is a gift and I am deeply grateful.    
 I'm very pleased with this book.  I wanted something that would help me figure out what colors to use, whether or not to paint the molding, and how to make one room flow with another.  This book addressed all of those issues and more!  I am very pleased with the layout and how the book is set up as a Q&A format.  I would highly recommend this book 
 There is nothing remarkable about the literary style of Butler's book; it reads like a million and a half other 19th century British novels.  What distinguishes "The Way of All Flesh", however, is its honest and at times funny portrayal of Victorian society.  With great wit, Butler's narrator, Overton, and main character, Ernest, expose the stuffy, staid, hypermannered, insipid Victorian middle-class mindset.    What is especially nice is that Butler doesn't take too many cheap shots.  The characters here are very well-drawn.  Ernest's father, Theobald, though clearly representing all that Butler seeks to skewer, is enough of a three-dimensional foil that I could feel some sympathy for the poor old man.  (He's not evil incarnate, just a sorry product of his time.)  The same goes for the rest of the supporting cast.  I like the narrator's voice; it's distinctive and wry enough to be unique, but not so intrusive as to distract from the plot.  Parts of the novel are funny; parts seem to drag.  I don't know that I liked the end of the novel--everything seems tied together a little too perfectly; but an explanation may be found in the fact that Butler did not edit this portion of the novel before his death.    This is a solid book.  Give it a shot 
 Rachel Stevens proved back in 2003 that she was not a shadow behind frontman Jo O'Meara of the group S Club 7 with her debut album, Funky Dory. With her first album brought a string of hits including the slinky "Sweet Dreams My L.A. Ex," the 70's flashback of "More, More, More," and the anthem of 2004 that supposively saved her career, the 80's thumping "Some Girls." So with that in mind, that "Some Girls" was her chance back a top of the charts, why did her sophomore album flop?   I should retract my previous statement. Her album did peak at No. 20 in the U.K. and she had several top 10 hits and one top 20. But for some reason these songs were like something thrown at a wall. Sure, it will linger for a few seconds, but then quickly falls to the ground.   "Negotiate With Love," probably wasn't the best way to introduce her new found sound to the world. But it was catchy nonetheless with its addictive chorus (The case is closed/ I don't negotiate with love). So it was no wonder that it was able to peak at No. 10. But the follow-up "So Good," the catchy as hell break up anthem was stunning! Her sexy low key vocals with it's thumping beats should have made this a No. 1 smash and gave her the limelight she deserves overseas as well. Unfortunately, it stalled at No. 9. Rachel continues with her singles and brings us the rockin' 80's sex with your ex track, "I Said Never Again (But Here We Are)." This song is nothing short of spectacular and should have given her album it's pole position peak it deserved. How can one resist the lyrics "I said no no never, we don't go together, no, I really couldn't take anymore. Now it's two weeks later, I feel such a traitor, I let you in my back door." Where Funky Dory lagged with it's musical quality and cliched lyrics, Come and Get It prevails beautifully.   Hopefully the music industry will pick up on this diamond in the rough and she will finally get the attention she deserves. And why not? Her vocals are mezmerizing on the beautiful ballad "I Will Be There," or her arguably best track on the album, "Nothing Good About This Goodbye."   Rachel asked for people to come and get this album. But apparently people haven't gotten the earwax out of their ears and picked it up. When will they learn? 
 In this book Ron Chernow does a magnificent job of explaining this complex and often controversial figure. While the Authors view is somewhat slanted in favor of Hamilton he does point out Hamilton's glaring defects. Hamilton is one of those figures that are difficult to understand, either you love him or you hate him. Was he a genius that was too smart for his own good, an arrogant aristocrat, or both? I think history vindicates Mr. Hamilton and his philosophy. A Central Bank, the New York Stock Exchange, The Federalist Papers, His View of the French Revolution, His report on Public credit, Revolutionary Debt consolidation, the list goes on and on. His genius is evident in all that he set his mind too and yet his arrogance and ego left a trail of destruction. If was not for the Maria Reynolds affair and the conspiracy against him would he have been our 3rd president? 
 This one was a joy to read.  Like one reviewer said "another book about books."  (My, I do love those).  This is a absolute delight to read though.  It is funny, flows well and most of all, is highly entertaining.  So many works written near or at the turn of the last century are burried, seldom read and difficult to find.  It is a pitty.  There are so many wonderful, little known works out there, that simply are not in the public eye as they deserve to be. This is one of them.  Highly recommend this one 
 I've been writing a musical comedy for awhile, and needed some music for the scene segues. It takes place in Hollywood circa 1940s, and I'll tell you, this captures the era perfectly. It wasn't the classics like "Singin' in the Rain" or "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" that really impressed me. Some of my favorites are "Going Hollywood", an upbeat and hopeful tune...Astaire's "If Swing Goes, I Go Too", Brilliant! Stop reading this review already, and add this to your cart. You'll be the envy of all your friends-Ok, maybe not. But who the heck cares, its a great CD 
 As my dad wrote BEING ZEN, he sent me one chapter at a time to proof-read and offer feedback. The information wasn't new to me, as we'd talked about the ideas and experiences mentioned in the book many times. And so I thought that once published, reading BEING ZEN would be like a review for me. However, each time I read a chapter, there was something new and helpful there, not because it was new information, but because my life and my relationship to everything in my life is always changing. I figure I could read this book 100 times and gain something new each time. I could turn to any page and find a reminder there that applies to my life and the issues and difficulties on my plate at any given moment. Most often, it's the last thing I want to do. My dad's "practice" is HARD!!! But I've seen it transform him and his life from one ruled by anger to one filled with love, compassion, and true happiness found in his wilingness to just BE with anything life presents. This book can help anyone who is willing to use it. And to all of you... you can either write-off my opinion as that of the biased daughter, or take it to heart from someone who has watched her father grow and change 180 degrees over the past 26 years and who has become her best friend and greatest teacher 
 Asif Siddiqi covers the first laps of the space race from the Soviet side. This tome goes deeper than just the hardware by covering some of the personalities involved on the Soviet side of the space industry. If you are interested in the history of early space exploration, this book fills in many of the holes that most Western histories leave unexplored 
 I'm a forester and I know my native trees, but I am now helping a co-worker in urban forestry.  I'm having to identify ornamental trees that I do not know so well and this book has been a major help in the field.  It fits nicely into my saftey vest too.  I definitely recommend this book as a reference for both common native trees and also for ornamental trees 
 Excellent...very inexpensive. Great translation. If you need a copy of the Republic, GET THIS 
 Villa-Lobos is a Brazilian composer of the 20th century who deserves more attention. There are relatively few recordings of his works. This complete recording of the 9 Bachianas Brasileiras is a rare pleasure. The Bachianas are considered some of the lighter and easier works of Villa-Lobos and are based on Bach's music. Still, they can't be considered easy listening at first. After a few hearings, however, the music grows on you and you come to realize their beauty 
 The study of the Chinese in America has been given a major boost with the publication of this important book by historian John Kuo Wei Tchen. In clear and vivid prose, Tchen has altered the landscape of what has  heretofore been accepted as Chinese-American history. From George  Washington's porcelain tea set to the Bowery to "Siamese" twins  Chang and Eng, the book is filled with eye opening original research and  thought provoking conclusions. Sure to become a standard reference in the  coming years 
 Fire in the City is another revealed hornet's nest from Martines that picks up the thread where his previous book April Blood left off.  As the title suggests, this is not an exclusive biography on Savonarola, the author casts his net wider than that detailing, in a very readable fashion, the political and social settings that were bound in with Savonarola's actions.  With Lorenzo's death, Florence is at the mercy of his vain and incompetent son, Piero de Medici, whose diplomatic bungling with the invading King of France, Charles the VIII, gets him run out of town by the citizens of Florence, creating political alternatives to Medici rule. Into this anxious period of uncertainty, the searing personality of the reforming Dominican Friar, Savonarola, is catapulted.  Martines shows how Savonarola's political instinct was very much in line with the Christian ethos he espoused from the pulpit, preferring a broader based franchise through the Great Council, sustained by a Republic, instead of oligarchic rule by an elite. Salvation meant not just the deliverance by redemption from the power of sin, but also preservation from tyrannical harm. Yet Savonarola's motives were not as subversive or ego driven ('vainglorious') as his inquisitors and future Medici regimes led history to believe.  Martines also shows how Savonarola's prophecies, another contentious quality to his personality used against him by his enemies in Rome and elsewhere, were not far off the mark. The sack of Rome by Christian mercenaries in 1527, twenty-nine years after Savonarola's execution, seemed to vindicate much of Savonarola's visionary utterances.  Was that, indeed, the scourge against the Church he claimed Charles the VIII capable of a generation earlier?  Emphasising the importance of this little Dominican Friar from Ferrara who was prepared to take on Pope Alexander VI over issues of simony and moral corruption, reminds us just how much of a precursor he was to Martin Luther.  His insistence on a reformed Church was not merely rhetorical either, his own example proved otherwise.  No doubt Savonarola was a force to behold with his lightning bolts of apocalyptic doom. He profoundly affected Michelangelo and Botticelli who heard him speak, but Martines has stained orthodox whitewash with the blood of historical realism, showing us that Savonarola was more vital and complex and his contribution more positive, than that of just a preaching terrorist who infuriated Rome and encouraged the `bonfire of the vanities'.    After reading April Blood and Fire in the City, the enigma of Florence is much better understood. We patiently wait for his next publication, to read again where it will lead.     
 There is absolutely nothing wrong with this book at all. It is a very good read, in a very standard binding. You get a good introduction to it and some nice notes which are helpful.  This is set in contemporary times to Austen, and was the heroine which Austen least liked. Emma Woodhouse is young, rich and single. She lives a life of wealth and privilege in a small village just outside of London. In her world, and in her village she is queen. However there are flaws in her character which will be tested.  Austen liked to write about small things, about daily life, and the petty things which people in small communities become obsessed with. And so into Emma's life come the scatter-brained Harriet Smith the daughter of "someone" who cobbles together what learning she might at a local ladies academy. Emma adopts her and tries to help her make her way in the world by finding her a good match.  Emma's fine world is disrupted when first Mr Elton moves to the village, and then marries a rather smart but upstart woman who wishes to manage everyone's life.   Austen's skill in reflecting Emma and her machinations for good, against Mrs Elton and her machinations for her own good are gloriously done.   Emma is a brilliant novel and its themes are universal and timeless, it is all about the things in life which never change -  love, pride, marriage, status and money.  Don't watch dreadful movie adaptations of this book (like the one Gwyneth Paltrow did) the book is much sharper, wittier and subtler. It is greatly enjoyable reading. The introduction may (or may not) help you to greater understanding of her ability to write with a light, sharp pen. Hopefully the story will stand out for its brilliance 
 If you are around kids a lot, as a parent or through your work, this book will likely be quite useful. It gives lots of learning activities for kids and goes into a lot of detail. However, if you don't need as much detail and also want suggestions for adults, I recommend "Learned Optimism" which covers the key points from this book and also addresses adults. 
  "Children of Paradise" is set in pre 1840 Paris, on Boulevard of Crime and is a richly entertaining and intensely romantic. It is the story of infatuation, jealousy, deception, grief, murder, and true love lost forever. The film tells of an unattainable beautiful courtesan named Garance (unforgettably played by Arletty who was over 40 and seemed not to care at all if she looked her age) and four men who love her - the famous mime Baptist (Jean-Louis Barrault is matchless), the actor, Frederick LeMaitre, the criminal Pierre-François Lacenaire, and the aristocrat Comte de Montray. She loved one of them and the affair was doomed. The film is so much more than just a romantic story (which is absolutely beautiful and compelling) - it is a love song to the Art of Theater where art imitates life and vice-versa and the hidden symbolism of freedom and despotism (the film was made in Paris during the Nazi Occupation under immensely difficult circumstances).   Jacques Prevert wrote the brilliant and ironic scenario and dialog; Marcel Carne superbly directed the film. Its larger than life and gloriously three-dimensional characters, narrative skill and the sweep of production make it a true cinema triumph. It is a 190 minutes long film but I cherished every minute of it.   
 This book was good and a fast read, however it was very biblically based and had many religious references.  It didn't take away from the book, but is something for potential readers to be aware of.  It is definitely a book to put your mind at ease if you're currently struggling with military life.  It very much normalizes the thoughts and feelings military wives have, showing you you're not alone and can face what the military sends your way.  If you're a new military wife looking for a lot information I'd recommend Today's Military Wife by Lydia Sloan Kline instead 
 So you all probably know that Monica workshopped with Chuck Palahniuk, and he refers to her in the intro of "Clown Girl" as the funnier, sexier, darker writer.  I really enjoyed her book, it was indeed funny, laugh out loud funny, as well as twisted, dark, sexy and a blast to read.  When I look back on 2006 I think it is one of the best books I read, one of the few I LOVED.  I look forward to more of her work, and if you haven't gotten this book yet, get it right now.  
 I agree with the previous reviews, i.e. this book is a great combination of personal first hand accounts and tactical and strategic narrative supplemented by plenty of maps (unfortunately not many photos). It is sad that Mr. Zoepf passed away before he knew how much readers liked his book 
 I did my original review below in 2001. The year is now 2006 and we have ordered literally hundreds of copies of this book for our relocating employees. As long as this book is available, we will be ordering it long into the future. The advice is priceless.  Moving is a stressful life experience under any circumstances.  Ellen Carlisle, with her delightfully easy to implement tips, has shared advice from her own life that will make the transition of moving not only easier but enjoyable for the whole family.  Ellen's conversational style eases the reader through the phases of relocating--from the initial realization to the actual move and everything in between.  There are even chapters to guide the caring parents as they help their teenagers and younger children through this exciting yet scary life change.  Ellen deals with the necessities in a simple straightforward manner and tops everything off with encouragement that "Yes, you can do this and have fun too!"  We were so impressed with Ellen's book that we ordered 200 to implement into our company relocation program.  The feedback from our relocating employees has been very positive.  They were thankful to have the book to guide them through the ins and outs of relocating.  I would advise anyone making a move to read Smooth Moves 
 Enjoyed the book. This single engagement may well have changed the course of history. Beyond the overarching picture of victory in the face of overwhelmingly superior Japanese forces,the book llluminates the human faces of those times--some with halos, some with warts 
 If you are looking for a better way to teach children math in the early grades, you must read this book.    In Young Children Reinvent Arithmetric, Professor Constance Kamii takes you on a journey of discovery as she works with  teacher Georgia DeClark in her first grade classroom. Together they work through the first grade math curriculum finding games and real life situations that will assist students in developing the mathematical thinking skills that underlie the curriculum goals.  The book begins with background information on Piaget's Theory of number, demonstrating how children develop logical-mathematical thinking by interacting with the world and each other. In Part Two the goals and objectives of the curriculum are explained. In Part Three the activities used to teach the children are explained in great detail so that teachers will understand how to use them in their own classrooms. In Part 4 The teacher tells her story. Part Five provides the program evaluation with the research and testing that was done. The children in DeClark's classroom are compared to children in a classroom using traditional teaching methods.  Constance Kamii has been transforming the Constructivist Theory of the origins of thinking by Jean Piaget into practical activities for teaching for decades. Her work is so important in these days of standardized testing and NCLB. Nancy Illing author of SPARKS Ignite Imaginatio 
 A Million in Prizes: The Anthology~ Iggy Pop is an amazing anthology collection from an icon in the rock industry and rock music history. Iggy Pop has surprisingly good vocals, the lyrics are not as simple as one would have like thought they would be. I must admit that I only heard Lust for life and to be even more honest I had no idea that this song was written by Pop and Bowie. I love the photos in the book-let and the cover photo is vintage Pop at his best. I was a bit ticked of that they had not included the lyrics for the songs in the otherwise amazing book-let. This is a compilation that I highly recommend.  
 Indispensable ammunition for those of us seeking to establish "original intent".   Skousen's book matches provisions of the Constitution with Madison's Notes on the Convention.  Very readable.   Liberals hate it...that's good enough for me 
 I've always been a big Pam Tillis fan. Her voice is one of the most unique in Country Music, and she sure knows how to sell a song. She's outdone herself here. This may be one of her best albums ever. She's singing better than ever, and she makes you believe every word. "Train Without A Whistle" and "Someone Somewhere Tonight" will break your heart. "Bettin' Money on Love" and "Crazy By Myself" will have you grinning. And the duet wih John Anderson, "Life Sure Has Changed Us Around" is a classic. Kudos to the musicians, as well. There's some great playing on this album. It's all just wonderfully done. If you like Country Music, you owe it to yourself to check out "Rhinestoned". It's the real deal 
 It may help to have read the entire trilogy before attempting these CD's. The fact that the author and a cast perform on all 3 sets of CD's is fantatstic. The narrated story let my imagination soar. Perhaps, for me, driving is not the time to listen to these audio books. I get so carried away. The universe created by the author is compelling, darker than Tolkein, so fantastical yet so believeable, and very hard to shake.  A treasure to keep alongside the book versions 
 Over the years, I have purchased countless exercise videos and The Firm is definitely my favorite.  I own The Firm 1 (whole set) and this Firm 2 video.  This video is challenging and fun.  It is tough and definitely a good workout overall.  Each exercise transitions well into another.  The cardio is fun that includes a bit of kickboxing.  The weight training is more intense than The Firm 1.  I highly recommend this video.  I have always enjoy The Firm exercise video.  The only setback is, everytime The Firm comes out new videos, you are required to purchase a new equipment for their new workouts.  
 I am over 50 years old and needed a workout that was easy on my joints but still fun and would make me sweat without getting out of breath. This one did it all. I love it. The only problem is the menu setup - too many screens before you can start the workout portion. If it were not for all of the DVD screens, I would have rated this 5 stars 
 Although the book focuses mostly on MFC, I still found it an excellent source and an effective learning aid 
 Forget the feel-good hype that advertisers, marketing types, and "bioscientists" are trying to make you believe: an untested, unknown, and uncontrollable technology has been released into our food supply, and we will be living with the consequences for generations to come. Corporate agriculture holds the farmer and consumer hostage in the never-ending quest for ever-greater profits. The research conducted by so-called bioscientists is shoddy and sparse, and what has been done to farmers in America and abroad is sickening. Particularly alarming is the lack of data on long-term ingestion of these products, especially in children. Cummins and Lilliston provide information on how to determine whether products contain GE ingredients and how to avoid GE-tainted food. Ways to get involved--at the very least we should be loudly insisting that these products be labeled--are provided as well. If you think tobacco companies are dishonest and greedy, wait until you read about corporate agriculture. If you eat, you must read this book 
 Siddhartha a Brahmin's son and his friend departs his fathers house in search of a different life than the sedate environment of home. His father (Amrik Singh) says that if he finds truth then return and tell him. And if he should find nothing to return any way; as like the river everything returns.  His path through the story, that takes place in no certain time or place, sort of parallels the Buddha's searching's but is not a fictionalized version. His friend finally chooses another path leaving Siddhartha to find his way alone. Siddhartha decides that enlightenment comes from within and can not be taught. The Buddha admonishes Siddhartha not to be too clever.  His searching takes him through several lives as he learns of love and money, and a few more experiences. He almost seems like snot as he explains to a courtesan that he doesn't really love. Recognizing that he has wasted his time with searching he comes to some interesting conclusions.  In this 1972 film by Conrad Rooks captures more of the original book than he intended. The film was not intended to be more than an adoption of the book as the director figured that his 25 years in India gave him a better insight than Hermann Hesse's (the book that the movie was based on) 11 month insight.  One of the profound items I picked up on was the speech about what a rock could be. 
 If you ever wanted a way to break through old barriers and you don't have the time or the money to pay a therapist, EFT is the answer and this newest book on the subject is a GREAT compilation of the best minds in the business.  I have read many of these authors already and to have them all in one well thought out book is really a pleasure as well as a time saver.  This is a great book, I recommend it to everyone I meet. 
 The Boston based author, Dennis Lehane, wrote a great detective story with a social background so great, it is almost more important than the plot. "Mystic River" differs from Lehane's other books and indeed raises him to the next level as a writer.  "Mystic River" is set in the fictional Boston suburb, called East Buckingham (the author explains it as an amalgamate of Dorchester, Charlestown and South Boston and it really feels like Dorchester), home mostly to white working class, with plenty of crime. I liked the background info especially since I could relate to it, knowing the area...  The first part, which is the base and explanation for later events, takes place in 1975, when one of the three eleven-year old neighborhood boys playing in the street is abducted by two men in an apple-smelling car, and although he comes back after four days, his life as well as his friends' is changed forever. The ways of the boys soon part, Dave (the boy taken by the men) lives a quiet life, has a wife and a son, and likes his memories of being a football player in high school. Jimmy, the "bad boy", after doing some time in prison settles down as a storeowner with a nineteen-year old daughter from his first marriage, second wife and their two daughters. The third boy, college-educated Sean, becomes a policeman.  When Jimmy's beautiful daughter, Katie, is found murdered in the park after a night out Dave comes home covered in blood, Sean gets assigned to the case. There are many leads to different people... But the case is difficult. Meanwhile, Jimmy and his family embark on the search of their own.  The plot is very good until the end, and psychological details as well as the insights into the society are extremely accurate. The characters are very real, especially Jimmy and Sean, who are central to the plot. Their trauma after Dave's abduction made a lasting effect on their lives - in very different ways. They are complicated, multifaceted people, very well developed as literary characters. Some side protagonists, depicting perhaps types rather than individuals (Bobby, Roman, the Savage brothers, Sergeant Whitey), are very good. I was in the grasp of this book until the end - it is not only great entertainment, but also food for thought.   The movie based on "Mystic River" with Sean Penn is equally moving - recommended for those with little time... 
 I had heard of this author for a long time and never read any of her work, so it was with careful reflection and consideration that I opened this book - attracted by the "Peace" and "Busy People" of the title.  The book is divided into 52 chapters (almost chapterettes) that include ideas for application of the principle discussed.  Borysenko writes with a friend-like, compassionate voice as she guides the reader into a more centered life style.  The strategies discussed won't be new for those "experienced" at Personal Development AND the presentation makes it worth the investment.  Each idea is narrowed down so succinctly and at the same time, the resulting "a-ha's" have the possibility of being substantial for those who take the principles and put them into practice.  I love how personable Joan comes across - in the section on perfectionism she describes how she still deals with it in her life through a story from a recent holiday dinner. Her chapter on "Breath" is so simple and yes, so powerful.  These happen to be my favorites, but each lesson has gold to be mined.  For those folks who don't want to do the lessons "one-a-week", the book could easily be opened to any page, read and applied in that moment.  The chapterettes can literally be read while waiting in line at the grocery store so there is no reason NOT to live more peacefully now -   There - see how effortless that was? *Smile* Reading and using this book is even easier than reading this review.... Enjoy!  
 I loved the way this book was presented.  It is pleasant to read and has lots of extras in addition to knowledgable Reiki techniques.  I especially liked the quotes 
 This album makes me fish better, drink whiskey better, pick up truck stop hillbilly waitresses better, spit better, four wheel drive better, honky tonk better, raise cowboy hell better, and love them southern trailer park ladies better... Cuz we can skin a buck, we can run a trout line and a countryboy can survive, country folks can survive. I'm gonna let out a Honky Tonk scream now.....Yeaowwww! Hard to believe I'm a native of India. Long live Bocephus 
 Conscious Dreaming is the road map to the expansive world that exists in every dreamers mind. Robert Moss is a gifted lucid dreamer who shares his intriguing yet simple techniques for readers to use in their own dreams. Much of the book accounts the past experiences that Robert Moss had while in his many states of lucidity. These are used to show the wonderful imagination that not only he possesses but that all of us already possess. In every persons mind there is a world so magical and beautiful that is just awaiting its discovery. I personally have used some of the techniques before I even read the book. In the past, I had had a dream where I was walking in the empty halls of a hockey stadium. As I was walking, I suddenly realized that I was dreaming. I tried my best to stay calm in fear of awakening from the dream. I thought of the endless possibilities that were now before me as I placed my hand on a wall. I said aloud, " I want this stadium to change into an ice palace." I dont know why I thought of that but its what came out. With the last syllable barely off my tongue the stadium was transformed into one of the most beautiful places I had ever witnessed. If dreamers are wanting to expand their abilities then this is a great book to start... 
 MAD LIBS are the best thing!!I will be buying some [...]! Living in Oz,It can be hard to buy mad libs but I managed to get this one.It is really good,really fun,and gives lotsa laughs.And,if you are wondering,yep,you can play each story again and again as you forget them.I suppose one of my favourite stories in it is Beauty Advice 
 At the beginning when the book tells us about Saddam Hussein I thought that this'll be as many books written about him. When the book turns out to be an internal affair is when you get thrilled. The book has some pages that said nothing about the main plot but you'll get hooked till the end. This is my first book by VF and I'm looking forward to read more of him.  About the end... no comments 
 McPherson has weaved together a very well written study of what motivated soldiers, both North and South, to fight in the Civil War.  McPherson does an excellent job of breaking up the chapters to keep the text flowing.  He also describes what would motivate men to continue to fight after seeing the horrors of battle, why men joined up, why married men continued to serve despite pleas from family members to go AWOL or take a medical leave, etc.  All the while, McPherson uses dozens of quotes from diaries and letters to back up his claims.  McPherson should be applauded for letting the soldiers tell most of this story rather than the author conjecture why he thought they fought.  He also seems to have let the story come to him rather than set out with an agenda.  A must have for any Civil War or military history student 
 Rogers writes this book as a follow-on to "Investment Biker"  which he wrote in the early 1990's.  The difference is he doesn't get rained on as much as his exposure to the elements is limited by his surrounding automobile versus his totally-exposed-to-the-elements motorcycle.    The crux of his book isn't so much a travelogue as about his exploits as a commodity maven or as one who seeks to improve his human capital in that regard.  Throughout the book I marveled at his insights and comparisons, and his doggedness at learning by keeping his ear to the ground and his eyes on the road.  He knows a great deal about history and the ebb and flow of successful (and unsuccessful) societies.  He recounts his own take on the historical, social, political, military, and financial (seen thru  currency spreads) realities on every country he visits, - all 116 of them.  He's a courageous guy, one with the genes for adventure and risk taking even though he claims to never take risks while investing.  This implies that he always buys when there's "blood in the streets" (at the bottom), but his latest problems with Refco, the bankrupt commodity trading operation and it's fraudulent books are a testament and refutation to this claim.  That may seem rather cavalier of me to say, but there are always unforseen risks in investing no matter how thorough your research and he knows this better than I.  As a contrast to the high regard in which I hold Rogers as an investor, I am somewhat flummoxed with his claims to be anti-war.  After all, he had to occasionally be escorted by armed convoys when he traveled thru Africa and other countries of the sub-continent.  Why does he think we give guns to cops?  Put another way, the only way you can ultimately neutralize the bad guys is with force.  If you want peace you must be prepared for war or so the saying goes.  While Rogers correctly states that avaricious politicians are almost always the culprits with regard to war mongering, there are some wars which are wars of liberation i.e. our forays into Bosnia, Afghanistan and Iraq, WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, etc.  One need only look at the tremendous outpouring and participation of those who have recently voted in Afghanistan and Iraq.  These events make George Kennan's containment theory look a bit dated though it did work acceptably at the time, some 55 to 60 years ago.  From my personal perspective Reagan had it right in his dealings with the Soviets and we could have shortened the Cold War considerably had we followed his dictums.  Rogers is certainly correct in understanding the damage that unscrupulous politicians can wreak citing endless examples of it in this book, and his major investment thesis is to buy into a country when no one else will consider it.  Given that many of these countires seem to be not countries at all but oil wells with a flag over them, Rogers is true to his calling as an investigative commodities investor, one with his nose close to the ground.  By contrast, most large investors are "top-down" guys who look for expanding or contracting spreads after which they invest in the biggest companies in the sector.  If you pay close attention to Rogers you see that he always goes for the stocks of staple industries: tobacco, banking, brewing, oil, gas, etc; all industries with a local as well as a potential global market.  Because most countries don't manufacture anything that any global consumer  will buy, they sell what they can grow and what they have underground in the way of natural resources.  If they can cost effectively get it in deliverable form they can export it.  After that their next gambit is arms and tourism.   As an aside, Rogers points out and correctly so that when the price of oil drops again the Russians are in for a heap of trouble, all the way around.  But, it's always something isn't it  (Remember Roseanne-a-danna-danna?)  I'd recommend this book to anyone who is an investor and intersted in a macro level birds-eye view of the world.  Not many guys have Rogers' keen insights nor his zest for getting down and dirty in the pursuit of the next profitable natural resource or currency play.  He's a real maverick and a successful on at that.  My hat is certainly off to him and I will faithfully read his next offering which though unannounced will, I'm guessing, be about either undersea or space travel as he seems to have covered everything else, what do you think 
 A manual on growing into death and dying, change and trasitio 
 I couldn't disagree more with the comment below that this was written by "some over-educated women with too much time on their hands." Actually, I know one of the authors (I used to babysit her three wonderful adopted daughters).  I found the book consistent with my experience of her:  as a dedicated, sensitive, gentle mother who cares deeply about her children and wants to help adoptive parents learn both from the research about adoption and our personal experiences as adoptive parents.  This book is a gem!  
 It's really good to have Dick Francis back in the saddle, or rather at the typewriter. I do wish he had invented a new character instead of re-hashing sid halley. unless it was done by a ghost-writer?  it does sound like him. a satisfying book but not one of his best... too predictable. like another reviewer, i liked the DNA information tied into the plot.  
 I picked this book, because I read "The Da Vinch Code" and I wanted to check out other Dan Brown books. I actually bought the small paperback and after finish reading it, I found out that there was a Special Illustrated Edition of this book, and I had to have it! Because when I was reading the small paperback without the illustrations, it was hard to imagine the places.  I wish I knew about this Illustrated Edition. I loved it! In my opinion, "Angeles and Demons" is better than "The Da Vinch Code". I have heard that "Angeles and Demons" is going to be a movie. If it's true, I could hardly wait. And I hope it's not going to be like the movie version of "The Da Vinch Code" 
 We have had one of the ISI Whip Cream Makers also for 20 years and there is nothing else like it. We have given them away as house warming gifts repeatedly and they are well appreciated. Some friends have purchased poor imitations that last only a couple of years and cost them just as much. It is one of those things you think you "Why would I want one?" and after you own one you think "Why did I not have one of these before". Not only does it make great whipped cream, it impresses the hell out of your guests 
 I purchased this project when it was originally released around 1982 & was blown away by it.And this was the CASSETTE version!Since I gave away the worn-out tape,I have been looking for the CD version for the last 10 ten years.This one is a no-brainer gimme.Get it while it's back & the follow up album(I'm Walkin)before they disappea 
 I generally am not a fan of sports saga books. Very often I think theyre little more than a collection of sports columns and media articles, along with some locker room gossip, pasted together for a quick-read. That being said, I greatly enjoyed "Last Night of the Yankee Dynasty." Bruce Olney's starting point is the now-infamous Game 7 of the 2001 World Series, when the usually unflappable Mariano Rivera blew a save and the Yankees lost the World Series. But his book also covers the "dynasty" years of 1996-2001, when the Yankees won 4 championships: 1996, and 1998-2000. Olney is a good writer, and he makes us care (shocker!) about this team. Derek Jeter, Tino Martinez, Mariano Rivera, Roger Clemens, the tragic Darryl Strawberry, manager Joe Torre, even George Steinbrenner are humanized by Olney's pen. But Olney also documents how Steinbrenner's micromanaging, "shopaholic" ways eventually ruined this dynasty. That's certainly a valid theory, as there's no doubt King George's penchant for trading away "farm" prospects for huge stars with bulky contracts took away some of team cohesiveness and also roster flexibility. On the other hand, one could also argue that the Yankees stopped winning championships in 2000 because all good things must come to an end. This book has an epilogue, which covers the Yankees after the 2001 series. IMO the epilogue feels a bit shallow and tacked on, and why I only give this book four stars. By now, everyone knows that the Yankees advanced to the 2004 ALCS against the Boston Red Sox. And ... well, everyone knows about the most spectacular choke-job in sports history, as the Yankees went up 3 games to none and then proceeded to lose the series. Olney's epilogue covers this, but IMO too briefly. There was a lifetime of baseball in that 7-game series, and a few pages simply can't do justice to that series. Perhaps the incredible 2004 season deserves a book of its own 
 This is such a Great book I have boughten copeys for all my childern 
 I met Tony Earley yesterday during the Festival of Southern Cultures at the University of Tennessee at Martin.  Our group had the unique opportunity to sit with him once yesterday and once today and pick his brain about this book.  It is a very amazing piece of literature, with metaphors hidden just below the rocky surface.  His short stories include very insightful mantras...especially the ones about shooting the cat (not for cruelty, but out of pity) and hunting deer.  I don't really know how else to describe this book, so all I can say is that you should buy it and read it as soon as possible!  Also, he teaches at Vanderbilt University in Nashville if any of you go/are thinking of going there 
 How refreshing it is to know that we can turn to Amazon for all our fresh elk carcass needs!  No more hoping to come across a large road kill on the way home from work!  Perfect for wedding receptions, birthday parties and anniversary celebrations - you know, all those fun times when you just have to dig that pit in the back yard, and roast a large slab of meat.  Slice up those leftovers, and you'll have sandwiches for weeks.  Thank you Amazon 
 Charlie Bone isn't your typical nine-year-old boy.  Although he didn't know that himself.  But when photographs get mixed up and he ends up with a picture of a man and a little girl that talks to him, he knows everything that was normal about his life is gone forever.  Tracking down the picture, Charlie finds out it belongs to Miss Ingledew, a woman who owns a bookshop and has been looking for her missing niece for years.  She gives Charlie a mysterious package (that he can't open) and sets him on his journey that will change everything in his world.  As it turns out, Charlie is one of the descendants of the Red King, a mysterious person who had wondrous magical powers who went into hiding.  The Red King's children have been equally divided between good and evil ever since.  At Bloor's Academy, Charlie finds friends and enemies, and the challenge of his lifetime as he tracks down secrets others don't want revealed.  Jenny Nimmo is the author of five books in the Charlie Bone series and has written several other children's books and fantasies.  Many people compare Charlie Bone to Harry Potter, and that's a good comparison.  But the two series are different.  Harry's family is really non-supportive, but Charlie has a loving mother, a doting grandmother, and Uncle Paton, who turns out to be something of a hero.  The book is a fun, fast-paced whirlwind of mysteries, magic, and friendship.  Even at 400 pages, it feels like it's over much too soon.  There are a few jarring instances where the point-of-view was disconnected, moving from one character and one scene into another without warning.  They were easily overlooked due to the pacing of the story, but noticeable all the same.  Fans who are waiting for the next Harry Potter book who haven't tried the Charlie Bone series are encouraged to do so.  Charlie's story, although similar, has much to offer in reading excitement 
 Hitler read this book and Mussolini knew it by heart.  Great book if you want to enter politics and control the crowd 
 They may have a new name, but their sound remains the same as before. Mixed with club-friendly beats and laid back drunken-style, the Liks have crafted the perfect party CD. Tracks like "Run Wild" (possibly the best track on the CD, certainly the most fun to listen to), "Sickness" (with Butch Cassidy providing some very tight vocals on he hook), and the Neptunes-produced "Best U Can" showcase The Liks' party appeal, while head-nodders like "Bully Foot" (with Busta Rhymes) and "Another Round" create a more relaxed vibe for the listener. The Liks also get outside help from artists like fellow Likwit-Crewmember Defari ("My Dear") and Kurupt (the cleverly-titled "Promote Violins"). Of course, Xzibit holds it down on his two tracks, "Bar Code" and "151". The only way this Cd differs from their last releases is the instruments, varying from violins ("Promote Violins"), trumpets ("L-I-K-S"), and even 40 ounce bottles ("40 oz. Quartet" skits). The thing you shouldn't expect to find is deep lyrics or dark productions (go grab Mobb Deep). However, copping "X.O. Experience" could be the best refreshment for this summer's heat. If you like "X.O. Experience", check out: "Xzibit - Restless", "Alkaholiks - Likwidation", "Kurupt - Space Boogie", "Eastsidaz - Ducez & Trayz&quot 
 This is a beautiful, haunting collection of stories about a part of the country I have no connection with, yet Blake brings me there, sits me down and says, "Look around." I didn't want to leave. Buy this book and read it again and again 
 After falling in love with the Mrs. Murphy series I found out that author Brown has a "real life" as a bonafide novelist and a darn good one at that.  Brown's characters are so real that I wanted to join Cig in her out of this world adventure. Once again Brown masterfully produces an  unusual plot and story line that engage the reader. She carries through the story with skill to the very end. Very enjoyable!! 
 For more than half a century scholars and psychologists have been trying to see whether the practices and philosophy of Eastern religions and philosophical systems can be engaged with Western psychology. Some of the finest attempts at doing this have come from Ken Wilber, Roger Walsh and Frances Vaughan. To their number we should now add the name Harvey Aronson. I do not know him, but I read that he is a psychotherapist and Buddhist lecturer and this is one of the most comprehensive attempts to examine the basic differences and convergences between Asian and Western cultural and spiritual values.  This is far from being an arcane topic. Virtually every meditation teacher has been struck by the amount of psychological work that we need to do. Not just at the outset, but, as practice continues, many psychological issues tend to come up. Often people find themselves struggling with the apparent contradictions of being a Christian and needing therapy. Or alternatively of being a Western practitioner of Buddhism who enters therapy and then has to try and reconcile the apparent contradictions between a meditation practice that stresses the gradual dissolution of the ego and social inter-dependence, with therapeutic models that tend to emphasize ego-strengthening, autonomy and individuality.  The influential Chögyam Trungpa, founder of Naropa University in Boulder, talked a lot about meditation as therapy, but always said that meditation should be seen as an unconditional way of life rather than a form or medicine or healing.  The author's background enables him to expand on the subject in a way that only a few other writers have. In this book he focuses on the four central strands of the teachings of the Buddha: The Self, anger, love and attachment, and how these strands can illuminate and enrich Western psychological thought.   This is a well-written, clear and practical book that I recommend highly 
 Arthur is the coolest. My daughter loves him and the DVD 
 Here we have intrigue, adventure, excitement and even sex thrown into the book. Details are sparse, enough to interest and not to bore.   Still, Dirk Pitt's lines are a bit too smooth and clever, the bad guy doesn't evolve enough(even though the good guys are constantly moving against him, he doesn't defend and secure his base) and the ending was quite silly.   Yet, at least the action is good enough to make you want more. 
 My daughter is really in to Bob the Builder right now and was thrilled to get this toy.  It is much smaller than I thought it would be and doesn't really "do much".  After the first few days of playing with it, my daughter lost interest (but thats what kids tend to do anyway).  I think it is a fun addition to Bob the Builder products, it's just not as great as I expected it to be

 This razor is similar to the men's Gillette M3Power Razor.  It uses one AAA battery, and it vibrates.  One blade should last approximately three months in this razor.  It requires little or no effort to remove hair with this razor.  This razor can be used to swiftly remove hair from armpits, legs, or any other place a goddess can think of.  Thank God for goddesses 
 The collection combines the best songs from some of the great groups of the 50's and 60's.  I got all the songs I wanted, without having to find four or five greatest hits albums.  I generally hate Christmas music, but the fourth disc was also very good 
 Set in the aftermath of World War I, this study of 1920s society, with its elements of social comedy and satire, follows Nick Lansing and his wife Susy, through the highest levels of European society.  Though they have the credentials to be accepted, they are financially limited, always unsure where their next funds will come from. Nick and Susy have married for love, with the understanding that if either of them finds a more financially stable suitor with a long-term future, that each is free to dissolve the marriage. They spend their honeymoon year living in the empty European homes of their more affluent friends.  When they stay in the palazzo of Ellie Vanderlyn in Venice, early in the novel, Susy receives a note from Ellie asking her to mail four letters, one each week, to Ellie's absent husband Nelson, so that he will not know she is away.  Confronted with this thorny problem, which she has been sworn not to reveal to Nick, Ellie agrees, knowing no way around the problem, since she and Nick depend on Ellie's hospitality.    It reveals no plot surprises to say that Susy's deception eventually undermines her superficial but loving relationship with Nick.  Wounded by Susy's lack of trust and her deceit, Nick needs to get away.  The separate comings-of-age of Nick and Susy occupy the bulk of the novel as each, still sharing the extravagant lifestyles of their friends, considers whether to honor the agreement to let the other person go if someone "better" comes along.  Wharton presents their dilemmas clearly--their desire to experience the "good life," their belief that they deserve to do so, the lengths they are willing to go to make it possible, the conflicts they face between their latent ethical sense and the realities of their lives, the belated discovery that each has the potential to support himself/herself, and the growing awareness that life offers many rewards that are not financial.    Filled with trenchant observations about society and the frivolous behavior of those committed to remaining part of it, Wharton's novel draws attention to the conflict between real feelings and pretensions and between real goals and social expectations, presaging the novels of Fitzgerald.  A sophisticated and elegantly written study of aristocratic society in the twenties in Europe, this is not Wharton's most thoughtful novel, but it one of her best observed. n Mary Whipple  
 I had the book in my house. There are pretty grat pictures in it. Page 22 was the best page, In my thought. I'd recommend it for anybody who likes reading both fun and intresting stuff. This book is allowed me to have a birth 
 More acoustic and folk-oriented than Led Zeppelin's previous two efforts, but not lacking in attitude or craft.  Slightly underrated (if you'd consider a certified 6x platinum album underrated), but still well done.  Though not an absolute essential like Led Zeppelin 4, Led Zeppelin 3 is an excellent piece of work that is worth your time and money 
 This Movie ROCKS! It's worth the 10 bucks! It has catchy music, its got famillier actors, and It's got great HUMOR! i recomend this movie to any teen, or music, comedy, or movie fan. 5 stars on the nose 
 This book was first written as a series of unusual sermons that was a continued story, one chapter to be given out each week about what happened in the lives of various persons with different backgrounds and vocations, but all applied WWJD to every decision they made.  Charles Sheldon was the author, and he was the pastor of Central Congregational Church in Topeka, Kansas, and this series began in June 1896.  One of the amazing things about this book is that despite it being written over 100 years ago, the story still applies to this very day.  As you read it, you will find not so much that you travel back to 1896, but it feels like it was written for today.  What would Jesus do if He were you?  This book challenges the reader to consider the question "What Would Jesus Do?" in every decision in life.  It tells of different persons who after taking an oath to do that began to bear their cross as a Christian, but at the same time experience the Spirit's work in their lives and through their lives.  Though it is a story written by Sheldon, it could very well have been a real life story as well 
 Very good book! Can be used as a reference for practising engineers or as a Text-book in a class room at the Senior under-graduate class or in a Masters program. I used this book 25 years ago and now the 2001 edition is very well written and organized, addressing the 21st Century problems in OR. For Personal PC applications the CD is of great help for any one who want to succeed in Operations Research 
 Professor Maier does an excellent job of giving an accurate, researched  and detailed account of the end of the "first socialist state on  German soil". Although not a consummate expert on the subject and  certainly not a contemporary historian at heart, Professor Maier succeeds  in presenting a readable and fascinating book.  The text could stand to be  slightly less academic -- the long section on the nature of revolutions is,  in my opinion, a bit tedious.  Nevertheless an excellent account, certainly  the best one in English, for scholars and laypersons alike 
 This book is one of E. Peter's very best, and I know, I have read every E. Peter's book including those under Barbara Michael's real name.  The book is a clever satire and mystery rolled into one.  There are many Peter's  books I would happily re-read, this one tops the list 
 This most recent batch of RVG reissues (2/15 & 3/1/05) features some long neglected Blue Note titles, none rarer than this one, which has been out-of-print as a single disc for nearly 15 years.  Of the half-dozen albums that this edition of Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers (Art, Lee Morgan, Wayne Shorter, Bobby Timmons and Jymie Merritt) recorded in 1960 and early 1961, the sessions from August 7 & 14, which yielded "A Night in Tunisia" (see my review) and "Like Someone in Love," are the finest.  Indeed, enough material was recorded over those two dates for two LPs, and while "Tunisia" is generally considered the masterpiece, the selections assigned to "Like Someone in Love" deserve more recognition.  In particular, the title track, a beautiful standard frequently featured in the Messenger live repertoire, and Wayne Shorter's "Sleeping Dancer Sleep On," which is one of the truly great Messenger tunes.  The other three songs -- Lee Morgan's "Johnny's Blue" and the Shorter penned "Noise in the Attic" and "Giantis" -- further show the burgeoning writing talents of Art's frontline players, who later in the decade would be recognized as two of that generation's most gifted jazz composers.  Any Messenger fan who did not get "Like Someone in Love" in its original CD incarnation or via the now OOP Mosaic Set, would be remiss not to fall in "Love" now 
 Daniel Defoe, hot on the heels of "Robinson Crusoe" came under considerable fire when "Moll Flanders" was published. She was called immoral, when, in fact, she is amoral. Churches and universities could not understand why Defoe was fascinated with characters considered "low". The fact is, the public adored her and the novel. And it continues to do so to this day.  But, as I've repeated in other reviews, the Dover Thrift edition makes it even more of an attractive purchase. Well-bound and sturdy, it's the best thing you can do with the $5.00 you can spare in your pocket. And, if you're like me, and you have to teach this book, it takes a great financial burden on your already overburdened students 
 I have previously read every book that a fellow West Virginia Native by the name of Pearl Buck, Pulitzer Prize Winner, wrote concerning China.  I was very impressed by the accuracy that Lisa See utilized in her descriptions of concubines, status of family members, arrangement of marriages, and especially foot binding.  I have seen documentaries of elder chinese women severly maimed by this practice. I highly recommend this book to all women and men alike.  It is beautifully written...can't wait for Ms. See's next book 
 One of the very best introductions to how the modern world came to be -- at a high level of detail. This is political economy as it should be written 
 While I'm so glad I bought this great series. I'd like to know who's not so bright idea was it to have the set as double-sided discs??? Did they realise that the discs are prone to scratching??? As I have found out with another Dvd. I only hope that the remaining series are not in the same format, otherwise I won't be buying them.  I may have rated it 5 stars but I give it a minus 1 for the format alone.  
 Philomena Nolan is an abused housewife and mother living among Ireland's working class in Peter Sheridan's EVERY INCH OF HER. The highlight of this novel is Philo and what makes her tick. She's one of those characters who will warm a person's heart, leaving an impression upon the reader and making her very unlikely to forget.  Her circumstances in life are not great. She has just run away from her husband and children to seek comfort at a convent, pretending to be a single woman without children. She tries to talk her way into the convent by claiming she has always wanted to be a nun. The tattoos on her body as well as her large size and gruff attitude make them a little nervous at first, but the nuns take her in, at least temporarily.  Appearances are often deceiving, and it is so with Philo. Her outward appearance may be that of a tough, crude woman, but in reality she has a heart of gold. Despite her personal problems, Philo finds ways to make others happy. She's a wonderful nurturer, and although not all of the nuns at the convent warm up to her right away, she eventually finds her way into everyone's heart --- at the convent and anywhere she goes.  Philo has many vices. She's a chain smoker, and living at the convent means that no smoking is allowed. She sneaks the cigarettes with the help of Sister Rosaleen, a nun who takes Philo under her wing, despite the disapproval of some of the other nuns. Philo and Sister Rosaleen bond and become good friends and co-conspirators at the convent, making for some very funny scenes throughout the novel.  Philo's other vice is food. Her mother has taught her that eating will always make her feel better. So if she's unhappy, she eats --- and she eats a lot. As Philo's weight approaches three hundred pounds, it is safe to say that food is always on her mind. Sneaking in bacon and eggs in the middle of the night while the rest of the world sleeps, or eating a handful of candy bars to pass the time, is a daily occurrence. She eats all she can during the wee hours of the morning, and then sleeps the food off in the morning. It is her way of coping with the many worries of her world.  Her main source of concern is her husband Tommo. He constantly berates her in front of the children, and has given her a black eye or two. Yet, when Philo runs away from him and the family, he always comes back to her, begging her to return, telling her that he's lonely and needs her. When Philo runs away this time, she refuses to return, despite the fact that Tommo has gotten rid of the children and placed them in an orphanage. Philo knows that the children are better off without their parents, yet she misses them so much. However, she thinks it's best that she stay in the convent to keep her children and herself safe from Tommo.  In the meantime, Philo's life is now centered on the convent. During the day she helps out at a senior citizens center, where she and the nuns help prepare food. With love and inspiration, Philo performs miracles at the center, creating new life and energy among the elderly, giving them newfound happiness. She gets them involved in Bingo, with the help of Sister Rosaleen, as well as a crazy game called Blind Date. From here, a subplot emerges --- that of the love story of two elderly persons at the center, Cap Coyle and Dina Sugrue, who have known each other for decades but have been sworn enemies due to a history that involves Cap's best friend Gerry, who later became Dina's husband.  Philo's life takes on new meaning as she helps out at the Senior Center, visits her children when she can, and plays matchmaker with Cap and Dina. But once again, Tommo reappears in her life, and it's not good.  One cannot say enough about EVERY INCH OF HER. It is beautifully written, told with a touch of humor. Sheridan does a good job at describing life in the North Wall, which can be hard, but there are plenty of friends and family to help one get through the day. It is a tale of one person's desire to survive, to find happiness, and to overcome insecurities and demons from the past. Highly recommended.     --- Reviewed by Marie Hashima Lofton (Ratmammy@lofton.org 
 Although at times this book can be kind of hard to understand at parts, and you might have to read something over again its an excellent book.  My statistics teacher was very brief on everything and didnt teach the subjects well so i was doing terrible.  As soon as I got this book my grades improved completely.  I used this book to teach and quiz myself and did great.  Sometimes a couple questions from the books quizzes turned up on my teachers tests lucky for me 
 I don't generally like rock music, so i went for the single.  I would recommend that most people go for the album which is similarly priced.  Starlight opens with a great base line that really enhances the chorus.  The second chorus is almost James Blunt type beautiful in its sound.  The Main chorus is the disappointing part which is hard rock sounding.  This song reminds me of Stone Sour's "Through Glass", in that the best parts of the song is not the main chorus.  Instead of sounding acoustic like "through glass", starlight features a base guitar and a piano/keyboard behind the vocals.  A criticism of this song could be the higher pitched "whining" vocals.  Fortunately the singing is able to pull it off as he is actually a good singer.  This song's best parts are featured in the preview of the song, under there "Black Holes and Revelations" album here on Amazon 
 I've got a bookshelf full of business books.  I read the first few chapters of a new one, and much more often than not, up on the shelf it goes.  Not this time.  In a world of increasingly commoditized products and services, marketers continue to focus on building the brand...to differentiate, command premium prices, and maintain customer loyalty.  How come great brands are being sent to the graveyard faster and in greater quantities than ever before?  Lewis Carbone's got an insightful, provocative, paradigm-busting view of the world.  Sure, how customers feel about brands is important.  But, it's how customers feel about themselves when they encounter brands that drives today's differentiating value proposition.    He provides an easy to understand treatise on managing customer experience, chock full of real world examples.  You get to understand experience from the customer's point of view, as opposed to that of the seller.  He helps you look for those clues that make experiences good or bad, and keep customers coming back, or running to the competition.  Anyone who is responsible for helping to build the top and bottom line of products, services and companies can't afford not to read this book.  Or, put it in your bookshelf unread at your own risk 
 I've owned this on laserdisc for a few years and am anxious to receive my DVD copy.  This is a concert/documentary of a bluegrass festival in the early 90s.  Great footage and quality sound by the likes of Peter Rowan & band, Doc Watson, Ralph Stanley & band, Del McCoury, and many many more.  I'm glad to see more bluegrass available in this format.  Pick this one up, you'll enjoy it 
 This book completely captured my almost 6 year old daughter's attention.  We had to read it to her at least twice daily for several weeks before she'd let us read another book.  She liked it so much that she finally started trying to read it herself (with our help).  That is the first book that has caught her attention long enough to cause her to want to try and read.  We will be buying more books by this author in the near future 
 I found this book of approximately 130 pages absolutely fascinating.  While it is very non-traditional, it provides a bridge that helps the modern person to relate some of the most important concepts of Buddhism through the bridge provided by Western existentialist thought.  This book is very well written and Stephen Batchelor is very credible as an author having spent considerable time in Asia and having been a monk for 10 years in both the Tibetan and Zen traditions.  While the book is largely his own perspective, it is a valuable one given his life experience and ability to convey complex topics in easy to understand terms.  It certainly got my attention!  If you are looking to read your first book on Buddhism or Existentialism, this is probably not for you.  However, if you are familiar to one or both of these topics and/or are looking to understand the human condition more deeply, then you will not be disappointed at the ideas presented here.  For me, this was a two sitting book that completely engaged me.  I have read many books on Buddhism and Existentialism and thought this had a lot to offer a modern person in terms of making Buddhism relevant to modern contexts.  I also found it a useful and sensitive exploration of the nature of loneliness and the limitations of the human condition.  Among other things, it poignantly expressed how loneliness and the reality of our ultimate death could help us deepen our experience of reality through relationship and fuller engagement with life

 My 12-yr old son read this book for a report. He didn't complain too much and finished pretty quickly so I guess he liked it.  
 I think it's high time the classics were brought back. Too often these feminists classics have gone out of print, and not available to younger generations. It's as viable today as it was in 1984

 I just returned from a solo trip through China and the Frommer's Guide was an excellent reference for both planning the trip before I left and for exploring the areas while I was there.  The information provided in the beginning of the book ("Best of China" "Planning your trip..") helped me to focus in on what I wanted to see and how I could best do that, while the city sections provided a wealth of useful information on neighborhoods, orientation, and fast facts for the area.  The bi-lingual listing of accomodations, attractions, etc. came in handy several times with taxi drivers and helpful citizens (I tore pages out of my book at each city visited to travel lightly. I especially enjoyed (and used) the highlighted sidebars (i.e. "A Great Hike on the Great Wall"  "To Cruise or not to Cruise") as these messages were especially timely in light of what is happening now with China's rapid development.  These sections, and most of the information in general, I found to be objective and true descriptions of what I encountered in China.  The book, of course, was one of several tools (including internet postings, site reviews, transportation schedules, reading other books, learning a few Mandarin phrases, etc.) that helped to create a successful trip full of wonderful memories; however, after doing lots of note taking and reading from the other sources, it was an easy choice to make Frommer's the only book that made the cut as part of my carry-on.  I was never disappointed and I'd recommended it to other travelers...Happy Journeys : )  
 This is a good movie don't get me wrong but it was a real let down. This was not as strong as the first 2 of the trilogy. The one thing we do get to see is the downfall of andy laus charector both mentally and profesionally. The movie shift to much from the past to the present that you start to whish that they stayed in one place for one second so that you can get a grasp of what is going on. This is like the godfather the first 2 are a masterpiece but the 3rd part even though it is good it leaves you dissapointed by the way it turned out in the end. If it was not for the great performances from everyone this would have gotten a three star from me 
 I agree with the other reviews. This is a terrific book. Great songs with the best type I have seen - very readable.   One note of caution: If you are considering the Just Jazz book with this one be aware that some tunes are repeated in both books so look before you purchase both to see if the tunes you want are repeated 
 Retro? Yeah, right.  As if there were anything but.  The titles are amusing enough, but the lyrics to "From Time To Time" are so punningly religious/secular the song practically wears beads.  And the aching ballad "Only Now" outdoes even itself when it (look out) comes to the afterglow of seduction ("Crown Of Creation" indeed, and where IS that incense. . .).  "I Don't Know Where It Comes From" either but I'll bet it disappears down the ol' "Endless Road" for the next "1000 Miles" or so in search of that elusive "Magical Spring."  Or butterfly, or whatever.  Yup, a bona fide winner here, even better than the great Going Blank Again only, like,  mellower.  When the smoke clears this'll still be spinning and so will you 
 This is AMAZING!  Fabman, as he is known to many, has outdone himself.  Informative, well produced and worth every penny of the price.  His book is a MUST have 
 This is a great overview of evolutionary thought and history. The chapters are some of his past works improved upon. He explains why there has been such trouble between evolutionists, and shows many mistaken ideas presented by Dawkins and Gould.  I would recommend this book so the reader might correct any incorrect information he might have picked up from someone not as knowledgeable about philosophy/Biology as Mayr. He clearly presents his ideas with better force than many authors of books on Biology. Perhaps you may also gain more respect for Biology apart from Chemistry and Physics.  I would also recommend his book, What Evolution Is, because he covers a lot of things in much more detail than in this newer book -- due to a broader overview in the current title 
 I have read many grammar books over the years, and this is the best of them all.  It was originally published in 1965; but since the English language changes very slowly, 99% of the book is still modern and accurate.   This may be the only book on grammar you will ever need 
 No, I'm not a salesman for Macworld -- at least, they're not paying me anything for being one.  I only know, as an owner of Macs for over 25 years, that Macworld will repeatedly show you how to do things that (1) you always wanted to do on a Mac, and (2) you didn't know you could do on ANY computer.  See, a key reason you're buying a Mac is that it makes it possible to do so very many things easily that a PC either can't do or makes very difficult.  Right?  Well, as easy as Macs do make most things, there are still a lot of details that can be hard to absorb quickly when you're just trying to make things work.  Especially when you feel as though you could erase something vital accidentally with just the push the wrong button.    MACWORLD GETS THAT, and has LOTS of easy-to-undertstand articles on how to reduce your fears, get things done, and even  simplify the processes in the long run.  Plus, they have a website, where you can look up past and side articles that pertain to exactly what you are trying to do.  In addition, as a new Mac owner, you'll find that there are tons of outside companies -- large and small -- that make software and peripherals for Macs.  Most are very good, but some are so geek-centric that it can be hard to understand whether what they have to offer is beneficial to you or just more crap on your system.  Macworld is very smart about helping you understand which ones to pay attention to and which ones to avoid.  Lastly, I suggest you think of Macworld as you would a guide to your favorite hobby.  That is, it's likely to have a lot of information that you know, but it will also constantly update you on aspects that you don't.  Plus, since new products come out constantly for the Mac, it will also keep you up-to-date on what's available that may or may not make sense for you.   In the long run, I predict that you'll soon find a Macworld subscription to be one of the cheapest (and most valuable) investments you've ever made.  And good luck with your new Mac.  Welcome to the fold 
 Once again, I was thoroughly entertained with a Michael Connelly novel featuring my favorite detective, Harry Bosch.  No matter how long ago the crime was committed, Harry will solve it.  Not only with his tenaciousness, but because he happens to care.  This well written, compelling story grabbed me from the beginning.  The twists and turns were spot on and the ending was oh so satisfying.  Great job Mr Connelly.  As a fan of your novels, you're at your best when Harry's doing what he does best...seeking justice for the innocent.  I love it 
 This was a great book...J.D. Robb always keeps you guessing until the end.  I would highly recommend.  Marge 
 If you have not already added this book to your collection, then you should do so now.  Someone recommended this book to me, and I have not regretted getting it.

 About 12-14 years back I was at the beach with a friend of mine and it was a grey, drizzly day to say the least. But because I love the beach, I was going to make the best of it no matter what. So I dug a body length trench in the sand, draped my towel over the trench I had just dug, laid down and closed my eyes and just began repeating quietly to myself, "Let there be Light...let there be Light..." I really wasn't going for anything in particular I was just repeating this line from scripture because I was in a good place, but I wanted to feel an even deeper connection to life.  And as I settled into a deep meditative state, I let go of the mantra I had been repeating to myself and just let myself feel Life within me and all around me. Ahhhhhh...I can still feel those wonderful, alive feelings. It was like my body was buzzing from head to toe.  I came out of my meditative state and sat up. During those 30 minutes of meditating, the grey, overcast day seemed to give way to beautiful, golden light. I had never seen it so bright. Everything seemed to be lit up from the inside. I turned to my friend and I said, "Wow...it sure did get incredibly bright out here all of a sudden..."  He looked at me like I had just flipped my lid and said, "What are you talking about?"  "The sun...it's so bright. Everything looks as though it is awash in golden light..."  Again with the look, "John...it is very overcast out. In fact, I was going to ask you if you just wanted to go home..."  And then slowly the golden light began to slowly fade from my sight and everything began to dingy gray. So where did that light come from? Was I just imagining it? It all seemed so real...  I had, what Maurice Bucke calls, a "cosmic consciousness experience". You see, the Light I saw was not coming from the outside, but from the inside and I believe that we have all had one at one time or another and if we haven't, we will...but please, do not dismiss the experience. Like I said, I had one over fourteen years ago and it changed my life forever. I am so glad that I just didn't toss it aside. I'm glad that I was given just a little glimpse to how things really are.  I believe that the whole universe is alive with Light...that in Truth, the only thing that is real, is the Light. Everything and everyone proceeds from this Light. But we forget. Oh, man do we forget. This Light remains deep in our subconscious minds. At a deep, deep level we know that we came from it, but we fall into a sleep...a trance...and we begin to think that everything is dull and leaden, mundane and ordinary...  This book will excite you in a very deep way...but again, you have to be open to it. I used to try so hard to get my friends' and family to share my passion for these things, but they weren't ready...and now I know that it's okay...now I know that they will have their own experiences of the Light. Maybe in this life...maybe in the next...I don't know when, but I don't need to know when...  This book fueled my passion to become more and more acquainted with Higher Laws. Not so I could escape this world but so I could be in the world but still know in the back of my mind and in the front of my heart that I am not of it.   If you are into metaphysics and spirituality, you must add this classic to your collection. It's amazing...but then again, so are you...   Peace & Blessing 
 At the time of writing, this seven-part series for slightly younger readers is up to its fourth instalment: 'Sir Thursday'. The other books are named 'Mister Monday,' 'Grim Tuesday' (can you see where this is leading?) 'Drowned Wednesday' (well done!) and future instalments are likely to be called 'Lady Friday', 'Superior Saturday' and 'Lord Sunday'. 'So Hilary, what's with the 'days of the week' theme then?' I hear you ask. These characters are, in fact, the 'Morrow days', and each are in charge of a seperate aspect of the Universe, or the 'House', as it is depicted by Nix: a great, sprawling, bizarre landscape which incorporates great deep pits, an infinite sea, a thousand mile square shifting maze and other odd features all frozen in a strange bureaucratic deadlock caused by the disappearance of the 'Architect'. If you've been following Nix's 'Universe-as-a-house' analogy then the word Architect can only refer to one thing: yep, that's right: the Creator, God, the Almighty etc etc. And she (yes she) is A.W.O.L. This has led to a right old mess, and it would seem that the only person who can sort it out is one Arthur Penhaligon. Arthur has to find and unite the seven pieces of the Architect's Will: a living text that has been split between the seven 'Morrow Days' to ensure they stay in control. And from there it gets even more odd. Its a work of pure, unadulterated imagination. Yes, its a bit weird, but so is 'Alice in Wonderland', and this work is in my opinion no less worthy of praise and attention. The books are unbelievable fun, and will leave you seriously questioning the nature of reality!

 Peter Gabriel has never been one to rush out albums, but he took his time in releasing the follow-up to his 1992 album US (which in turn was a follow-up to Gabriel's megahit 1986 commercial breakthrough SO).  To be precise, Gabriel took ten years to release his latest album, UP.  The question on everyone's mind upon the album's release was, "Was it worth the wait?"  Depending on who you ask, yes or no, but in my opinion, it was well worth the wait.  At first listen, it seems ironic that the album is titled UP, because it appears to be Gabriel's most somber release ever.  A little analyzation, however, makes it quite clear that Gabriel remains upbeat through the whole album, though he is clearly hurting.  Nowhere is this more clear than on the comforting "I Grieve", the original version of which was on the CITY OF ANGELS soundtrack; this version appeared in a very important scene from the fifth season of the hit TV series SMALLVILLE.  The song begins with a despairing Gabriel singing, "I grieve for you / You leave me / So hard to move on / Still loving what's gone".  But by the end of the song, Gabriel has - literally - changed his tune to one that is hopeful and determined as he observes that "life carries on".  Those who worry that Peter Gabriel has taken a path similar to the one taken by Sting need not worry.  Sting's albums have gradually decreased in quality - not greatly, but they've decreased nonetheless - and he has focused more on high-tech, electronic pop than the jazzy, emotional compositions found on his earlier albums.  The different between the former Police frontman and Gabriel, the former Genesis frontman, is that Gabriel has always experimented with electronics, and yes, he does continue to do so - but the result is very far from pop.  The only song that could possibly be classified as pop is "The Barry Williams Show", a song that seems to be universally disliked by Gabriel fans but which I actually love.  It's a charismatic, very amusing composition that really lightens up the album, if only for seven minutes.  That brings me to the album's only real flaw - length.  These songs are lengthy.  The last song on the album, "The Drop", runs about three minutes, but the rest of the compositions run anywhere from six to nearly eight minutes.  Ultimately, the songs are good that it doesn't really matter, but some listeners may be put off by the length of the songs.    And for the fans worried that UP has little in common with Gabriel's earlier work, don't worry.  The brilliant opening track, "Darkness", is the ferocious brother of "Intruder", the opener from Gabriel's third solo album.  A vicious explosion comes about 3/5 of the way through "My Head Sounds Like That"; a similar explosion was in "No Self-Control", also from Gabriel's third album.  Up actually sounds very much like Gabriel's earlier work.  The biggest difference - other than some technology, obviously - is UP's somber tone.  This is Gabriel's most grim album, but it's also his most heartfelt and one of his most powerful.  Most artists "lose their touch", so to speak, around the time they reach middle age.  Peter Gabriel is the rare exception.  The songs here are powerful, heartfelt, emotional, comforting, inspirational, and completely with pretentiousness, unlike Sting's most recent recording, SACRED LOVE.  Gabriel's delightful knack for creative and unusual arrangements still shines, on tunes like the tension-filled "Signal To Noise" and "No Way Out", a song dominated by a sullen bass line from Gabriel's longtime bassist, Tony Levin.  Throughout the album, Gabriel uses the metaphor of water to explain his feelings.  We know that he succeeds in doing so, because we sympathize with him and understand his remarkably positive message - "life carries on".  Inevitably, people wonder how the album ranks amongst Gabriel's immensely impressive body of work.  In my opinion, though it's not as good as Gabriel masterpieces like PETER GABRIEL 3 (MELT) or PETER GABRIEL 4 (SECURITY), UP is one of Gabriel's finest recordings.  It deserves a place alongside the aforementioned Gabriel classics, and that is truly a wonder.  No matter how much faith the fans placed in Gabriel during the ten-year hiatus from US to UP, who really suspected that the album would be this good?  But it is, and so with that I suggest that you give the CD a spin while those who have already done so anticipate the release of the next masterwork from one of the most talented musicians of all time 
 This book will have you examining your own body language and that of the people around you like never before.  The drawings are excellent illustrations of the concepts expressed in the text 
 It broke my heart to see anyone compare this masterpiece to a Disney film or a modern work of art.  There is NO comparison.  I first read this book 17 years ago and was so captivated that I could not put it down. I often wonder why Hollywood tried to reproduce this book at all, since not one single movie has ever come close to giving us a glimpse of all this book has to offer.  The ties and the love and the betrayal, the architectual detail alone, all of it make for one of the most profound works of literature ever written.  Please do not be spoiled by the quick reads that one is most aquainted with today.  Take the time to reaquaint yourself with this extraordinary work that will leave you heartbroken and amazed by the end.   
 Like the gentle, rocking sea -- this book gently opens your mind with each "wave" of insight from the author, wider and wider until you feel like you've ridden the tide of wisdom and have obtained some true secrets of life -- though oddly they feel like they've been with you all along and this book just reminded you of their existence.  I loved this book because of its imagery through words and the delicate touch of the author to balance hard truths with beautiful surroundings to arrive at some very valuable life lessons. Would highly recommend this 
 I have a slow thyroid and NOTHING could help me lose the 15lbs I gained because of it.  I always looked 'puffy' in the face, and legs.  My blood pressure was high as was my cholesterol.  I exercised everyday and still no change.  I didn't overeat either.   This book helped me find a resource to do the proper lab testing (ELISA/ACT) test to see what foods I was reacting to.   I also had a fantastic doctor who agreed to draw my blood for this test and he was curious to see what they would find.    Lo and behold when I got my results back I was shocked!  Everything that I showed a sensitivity to (from mild to severe) were all the things I LOVED and CRAVED to eat on a daily/weekly basis.  In order for me to lose weight, I had to cut these foods from my diet.  They were causing inflammation which is linked to the host of health problems I was having, including my slow thyroid.  I elimated the 'NO' foods and the weight came off so easily.  Not overnight, but steadly.  I didn't have to weigh food, count calories or do anything complicated - I just had to stay away from the foods I had sensitivity to.  THAT was the hard part, to give up things I was used to eating all the time.  But since I knew what I couldn't have, I realized there was still a bunch of stuff I "COULD" have!  You can very well do the diet without the lab testing, but it takes some willpower and journaling and I just didn't have the resolve to do that.  I wanted to know NOW.   When I went back to my doctor he was amazed.  The puffy look in my face and legs was gone.  Blood pressure and cholesterol was great!  Best of all my food cravings was gone.  He was glad that he didn't have to put me on meds.  Best thing for me was all the compliments.  I also felt much more calm instead of anxious all the time.   I think for those on the fence about this book, do an internet search on 'inflammation' symptoms.  If you have the diseases/health problems associated with inflammation AND you are overweight and nothing works...this just might be your answer.  It was mine!          
 This is a great toy for teaching little ones cause and effect. We got it for my son at 6 months and he's loved it since the very beginning. He figured out two of the buttons right away and was able to trigger them himself, unlike similar toys from other companies which are much harder to trigger. He was so excited to see the animals pop up and hear the music when he pushed the little lever or pulled the little ring. Now, at 16 months, he still plays with it sometimes, and know the animals and their sounds. Overall it's a great toy that will last your child a long time 
 I love old Cary Grant movies.  Great to watch and entertaining.  Can also watch with my relatives and won't be embarrassed 
 The Ladies of Covington return in a book that you can't put down until you are finished.  The ladies have returned to their new home and decide to take a cruise.  They learn much about each other and their own selves and return home looking forward to many pleasant things - the birth of Hannah's grandchild for one.  Without telling the whole story and spoiling the reader's enjoyment, I would say that this book shows how conflicts are resolved, how everyday things bring joy and how the ladies learn to "count their blessings."  
 I actually think this 2001 low-budget, indie film has a quirky charm that's hard to resist, and credit goes to director/writer/editor Brad Andersen's singular filmmaking style. It's ostensibly a contemporary love story between two misfits, but he laces the plot with science fiction elements that seem contrived at first until they start to affect the characters tangibly. The irony is that these far-fetched plot developments are what make the movie resonate emotionally. The two people at the center are Ruby Weaver, a single woman with an unfortunate track record of enabling men to meet her lowest expectations, and Sam Deed, a stranger from Dubuque who may be either mentally ill or a time traveler from the year 2470. Ruby is immediately drawn to Sam's sincerity but when he confesses to coming from the future, she inevitably feels like she is recycling old behavior by trying to save him from his delusions.  It reminds me a bit of John Carpenter's 1984 "Starman" (where an alien takes the form of a woman's dead husband) and a touch of Hal Ashby's 1979 "Being There" (where an insulated gardener tries to make sense of the world around him). However, Anderson puts his own idiosyncratic stamp on the movie by making Sam's seemingly insane assertions credible and Ruby's attraction alternately frustrating and empathetic. The acting by the two leads helps considerably here. Suffering from premature Oscar ejaculation, Marisa Tomei has slowly recovered her acting credentials, and this performance is among her best as she dexterously brings out all the hesitation and vulnerability in Ruby. As Sam, Vincent D'Onofrio tempers his trademark intensity with a genuine sweetness that makes his child-like wonder believable. Holland Taylor effectively tones down her sassy persona to play Ruby's impervious therapist, while Tovah Feldshuh grounds the film with warmth and sensibility as Ruby's mother. The ending is clever with a nice use of stop-motion photography, even if it felt slightly derivative of the legendary "Star Trek" episode where Bones is stopped from saving a peace-loving missionary (played by Joan Collins, of all people) about to be killed. This one is more infectious than you may be assuming from the set-up 
 It's great that they are finally filling in this missing season. Too bad the first and third seasons are still only available with 3 episodes per DVD. Also,If there are 32 episodes in this set and 32 in the next,then it appears "Hoenn Alone" will be left out of both the Master Quest And Advanced videos. That's too bad as it was an exciting episode and also shows the transition from Johto to Hoenn. I have one final suggestion-put out a set of the 'special' episodes that as far as I know have never been shown in the US.      
 how could you give it a low score? ok...it was a tad rushed. what quality for rushing! four cds...four REALLY GOOD cds...in a neat little box with a poster and booklet with info on every band! it's a lot better than the 'now' and 'totally hits' compilations on tv...pff, a few songs on one cd that millions hear on the radio every five minutes? but no...this is a week's worth of great goth listening that won't tire you out so quickly and is great for both fans of the genre and newbies who wish to distinguish themselves from the ninnies and mansonites that are popping up everywhere...and it's got bauhaus, switchblade symphony, red lorry yellow lorry, black tape for a blue girl, lycia, the shroud, brotherhood of pagans...all these great groups on one cd that you could blow 30 times this much money to buy each album individually! get this...you won't disappoint yourself 
 I love the band Various Artists. The make the best stuff! 
 What happens when your child is killed in a car accident by a drunken driver ? What happens when you have killed a child in a car accident when you were driving under the influence ? For one, the drunken driver goes to prison for a while which always seems to be too short for the victim's father. For two, the drunken driver develops a sense of guilt that makes him desire to die, to be killed, to disappear. For three, the drunken driver cannot develop a normal life because of this guilt that keeps him away from his forgiving parents, that prevents him from building a normal relation with anyone, particularly a love relation. For four, the father of the victim develops a desire to really take justice in his own hands, unable that he is to forgive, to accept the death of his child as an event that cannot be repaired by any action on his part. Gone is gone and bygones must be accepted as such. But even if you let the sleeping dog sleep, there is a this dog gnawing at your innards and your soul, perverting it, rotting it, destroying it, and all reason along with it. Then you embark into a chase after the killer and try to destroy him in his turn. You become kind of schizophrenic and real life disappears for this virtual mission that you think, feel and know you have been entrusted with by fate and suffering, some even say God. Vengeance is the word for it : an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a life for a life. And there is a perfect meeting of the sense of guilt in the killer and the desire to kill in the father. And yet, the film comes to a positive end, comes to forgiveness and repentance. This ending is very unrealistic. Vengeance does not know any stop, any limit, any mastering force because it comes from the deepest layers of one's instincts, impulses and drives, totally unconscious in its real motivations. Guilt cannot alleviate the suffering of the other nor the suffering of the drunken driver because it comes from the deepest ethical layers of the unconscious. On one side the desire to kill because the other has killed : a false balancing justice that is fundamentally barbaric. On the other side the desire to die because he has killed and cannot accept the fact and change his neurotic if not psychotic vision of the world and himself. Sean Penn just dreams of a way out that does exist in society, among men, for most of them, but is unrealistic when the two protagonists have reached their levels of derangement, because vengeance and unabating guilt are derangements of reason and the mind. Make it a mass reaction and you have a simple cause for war. The stronger will go at war against the weaker but the weaker will become the stronger because of his massive nature and of his sense of being invaded by some undeserved injustice. Never play with vengeance : it is no toy, it brings no joy, it only brings unwarranted death and unrighteous action that prompts the desire and the will to resist, to righteously defend oneself. Then it is a vicious circle going down into hell.  Dr Jacques COULARDEAU 
 Young 8-year old Hope Lavelle is out on a nighttime adventure to meet her very best friend, 8-year old, Tory Bodeen, a victum of neglect and abuse by both her mother and father.  Hope has every comfort of life and is the daughter of a successful southern family with a twin sister, Faith and an older brother, Cade (Kincade).  Sneaking out to meet Tory, Hope is murdered.  The story moves ahead 18 years and picks up w/Tory as an adult dealing with the ghosts of her past and present.  "Carolina Moon" is a very well-written story and will keep you fascinated until the very conclusion.  Supporting players such as Iris, Cecil (Tory's grandma and significant other) as well as Wade (her cousin), add amazing color to the plot.  Personalities are described so well you can almost see these people and feel for each in their dealings with life's turmoil as well as joy.   I would definitely recommend this book to all, especially Nora lovers!  It has murder, mystery, romance, and comedy.  What more could you ask for in a book 
 I love the charactors and love following there lives. like reading a soap opera from book to book. great fun. look forward to the next one. 
 First published in 1973, DANCE HALL OF THE DEAD was and is still considered among the best of Tony Hillerman's "Joe Leaphorn" novels, a series set on Southwestern Native American lands and following the adventures of Lt. Leaphorn as he investigates crimes on the reservation.  In this particular novel, Leaphorn, a Navajo, is summoned to Zunni lands to assist in a particularly unpleasant crime: a Zunni teenager's blood has soaked the land, but his body is missing--and so is the Navajo teenager who was with him.  As usual, Hillerman writes in a strong prose voice, and much of the novel's interest stems from his depiction of the character, traditions, and lore of Native Americans who live on the reservation.  Unlike some other Hillerman novels, the plot is fairly tight and does indeed live up to its description as a mystery--but even so the mystery here is remarkably transparent; even the most niave reader should be able to spot both killer and motive in the first quarter of the novel.  That is unfortunate--but still, Hillerman's expert prose and his portrait of Native American society make DANCE HALL OF THE DEAD an interesting, entertaining, and often informative read.  Generally recommended.  GFT, Amazon Reviewe 
 This is a fantasy novel about two magicians (and a nasty thistle-downed-haired fairy) written in the form of a true historical novel, complete with footnotes to clarify the text and/or "refer" the reader to other sources. It is, if it is your taste, a wonderfully droll and imaginative book. I say, if it meets your taste because a complaint could be made that, when those moments of magic-making appear in the "history" they too are done with the writer's option of simply stating an historical fact. Some readers might like the writing at these points to "soar" a bit more than it does with wonder and imagery as the writing would surely do in other more traditional types of fantasy. For instance, when J. Strange brings some corpses to life (to question them) the scene is (to make a pun) almost lifeless, as it would be in a true historical novel. Still that complaint aside, the book is thoroughly readable, very entertaining, and the many pages go by rather swiftly. Oh, one more thing, the type font on the paperback is small and it might be wiser for some to avoid the mass market paperback and obtain another version.    
 This book helped make my birthday weekend AMAZING. Instead of hanging out at all the standard tourist-y spots, we were surrounded by locals for most of the trip. This book made our trip, and next time we go somewhere, we're relying on the irreverent guide. (Restaurant guide was especially helpful, but the maps weren't so great...it took us forever to find Havana-but it was totally worth it 
 Read a few Ice-Climbing books, but found this to be the best of the lot in that it touches all the aspects of Ice-climbing- Equipment, Technique, Attitude, Ratings, all illustrated with good photos & tables. The order of presentation could be changed though, IMHO i.e technical stuff firs 
 Great bio.  I usually don't read bios, but made an exception for Chuck Norris and for Barry Manilow.  Also read Doreen Virtue's bio because it was included in one of her angel books.  That said, Chuck's bio is about overcoming obstacles and helping to make the world a better place. I wanted to read his story because I have always liked his movies and got really into the "Walker Texas Ranger" series.  I really liked the positive aspects and messages, and the included spiritualism, in the series.  I also liked the way the show included respect for and appreciation of the path and knowledge of the American Indian.  Chuck's bio was very interesting and uplifting and included his beginnings through the fairly current times.  There are also old through current photos.  It's great to read about a celeb that has his head on straight when you see so much tabloid stuff in the supermarkets.  It's also great to read about somebody who moves forward in a positive manner to 1)accomplish things, and 2)help others.  (No, I don't buy the tabloids anymore, but you cannot help to see the headlines when you're in line to buy your crabmeat in Maryland. 
 I read this book 30 years ago and have picked it up again. Ms. Smedley gives a first person account of her life as a revolutionary union organizer and feminist during a time when few women were allowed out alone! This book  had a profound impact on how i understand feminism, economic tyranny, the  right to organize, and solidarity among women 
 Inspired by a real-life incident of the death of a sea gull, this is hailed as the best written play by Chekov, The Sea Gull tells a poignant love story centered on literaray nonentity Konstantin's tragic quest for a burgeoning actress Nina.  Swirling around the country estate are characters  who reflect Konstantin's pain and suffering in their own harshly realistic  ways.  In this famed play, Chekov introduces a brand new form of literature  as to emphasize characters other than plot.  Instead of placing characters  beneath a steady frame, Chekov lets his characters guide the subtle  movement of the sad tale of devastated dreams and hopes. The dying sea gull  symbolizes the emptiness of defeat and further stressing the beauty of  life.  The fullness of being simply alive comes beaming with power and  touches life 
 Just wanted to say I have seen almost all productions of A Christmas Carol and read it many times, but I bought this on CD and Patrick Stewart as narrator is as good as it gets.  His beautiful accent, bold intonations where it's called for and delicate tones when the characters dictate make this feel like a play with a full cast.  Fantastic.  I usually sell or pass along my books on CD, but this one is a keeper to listen to around the fire for years to come 
 I came across this book through a friend and it seems like it was really a godsend.  Things with my husband had changed so much from when we had first married.  So when my friend handed me a copy of "Oral Sex" and told me that she thought it would help us get back on track, I thought I was going to read a book that would tell me all we had to do was have more sex.  Instead, the book taught me how to open up and talk to my husband about what I was everything I was feeling. While it took a lot of practice, my husband and I are talking now like we never did before.  More than anything we're having more fun than I can ever remember having.  I really applaud Dr. Paul and Dr. Freshman for creating the sort of workbook that should be handed to all couples after they walk down the aisle! 
 Just picked up a copy of this book today.  Covers everthing there is to know about Glocks and then some.  Very well written.  If you own a Glock or are just interested in them the run, do not walk to buy this book 
 With my newly revived interest in old and new, well-done comic books-slash-graphic novels (think ASTONISHING X-MEN, think SANDMAN, think WATCHMEN, think SUPREME POWERS),  I had to rush here to amazon.com for a copy of MARKED. I first saw it featured at novelist Chris Well's nifty blog. This re-imagination of the gospel of Mark sounded like something I should "taste and see."  It arrived on a Friday.  I read it the next Saturday, in one sitting. Loved it.  Why?  MARKED is clever. It's got attitude. It's got gentle moments of compassion. It's got strong visuals that mix a bag of emotions together and toss them at you. It's got humor. It captures the essence of what the evangelist wrote: a very active Son of God, a very troubled world, imperfect followers, even more imperfect antagonists, wisdom, courage, mercy, grace, death, and victory over death.   I recommend it.   I dare you not to laugh at mad-eyed John the Baptizer and the running headlines that cover the main events of that prophet's activities--even as you'll be horrified (rightly so) by the front page spread of his demise and its timeliness given some of our recent front page news. I dare you not to be thrilled at some really fine creative moments, such as the Gadarene's encounter with the Christ or the incident of transfiguration on the mount. I dare you not to feel ferklempt over the incident of Christ's meeting with the leper. I dare you not to holler, "Cool!" every few pages. And do tell me if you've seen the resurrection handled anywhere quite like this, ever. I haven't. I had to actually stop and ...STOP. No, really, I had one of those blank moments of, "What?" And I had to think. I like when creative folk make me stop and think. I like when creative folk stir things up. Steve Ross achieves this with MARKED.  The Mir's thumb is way up.   Side Note: You can also play, "Find the famous person" with this. Can you find a great black leader? Can you find the is-he-dead-or-isn't-he rocker? Anyone else?  Shameless Gift Suggestion: Christmas is upon us. If you have a comic book lover in your family, of if you know a reader who needs to be slapped with a zingy graphical gospel that will whet their appetite for a visit to the original, or if you just love someone and want to thrill them, get this as a gift for that person.  A slightly different version of this review with helpful links to an article with Steve Ross and to Chris Well's Nifty Blog may be found at: http://mirathon.blogspot.com  Mi 
   Rabbi Kushner is a very thoughtful man with a great ability to bring religious insight to the average person. I think this book is excelllent for anyone, regardless of one's religious background. 
 Punisher fans or not, I just got back into comics, and graphic novels are the way to go. This is a complete all in one story. Great characters, and story writing along with awesome graphics. And being a hardcover for only $13, I sure am happy 
 I must admit that I haven't tried out all the recipes in this book so far. But the vegan tiramisu is so outstanding, that even if it was the only tasty recipe, this book would be worth it!!! My non vegan friends can't believe it is made without dairy and request me to make it for birthdays and other celebrations. When I became vegan I thought I would never be able to eat tiramisu again, but thanks to Bryanna I can enjoy my favourite dessert again! I can`t wait to try the nondairy cheese fillings 
 This is a really good book that I had to purchase for my graduate level Haz. and Waste Management class. My professor, Dr. Reimers, is THE top man in the country for Activated Sludge use, etc. I thought that the book would be boring, but I really learned a great deal from it. We had to do select homework problems from each chapter (some of which our teacher required a lot of detailed answers for), which weren't that bad. Overall, this book comes highly recommended 
 This edition (the third edition, 1996) has over 6200 entries on 1640 pages! And no, I haven't read them all... This is really wonderful for those times when you come across a new term (whether a person, place or thing) and need some idea as to who (what or where) is being discussed, indicated or alluded to. This Edition, published in 1996, was put together between 1991-1994 and contains matters (such as the Near East) that were barely touched on in earlier editions. But never fear! - The centrality of Greece and Rome has been quite correctly retained. There is, however, a much broader (and self-consciouss) inter-disciplinary focus to this edition. Older readers will likely be annoyed by long bows to feminism, Marxism and postmodernism in some of the essays. Occasionally, the tone and 'politically correct' point of view of some entries can be a bit over the top. If you are either old-fashioned or easily annoyed (and you know who you are) it might be wise NOT to toss out the second edition... But even they might find some of the new 'thematic' entries - on disease, ecology, economy, imperialism, literacy, motherhood, and technology, e.g. - more than occasionally useful. There is even good news for the under-educated - most Greek and Latin terms are translated! But I would prefer that the Greek or Latin and its translation both appear; this compromise would likely satisfy both novices and experts. Unfortunately, the cost of including the original term and the translation would likely cause the publisher to balk. Now, Roman names will probably continue to annoy everyone. If, for example, one looks up Caesar one finds 'See Iulius Caesar'. Now, as I hope we all know, the Romans had three names (using Caesar as an example): Gaius (praenomen), Iulius (nomen), Caesar (cogomen). Pretty much no one, besides Emperors and writers, is listed under the cogomen in this edition - they are almost all listed by nomen. (No, Caesar is not the exception, he was never officially Emperor.) The change of 'Julius' into 'Iulius' is also annoying - especially after being assured (Preface, viii) that "the more familiar form [...] should be preferred." But with a work of this scope and length there will always be a multitude of quibbles and annoyances. One of mine is that I wish the tiny bibliographies that follow some entries were less brief. But all things considered this is a first-rate OCD that will inevitably, after a generation and a half has passed, need to be revised. But such is the fate of all academic reference works. - They are all such slaves to fashion! That said, the general editors, Hornblower and Spawforth, and the area advisers have much to be proud of; 4.5 stars, 5 if the 'politically correct' gestures are toned down and the bibliographical data following some of the separate entries increased.  
 Beautiful story!  I thoroughly enjoyed this work and all the other works of Janet Taylor Lisle.  I really hope this book wins the year 2000 Newberry Award or at least be an Honor book 
 This is a serious book, not a page turner, perhaps not a book for the young and optimistic who might prefer to look forward and meet hopeful young Siberians than to slowly unfold the memories of some of its older citizens. Nor is it a book for the lexically impoverished. I first encountered it as a full text audio book on about a dozen cassettes. I greatly recommend this slower-paced way of getting to know the book. Later consideration of the written text only confirmed my delight; this is an impressive writer who reconsiders his sentences and uses a wider range of the resources of our English language than many of us may be used to. As a result, he manages to give a precise and individual tone to each description, whether of the land or of its people, despite the similarities that will recur.  Don't expect a travel guide or an engaging host: the book gives little or no practical information and reveals little too about the author, except his obvious talent for drawing out personal stories and his pluck in venturing into remote and dangerous contexts. No, this is a serious book and, all in all, a terrific achievement, as its readers will begin to understand a most significant and oversized piece of the jigsaw of human history. Every serious minded person should know about this book and try to find time to read it.  
 jerry cantrell the songwriter of alice in chains layne stanley RIP who's alice in chains day were dark and sombre well don't expect any different with this album it's a full frontal album with great lyrics cantrell voice is great and the lyrics are superb this is the only jerry cantrell solo album i own i'll hopefully get some more soon, but as i haven't at the moment every so often i put on this album and remind myself of his genius and a masterpiece 
 Picked up this book, checked out the page length--475 ppgs.--thought to myself there is no Regency book left in the WORLD able to hold my interest that long.  I was wrong.  This writer-chick has MAD SKILLS and  had me at the first pass our top notch Alpha male threw at our bluestocking, virgin female heroine.  I know, I know, we've all been THERE before with these books but this author wraps us around her finger with great storytelling,just enough suspense/conflict, a variety of characters so we don't suffocate in the "ton", and delectable sensuality.  For once, the suggestion to just "lie back and think of England" is great advice!  Turn off your inner clock, readjust your reading pace to handle words/sentences that rival literary fiction and retreat to "the Continent"  for an attitude adjustment.  You might even let the "serving staff" off for the night too!     
 This book is a clear and concise guide to Critical Thinking. It presents subject matter in an easy to read fashion in a book that is not overly long. It was a great addition to my College English class 
 This story is really weird and cool, and listen to all the disgusting, scary, exciting words through ears, I think, is much better than to read them. I loved these tapes!! 
 In this world of changes we must know our next future. This book brings us these informations. Garten handles a torchlight to the future of the world and organizations.   It is surprising how he connects the wires and alll we  have to do is just follow the line of the words.  Undoubtfully is a great  book 
 I absolutly love this book.  I read this book for the first time when I was in elementry school.  This book continues to be one of my all time favorite reads ever.  There is so much imagination put in this book and the characters develop tremendously throughout 
 I COULDN'T WAIT TO FINISH THIS BOOK. IT STILL SEEMED TO ME THAT THEIR WAS SOME REASONABLE DOUBT ABOUT THE ABUSE, BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT NANCY KILLED HER HUSBAND. I FELT SORRY FOR THEIR 2 SONS. WHAT A HORRIBLE SITUATION TO GO THROUGH. I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE. 
 I have them all,...1st editions which are probably worth nothing, because his publisher knows he can write too. In my house, for mainstream writing, there are only a few authors worthy of buying EVERY book... Grisham is the only one my wife (she of more like Oprah's club fandom) and I agree on. We fight to see who gets to read Grisham's book 1st. Read them all...outside of Brett Favre and Steve McNair, this has to be Mississipi's best statesmen. Keep it up Joh 
 Blues for the Red Sun is definitely the best Kyuss release out of the three available.  This CD is definitely a must have for anyone who closely follows Josh Homme's music.  This CD also has Nick Oliveri playing bass which is always cool.  Though Kyuss is not quite as innovative in its musical sound as Queens of the Stoneage it is still a very solid rock album and one to be proud to have blasting in your car or stereo at home.  So if you sick of MTV "pop" rock, and like queens of the stoneage, or are a fan of the older style of rock, then pick up Blues for the Red Sun and see how rock is done in the Arizona desert 
 This 1GB mp3 player has it all and everything works. It's light, reliable, durable, and simple. The song organization is intuitive with music stored in folders that can be played randomly or in order. You can easily switch between play modes even while it is strapped to the included armband and the microphone works well. My one complaint is that the software allows the user to store media without using the smart storage option and this can cause the player to malfunction. If it were waterproof it would be perfect 
 An excellent book of reference for owners/would-be-dog owners.  I had checked it out at the library and decided it to be a must have on the shelf 
 Service was excellent and prompt. The book arrived in excellent condition. Triple A-OK satisfaction on our part. Thanks 
 Ideal for anyone who has been double-crossed by an ally and seeks retribution 
 This is the last cd done by JOURNEY with Mr. Perry as lead.  It still has the magic that everyone who love Journey and Mr. Perry love.  the track "When You Love a Woman" is just pure magic. While listening to this song you can see a motion picture form in you mind about what Steve Perry and Journey are trying to do. Show that love changes everything you see things from your loves eyes not just your own. and this comes through with the music and the vocals. It makes you want to fall in love again and again. Love the rest of the cd.  Miss the music and the magic of Journey. Waiting paitently and hopeing for a come back by Steve Perry. 
 Great book for revision, though not a single source for all you need to know for the exam. Good indication of which concepts are important.  I recommend it highly if you have studied from many other sources, and need to put everything together. 
 I never thought I'd see the day any rap music came out of Landover, MD let alone an album this good.  Usually the music coming out of the DC area tends to be thugged out/pimp/playa music.  I bought this to support talent in my area and expected to hear more of the same, but I wound up being totally surprised.  Lyrically, Kev could use some tightening up because he lets the many guests outshine him on the mic.  I think his stronger suit is his production.  You can hear the influences of Pete Rock, Jazzy Jeff, and J Dilla.  He definitely has a future in the rap game as a producer on the rise.  My only beef is that a lot of the beats sound alike (bass heavy, soulful, laid back joints).  The production isn't bad, in fact it's damn good, but Kev doesn't switch it up much, so a lot of the album sounds like one really long song.  Don't let that sway you though, this is a dope album.  I Do What I Do is going to satisfy the ears of any rap fan.  Even though the sound doesn't chage gears often, the album is still strong enough to warrant a purchase if you don't have this already.  Kev Brown definitely has a sound that needs to be heard.  I recommend checking this one out.  Standout Tracks: Hennessey Pt. 1 feat. Kenn Starr, Work In Progress, Say Sumthin' feat. Kenn Starr & Quartermaine, Hennessey Pt. 2 feat. Chronkite, Eric Roberson, & Wayna, Beats 'N Rhymes feat. Phonte & Oddisee (My Favorite), Hold Fast, and Alone Agai 
 This book has stunning and well-done photos of the Vatican. The author had priviledged access to many areas that other photographers have not had.  This book really shows you the history and beauty of the church's founding  place.  Well worth a read 
 This game is Shrekalicious. It rules!! It is even more fun than the original. Operation Shrek is definately worth the money. I've had tons of fun playing. People of all ages will have a blast playing this game. Rock on!!!! 
 Call it nostalgia...I really liked this movie.  It was dorky then, and it's dorky now, but it's fun 
 I have studied symbols and observed them in my life for over 30 years, and at latest count own over 20 books on symbols.  Unfortunately, after I had obtained about five of them, the succeeding ones became mostly just 
 The book gives a good overall insight into how opals are formed, types of opals, where they are mined, how they are mined and many stories surrounding opals and opal miners.  It was informative and entertaining.  Would have liked to have seen a little more information that would clue you into how to select and price black opals 
 This is some of the best French Roast coffee! I really enjoy, the taste, aroma and color. I highly recommend this coffee to anyone who wants a great cup of strong, dark, coffee 
 I'm a pretty young shaver and I've only had 1 other electric razor to compare with this, so I can't really speak from a lot of experience. My old shaver was a bottom-of-the-line norelco that simply tore my face to shreds. There was none of this 30 days to adjust thing, it was just always an uncomfortable shave.  Now that I'm shaving more frequently however I thought I'd get a decent one and this Panasonic is great. I have a fairly sensitive face but I think my beard only needed about 4 or 5 days to fully adjust. Even if the razor is dry, it shaves very close and doesn't irritate my skin.  Unless I'm running late I usually use some EDGE gel, which works like a dream with this razor.   I kind of would have preferred maybe a stand or a small cut in price instead of the nosehair trimmer, but that's just a minor gripe.  If you do get this razor though, make sure you clean it after every time you use it. All you have to do is squirt some liquid/gel soap on it and turn it on and then rinse it off. There's very little effort involved and because the replacement razor heads aren't cheap, it would be in your best interests to just get in the habit of cleaning it 
 I was having pain in my feet because of other flip flops not supporting the arch.  Foot pain has gone away.  ..so has the pain of finding a bottle opener.  Very comfortable.  
 This book by Roger Fisher and Daniel Shapiro has rightfully won a prize offered by the International Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution for the best book on negotiation. The book focuses on the important role emotions play in negotiations and offers a practical framework for dealing with them constructively. Throughout the book Fisher and Shapiro present recognizable examples, ranging for day to day situations we all encounter to political negotiations with huge impact for millions.   For me, the most interesting part of the book is were the authors explain five core concerns -- appreciation, affiliation, autonomy, status and role -- and their effect on decision making. They provide sensible advice on how to use these concerns as levers to keep negotiations constructive. Here is a quote from the book giving you an example: "Perhaps the most powerful way to soothe someone's emotions is to appreciate their concerns. There are three elements in appreciating someone. You want to UNDERSTAND the other's point of view; FIND MERIT in what they are thinking, feeling, or doing; and COMMUNICATE the merit you see." I think that is a terrific way to put it!  The content of this book is one thing that makes it worthwhile. Another reason why I like it is that it is exceptionally well-structured. I like it when authors do their very best to make it as easy as possible for readers to understand their core messages. Fisher and Shapiro succeed very well in this. 
 An awesome twist of detail, accompanied by shocking findings by Lorraine Page, a private investigator who surpasses all the other private investigators who have been hired by the ultra-rich parents of a missing  16-teen-year-old girl. In a last-ditch effort, Page is hired by the mother  of the girl. Page has her own black past and desperately needs to find the  girl to save her falling-apart private investigation business. That, she  does, and with a vengeance. The book is confusing at times, and the amount  of characters made me almost put it down several times because I had to  keep turning back pages to remember who everybody was -- that's something  you're not supposed to have to do in a good book. I'm glad I didn't stop  reading, because I discovered Ms. La Plante to be one of the top mystery  writers I've seen after finishing this book. A prime mix of sex, blood and  glamour 
 Until I read this book I had only got some half-baked ideas about Gen Patton. In this well written Biography he comes across as a caring  and extremely able General. His tactical brain must have been probably the best in WW2. The speed with which he got things moving is exhilarating, and one can see why the Third Army worshipped the man. His untimely end left unanswered questions - what if he and Gen Macarthur had handled the Korean Campaign together? A wonderful read and one which I thoroughly enjoyed, and recommend. 
 I loved the movie Cry-Baby. Alright, maybe a lot of it was because of Johnny Depp (how could anyone not love him?). However, I am also a big fan of music, and at the time I was very impressed by the quality of Depp's voice. However, it should be made clear to anyone before buying this soundtrack that the actors onscreen are lip-synching. The artists onscreen are separate from the artists singing. Now, this shouldn't be any reason to not want the CD, but I must admit I was a little disappointed.   Just thought that should be cleared up.  Anyway, the actual quality of the music is great. There are 18 tracks total in the soundtrack, among them such lively numbers as King Crybaby, Sh Boom, A Teenage Prayer, Please Mr. Jailer, Cry-Baby, Teardrops Are Falling, and Cherry (most of the CD, really). The voices of the artists very much go with the acting in the movie, so in a way, I was even more impressed when I found out that the leading couple wasn't really singing. I would very much recommend this CD, especially if you are also a fan of Grease (elements from the music are similar) 
 This book is good, has it's fair share of excitment and adventure, but it being a classic does have it's boring moments.  These are the periods that just drag on and on with description or with attempt at building anticipation.  This might just be a problem to me because I have grown up in a day and age where the build up has to be darn good to keep the population's attention.  All in all, because of it's classic status and it's effect on literature and movies about pirates, I would definatly recommend this book 
 Microbiology and Immunology is another quality review guide molded in the line of the other Board Review Series books.  While all the required information for the boards is presented, little is in sufficient detail for  course exams.  However, this book is a good reference and guide to help  steer your studying in conjunction with a larger text 
 Read it!  As with Dirk Pitt and Al Giordino, there's a new dynamic duo in town, and one of them is older than the sun. (every pun intended) DuBrul does a fantastic job with developing the characters; their depth and frailities, charisma and understanding. The tale weaved, bested by the intense character exposure and interaction.  Maybe DrBrul will write a christmas story one day as a follow up.  Maybe even a short story. I have a feeling it would be one heckuva party! Medical doctors should beware, however, because there's an 80 year old, chain smoking, hard drinking hero that absolutely steals this book. I give DrBrul a "thumps up" for scoffing at the politically correct nonsense that has pervaded the current conscious.  Harry - keep drinking, smoking and stabbing bad guys with your cane; it makes for an enjoyable read 
 Yes, After School Specials.  This is probably one of the shows that is better on VHS because the worn tapes because so much funnier given their low production look and feel.  Given that, it's one of the funniest shows ever because, like all sketch comedy, it goes too far, but it's satiric aim is dead on.  The only reason this series didn't take off is that it's dramatic effect is so arcane that many who see it for the first time will  be shocked, or disgusted by what they see and not watch it again. Well, even those who like the show are sometimes shocked and disgusted, but the show more than makes up for it by being absolutely hysterical and featuring performers who can improvise on a dime and have wits like razors.  The same can be said of the writers.  When you combine these two elements you get a timeless show and this is the beginning.  Enjo 
 This is THEE best collection of V.U. songs in one " Greatest hits "  package I have ever heard ....contains a lot of framiliar classics with  a couple deep album tracks as well....BUT the real kicker is the PHENOMENAL sound quality of this disc !!!.....They REALLY did a nice job selecting and re-mastering all the songs.....I am a HUGE fan of V.U. and would have to say that this  disc is THEE one to pick up for an ' overview' of their work and the best possible sound quality on the market......you can't go wrong with this disc... worth the money.... 
 Bravo to Vicky Oliver for explaining the inside scoop on mastering the art of the interview. She does so in an intelligent and entertaining fashion. I found her recommendations to be witty, insightful and a valuable asset to anybody who needs to be able to persuade an audience, be it for a job interview or for that matter, anything else.  Abbe R.

 This is the Bee Gees at their best, during their dark early years.   New York Mining Disaster is about men trapped underground, coming to gripes with their mortality, I've got to get a message to you is about a condemed man on his last mile. the list goes on with wonderful gems. Holiday, I Can't See Nobody  Listen Listen and I Started a Joke. There's the classic Words  that I think is a perfect song. Massachusetts is a very touching song as well. 
 One book of three books I wish my own wife would read and listen to the advice of For Women Only, Dr Laura's Proper Care And Feeding, and Paul & Sandy Coughlin's Married But Not Engaged 
 The true story of the relationship between mother and son is told throughout this book, along with many helpful and insightful tools in spirituality. The heart of the book is a deep, unconditional love, which the reader can feel and learn from.   The lessons of letting go, finding inner strength, and finding balance in any dynamic relationship are some of the core things I enjoyed in the book.  Bennett's poetry and some of his essence is also captured in the extraordinary tale that he left for so many to learn and heal from.  A wonderful, healing, magical book 
 Here's another omnibus edition of Gary Larson's weird, wacky and utterly hilarious cartoons. To enter Larson's world is to enter a world where animals have meaningful conversations, bugs make their homes in nice suburban houses, flies fly planes etc, etc. Certainly not the mainstream kind of cartoon but for anyone who likes 'off the wall' type humour this is a 'must buy'. Absolutely hilarious 
 Early compilers of Shakespeare's plays classified this a comedy, but there is much tragedy in it. Later it was called a romance. Through irrational jealousy a king is apparently responsible for the deaths of his entire family -- wife, son and daughter -- by mid-play. Time is a character in the play and at his one appearance summarizes the passage of sixteen years. If you have an overy high regard for realism, you may not much enjoy this play, but that will be true of more of Shakespeare than just this one tale. I thoroughly enjoyed it.   I look forward to seeing it. I've ordered the BBC DVD and it's being performed at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 2006. These Cambridge School editions have the play's text on right-hand pages; they have summary, commentary and exercises, and vocabulary on the facing left-hand pages. As I read through the play, I'd read the summary, read the play text paying attention to vocabulary, and then read the commentary and exercises. Some additional, unusual vocabulary was only explained in the commentary. I felt I got a deeper understanding of the play than if I had just read the play proper.mmary, commentary and exercises, and vocabulary on the facing left-hand pages.

 I thought this cd was fantastic.  I mean, I loved the movie, but the cd is even better.  I especially liked the Malkovich Masterpiece Re-Mix done by Mario C and Spike Jonze.  It sounds like they took the original song from  the movie and sprinkled a little gold on top.  I also loved the Bjork song.   She has such a big voice for such a tiny person.  Carter Burwell's score  was great too. Keep your kids safe from Hollywood, buy this CD 
 This book helped me to get through a lot of problems I had in my garden. You can find the answer to over 1,000 problems in your garden including problems with vegetables, flowers, shrubs, etc.It is also very well  organized 
 Nora Roberts once more hits 10 stars with this trilogy.  If you love Roberts, this is one of her finest 
 I have just finished reading this book any can't say enough positive things about it.  Ms. Carmack's book is not a "quick fix" to help someone through the grief process of loosing a pet.  It is however, a book for anyone who has a pet, anticipates the loss of their pet or who is currently going through the grief process. Ms. Carmack candidly talks about her own personal emotions concerning the pets she has lost as well as stories of others and their pets who range from cats,  parrots, horses, dogs.  This is an "easy read" that will capture your attention from the start.  You won't want to put it down 
 Written by Marchette Chute and enhanced with illustrations by Grace Golden, The Wonderful Winter is an outstanding young adult novel set in sixteenth century London, about an orphan buy living with three ill-tempered aunts. When young Robin Wakefield finds a lost puppy, he acquires the resolve to keep the animal - yet one of his aunts refuses to allow this, forcing Robin to run away to the streets with his cherished new animal friend. Adventure, danger, and excitement ensue in this captivating tale which is enthusiastically commended to the attention of school and community librarians for inclusion in their fiction collections for young readers 
 I would recommend this book to children struggling with fractions, or even to adults who struggled with fractions when they were learning them as kids.  The author makes it about as simple as it can be made.  The only thing better would be to hire a private tutor.  If you go through this book one step at a time, and practice at each level, you should learn a lot.  I bought this book because I started a math club at my son's school.  I plan to let the children borrow it as needed 
 I'm somewhat of a new fan when it comes to Tom Waits. I've got a handful of his more recent releases (from Swordfishtrombones up to Real Gone) but I've got to say that from what I've heard this is my personal favorite with "Alice" coming in at a close second.       In "Blood Money" Tom Waits basically continues along with the mindset of "blow the minds of all the unworthy humans who happen across my brilliance" and does so beautifully. With songs such as "Misery is the River of the World", "God's Away on Business", and "Starving in the Belly of a Whale" showing off his trademark carny-bark vocal stylings which roughly sound like that of a human voice drenched in alcohol, nicely blackened by one too many cigarettes, and then tossed into a meat grinder. While songs such as "Everything Goes to Hell", "All the World is Green", and "The Part You Throw Away" give perfect examples of Tom Waits' ability to serenade you through bitter-sweet tales laced with just a dash of rat poison. And the whole album is concluded with my favorite song in the world "A Good Man is Hard to Find", featuring the greatest chorus ever written "A good man is hard to find/Only strangers sleep in my bed/My favorite words are good-bye/And my favorite color is red".     If you're a fan of Tom Waits and you don't own this record then you aren't worth much as far as I'm concerned. If you're new to Tom Waits you should get this album first simply because once you hear this you'll know right away whether you're intelligent (Love Tom Waits) or an illiterate fool (Hate Tom Waits). Believe me there is no real middle ground when it comes down to it.  Key Songs: Every Song 
 ...for discussion!  We recently used this book as a study guide for an adult education class at my church.  While Rossing clearly has her own agenda, and her own worldview (don't we all?), she has done great work here in exposing "Rapture theology" for what it is: mythology based on 170 year-old writings based on misinterpreted scripture, taken completely out of context.  Rossing has very little time for the ridiculously badly written "Left Behind" series (and if you don't believe her, or me...read at least the first book yourself... what garbage!).  She is, however, very concerned at the impact that these novels have had in popular culture.    At the end of the day, Rossing exposes rature theology for the heresy that it is.  For this, I thank her 
 Having twins we always had to write down everything, or we wouldn't remember whom we feed, when we feed them, or any details.  We used to keep a chart, but then I received the Itzbeen as a gift.  It is so much faster to press a button then to write everything down.  When we go out I just toss it in my purse and when the babies start crying I can just pull out the itzbeen look at the timers and figure out if it is time to eat or they are just being fussy. If the boys do eat or require a diaper change, I can record it easily.  no more carrying around a clipboard! I didn't give it 5 stars because it would be even better if it could track how many oz of formula the babies eat and if it could total the number of hours the baby slept. But still it is a nice tool for forgetful people.  I'm buying a 2nd one, so I have one for each of my twins 
 If you like this album you should check out Joe Sneva.  www.joesneva.com    I saw him when I was in Seattle. He's got a cool acoustic rap sound just like this album 
 "The Pythagorean Sourcebook and Library" is a fascinating entrance into world of the ancient ancients. My exposure to Pythagoras had been limited to his mathematical theorem taught in high school geometry. Kenneth Sylvan Guthrie excellent book brings the enormous range of Pythagoras' interests alive for the modern reader. Pythagoras' works in Harmonics, Number, Political Science, Education, and a host other important subjects were foundational ideas and concepts explored and modified by later thinkers. David Fideler's Introduction sets the stage for this modern, easy to read and understand translation that forms the substance of the book. Both the Translations and Introduction work to make this volume so appealing. Highly recommended for those who have ever wondered about those obscure references pointing to Pythagoras. A lover and student of Wisdom, Pythagoras claims the title First Philosopher 
 A must read.   This story is a combination of beautifully woven explosions of visual fantasy and reality. In an unbelievably adroit way, Veronica captivates us with an entertaining approach to make wonderfully comprehensible a complex and painful topic.   The complicated issues of growing-up-and-continuing-to-be-black are addressed as only Veronica can. Incredibly, using this abbreviated format, Veronica explores and brings to the fore the essential ingredients of racial divides.   Veronica's excruciatingly suspenseful climax slams the reader, privileged to occupy a front-row seat to a skillfully portrayal that  incorporates multiple stages of personal development - childhood through adult.   Wonderful and essential for all readers - at whatever stage or status in life. 
 i'm not typically the play-a-single-cd-on-endless-repeat-until-you-can't-stand-it type.  that said, this cd has not left my player for 3 months, and i have yet to tire of it.  it's like the godfather part two of folk.  
 I bought the product only for the sound track of te movie. I find the music in the movie fantastic, unexpected. With the time machine I discovered the writer of the music Klaus Badelt who wrote the sound tracks for other movies to 
 My very first Forgotten Realms novel and for that matter, my very first Fantasy Novel. I found this book to be a very good read, holding my attention to the very last page. I would definitely recommend this one. Now  I'm hooked on Forgotten Realms 
 People complain that too many Donna Summer hits compilations have already been released, but "Gold" offers the most comprehensive anthology of an artist who peaked - commercially, at least - a long time ago. Some of the real bonuses of this release include uniformly excellent sound and full production credits for all the tracks, as well as full or previously unavailable versions: the 4:57 edit of "Love To Love You Baby" is the best of the edits; similarly, the 6:28 promo single version of "MacArthur Park"; "I Feel Love" is finally included in an anthology in its superb full length album version; the fantastic 6:47 12" single version of "Hot Stuff" (not included even on the recent Deluxe release of "Bad Girls"); the definitive 5:49 full version of "State Of Independence" (for many her best-ever recording). Her later releases are rightly included as single or edited versions, and whatever you think of them, it's good to hear so many brought together; the Tony Moran edit of "You're So Beautiful" (first available on 2003's compilation "The Journey") ends the album on a high. A real attempt has been made with "Gold" to provide the best-possible summary of Summer's career, and for my money this is a great anthology for both fan and newcomer alike.   
 While I lived four years in Japan, I read many cultural books.  Most authors referenced the work done by Ruth Benedict.  It's my understanding that the military needed her ideas about the enemy to help win the war, and to effectively occupy Japan following WWII.      Japanese survivors from WWII have universally told me that American soldiers, following the war, were very kind, respectful, honorable, and helpful to the poor, defeated Japanese in their home country.  They seemed genuinely interested in getting Japan back on its feet, and today's elderly Japanese feel a great respect and indebtedness towards those occupying forces from America.      American occupying policy was put together fairly quickly.  Decisions were made, including whether and in what form the Emperorship should continue.  A cornerstone for guiding these decisions was Ruth Benedict's book, "The Crysanthemum and the Sword."        Steps taken and structures put in place by America in post-war Japan were consistent, well-thought, and extraordinarily successful.      As Americans, we really needed a Ruth Benedict to analyze Iraq and inspire our leaders to put together an occupying strategy there that would acknowledge the strengths of Iraqui culture and re-shape them for success.  Instead, we seem not to have a clear plan of who Iraq is or what to do with them.        How could we have done so well in the 40's and so poorly now?      Anyway, read Ruth Benedict's remarkable book and marvel at the skill of her analysis.   
 I have purchased several of Crane's humidifiers and have thrown several of them away: the crane, two apples.  I have 2 elephants and wouldn't buy any of the other models.  The elephants put out the maximum amount of humidity with the least amount of problems.  The only problem I have had is they leak under the snout to a small extent.    They are easy to clean and we run them 24 hours a day when we are home.  I would recommend them, but realize that there is some leaking and you need to put a towel in front of them.  I would buy additional elephants if needed.  
 I read this translation for a college class--and it was surprisingly entertaining.  Fitzgerald makes peculiar, often hilarious choices for this translation.  A particular favorite:  You now, for instance, with your fine physique-- a god's, indeed--you have an empty noddle.  Case closed.  Hilarious translation.  Some bits and phrases, though, seem too modern-language-colloquial, and it threw me off a bit in some parts, especially when it came down to analysis.  However, this is a very good translation for the typical ok-well-I'm-trying-to-read-the-classics reader 
 Marion Zimmer Bradley's The Mists of Avalon retells the matter of Britain from several feminine perspectives such as Igraine, Gwenhwyfar, and Viviane - but above all, Morgaine who is called le Fay, dedicated to the Goddess at a young age and heiress to all that is Her worship. The novel is often interpreted as Christianity versus paganism, which is an aspect of the story but not all of it. What Bradley explores is how Christianity and paganism exist side by side, how the Mists of Avalon are still there if only one can push them to one side to enter into the mystery beyond.  Bradley's elegantly evocative writing style, the glimpse of how it might have truly been create both a tantalizing and a soothing universe for the reader seeking to lose themselves to the fantasy. Bradley also does an excellent job creating a consistent world wherein mystery, love, tradition and religion intertwine the fates of so many.   
 Anyone interested in so-called gender studies, textiles, prehistory, or just in regular people ought to read this book. The authoress, in incredibly simple language (she can't REALLY be an academic, can she?), tells the story of women and the textile work that has (pre-) historically been theirs. Bringing the insight that only a practicing weaver or spinner could have to the dusty world of archeology, she sweeps the reader into the homes of real people. Lots of metaphors, but honestly, it's that kind of book: rich. I only wish I could read it again for the first time 
 Every time I pick up this book I get a new insight. This is the first book you have to read if you want to understand the PSF "arena". A professor at LPSF in Harvard expressed that he considered this book to be the first "Academic" source on PSF.  If you can, read all of Maister's books.  THANK YOU, David !!  P.S.: In only 3 months he has built the best web presence I have seen so far 
 Washington potrays a resilient and resourceful man in his  autobiography, "Up from Slavery."  With little formal education as a child, his abilities and outward accomplishments are astounding to read about. Tuskegee being the most well known, but not his only significant achievement.      Stripped to its barest elements, Washington presents a philosophy that those with character and industry will succeed. Despite deep racism and prejudice, persistence in an American form of opportunity can result in success over time, as evidenced by Washington's life.   Washinton makes no excuses and moves forward despite unfair and unreasonable treatment. 
 I have owned this book and its preceding editions for many years now, and I still the most used book I own. This is, hands down, the best recording reference guide avalible. This is must have for any engineer. If you're just starting out and looking for a book to help guide you, THIS IS THE ONE. You will use it book for the rest of your life 
 THIS BOOK NOT ONLY DESCRIBED IN DETAIL THE FINAL MOMENTS IN THIS "PERFECT STORM" TO ALL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED, MAKING FOR A VERY SCARY READ UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT, IT ALSO GOES IN GREAT DETAIL OF A FISHERMAN'S LIFE.  I LEARNED MUCH ABOUT THIS LIFE THAT I REALLY HAD NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT,EVEN AFTER SEEING THE MOVIE. ALSO AGAIN, WITH THE DETAILS, U FEEL AS THOUGH U WERE ON THE WATER, GOING THRU THIS MONSTER.  A GREAT READ! 
   In an era when some American citizens openly root for the nation's enemies, Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp character is a refreshing throwback to another era where no American would openly criticize his nation during time of war. Before, yes: after, yes - but not during.    Vince Flynn's novels are openly poltical. The author makes no secret of his preference for what some might consider traditional values like patriotism. In an age of moral relativism and news agenecies that refuse to be judgmental and refer to terrorists as "freedom fighters", there are some who consider Flynn to be unuanced. I consider Flynn to be one of the best thriller writers of the age.    In this eighth novel featuring Mitchell Rapp, Rapp is back at work for the CIA, handling the off-the-books assignments no one wants to hear about. Rapp is still recovering from the brutal murder of his wife by terrorists.    Rapp reports directly to CIA Director Irene Kennedy. His work is sanctioned by President Hayes and a very few others in Congress. Rapp has his enemies, though, and one of them has just been elected Vice President after a campaign in which the motorcade of the presidential candidate was attacked by a terrorist bomber. Presidential candidate Josh Alexander's wife is killed in the attack. The Alexander ticket wins on a sympathy vote. Vice President elect Ross is already planning to fire Director Kennedy and do a few favors for some people who helped get him elected.    The FBI, Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies have drawn a blank in finding the bomber and his masters. Rapp, of course, locates the bomber and, without bothering to read the rulebook, takes him into custody. Meanwhile, other information comes to the attention of CIA Director Kennedy that casts an entirely new light on the motorcade attack.    The capture of the alleged assassin becomes a hot potato as various political factions maneuver for position, some working in the interests of truth and others seeking to bury it. Politics at its dirtiest.    Flynn (and Mitch Rapp) paint a dark picture of Washington politics as the screws draw tighter and tighter. Rapp essentially becomes a fugitive, feverishly working to bring the truth out while political figures try everything they can to bury the truth - and Rapp. (Nope - no details. This book is too good to be spoiled.)    As is typical of a Flynn novel, there isn't a dull page in the book. Flynn doesn't need padding: he just keeps the action moving, page after page. If you're one of those old-fashioned people who believes in America, you'll be cheering. If you're not, well maybe this isn't the book for you.    The ending is, putting it mildly, disturbing. It raises many questions that most of us would prefer not to think about, but from time to time do when we browse the endless stream of news stories about corruption.    Vince Flynn has created a contemporary American hero in Mitch Rapp. In this eighth outing, Rapp is still a potent character. And Flynn's enthusiasm for protecting the United States of America at any cost is undiminished.  Jerr 
 Did not use in my assignments - other texts were necessary.  I believe it will be a good reference for first year teaching 
 The Harold and the Purple Crayon Series are wonderful.  Harold is a little boy with a round head (around long before Charlie Brown) with a little purple crayon and a big imagination.  In the North Pole book, Harold has set out on Christmas Eve to find a Christmas tree.  Along the way, Harold ends up helping Santa but needs to hurry to find a tree to have it ready for Santa's visit.  The simple line drawings are wonderful for younger readers yet there is always a charm to them.  Harold inspires kids on so many levels; he's great for children who are timid, he's great for the mighty little explorers and he's great for kids who like to draw but feel intimidated by other artists 
 Very educational and eye opening to say the least.. 
 The 288 pages of this book written by those in-the-know can really simplify our talks about sex, character and more with our children.  The "Ten Talks" book offers parents what they need to speak with their children, confidently, about these important topics and their relationships with others.  The information has been gathered from across the country and the methods have been time tested and proven.  It's difficult for all of us to begin and carry on the discussions that we must have with our kids, even for those who speak easily to large groups.  Our own "home-grown" group can be much more difficult to address.  In addition to the topics of sex and character, this book provides advice on safety, peer pressure, ethics, meeting people on the Internet, and messages received from TV.  It shows parents how to understand their own values and tells how to appropriately communicate them.  The information is useful for any type of family.  You'll learn how to get your kids to talk to you, which in itself is half the battle. Topics range from sex to honesty, respect, caring for others, sticking up for what you believe in, keeping promises, courage under pressure, and much, much more.  A very valuable family resource. Add it to your parenting library 
 This book is very easy to read. It contains a list of pointers for various kinds of situations and includes examples of dialogue you can utilize. It covers topics like dealing with forgetting people's names, and dealing with  nay-sayers and how to get beyond the motor-mouthed customer or co-worker.  Booher doesn't belabor any of the points, and that's a plus. She moves  right along. You can pick this book up and put it down and pick it up again  and not lose anything. You can read it 3 or 4 times and still get good  advice.  If you're able to put her suggestions into action, your  communications skills should be substantially improved 
 THE THIRD BOOK IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE FIRST TWO! I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SERIES TO ANYONE!!  GREAT BOOKS!

 I've been a long time fan of Delerium et al., and while I like this album, I'm not as crazy about it as I was about Chimera, Poem, and Karma (the rest of their albums can't really be compared since they're a different style for the most part).  In fact, at first, I didn't think much of it, but the more I've listened to it, the more I like it (I felt similar about Chimera, but I got into that album more quickly and thoroughly).  It's difficult to describe why I'm not as enthralled with this album - I suppose it just doesn't feel quite as "inspired", like Bill Leeb and his buddies are getting tired and running out of ideas.  In any case, if you're already a fan of Delerium, I'd recommend the album.  If you're new to the project, I'd say try Poem or Karma first, and then come back to this if you like those 
 For anyone who has lived in Japan, there are way way too many books that attempt to explain away what we witnessed as severe problems via complex cultural blah-blah about the "Japanese exception."    The great value of this book is to explain the corruption and autocratic impulses as the product of a rather straightforward politican machine - there is nothing exceptional that offers anything of intrinsic value beyond understanding it for what it was:  just a moment in time that a corrupt leader, Tanaka, was able to create a seat for himself at the center of power.  As Schlesinger argues, with all that power, the great failure of Tanaka was that he did so little with it in terms of serving the public interest:  instead, it just served him and his cronies.  As such, now that the machine has been watered down, many needed reforms are far more difficult to implement (and the need for remedies, after decades of neglect, is worse than ever).  This is the product of a truly intelligent and thoughtful journalist.  I knew him briefly in Japan, and was always impressed with his clear sightedness and willingness to question anything, in addition to his humor.  It is a great pleasure to read this book and recognise the original mind that I knew.  Warmly recommended 
 My daughter is 2 and absolutely loves Blue's clues.  She loves this dvd 
 One of the most popular sketches in the early days of "Saturday Night Live" was The Blues Brothers, a duo of blues lovin' brothers portrayed by Dany Aykroyd and John Belushi. The sketch became so enormously successful that when Aykroyd and Belushi departed the show in 1980, the sketch got a feature film.  "The Blues Brothers" tells the tale of Jake (Belushi) and Elwood (Aykroyd), The Blues Brothers. Searching for redmeption and trying to raise some cash, Jake and Elwood go on a cross country road trip to put back together their old band and earn some dough. In their wake, they leave a trail of chaos and destruction, and leads the cops on a wild goose chase to put Jake and Elwood behind bars. Hilarity, excitement and fantastic music ensues, and the reuslt is a classic comedy filled with great music and lots of laughs, not to metnion unforgettable cameos by soul legends such as James Brown, Ray Charles, Cab Calloway and Aretha Franklin.  This 25th anniversary edition is loaded with extras, and the film itself is one that belongs in all dvd collections 
 My son had a sudden onset of OCD at age 6.  There is a shortage of psychiatric care in my area and even more limited for children.  I had to get help FAST.  I ordered 3 OCD books from Amazon including UP AND DOWN ...  I read it to my son as soon as we got it.  He exclaimed that "He's just like me!"  My son doesn't like to read it often, but we do every so often to remind him that he's not alone and that things are usually pretty good.  Also, the character has traits that my son does NOT have and that makes him feel better, more in control 
 This is certainly one of Woodward's better efforts. I didnt find a "cheerleader" mentality for the administration as has been asserted by some.  I did find it extremely interesting on how Woodward was able to clearly delineate the differences within the administration on whether to go to war or not. Would have liked to have seen more on Rumsfeld, who I believe escapes closer scrutiny in this book, as to his exact role in the decision for war. I also think General Franks gets off pretty lightly on the failure of the administration to adequately prepare for the "end of hostilities" and what the exact plan for the occupation would be--per Colin Powell's State Dept's concern. Very quick read, and excellent insight (as usual) by Woodward into the inner sanctum of decision-making in the highest levels of government

 Love is something but when it has a foundation of lust and taboo, it is tragic and life shaking.  That's the kind of love that Michael Bergin shared with the late Carolyn Bessette Kennedy.  I would have done, or rather I would hope I have the tenacity and bravery to do what MB did and write down the true, honest and gripping story shared in "The Other Man."  This book is a great read because it feels like a long conversation with your little brother who you love and want no harm to come to.  When Michael Bergin met NYC and Carolyn Bessette, he experienced what only a few of us are gifted to experience: true love and passion and opportunities that are so much bigger and more powerful than ourselves.  If we are sincere and human, we ride such episodes until they saturate our lives and every cell of ourselves to a point that we are both surviving and fighting within these dreams.  I've been there, but I made it out.  Michael Bergin's love was snatched out of his life and although we mourned the tragedy, fate did his heart a blessing.  Carolyn Bessette was what we in the working class community call a PLAYA from the Himalayas.  Because she had that "whippappeal" Michael Bergin couldn't pull away even after she broke his heart time and again.  Needless to say, I could have continued to read this great story for a thousand more pages, but Michael Bergin has laid his last demon and dream to rest after 242 pages.  By the way, if you are an aspiring model or actor, this book will show you the reality of that life:  Michael Bergin only made $2000.00 when he was picked and featured as the Calvin Klein underwear guy. His Baywatch salary was only $30.000.  Sobering, piercing and extremely satisfying. Thank you, Michael Bergin for sharing. 
 I've had this handbook for 2 years now, and I still am amazed by the wealth of information it provides on every page. Information is well presented and concise; figures and graphs are clear.  Mechanical Engineering is an incredibly vast field, and hundreds of books have been written on any one topic. So do not expect to find the answers to your engineering problems, as diverse as they may be, within ONE book. BUT, as a handy reference, to review forgotten concepts on anything from logarithms to pumps to steam plants to automobiles to pumps, to look up data on pipe diameters, air conditioning coefficients, thermodynamic tables, vibration equations, tables of integrals, etc, etc ... there's no other like it.  Together with Machinery's Handbook they form the best reference combo a Mechanical Engineer a can have. Just remember, for your more specific needs, go to a book on that covers only that field 
 This is Dickens first work , and one of his most comical. His depiction of what for him is a typically eccentric gathering of English characters is satirically brilliant and warmly comic at once. This is the stage where Dickens seems to have warmth for a good share of his characters, and even the ridicule does not seem as bitter as it will later on become. I could not really follow the plot if there is one but recommend reading this in whatever pages the reader happens to find himself enjoying. 
 This book seems full of interesting ideas - I predict it could have a significant impact if its ideas were to become widely known 
 I first read about the devas in a Findhorn book quite a few years ago. The transformation of a sandy tract to a lush garden was amazing. This author has taken the idea even further. Definitely worth a read or two. -Linda Fry  Kenzle,author of GATHERIN 
 JSF has created a charming, thought-provoking and absolutely hysterical novel that takes you on Jon-Fen's (sic) journey to find his 'roots'. Coupled with a deranged canine and a 'blind' driver, the journey totally sucks you in and doesn't disappoint 
 This book is the only source of info for building natural swimming pools and covers it well. Not for amatures to take on, but with the help of a few good professionals, the photos and specs are a great start 
 Una de las bandas sonoras más formidables de todos los tiempos. Prueba de ello fue la inclusión de tres de sus canciones en el top 100 de las mejores bandas sonoras de los 100 años del cine. Canciones como "My favorite things", "Do-re-mi" y "The sound of music" son ejemplo de la calidad de las composiciones.  Excelente proceso de restauración y remasterización... Se lo recomiendo a todos los amantes de las bandas sonoras 
 Tara Bennett-Goleman has a very lyrical and almost poetical way of writing.  She uses vivid and powerful examples to illustrate her points and this is a value add because it drives the points she is making home.  On the other hand, she can be repetitious and some people might find her meandering a bit annoying.  However, for me it was forgivable and even helped to reinforce the material.  With respect to content, I liked that there were many exercises scattered throughout the book that will help you to work with your emotions.  I also agree with the author that combining mindfulness with schema therapy is very powerful.  With mindfulness you can slow things down and see what is really happening at a deep level.  When this is combined with cognitive techniques, there is a real potential for emotional transformation.  Emotions can be on object of meditation just like anything else and interestingly, if one stays with an emotion with openness and curiosity this in itself can bring unconscious underlying needs to surface.  It has been said that if one can stay with their emotions in the moment, they can be ride this wave into their very soul.  This is a beautiful statement and I believe there is much truth to it.  Tara Bennett-Goleman taps into this dynamic and combines it integrates it with more contemporary psychotherapy.  The bottom line of this review is that if you are trying to work through difficult emotions, this book can really help you.  As Krishnamurti once said, "seeing the truth deeply is what liberates, not our efforts to be free."  I believe this statement captures the spirit of this book. 
 I have read a lot of books about Manhattan Skyscrapers, but this is by far the BEST of all of them. The author makes a review of 75 of the most famous Manhattan's skyscrapers, with amazing pictures you've never seen before.  Going in chronological order, it goes from the first skyscrapers, like the  Flatiron Building, pasing through Empire State Building, Chrysler and  Woolworth, and ending with the new Conde Naste Building at Broadway. If you  love skyscraper architecture, this is THE Book !  
 Those not familiar with Elisabeth's work might do well to read her article entitled, "Feminist Theology as a Critical Theology of Liberation".  That article, published in a number of edited collections of feminist theology, lays out the methodology she uses in, "In Memory of Her".  Just as important, those not familiar with her work should begin this book with the understanding that it demands to be studied, not just read, very carefully.  It is not a written motivational talk, i.e. to help women feel better about themselves.  Women are not the problem.  The book is written to challenge the deeply embedded assumptions scholars and people of faith make about biblical religion, biblical texts, and religious authority.  It is the challenge, not just the book, that is formidable 
 This is one of the better training tools you'll ever buy. Roebuck take's you step by step from puppy through the second year. I refer to this book every time I start a new puppy. If you hunt upland birds this book is a must 
 The author provides several good, solid marketing ideas that can be a benefit for any senior portrait photography studio. The book is worth the investment 
 We'll start with the simple ones: sad, deep, bloody... But it's the longer ones that truly sum up the book: thoughtful, emotional, frightening...  "For Whom the Bell Tolls" starts out simply enough, but it slowly progresses to being a book that houses a series of complex, not entirely predictable characters. Robert Jordan is the main character, an American, often comparing, often thinking. We follow him around in the midst of a not-so-pleasant, frighteningly bloody war. He is accompanied by other men who are either helping him, or have similar tasks, though not all are so. There is Pablo, who in reality, is Jordan's enemy, in that he intends to prevent Jordan from blowing up a certain bridge. There is Pablo's wife, Pilar, who tells a chunk of the book in the form of stories to Jordan about the past. There is Maria, Jordan's crush, and though many concentrate on their love, Maria is a rather flat character, though her history is one that tells more about the surrounding situation.  The book itself isn't across that long of a time span, on the other hand it includes many stories that are told to Jordan. The reader is drawn in quickly, and despite the blood, the fear, and the uneasy way everything is written, it's an incredible book. Perhaps it's because of these things; they make the book more realistic and touching to the reader.   It is certainly a great book, a wonderful read, and an interesting view on a little known event. It's a good book to read, even if you're not fond of stories with death and blood. 
 The book reinforced some common sense approaches that parents struggling with teenagers with adult problems sometimes forget.  Nothing new but helps to read it over and over 
 What can I say? I love Tonic, the band is excellent, their cd is excellent! It was worth the money 
 This book does nothing to remove pain from a believer's life, and it does not give any instructions or quick fixes as to how to do so.  What it provides is a new perspective on pain, one from a God-centered viewpoint rather than a man-centered viewpoint.  The author sympathizes with the reader who may be suffering, but then continues to give new, biblical insights that identify pain as a blessing from God to a sinful, broken world.  My wife purchased this title for the church library -- I'll probably buy one for my own collection.  It's a classic treatment of pain and suffering -- the best of which I am aware 
 This was, by far, my favorite book growing up.  I loved trying to figure out how to say the strange words and eventually, I could almost recite the entire book from memory.  I still can the first few pages.  I don't know that I was helped psycologically, but it sure was and is a fun book 
 Lora O'Brien has written a book that is both dead serious in tone and puncuated with her Irish wit.  This is not a book for fluffy bunnies, wanna-be's, 'Charmed' fans, et al.  This is the experience of a woman who is Irish and a witch, and lives it.  She pushes aside layers of blatant and not so blatnat misinformation on beign Irish and being a witch. While realizing we cannot all move to Ireland and pick up the language, we can understand the experience she shares with us on being as authentic as possible.  In a lot of ways, her approach is akin to Ray Buckland in his groundbreaking books, "The Complete Book of Witchcraft" and "The Tree". Buckland had to dispell stereotypes and rumors of orgies, drug/alchol consumption, 'black mass', etc.  As that has largely been cleared away thru the pagan/witch community, the new sterotypes-instant gratification, fancy, meaningless titles, spinning "burning times" icons, and using magick indiscrimatantly have to be dispelled to see the real soul of the Witch-not the trappings of "Pentacles, Inc.  O'Brien covers sabbats, stages of the Witch's life, persecution, sacred sites, and dieties.  This book is a serious look at herself, her tradition and her future.  It's also worth a look as your future, too.  I cannot reccomend this book enough.  If you are a serious witch, you'll see some of yourself here and find new doors in your soul to explore.  If you are looking to become a serious witch, and are ready to drop the party games, this book will help you map your escape route.  I read a lot of books. I attend lectures, teach, and just chat with others about our faith and craft.  This book is destined to become a modern classic.  You may not agree with everything, but you've got a real friend in this opus.  So mote it be,  Ty  
 This book, the first detective novel written, is a great combination of the eloquence of the Victorian novel and the entertainment of a mystery novel. Collins' main characters of Gabriel Betteridge and Franklin Blake are immensely likeable and there's a good deal of humour here as well. The only complaint I have about the novel is that it's entirely anti-climactic. Most of the suspense comes near the middle of the novel and you'll spend a good portion of the latter part of the novel with a pretty solid idea of who the culprit is. Overall, though, a very good read 
 I loved this book!! It's a well written story where you feel all the emotions of the characters. Reader: bare with the story because it is something really worth thinking about in the end. Does our soul really bounce back from one lifetime to the next until it fulfills its duty to stop the reincarnation? This story will help answer that. I love the angst-love deprived story between Celia and Stephen. Celia (de Bohun) 14 years old, and Stephen Marsdon, a Benedictine monk. Yes, they fall in love despite Stephen's vow to the Catholic Church; they just fall in love, and as a result of their love affair that took place four hundred years back, their past  catches up with them at the current time where only Stephen (Richard Marsdon) and Celia can resolve.  
 I'm someone who has grown quite weary of vampire fiction, and I usually hate romance novels.   So, I was skeptical when my friend handed me this book and said that it was a "must read".   I finally picked it up last night, and I couldn't put it down until I finished it! It was a clever, funny, and charming story that didn't take itself overly seriously. It completely burst the bubble of pretension and gothic melodrama that is so often seen in alternative erotica.   Aside from all the comedy, it is also a really hot book. I'll admit that the male lead is going on my Christmas list this year. Please feel free to ship him to me.  Love the book, and I'll order more from this author 
 I've just purchased this book today, and am looking forward to delving into it shortly!  However, I would like to make a comment on all the negative press Marie Antoinnette & Louis XVI received during their reign.  It seems all throughout history, whenever someone is unhappy with the way the present regime is running things, those trying to over throw the it, such as the Napoleons, Lenins & Stalins, are far more tyrannical and spend thrifts than their predecessors.  Anyway, just some food for thought 
 Even though my book got lost in the mail, I was still able to get my money back. Thank you very much. I hope I have the chance to buy another book from you. 
 As others have noted, this book is a fantastic introduction to the major issues and attitudes in the "who was Jesus?" debate.  Both Borg and Wright were excellent choices for each view.  The tone between the two is cordial and the debate, such as it is, relatively gentle and mutually respectful.  I agree with other reviewers that Wright's case is by far the stronger.  Borg's entire argument rests on the supposed late dating for the Gospel of Mark, which he says was the first Gospel written.  He then states that sayings which appear in later Gospels, esp. John, were "read" back into the mouth of Jesus by the church as it developed the idea of Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God and saviour of the world.  Peel back those layers, Borg says, and you will find a simple Jewish peasant, who performed what he calls "paranormal" healings, railed against social injustice and initiated a movement based on equality and inclusiveness.  In short, Borg sees Jesus as a first century version of a 21st century American liberal.  To him, anything which makes Him look more like the Jesus of orthodox Christianity is simply mythology.  These myths are fine, so long as modern Christians reinterpret them in the light of modern ideas of tolerance and pluralism, in his view.  To Borg, Jesus is "his" way to know God, but not the only way.  On the issue of the resurrection, Borg sees it as occuring in the hearts of believers, as they became aware of Jesus' closeness to God and the importance of carrying on his mission of inclusiveness an social justice.  He says that it is irrelevant whether the body of Jesus was revived in any way.  "He rose in our hearts, and that's what is important" is an apt way of phrasing this stand.   Wright defends the Jesus of the historical creeds of the church, the one who knew he was going to die for the sins of humanity, who was the Second Person of the Holy Trinity, and who literally rose from the dead.     So, who's right?  As someone who majored in biblical studies in college, I can offer some opinions on that question.  First, it can be said with confidence that most so-called "New Testament scholarship" is simply guesswork.  No one knows for sure which Gospel was written first.  The current favorite is Mark, but a close look at the reasons for that position reveals them to be faulty.    Traditionally and logically it has long been believed that Matthew was written first. This is the option I favor, for reasons too lengthy to cover here. If this is so then the foundation on which Borg builds his house of cards crumbles.    In the end, however, it's simply anyone's guess.  Second, Borg writes from the assumption that the New Testament wasn't divinely inspired, and bases his views on this premise.  For example, he says that Jesus' prayer in Gethsemane as recorded in John was obviously invented by the church, since no one was around to hear it.  This is only a problem if one discounts the guidance of the Holy Spirit in the writing of John.  An omniscient God could certainly have led John to pen a correct account of that prayer.  Borg is quick to call apparent problems in the text fictional statements invented decades later and placed in the trxt as true.  An example: since the trial of jesus was held in secret, he says that the details about it recorded in the Gospels have to be mere speculation.  Besides the answer from divine revelation mentioned above, there are  other alternatives to Borg's position.  There could have been eavesdroppers outside the building.  One or more of the persons present may have spilled the beans afterwards.    Borg reads anti-Semitism into the text even where there is no evidence for it.  An example he cites is Pilate's washing his hands before the crucifixtion.  He says this scene was put into the text to infer that Pilate was reluctant to kill Jesus, laying the blame more on the Jewish people.  This is pure assumption on his part.  I have no trouble believing the account is factual.  As hard as Pilate was in his governing style, it is entirely possible that he was so impressed with Jesus that he was truly reluctant to sentence him to death.  The hand washing may have actually occured, as an attempt on his part to assuage a guilty conscience.    History records similar events.  Attila the Hun spared Rome from being destroyed after meeting with Pope Leo 1.  The Muslim sultan Melek-el-Kamel was so impressed with St. Francis of Assisi in their 1219 meeting that he permitted the Christian monk to preach to his troops.  Even members of the Mafia show reverence for the Catholic church.  It would seem that cruel, hard men are often reluctant to harm someone they perceive as especially pious.  Wright points out these sorts of errors in Borg's approach to the Bible, citing reasons to believe in the accuracy of its accounts.  By American standards his tone is incredibly civil, given how much he and Borg disagree.  I suspect this is simply due to the emphasis on civility still prominent in British culture.  All in all, this volume is a fine way to begin a study of the differing views of Jesus.  I give it a strong recommend.  I also recommend the book "Will the Real Jesus please Stand Up?" as a follow up reading.     
 This book is god sent my 13mnth old loves this book he's had it for quite some time and his eyes still lights when its time to read it... this is fave book out of all the others... i also bought him Guess How Much i love you and I love you little he pays zero attn to those... he now knows how to call for his book... lol soo cute... 
 I like this book and dvd very much. well done, i love the dvd. i learned so much more, in a very short time,than any other dvd or book on this topic. i am so happy that the author and his wife were kind enough to share their knowledge 
 Excellent read - very captivating, good story lin 
 Dylan is of course the master of the political lyric. With this set of songs it takes one on a jouney back through time, to HIS roots. The selection of songs is outstanding. The throat catches on occassion with the truth in his word. The band meshes incredibly well with all players giving a more than credible performance. Despite the fact that organ and pedal are plugged, without them the performance would not have been as great. Stellar performance by the folk singer! 
 This is going to be a great program that will benefit our family in producing fantastic photos and films 
 Memorex, Maxell, TDK, HP, and many other disks are behind verbatim in quality. These CD-Rs are very compatible with so many devices, they are not very sensitive to scratches, and rarely fail to burn. They can even be over burned 20-30MB without too much trouble. I have been using Verbatim for years, and these are the best in their great series of disk 
 One of the finest sports books I have ever read...great as a sports book, even greater as a biography....probably better as a biography....the characters, especially the Babe, come alive. It's as if you are living history as it happens and the characters are real, so, so real.  Gives the reader an understanding and appreciation of the men who played the game as never before. Simple, yet complex men, in a simpler time. Simple to us, but still complex and uncertain to them....A rare find. A rare book. A good, good book.  Highly recommended to the devout baseball fan, the casual baseball fan and to the reader who has a casual, passing interest in Babe Ruth, his life and times. Highly recommended 
 This collection of the first three books in the Plum series is where it all began.  In these books, we first meet Stephanie Plum, bounty hunter.  Stephanie's funny, she's quirky, and she's not really that great of a bounty hunter.  She's constantly in trouble.  People want to shoot her.  People blow up her cars (yes as in plural).  But, despite her hard times and her lack of skills, Stephanie is just someone you have to fall in love with.  In One of the Money, we are introduced to Ranger, the sexy bounty hunter who we know nothing about except for the fact he's good looking...and he's a heck of a bounty hunter.  We also meet Joe Morelli.  Stephanie's job is to hunt Morelli down as her first case as a bounty hunter.  But there's a twist...a very funny twist.  This story will keep you laughing out loud even in the middle of the night.  Two for the Dough and Three to Get Deadly are just as funny as the first book in the series.  Start to read these books and you'll have to go get the whole collection.  Take my word, you'll fall in love with Stephanie Plum 
 Its like a milestone keeper for dummies!! I am not that organized, but this book makes it easy to jot down firsts. I have it for both of my children, so no one feels slighted.    It covers everything for the first year not to mention it is a really cute book! You will love it, when you look back and read it 
 finally here two classic laugh out loud no matter what age you are comedys.problem child 1 and 2 are a classic example of comedys that dont take themselfs too seriously and in the process make for heilirous viewing.the jokes are more hit than miss and especially in 2 push the bounderies of what you get in a pg rated movie.number 2 is still my favorite and after all these years these movies sure do stand the test of time.finally movies that live up to the fond childhood memories.plus junior is a total (jerk) and a great role model for all young kids 
 This my favourite book in the series.  With all the unexpected twists in an amazing plot I can see why Louisa May Alccott is so popular I am 14 and have just finished yr10 at high school and completed an Author review for  english where I had to read all the books written by 1 author and I found  that this was easily my favourite of the Little women series 
   The Relic in movie form is a suspenseful and entertaining romp through one of the most interesting locations for a pseudo-techno-thriller. On the first viewing, there are many good elements of a gritty cop homicide investigation meets intelligent yet homicidal creature flick. The archetype of evil being a universal constant in all cultures no matter how primitive coupled with an innate look at superstition and legend in all cultures was the perfect mixture of plot setting to make this an enjoyable movie.     I say "the first viewing", because quite a bit of the movie is devoted to figuring out "what" is going on and "why". Once you learn the reason, the movie shifts to a more standard horror survival role until the end where it reverts back to trying to explain itself. There are several entirely enjoyable sequences of plain old scariness and tension if you are able to successfully suspend your disbelief and go along for the ride.  In fact, several of these scenes are enojoyable enough on their own to cause me to watch them over and over from time to time.    However, as a disclaimer to fans of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Childs (like myself) this is NOT the exact same plot, ending, character development (or even all of the major characters) the novel(s) the movie was based on. The movie suffers from a rushed pace and several "by-the-book" horror movie cliches. However, if you are not planning on reading the books and are looking for a one-time enjoyable thriller, or do enjoy reading and want to compare notes, I would highly recommend this one as it is just enough different to be unique. 
 My first introduction to Nathaniel Philbrick was this particular book, IN THE HEART OF THE SEA, which I bought over three years ago and kept it in my "to be read soon" stack. After hearing the recent reviews of Philbrick's latest, MAYFLOWER, also in my "stack," I pulled out IN THE HEART OF THE SEA and decided to read it. To say that I felt idiotic for not reading it sooner would be an understatement.  Many authors of factual-based books, regardless genre, don't have the touch to make non-fiction readable. (I noted with a chuckle the high school/college student who reviewed HEART OF THE SEA, and indicated how boring and dry it was...well, it was a class requirement, so of course it is boring and dry.) My opinion is diametrically opposed. There are a few authors that bring non-fiction to life: Roger Lowenstein (in business), Kurt Eichenwald (in business tales), David McCullough (in history), and, of course, the late Stephen Ambrose (in history). Philbrick can now be added to that list. While he doesn't present presumed dialogue like Eichenwald, Philbrick brings the story to life with titillating detail and gusto.   HEART OF THE SEA introduces readers to the island of Nantucket in the early 1800s, where whaling was the primary, if not only, industry of any import to the islanders. At that time in history, Nantucket was considered the whaling "capital." Philbrick introduces the readers to the customs of whaleships, the ranks of the seamen, and the incredible journeys a typical whaleship made. Each journey, with little variation, took the seamen from their Nantucket familes for periods as long as three years. Upon return, they might only be with their families for a few months before the next voyage. However, given the dire need for oil provided by the sperm whale, and the riches it brought on the open market, this was a standard and fully accepted custom, not only by the seamen, but their families as well.   The story within the story provided the basis for one of the great works of literature of all time; Melville's MOBY DICK. Philbrick indicates that Melville was ardent, and somewhat transfixed, by the story of the Essex, and its ulimate plight. Of course, MOBY DICK is a work of fiction, but it is centered in fact...that being the tale of the Essex.  IN THE HEART OF THE SEA revolves around the  whaleship Essex, which set sail for the last time in 1819 in search of sperm whales. Now, think about this: the whale hunt was to take place in the Pacific. The Essex had to sail from Nantucket (think Boston) in the Atlantic, around Cape Horn (the southern tip of South America), and then back north to the whaling grounds of the Pacific. No wonder these voyages took years! The Essex had a number of "events" occur before making it to the South Pacific, which, in hindsight, should have given the crew a hint that this, indeed, could be an ill-fated voyage. After having some decent luck in their search for whales on their way to the whaling grounds, an extraordinary and unprecedented event took place while the Essex's latitude was approximately the Equator. The Essex was rammed by an eighty-five foot sperm whale, twice, which sent the 228-ton whaleship to it's death in the Pacific. The crew, numbering 20, took the three available lifeboats, called whaleboats, and began pondering how they were going to survive, literally, in the middle of the Pacific, thousands of miles from any known civilization. While the crew was able to save some food and fresh water prior to the Essex going under, most knew it wasn't enough to make it. Their ultimate journey from the death of the Essex to rescue was filled with hope, dispair, and human behavior none of the seamen thought they'd ever consider or engage in. This journey is heartwrenching and fantastic.  Philbrick has put together an incredibly vivid tale bringing to life the tibulations facing each of the seamen of the Essex. Philbrick has given enough, but not too much, information on whaling, sperm whales, 19th century industry, and the culture of a seamen and whaleships to give the reader a firm grasp of the time without becoming inudated with minutiae. IN THE HEART OF THE SEA is an outstanding effort by a very talented author. 
 I've had a string of bad luck with computer books lately so I was hesitant to get this one but I'm glad I did. The title says it all. I would not encourage people who are new to Maya or people who already know MEL to read this book, but for those of us experienced Maya animators who need a place to start with MEL it's perfect. Very well done and clearly written 
 I have a 13 month old boy and he has both the Right and the Left Brain video and he loves them!  I can have the TV on any time around him but he only really pays attention to it when I put on one of these videos.  I tried the Baby Einstein videos and Baby Mozart held his interest for a bit, but nothing like the Brainy Baby series.  I've noticed that at first he loved the Right Brain the most but as he gets older he is becoming more and more interested in the Left Brain Video.  I have also lent them to my friends that have the Einstein videos and some of them have gone out to buy the Brainy Baby series.  I'm on my way now to try some more of the serie 
 this would have to be one of the most beautiful albums i've heard. a glorious mix of breathy french vocals from francoise combined with gorgeous brazilian guitar from tuca. gentle from start to its brilliant ending, this album never strays from its dreamy tempo yet is full of surprises. sensual, romantic, haunting and at times melancholic this album is truly a wonderful masterpiece 
 In the introduction, the creator of these photographs claims that his works of art are inspired by his dreams.  If these are his dreams, I hate to see his nightmares!  All the models are nude, and are in strange positions: holding bizzare items, draped just so.  Kinda makes you wonder: what will this guy think of next?  
 David Wick's book is the best book that I have seen on jargon in quantum physics, and I have been publishing and lecturing on the topic for quite a while.  He shows step by step how some of the greatest abstract geniuses  including Heisenberg and Bohr but also most of the quantum mainstream  geniuses get carried away by their own importance and talent into coining  and believing gibberish and jargon including complementarity. I might add  that the statistics establishment, both in physics and mathematics,  especially the Bayesians, are generally about as bad.  These geniuses will  not even publish any ideas not using their exact jargon and current fads.   An advanced civilization would probably have an inventors-creative  department to remedy this, but try telling this either to government or  corporations 
 This is another winner from the Wodehouse collection. One might say that all of Wodehouse's books are similar, or almost formulaic, but to that I say, "If it ain't broke, then why try to fix it?"   This book is a collection of stories about Bertie's efforts to get his friend Bingo Little out of the trouble that is caused by Bingo's romantic entanglements. All the stories tie in together, but in typical Wodehouse fashion, they all have a little something different to offer the reader.  I would place this at the middle of the pack in the Jeeves series, but still worth a read 
 I'm a QL fan, but more of Scottie Bakula, really I enjoy this c.d. but I  was sad that it's his only song!!!!, he compose the lyrics and they're so  beautifull, but I preffer to hear more. Angela Kocybakulawsk 
 This book fills in the empty space of academic books in CRM. Most of the publications and articles I've read deal with research on the subject and companies selling their programs. In this book Peppers and Rogers compiled a comprehensive text with theory, research and contributions from other authors that are a valuable tool for the under and graduate level 
 Appadurai's book, Modernity at Large, offers quite a few tools to help us think about that big fuzzy thing called "globalization."  He coins quite a few words to describe multiply-constituted networks of culture - ethnoscapes, mediascapes, ideoscapes, financescapes, and technoscapes.  All are different ways of looking at the global cultural flows that we're trying to describe, and all are strongly influenced by perspective, overlapping, and rapidly shifting (though the term doesn't quite capture the instability and mutability of global cultural flows).  A book like this, to be useful, should help us think about important problems in manageable, intelligible, and useful ways.  Appadurai's book offers more than most in this line.  His terms, such as the above, are interesting, and his willingness to theorize as well as analyze is valuable.  The ways that he situates himself in his analysis is also illuminating and useful.  For example, Appadurai describes a trip he and his wife made to a Hindu temple in Bombay.  His wife asked about a Hindu priest that she had known before, and they were told that he was in Houston.  The point isn't just that they went there and he came here.  He's talking about trans-locality, and the production of locality beyond mere connection to a place.  Not all Hindus live in India, and not all Indians have to live in India to maintain their Indian-ness.  At the same time, Houston is Houston because of both the people and the landscape located there.  But part of its identity as a place derives from the trans-local identities of some of its citizens - a "cosmopolitan" city where some citizens are both Indian and American.  He does a better job than I'm doing here explaining his thinking about the contemporary experience of diaspora, which is an accomplishment in itself.    There are some flashes of real insight in this text - for me, some of his coinages were brilliant, and the comment that some trans-local modern ethnicities are forced into violent anti-statism through an inability to articulate their identity except through the language of nation and state also resonates - but overall, Appadurai tried to accomplish too much in one book.  He finds himself saying things like "the details of this argument are beyond the scope of this chapter," and it seems like this happens too much.  It would have been better to flesh out his thinking about the production of locality in greater detail, with more case studies.  And some of his terms could use additional explanation - he doesn't seem to notice his own un-critical use of the term "cosmopolitan," and he pays remarkably little attention to literature and film after professing the importance of both in the global exchange of ideas (mediascapes and ideoscapes, as he calls them).    This is a strong book, with some real value, but I wouldn't recommend reading the whole thing all the way through.  The table of contents, the index, and the chapter titles are useful signposts.  It's the kind of book that might be most useful in small doses.  
 I've had this watch for about a month and I love it! So far the  barometer has been right about the weather a few hours ahead. I have not had the opportunity to take it to the mountains, which is the main purpose for my purchase, but the big screen is easily visible and the features are readily accessible. If you are looking for a great outdoor watch, give Highgear a chance 
 a book written with the full use of the english language. words pour out here in a very intriguing way and capture the audience very well. a well written novel using a protaganist that has been rarely used befor 
 I collect Oriental rugs and Oriental rug books.  This book is not for the beginner, but is meant for in-depth study of the subject of Oriental rugs.  As you read you are directed to other pages for study and comparison.  This is a time consuming but valuable process.  If one wants to really study Oriental rugs this book can elevate you from beginner to a person who is comfortable with the subject and able to talk with experts. I used this book as a self teaching text book and loved it 
 This is a great story.  I will follow the story in future books.  The characters are very real and are easy to merge with for a fun ride.  Chas E. Mose 
 Of my dozens of pregnancy books, this one is the hands-down best. It is the only pregnancy book that answered the questions I had before I actually became pregnant, since there's more than one chapter on issues of fertility and planning. It is also still the book that I refer to most frequently when I want to know what's happening inside my body (I love the week-by-week chart),  what symptoms to really worry about (I love the reasonable & accurate information), and for sensible tips for alleviating the minor discomforts of pregnancy (I love the ginger tea).   This book has the tone of a wonderful older female relative -- especially if you happen to have an older relative with deep medical training combined with a great sense of perspective, a relative who may be a little long-winded but ends up being the person you want to talk to most often while you're pregnant.  Some pregnancy books are paranoid, some are overly-flippant, and many are addressed only to women who are already pregnant instead of to partners who are trying to get pregnant. This book avoids all those pitfalls. I wish I had bought only this book and not all the others. The only other book necessary to complement Ann Douglas's great guide is Armin Brott's _The Expectant Father_ 
 As the leading civilian authority on the U.S. Secret Service (and President Kennedy's interaction with the agency), I was much interested in this book by Cathy Trost. In conjunction with the audio cd, this book provides a dramatic overview of that terrible time in our nation's history. I recommend this book and cd, especially to the newcomer. vince palamar 
 I was forced to read this book for a college class... but after a chapter or two, I was voraciously reading it, more than willingly!   This book effected me so deeply with its complex, engaging, and devastating portrayal of an immigrant family that spans over several generations. Nearly every person who calls themself an American will find interest in this amazing book, because all our ancestors came from somewhere else - this book will give you a glimpse into the hard work, heart ache, and life that your forefathers endured.   Without a doubt one of the top 5 best books i have ever read 
 This is a great book, clearly written, with extraordinary insight into why sports fans are sports fans.  You will understand yourself better, if you are a fan, and you will understand the fans in your life better, if you're not a fan.    This brilliant international affairs specialist turns out to be a huge fan, and not only a fan, but also a profound analyst into what we see in sports and in sports heroes.  I recommend this uniquely perceptive book to all readers. It is a wonderful read 
 Oleanna is a two-character piece. For the most part, the dynamics are played out in a series of rooms on an unnamed  college campus.  Carol approaches the professor for help. She's failing his course. Instead of giving her conventional advice, the professor explains to Carol his entire philosophy of education. She is offended by some of what he says, and they argue, but their eventual parting seems to be amicable, in the beginning.   Bolstered by a group of nameless, faceless supporters, Carol is no longer the nervous, uncertain girl of as the movie plays out. Her self-assurances waxes, the professor's wanes.  An intellectual sparring match where there is no absolute truth.  The dialogue is strewn with inuendo's through out the latter part of the movie, though neither is lying; it is the subjective rather than the objective element of their account which is unique to each who witness this movie unfold.  Ultimately, perhaps the question in Oleanna is not whether sexual harassment has been committed, but exactly who is persecuting whom.   Although there often appears to be a play with graduated English literal terminology, Carol often demeans the language to lower the standard in conversation; though apparently fluent in it's use.   As the movie progressors it's possible in the beginning to see Carol searching for understanding, then toward the end simply using it as condesending weapon or retaliation, in attempt to belittle and demean the professor; as she feels, was done to her and not just in terms of conversation but her grade. There is constant reflective quality of a word meaning, that within the cofines of using a word and within the sentance structure, which is acurrately used, becomes a tool to change the structure of intent and meaning.  The most annoying aspect of this work,is the constant interruption and it's not the phone ringing during critical pauses in conversation, but the constant incomplete and interupted sentances and 'Flight of Thought'; by both the professor and Carol.  In some ways, the progression of Oleanna is more like that of a psychological thriller than a drama.  As the movie goes forward, there is the revealation that Carol has filed a protest against the professor, accusing him of sexual harassment. Her charges have some part of fact, but neither intent nor context are considered within the charges laid forth. They are not meant to be real, in fact.   This is essentially a play of a student failing a class and is looking to get even, easily reflected in her attempts to document each and every word; which in its self is taken out of true context, thus proving a play on words without a witness,is nothing more than words -Accurate as they may be. Having noted that, the turning point of the whole movie, was made in the most simple fashion..."Don't call your wife, baby", one will have to see the movie and then consider context and intent of that small phrase and the impact relationship.  Oleanna is a about mind games and I would feel confident that there is the possibility to see more than two versions of the whole, in the end. Much of the interpration is left open for judgement.   For myself  I see a student, feeling threatened with failure, seeks guidance with the express intent of obsolving herself; only the situation gets out of control and that's remarkable, the movie is about control, although the word 'Power' in transgressed into the theme. In order for the student to give conscience to her appeal, she drives herself deeper into a disconsolate mood and is not helped by the professors ideology of himself and that education is his to manipulate. Neither one listening to the other, the result is the student breaks down the barriers, using her notes to have the professors tenure dismissed, without any involvement on his part officially; the professor was over confident and should have seeked School counsel.   The end result was in fact more than words, but the physical act of lost control and indeed a crime, pushed and goaded he cracked.  I'm always taken by those that subverse others with dreaded "Social" crimes, with no real merit, equally the self imposed Rightous types; we have both in this drama.  Michael 
 I didn't love this story the first time I read it; but it's much better when you read it as a whole, rather than one issue a month. Grant Morrison writes incredibly well, as always.  Wolverine and Fantomex play off of eachother very well, as do Cyclops and Wolverine. More importantly, Morrison fleshes out earlier ideas regarding the Weapon Plus program. This is a very original take on the Weapon X (or Ten) project that's been done to death throughout the eighties and nineties. There are some important character moments for Scott and Logan here, as well.  Whether or not you like the artwork depends on yor personal taste. Bachalo's style is sloppy and somewhat cartonish, but that works for him. I' not a huge fan, but I don't hate it either. Wolverine does look a little like a fat, old man in a few scenes, though 
 This is a great review of India and some of it's history 
 Most newsmagazines are dumbed down in both intellectual rigor and political bite.  This is the only weekly newsmag I can stand to read, and I love to read it.  US news is a grab bag of topics, international is excellent (vs. other US sources of news), finance & business is excellent, science is a grab bag, books & arts is quite good, and the periodic special reports are great.  Cheeky and clear, a delight to read.  Bring your skepticism, though, because the reporters & columnists are not shy about taking a position, and you have to be ready to grapple and form your own opinion.  
 I was expecting the usual self-help book, with idealistic but generalized and useless exercises, flowery language that doesn't really say anything, and thinly-veiled advertisements for other books or products.  Thankfully, this book has none of these.  The writing is clear and direct, and the exercises are real and empowering.  This book has helped me learn more about myself in a few days than I learned over the course of many years prior.  Often, I felt the book was directed specifically at me, so accurate were the descriptions of the ways in which the "dragons" manifest themselves.  My one complaint (very minor) is that the section on maturity was almost overtly political, and in general not very useful or relevant to the core of the book.  Happily, you can skip this section without hindering the usefulness of the rest of the book.  All in all, I recommend this book without any serious reservations 
 Great to revisit Ray's works read when I was a teen in the 60's. An alternative perspective is what I need to be reminded of 
 A detailed and extensively documented account of the history of the Middle East focussing on the period from WW1 to the present from a journalist that has lived and worked there.  It answers the question "why would terrorists strike the US".  It will shock you and perhaps break your heart to realize how the actions and policies of the US, Britain, et al have sowed the seeds for the hatred and rage that we are experincing. It is a very long book (more than a thousand pages), and the detailed descriptions of the torture and carnage that have plagued this region are harrowing.  But it covers the countries and events that make our situation in the Middle East understandable. It shows just how misleading and ridiculous are the statements from our goverment that we have been attacked because "they envy our freedom" or that this is a "religous Jihad".  
 It's hard to call Diana Gabaldon underrated. She's a popular berstselling author, and she deserves to be- she writes good books. The fifth installment in her Outlander met with harsh critiques that I don't fully understand. Yes, there's let in the way of action- it's very much a transitional novel. Gabalon is leading up to her 7th and (rumored to be final) oulander book, and she's clearly setting the stage for something with this-  some important revelations are made towards the end of the book with regards to time travel, which indicates that the next book will likely deal with that aspect of the story more than the past 2 have. Meanwhile Gabaldon continues to develp the relationship between Claire and Jamie and Brianna and Roger. Roger undergoes a trial, and I think realizes his true feelings about Jemmy (regarless of whether he is the boys biological father). The relationship between Jamie and his sister Jenny is also strained due to events with Jenny's son. Basically, I think she's setting us up for something in this book. I wnat to see wha 
 Yes.  Very good.  I like.  Give it to me.  Rub me 
 Take one look at this book and you will realize how much thought, time, and effort was put into its creation. I read this book to my class of four and five-year-olds on the last day of a unit in which we discussed America's landscape, its folk music, and what makes our country unique. What better song to sum it all up than an American classic such as this? They loved it! I sang the verses to them and they joined in on the chorus. I can't remember the last time a book captivated them the way this one did! And to make things even better, the CD comes with, not one, but NINE songs performed by Woody Guthrie and Arlo Guthrie, all of which are lively, memorable, and downright wonderful children's songs. My students, as well as the other teachers, thoroughly enjoy the music. This book and CD are an extremely valuable tool for the classroom as well as the home. I couldn't be happier with my purchase, and I would recommend it to anyone 
 I love Jane Eyre for so many reasons. The character of Jane is so amazing: so quiet and humble and patient, yet at heart so passionate and full of longing! She is small and plain, but has more determination than any other character we meet. She has a pure, beautiful heart and a passionate, tender soul. She is the most amazing character I have ever enountered in all of literature!  The book follows Jane Eyre who, despite the stability of her quiet, peaceful life as a governess, is ultimately lonely and longs to experience more of the world. Mr. Rochester is a cynical, haunted man, living a life of sin and debauchery, but whose pure heart yearns for a clean conscience and a chance at happiness. Their love is deep and tender, filling up Jane's lonely life and rejuvenating Mr. Rochester--but true love can never be built on lies. When Jane discovers Mr. Rochester's awful secret, she cannot stay with him. He has lied to her the entire time, loving her completely but selfishly, using her for his own purposes. His feelings are true, but he has to pay for his sins and become upright before God--only then can they be together. Mr Rochester hoped to find redemption in Jane, but true redemption can only come from God. 
 This is an excellent first astrology book.  The in depth coverage and ease of use of the star charts enable the beginner to do accurate natal readings.  You will be amazed at how close the book is to the people you know well.   	Beware of the charts of people you don't know well, like new boyfriends.  Mistakes can be devastating, because the time of day matters.  The moon and planets sometimes swing in and out of a sign in a single day making the exact time of day of birth necessary for the serious new astrologer.  Time and experience makes the more advanced astrologer weary of these little got-you foibles.  Soon you to will become more exact in your work, and develop a sixth sense for a chart that just isn't right.  You will also start to recognize people for what they are, not what you want them to be 
 I've been a Greg Brown fan for a few years now. Only recently did I have a chance to see him live(Asheville) and it was truly one of the most memorable musical experiences I've ever had. His songs should be put in a time capsule and saved so the future can remember that this beautiful music existed 
 This Electric Guitar is a great value!! It has a nice sound and different modes. I suggest to beginners that you get this guitar. It has a guide and a poster with some guitar chords on it! I love this guitar pack!!! 
 Peter Morgan shows us how it's done.  It's the classic lot-of-white-space screenplay and it works.  The whole story is quite interesting whether or not you are obsessed with the British monarchy (I, for one, am not).    The only issues, from a speculation script standpoint, are that:  1) every character name always appears in CAPITALS; 2) the writer uses "a beat" with great frequency (this is supposedly an acting term not applicable to screenwriting [he should use "a pause" instead]); 3) camera direction is used, but the use is limited.  It's the ideal drama that could capture a broad audience or production interest.  Little or no profanity; no nudity; no violence; no special effects.    I've read quite a few screenplays and this is one of the better ones.  Very readable.  Not very technical 
 This is a very good undergraduate-level introduction to Vajrayana. It's well-organized, thorough without being too intimidating, and evenhanded. It really isn't a substitute for a teacher or time spent with a practice group, of course, but it'll help a newcomer make sense out of terminology and references 
 The Path of Alchemy - Energetic Healing and the World of Natural Magic by Mark Stavish is simply the finest book on practical alchemy that I have ever read. While focusing on introductory material and plant work, or spagyrics, it has enough meaty stuff for everyone. There is a fascinating discussion of the role of homeopathy in alchemy; extensive meditations and practices to link laboratory work (Labora) with inner work (Ora); initiation and the Tree of Life via alchemy; and some good background material on alchemy in the 20th Century. However, even the appendices are juicy in their description of the Tarot and the Alchemical process; the famed Longevity Tea of the Comte de St-Germain, similar to the confirmed recipe found in the long out of print, and very valuable biography on St. Germain by Jean Overton Fuller, and a fascinating description of the Flamel Path, of Nicholas and Pernelle Flamel, made famous in the first Harry Potter book, "The Sorcerer's Stone".  If you are going to read just one book on alchemy this year, or ever, I suggest "The Path of Alchemy".  P.S. Speaking as someone with next to no background in the Art, Mark Stavish has delivered a user friendly manual that renders the most obscure and complex material in plain language. However, this does not imply that the work is simplistic. As the Alchemists say, it requires both prayer and labor, "ora et labora" 
 I must say this is by far the best book I've ever read. 
 I recieved my book within 3 days by ordering on just the regular service 
 This is a very real exploration of some deep themes, namely rational vs. irrational thought, good vs. evil, rigid ideology vs. free-thinking, salvation through works or redemption through a lifetime journey of faith and seeking. It is also about love for a more "innocent" time, but also the continuum of darkness and latent evil that exists and has existed in mankind since our beginnings.   All these sound like heady, heavy themes, but they are given humanity in the two main characters, British husband and wife Bernard and June Tremaine, and through the books narrator, and the chronicler of their lives, son-in-law Jeremy. Both June and Bernard start their relationship in the time of the turbulent WWII backlash against fascism, and once they feel it is safe to do so, declare their identities as socialists. June quickly turns her back on these beliefs after a real but symbolic encounter with two vicious black dogs, the actual recounting of which is at the very end of the story; the episode unleashes in her a knowledge of evil and darkness in the human soul (they were Nazi-trained attack dogs) and a concomitant belief in good, God, goodness in humanity, emotion and feeling. She does not become, in a conventional sense, a Christian, but senses a higher power and some type of order in the universe. This serves to draw her apart from her husband Bernard, a rationalist who has no need for God, and believes that mankind can be corrected or improved by a social ideology (as he states near the end, having an inner life does not put bread on the table, or make life any more palatable for seven people who sleep on the same floor).   The narrator Jeremy, seems to have sympathy for both points of view, although drawn more to June's type of philosophy - this serves to bring both spheres of thought into fascinating counterpoint, and it is the fleshing out of these themes, with the beautifully written descriptions that I love about McEwan's books, together with the human dramas, and a sense of the beauty in human frailty and fallibility that truly make this a work to savour. This is a story certainly up to McEwan's very high standards 
 Based on the recomendation of a reader friend who believes Iles is a better writer than Grisham, I picked up this book.  I don't know if Iles can outwrite Grisham, but he is definitely a contender.  I found Blood Memory to be a page turner with a lot of unexpected plot twists. But, it is on the grim side.  The main character pursues solving two mysteries, one a serial killer on the loose, and the other a personal mystery related to childhood sex abuse that is a doozie.  In the end the two mysteries are related, though I think the author had to stretch things a bit to make it happen.  As an aside, I remain amazed and impressed that Iles can so effectively write a  novel in the first person in which the character speaking is a female sufferring from the effects of  sexual abuse.   Not a five star, but a solid four.   
 I was guided to this book when it was released.  It had just arrived in my bookstore but I did not know about it.  The way I was guided to it was as follows:  I woke up and the thought came to me "today I am going to my bookstore and find out what is new" and so I did.  When I entered the bookstore I saw a bookshelf with new arrivals.  Above the bookshelf in the air I saw what I would describe as a diamond.  My eyes were drawn to this book. I picked it up, read the title and my reaction was "what nonsense are they going to write about next" and returned the book to its shelf without opening it.  Then I browsed through the store looking for anything interesting and found nothing.  So, I decided to look at the shelf with new arrivals again and saw a budha in the air.  That is when the thought came to me that I should buy Amorah's book.  So, I bought it without opening it and went home.  Later it dawned on me that the diamond in the air I had seen was what is on the cover of the book. And years later I came to understand the symbolic meaning of the budha in the air.   I have read the book more than 25 times, and found Chapter 4 entitled "Ra Speaks" of particular relevance to me.  I can vouch personally to the accuracy of the guided spiritual healing Amorah went through because I subsequently went through one myself.  And I am grateful to Amorah that she had written this book, because it helped me understand what I was experiencing although her description of a guided spiritual healing only describes about 10% of what I went through.  It is one of the most remarkable books I have ever read.  The depth and accuracy of the information can only come from a much higher source as explained by Amorah.  Subsequently I read all of Amorah's books but still find this one the most remarkable one 
 You can tell he is a man who has been through what he describes. Very usefull considering some books written by some that haven't been in five fights their whole lives. I work in corrections and have seen many fights. They are quick and over before they even get started. Usually who lands the first shot and continues until it is over. He brings this out in this book and the ques that you look for that can give you an edge when fur is about to fly! I have seen these ques many times and could relate instantly when he described them. These bad people are predators, no different than animals. They pick out their victims by fear, weakness, and opportunity just like animals do. He really brings this out and how to carry yourself that will give the predators ques back that they better look for an easier target because you could be a problem they would be better off leaving alone. I have seen this in corrections alot. Just how you carry yourself. Not being aggressive yourself, but positive in your abilities and as a wolverine with a bear, "you might defeat me, but it will be a chore and not worth your time." He brings out things, especially fear that is worth the price of the book many times over. You can have all the training in the world, but if you can't control the adrenaline dump, you are in trouble! Good book. Highly recommended 
 This excellent series, "Civil War Journal" gives another great set for its fans and is a must-see for serious students of the war. While the general's names are well known, their motivations get a thorough examination. So many of the key players had friends and even kin on "the other side." West Point Classmates gives an excellent in-depth look at the early training and molding of values that influenced the sometimes heartbreaking choices these American heroes were forced to make. Highly recommend 
 My daughters, now 23 and 25 both used this book as the cornerstone of their college searches. Both chose colleges neither had heard of before, Hampshire College and Earlham College. Both schools were exactly right for both of them, and both girls followed Mr. Pope's advice in their selection process.   When visiting colleges they went when school was in session, attended classes, spent the night, had a student mentor (not a freshman) and ate in the dorm. One daughter visited an exhausting 12 schools, the other only 2 before she felt she had found her soul mate (Earlham). The daughter who picked Hampshire did so because she needs freedom to explore many venues, but the closeness of a small school community. At Hampshire she could attend any of the 5 school consortium at no additional tuition costs. So if Hampshire didn't have the exact class she wanted, she could use the free and frequent busses that run between the schools to take classes at Smith, Mt. Holyoke, University of Mass or Amherst.  The best thing about Mr. Pope's advice and bias on choosing a small school is that it's true. Not only do you get the small class size and individual attention of dedicated and well educated professors, but you have almost unlimited opportunities to explore social issues, sports, the arts and global society through personal involvement than most students at state schools.  In talking to peers who attended the oft chosen bigger schools, my girls found they had written more critical papers in one semester at their schools than friends had written in 4 years! At Earlham my daughter got to sing in the schools traveling performance choir for a semester in Vienna and Europe, be a teacher's assistant in German for a semester in Germany, live in a "Friendship" house, be a "featured artist" of the week in the school paper, play rugby for fun, write her first and second grant proposals and be able to successfully execute them.  The second daughter got to co-edit the school paper for a year and then resurrected the school's Literary Journal. Spent a summer in Bolivia writing for a paper owned by an alumni. She got to work in public radio, travel cross country researching her senior thesis, take horticulture at Smith and advanced Spanish at Amherst.  In small liberal arts colleges you don't have to be a "state champion" to play volleyball or football or rugby. You don't have to have ever had a voice lesson in order to sing in a choir and gain the skills you need to get into a performance choir. You can dream of being at the inaugural parade in Washington DC and the school provides transportation and teaches you how to be a socially responsible, safe protester who effectively gets a message across during a protest without offending (or getting arrested). You make friends and have a community that includes your professors. Friends you will keep for life.  Somewhere in one of Mr. Pope's two books he says something to the effect that the job you will have in 10 years probably does not exist right now, and that by having a liberal arts education a student is prepared to go out into the world and adapt and to continue learning while the world changes around them. That's exactly what my daughters are doing.  One, who majored in Art and German is living in Japan and teaching English for two years (and becoming fluent in a third language). Her student loans will be paid off in 2 years with a tidy nest egg stashed away for grad school.  The other, who majored in non-fiction writing is now back in school preparing for grad school in library science with an emphases in the arts and art history. Neither are where they imagined they would be when they were 18 and looking ahead. Because they had the advantage of reading Mr. Pope's books, they certainly have had a much more interesting and fulfilling life and education than they would have had they followed the "herd" out of high school.  And yes, Mr. Pope's book and specific school recommendations need updating. Antioch College is a drug den, crumbling, graffiti sprawled and fading blip on the colligate radar screen that shouldn't even be in the phone book, much less this book. But overall, of the 14 colleges we visited, all seemed to deserve their recommendation.  Based on Mr. Pope's personal recommendations (I called and talked to him) we did find that financial aid was plentiful and at almost all schools the financial aid package would have (and did) made the  small private schools as inexpensive as state schools. The value of this book's contrarian viewpoint outweighs the fact that the specific school information needs updating. That's why I gave it 5 stars but hope that Mr. Pope has another, better revision coming along 
 This book is a must-read for any English teacher.  When reading The Odyssey with 9th graders, I always have them think about Penelope's point of view about the whole Calypso business.  It was cool to find out the business with cousin Helen, too.  I also liked that Margaret Atwood tells the reader her reason for writing this story in the introduction.  I love that she took a piece of human history (whether it happened or not, we've been reading it for millenia) and sought to answer an unresolved question: What led to the hanging of Penelope's 12 beloved maids?    As much as Penelope's story was needed, though, what stayed with me most was the chorus chanted by the maids between Penelope's chapters.  When we learn history, we only hear about the winners, the heroes.  The maids' voices remind the reader that as much crap as the ones about whom tales are told have to go through, the servants would gladly have given up their boring existences given the chance.  Sure it sucks to get lost in the ocean without hope to ever find the way home, and it must be tough to be a wife who doesn't know whether her husband is alive or dead for ten years, but that pales in comparison to a life of boring, tedious, monotonous futility.  And, even though they do get a voice here, none of the twelve develop their characters.  The chorus members are basically as one.  I feel I do need to mention the humor with which Penelope faces her trials.  She doesn't hold back the bitterness about her distant Naiad mother, her awkward relationship with her father, her beautiful cousin, Helen, or her spoiled brat son, Telemachus.   The narrative voice is engaging and funny, in the first person.  It is no Handmaid's Tale, but The Penelopiad is an interesting look at what might have been 
 This is a good basic book for collectors new to Watt Ware.  The  photographs are excellent and help in identification.  It is a well  organized book and begins with a brief history of the Watt company and has  a chapter devoted to each major pattern.  At the back of the book is a  section covering different company markings with photographs and drawings.   The book was published in 1993, however, the value guide was updated in  1998 and has proven to be accurate in my experience.  What this book lacks  is a greater history of the company.  It would have been nice to know a  little more about it with some photos of manufacturing and such.  For the  price of this book it is a good value...a good start 
 An intelligent book- easy to read with a supportive tone, containing much needed information and guidelines for those of us who struggle with food issues.   As a counselor, I have been inspired to consider leading a support group with this book as part of the foundation.     
 Overall very interesting and nice historical book even though the POV's shift rather awkwardly and seem disjointed at times.  The book also provides a good narration of the competition between the Cuban and American meteorological services.    The only part that annoys me is the parts of narration that are sensationalist.  A storm is not a living breathing entity and does not have a mind of its own.  Yet the storm of 1900 is constantly described as "having Galveston in its sights" and there is even one point where it is described as "hunting children".  Please Mr. Larson if you ever do a book like this again just still to the facts and the first hand accounts.  That's all any of us really want.   
 Ray Lynch has constructed a fabulous work.  A sublime mixture of the cosmic and the terrestrial.  More energetic than Kitaro, but still conveying the mood of universal possibilities 
  The book lucidly explains the fundamental shift in employer-employee relationship in the new economy. Bruce Tulgan does an admirable job of showing that managers do not have to just let their talent walk out the door. This book has useful ideas that can save your company a lot of money. It is written in an immensely readable style and has some good humour.   Tulgan argues persuasively that in the new economy, every term of employment, including schedules, training, career paths, location, assignments, co-workers, pay, among others, will best be agreed through a negotiation process, so as to tailor it to the individual needs of the scarce talents, which he explains will enable the organization to retain the talent. Naturally, the most precious talent will have the most negotiating clout. All this entails a novel set of organizing principles for employing highly productive people in the new economy.  Companies are advised to reflect and take note of the kind of work place that Tulgan describes in his book. Unless action is taken timely to recruit and retain talent, then the future prosperity of an organization may be in doubt. As a senior manager in my organisation, the book was a wake-up call and showed me the things I can do right now to make the workplace a place where the best people will want to come to work.  The book is essential reading for both managers and workers. The managers will learn how to build a lean, flexible, high-performance workplace. The worker will be able to understand better the background of some people policies, such as why managers are more accommodating to "talents" demands and how they can adapt their aspirations accordingly. 
 Graham Greene presents the story of a priest and his trials and tribulations in a Mexican Socialist state where Catholicism has been outlawed, priests are executed, and the mere possession of a religious article results in imprisonment and hard labor.  In the midst of this turmoil we find a self-professed "whisky priest", the last priest in his state, on the run from authorities.  The state has turned its peasants against the church through propaganda and terror.  The current reality for the priest is one where most shun him and refuse to help.  And when he does have the opportunity to perform a religious ritual, there must be constant surveillance of the police, for once in police custody he will be shot.  Greene does a brilliant job of allowing the reader to enter the priest's innermost thoughts.  This is not a typically pious priest.  He is a drinker, a fornicator, and an absentee father.  He comes to grip with the reality that he is a "bad priest" and laments the fact that he cannot do more to help.  Indeed, he realizes that it was his pride and sense of self-importance that prevented him from leaving the hostile state.  He is filled with self-doubt and self-loathing.  Even as he awaits his execution, he never considers himself a martyr, but merely a failure who will meet God with "empty hands."  However, the priest may be too self-critical.  His religious duties and devotions are a powerful force that brings him back into harm's way when the opportunity to escape persecution is open to him.  Indeed, after an arduous journey across the rain-soaked jungle mountains into a safe state, he nevertheless journeys back into the hostile state to hear the confession of a murderer he has never met, knowing full well that this is a trap from which he will not escape.  It is this sense of duty and inevitable death that lifts the priest above the morality of the villagers and his captors.  Although he may not be a typical martyr or saint, he does hold considerable power with those he meets, although he may not realize it.  Indeed, this "whiskey priest" has changed the lives, subtly or directly, of scores of people he has encountered.  Although Greene, a devout Catholic, portrays the priest an imperfect sinner, I would not call this book anti-Catholic, as did his contemporaries in the church.  The priest is certainly not perfect, and has fathered a child, but he can still be a useful minion of God.  Greene shows that even those with weaknesses and past sins can still achieve glory in life.  Through the eyes of others, Greene shows how this self-loathing priest has done more than he could ever imagine.  Overall, this is a superb book and a fine addition to any reading list.  
 During my fifty years of enjoying opera, I never "got" Callas---or Bellini, for that matter---until now.  (I found his music too pretty and her voice too unpretty for my taste.)  This evening I turned on my local NPR station and heard this NORMA in progress.  It stopped me in my tracks.  Here is "opera as drama" in spades!  Serafin's taut conducting perfectly sets off Callas's intense, riveting vocal performance.  Corelli and Ludwig are in splendid form as well.  As soon as I heard the credits at the opera's end, I came online to buy it.  If you want "pretty," there are other recordings.  If you want "breathtaking," try this one 
 I cannot think of a book I brought recently that I like as well as this one. It is a real treasure, a beautiful, well-written book and a joy to read. It brought back so many wonderful cinematic memories. The DVD was as good as it gets. A wonderful job of picking out the most important and entertaining clips. It's a marvelous gift to give and get. I cannot believe such a wonderful and richly bound and illustrated book AND A DVD of such quality and depth can be purchased for so little. It's everything a movie buff and book lover could hope for. Do it again Mr. Garner 
 This is an excellent portayal of the events surrounding Julius Ceasar's assendency to power.  It is very historically accurate and is dramatized to prevent it from being boring.  An excellent movie to add to any history buff's collection, with great special features including behind-the-scenes and documentaries about Julius Ceasar 
 Cosmos isn't for the average reader who likes their fiction in neat compartments.  Rather, it goes off in a stream of consciousness that occasionally seems to get bogged down in the narrator's thoughts, then soars into lycism when describing his surroundings.  From the beginning of the book with the sparrow hung on a wire, the writer takes us into the narrator's mind and the people's lives with which he has come in contact.  It ends as it begins, with question marks.  Read it for a different look at life, but don't read it if you want "high adventure" or "action. 
 Interesting book that incidentally teaches you how to read a book. In fact, one might think Sanders is an Amazon executive rather than Yahoo given the praises he gives and pages he devotes to reading. For Sanders, carrying a book will make "you feel as though you were carrying plutonium in a briefcase", and "well-read lovecat is a lion in the jungle". And that's just one of many hidden gems in these pages.  Among other items, Sanders also discusses the "new economy", Internet-based business models, and gives tips on networking and personal organization. He provides today's professional with a very practical tool box, but the overriding theme of the book is as the subtitle states: "How to Win Business and Influence Friends".  The "bizlove" and "lovecat" stuff is a bit over the top, especially when the concept culminates in the last chapter on compassion. I would have received it better if Sanders was a bit less sappy, dropped less names and was a little more practical about its application. I don't think the world will give most people the quick payback to their generosity and display of emotion that Sanders seems to have experienced. It does not even touch on any discerning or boundaries until the Afterward. Still, it serves to make a good point. He further develops his compassion theme in his next book, "The Likeability Factor", which I read before "Killer App". I'd like to have seen that merged into the Compassion chapter.  "Love is the Killer App" is a nice 21st century spin on "How to Win Friends and Influence People". Sanders' NSPS or "Nice Smart People Succeed" is a great theme for a book and life strategy.  
 Yes, it is long. Yes, the sentences are complex. Nonetheless, this novel is a worthy investment of one's efforts, because it isolates events that are so innately human that anyone who reads this novel will relate to it. Beyond just reading it because one feels obligated to do so as bibliophile, enjoy the greatest achievement of 20th-century France because it is witty, insightful, daring, and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny.  I recommend reading this novel quickly, rather than being bogged down by details that result in confusion or distraction. I read the novel in 15 weeks in a class at UC Berkeley, and have concluded that it must be read twice--once, to understand the plot and big ideas, and a second time to linger over the concepts that piqued one's interest the most. However, even if only reading it once, it is worth an investment of one's time and emotion 
 This is a fun and prophetic sci fi thriller. Butb see it because Susan Dey gets naked. That is why this movie was known at the time. I guess it must have been scandalous or something 
 Possibly what keeps Barth Tarkington from going the way of the Magnificent Ambersons, completely rolled over and forgotten by history, is that this novel is on the Modern Library's top 100 list of books to read.  A quick look at the imdb movie database shows that a number of his works were made into films and starred such pantheons of the golden age of movies as Orsen Welles and Rudolf Valentino.  An amazon check shows that he won the Pulitzer Prize--twice!  As I was sick in bed without a book of interest at hand Tarkington was perfect: his was a free ebook easily downloaded. It is a regrettable that this towering novelist of another time has become rather obscure today. The Magnificent Ambersons excels in highlighting a rapidly changing time in American history: dress, language, style,  breeding, importance, aristocracy and more all went through transformation as cities grew, fortunes were made and lost and life changed.  These changes, seen and experienced by the author, an Indianapolis resident his entire life, are narrated from the living room (or parlor, or "reception" room) outwards.  In the case of the Amberson family, the city they helped grow now thrives beyond them and their faltering fortune can't maintain the family as it swirls into obscurity and is surpassed by the modern motor car and sooty grime that defines the city.  A touching scene occurs when the proud grandfather, stooped and aged, sits at his desk in his once impressive mansion going over ledger books to a gaslight while the boarding houses all around it have electric lights, and cars speed past the old stables where his rather now shabby carriage sits. Turmoil, Tarkington's previous novel that serves as a prequel to The Magnificent Ambersons, describes a midwestern city scene that could easily find a place here:   	And then, as the car drove on, the chimneys and stacks of factories came swimming up into view like miles of steamers advancing abreast, every funnel with its vast plume, savage and black, sweeping to the horizon, dripping wealth and dirt and suffocation over league on league already rich and vile with grime.  The book's center is the grandson George Amberson Minafer, who grows up spoiled, proud, selfish and limited, and views those around him as riffraff.  His goal to "be" rather than "do" prepares him for nothing, and his world view works to destroy him and undue his mother's last chance at happiness.   The town in earlier years always wanted to see him have his "come uppance", (to get what was coming to him), and it comes casually, slowly, as his family is forgotten to poverty, and his own self importance is  eventually shared by no one.  That he is only 24 when this occurs, and has nothing to combat it but frayed pride, is pathetic. Amberson regrets that the new section of the town cemetery doesn't take into account that the older section holds the most important names, and views his uncle's entry into Congress for its ability to make family members ambassadors, allowing for easier family travel abroad.  He takes all as his due, and offers little but arrogance in return. In the hands of a lesser writer George might be unbelievable or a caricature, but Tarkington makes him real, and George's failure to see beyond his own point of view is tragic. The book's only weakness is its ending.  Those who can help him do so only when his mother "speaks" to them during a seance, and its wraps up the novel too quickly.  George has by this time shown some redemption, but his lifelong obstinence is still intact, and his faltering attempts at apologies should not hide that the kindness being shown him is not due so much to a light at long last glowing in his soul, but rather the pity being shown by others whose character is far surpasses his own.          	 
 From the turn of the century until the Nazi Anschluss Vienna was a city of amazing artistic and intellectual creativity. The psychological theories of Freud and Adler, the final development of "Jugendstil" or "art nouveau" in art and architecture, authors such as Schnitzler, Friedell, Kraus and Altenberg, the philosophic and scientific thinking of the Vienna Circle, the "Kaffeehaus" culture...this was all a part of Wittgenstein's Vienna. Vienna at this time was truly a phenomenon, exceeding any other city (including Berlin and Paris) in its intellectual and cultural ferveur. This book discusses this phenomenon with a view towards its effects on Wittgenstein and his philosophy. It is well-researched and scholarly in style, i.e. no tourist book. For a more biographical approach, "The Duty of Genius" by Ray Monk is also excellent 
 I believe Dickens intended this to be more exciting and action packed than most of his other novels. For example, in Great Expectations and Hard Times, Dickens makes heavy statements on social issues, but in this, he is letting his action and adventure side go wild. He is telling more of a story, not so much declairing a point. But it is still good. It is wonderful the way Dickens captures the mind-set of the mob and his describing the storming of the Bastille. I also loved Mr. Darnay, and the way he is so trustworthy to Lucie and his friends. I also loved the raw down-to-earth realism of Sydney Carton. His fate, I thought, was very sad indeed.  So a great book!!  Bravo, Mr. Dicken 
 This magazine covers every aspect of horror/suspense culture, such as comics, books, music and of course, movies. The writers of the articles have respect for the craft involved in the subject, and don't just dwell on blood and gore (but have no fear, there is plenty of that).  Whoever designs the layout of this magazine does a beautiful job.  Lots of glossy photos and intriguing artwork, too.  Give this one a try.  I'll bet you'll love it as much as I do 
 No matter if you have known it all your life, the last time the Chicago White Sox won the World Series was in 1917, and the last time they were in the World Series was 1959, that is until 2005, when the White Sox became the surpise hottest team in the American League, but since the American League team won the All-star game in 05, like they have since the rule, had been put in effect that the side that wins the All-star game will get to have homefield advantage in the World Series, no matter which 2 teams make it. And who would have believed that it would have been the Chicago White Sox and Houston Astros that went up for the championship. This was also the first time the Chicago White Sox made the playoffs since 2000, when they played the Seattle Mariners, and was swept in the first round of the playoffs. The Chicago White Sox met the Boston Red Sox for the ALDS, and I didn't even think the Chicago White Sox will be able to even beat the Red Sox, but they did, and they completed the sweep at Fenway Park in game 3. And then that waited for the winner of the Los Angeles Angles and New York Yankes winner, and it went to where, the winner wasn't even going to get a day off. And the Angles won the series, and for the first time since 2002, there was no Boston Red Sox or New York Yannkees meeting up for the trip to the World Series. The well rested Chicago White Sox lost to the tired Angles (thier only loss in the whole post season). The White Sox won it in 5 games, and now it was down to the St. Louis Cardinals and Hosuston Astros, the Cardinals were bidding farewell to old Busch Stadium, but lost the Astors, and Busch Stadiume was closed, set to be delmoished. This is were he get all 4 games, including the marathon game #3, thqat the White Sox won the game in 5 hours and 41 minutes, long after it hit midnight, and shortly after 1 in the morning. The White Sox copmpleted the sweep later on that night. Games #1 and 2 took place at US Cellular Field in Chicago, and then the scene swifted to Minute Maid Park in Houston for games #3 and 4. Now I woulkd have thought it would have been a perfect farewell to the old Busch Stadium, if the Cardinals and White Sox met up for the World Series, but that didn't happen.     
 I bought this gadget thinking I might be throwing my money away (looks cheap), but it actually DOES it job and does it quite well. The remote is a plus, and the USB really works!. Now I just use my SD cards with a cheap $7 adapter and play all my music in my car's radio. It does carry some static but what did you expect? It's radio... Anyways, the static is low and does not bother me too much. It's way better than only having the radio 
 This book enabled me to learn the benefits of shooting in raw.  The Photoshop raw image plug-in and all of its controls were described in just the right amount of detail.  Since I read this book, I've been able to squeeze every last bit of color and tonal range out of my photos with a better understanding of what I'm actually doing.  This book has just the right amount of tech-talk.  This is the perfect book for advanced-photo-hobby people that want to get straightforward instruction on how to make the best of using the raw image format.  
 This is the story of an ancient manuscript of the X century, known as "Coislinianus 120" (now at the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris) after the name of his last owner, a French collector of XVII century.  This manuscript, that once belonged to the monastery of Great Lavra on Mounth Athos, was sent to Seguier de Coislin from Cyprus by father Athanasios Rethor in 1643.   It was ignored for almost two centuries, until in 1839 J.A.Cramer, a classical scholar, analyzing its content, a rather haphazard collection of patristic and Aristotelian extracts, found what he believed to be "the words... of a commentator on Aristotle's (lost) treatise on the art of poetry". * This is also the tale of a fascination with a book: Aristotle's almost mythical Second Book of Poetics, whose quest has been as enthusiastic as that of the mythical Holy Grail. * Readers acquainted with Umberto Eco's "Name of the Rose" will remember the plot of the novel, based on this fabled book.  And yet there is not even certainty that Aristotle did effectively write this second treatise, but for some allusions and scattered, highly debated citations (the philosopher wrote also a book "On Poets" also lost and often confused with the two Poetics).  In any case, unlike Poetics I, this book did not survive the Middle Age. * Poetics I was respected but not widely appreciated in the classical times.  It was during the Renaissance that Aristotle's Poetics ended to be one of the emblems of the new culture, being printed, translated, commented, revered and debated for more than two centuries, until the famous "Querelle des Anciens et des Modernes" in late XVII century France.   * Being so important to the new sensibility, it was almost natural for some scholars to begin wondering what Poetics II could have said: in the XVI century some of them began attempts to reconstruct the lost second book.  It was from one of these attempts Umberto Eco got the inspiration for "The name of the Rose" (see N.A. Basbanes - Patience and Fortitude, pag.222-223). * Richard Janko's "Aristotle on Comedy. Towards a Reconstruction of Poetics II" is a very specific book.  * It is first of all the critical text of the manuscript, presented with in original Greek text with English translation and the usual linguistic comments. * It is a scientific and highly interesting attempt of restoration of the original unabridged content, through a collection of passages from other extant works of the Greek philosophers. * It is lastly a curious specimen of the amazing tools of classical philology in deepening our knowledge of an ancient text, of its transmission and of the original shape it did have.  Not casually Janko introduce his work with three different citations: the first rather predictably from Aristotle, of the other two one from Eco and one from Conan Doyle - as to remark the investigative dimension of his work.  * Janko's case is well presented and well defended.  He demonstrates the terms used in the treatise are in quantity (about 90%) and quality consistent with those used in other Aristotle's work. This excludes the suspect of a later Byzantine forgery. He demonstrates all the references to ancient comedy are consistent with the period in which Aristotle lived (noteworthy is the absence of Menander, the second most important Greek play-writer after Aristophanes, who began to stage his comedies a few years after the death of the philosopher).  This absence is restricting the time-span of composition of the original source of the Coisliniaus. He ends up showing that the work is consistent with Aristotelian ideas (specially with regard to ethics and catharsis), as opposed to the theories of Theophrastus, an other likely author of this work.  Language, references, inner consistency: all points to Aristotle.  * Yet this attribution leaves many other questions open to debate.   Why wasn't this work so widely known as Poetics I ? When and why was it definitively lost ? How was made the original source of the Coislinianus?  This is the qualitative part of the analysis, made mostly of guesses and hypotheses.  * While the First book on Poetics dealt with Tragedy, a genre already established and codified, Poetics II was dealing with a genre that was still changing and far different from the "modern" comedy, the one we today use to associate with the genre and created especially by the plays of Menander. So while Poetics I was still valid in its interpretation, Poetics II was apparently obsolete soon after its composition.  This situation was crucial in the change from scrolls to parchment since Poetics II was not copied in the new form and soon it was lost for ever.  Janko is also able to deduce from textual errors that the original source of the Coislinianus had to be written in Greek minuscule, this one possibly already a copy from a former scroll in capital letters.  * I still did not mention the content of Poetics II - and will not mention, since this is the classic case in which shape is more important than content. Besides this review is already growing a bit too long, and I didn't perceive any conspicuous contribution to the study of Aristotelian ideas. * As I mentioned earlier, this is a very specific work. It is best suited to scholars and unfortunately the author doesn't do much to please a lay reader (some Greek citations are even presented with no translation).  No effort is done to introduce the relevant points to a non scholarly reader: the period in which was written, the systems of transmissions, the terms of the Aristotelian debate both in the ancient  times and Renaissance, and lastly a panorama of the  different opinions on the authenticity of the work.  None the less it remains a hugely interesting work and the author is no doubt worthy of the warmest praise.   If you kept reading to these last lines, there is a chance you may be interested in other works I had the chance to read about the same topic. Unfortunately, the most interesting is in Italian and still not translated to date into English: - Luciano Canfora - " Un mestiere Pericoloso. La Vita quotidiana dei filosofi Greci" (Sellerio). Canfora is both an important Greek scholars and an excellent writer. In the chapters dedicated to Aristotle he relays the fascinating story of the transmission of the Corpus Aristotelicum. Actually all the essoteric (from the Greek prefix EXO- "outside") works of the philosopher (those he willingly published during his life) have been totally lost. We have most of the esoteric (from the Greek prefix ESO- "inside") works, those intended for private use and lectures. Aristotle died 322 b.C. and left all these manuscripts to his family and they were completely disregarded and almost forgotten until Sulla included them in the booty after the war against Mitridathes (86 b.c). Not scholarly but mentioned and/or relevant to this theme: - Umberto Eco - "The name of the Rose". This is a must read, both for its huge learning and for its almost perfect Borgesian plot. Eco is an uneven writer, but this is undoubtedly his masterpiece.  I was amused in comparing the opening lines of the lost book as imagined in this novel and as recreated in the essay.  - Nicholas A. Basbanes - "Patience and Fortitude" Rather average - and sometimes dull: relevant here for the interview with Umberto Eco about the sources of inspiration for his novel.  * You are most welcome if  you can suggest other books about the same theme or just share ideas and comments!  Thanks for reading 
 While the target reader of this book is for competitive runners, I find the content very beneficial for someone like me who just want to finish a marathon.  It books helps me greatly in structuring my own training plan based on science and own personal fitness and commitment level. It doesn't pretend to a a book with the right training program that fits all.  The only that I find missing in this book is about motivation. This book assumes that motivation to run and intrisic and anyone who pick up this book would already be a motivated runner. Then again, this book is not meant for a total beginner.   
 I bought this camera for my 10 year old daughter.  She is thrilled to have her own camera and has taken may vacation pics for the family.  I would reccommend for all beginning photographers.  Great price range with all the options.  Plus easy to use 
 In an age when one is quick to act, our causes often loss energy, no  matter how important the issues at hand are. Be prepared and be ready for  the changes that need to be made. Read this once or twice and always keep  it handy. I often review it after meetings or when I need to think of a way  to empower the people 
 I sent this to my mother who is in her 80's and has been an Anne Perry fan for many years.  She read it immediately and loved it!  When will the next one be published 
 News flash! Not everybody's chicken soup is the way your bubbe used to make! This is a great cookbook, filled with recipes from all over America, of Sephardic and Ashkenazic origin, influenced by where people settled. Gefilte fish is made with whitefish, salmon, haddock or shad, depending on what fish swims in the ocean, lake or river near by. There are latkes with zucchini and chili in Arizona and curried sweet potatoes in Flatbush.   Along with the recipes, you get history, culture and religion. What could be bad? Certainly not the Chocolate-filled Rugelach! Gosh, I'm getting hungry just typing this. 
 So the audio book is abridged, what can you do? I just recently finished listening to this, and I love this story. Ayn Rand develops some of the most bizarre and interesting characters I've ever encountered. Some of them are likeable, while others are repulsive. I admire Rand's philosophy, although I don't agree with all of it. Not only is this a great story that I agree everyone should experience, I found that Edward Herrmann did an excellent job reading it. His reading was clear, and in almost every scene, I could clearly distinguish what characters were speaking. Commuter friendly. I wish I'd read this book in high school 
 I have an arthritic neck and painful shoulder on my sleeping side and have struggled for years trying to sleep - waking with numb arm and neck pain, etc.  Of course, I have tried many kinds of pillows including that odd-shaped kind to no avail. I tried this one because the memory foam mattress topper I bought really did make a difference for my low back, but really didn't look for much success.  But, "pleasant surprise", it really does make quite a difference.  Good buy 
 Taking into account that this is a 30 year old movie, the transfer is very good. Specially if you enjoy it in a 16:9 Screen.  I have always liked this movie, even more that 25 year after I saw it the last time I still remembered very well. I really liked the way the producers put a lot of detail into putting the  movie in the correct time and fashion. I fully recommend i 
 Anjani sings these songs like they're a part of her life.  She has a beautiful contralto and perfect phrasing for these lyrics.  And the backing music (mainly piano and drums, played by her) is subtle and tasteful -- not too bland, not too intrusive -- just right.  Quite unlike most of Leonard Cohen's own albums, though you can sort of imagine Leonard's voice in the background.  I wish she and Leonard would redo 2000's "Ten New Songs": Sharon Robinson was good as a backup singer but marred it with her incredibly cheesy synthesiser accompaniments... 
 This is a very well organized video and explained what I wanted to know about basic massage techniques. It is good to own a video like this, since you will not remember everything you see the first time. I have not had a chance to see the Professional Massage video. This seems to be a lot more detailed with pictures and so o 
 I just absolutely LOVE this movie. It has to be one of my all time favorite movies. I especially love to watch this movie with an ice cold corona!! It is hilarious! Really funny! I just loved it. I never get tired of watching it! I can't wait for the next Broken Lizard film!! 
 This book sits on my coffee table in the living room.  I draw from Mr. Berry's philosophy and writings almost daily.  This book should be required reading in colleges and universities.  It speaks of the sensibilities most of us have forgotten.  I have loaned my copy to many friends, all have read it, it has changed the way they approach their lives and how they look at how we all live 
 I will be the first to admit this is not the "best" or the "greatest" play written by the bard, but it is still very worthy of his name, and incredibly beautiful!  Kinsmen is a romance in the style of Shakespeare's other late plays, Pericles, Cymbeline, The Winter's Tale, and The Tempest (my favorite).  In many ways it reflects his earlier works, namely A Midsummer Night's Dream, Hamlet, and The Tempest.  It tells a wonderfully romantic story of two good friends who fall for the same girl (I know, sounds familiar, but trust me, it's a different take on the setup) in Athens.  The poetry in it is lovely, the characters very well developed, and the plot is incredible.  Many people haven't heard of this play as Shakespeare cowrote it with Fletcher, but belive me, it is still wonderful.  Highly recomended 
 Actually, I just want to correct the first on-line review about Eça's The Relic. That review or whatever that is does NOT refer to Eça's book. There must have been some kind of mistake. There are no brothers, haunted museums  or anything of that sort in Eça's Relic which I, as a Portuguese  enthusiastic reader and...professor of Literature, have read several times  and studied/taught in College. Eça is unique, his writing equals only  Saramago and Pessoa and he is the best possible approach to the Portuguese  masterpieces of literature. I discovered his work when I was in my early  teens and that decided my career. Please try to find a good translation of  The Maias, Cousin Bazilio, The Sin of Father Amaro, The Illustrious House  of Ramires or The City and the Mountain and bring them to the american  public. I know some good translations by Carcanet Press in Manchester, UK.  But please,correct your on-line review 
 It is not Twain's best book, and certainly not the same as something like Huckleberry Finn, however this is highly recommended reading.  The satire is excellent, and although some people who may be a little too serious about Arthurian legends may not appreciate it, I certainly did.  Based on this book I would guess that Mark Twain would've been the among the best, and definitely the funniest, science fiction writers of all time if he had decided to follow that path.  This book is great for anyone who loves the humor of Mark Twain 
 This book is very cute.  Obviously, it's about Bob's birthday but instead of acknowledging it, Wendy has everyone act like they don't know it's his birthday so she can throw a surprise party for him that evening.  Bob goes about his day working, and getting a little sad and disgruntled that everyone seems to have forgotten his birthday.  Wendy even goes to the trouble of getting the mail before Bob can so she can hide all his birthday cards.  When he returns back to the yard from a long day (he even has a bunch of accidents. Just wasn't his day!), he is surprised with two cakes, many birthday cards, and presents.  Dizzy even made him a cement birthday cake!  It's quite cute and a nice way to teach kids to remember others' birthdays.  We read it all the time in our house and we highly recommend it 
 The book is very clearly outlined and easy to read. It goes it depth without unnecessary information. The cases in the back are interesting and are supplemented with plenty of visuals. 
 I first read this book a few years ago and have since re-read it, recommended it, and given it to many people.  The setting, an orthodox Jewish family in the Catskills one summer in the 1970's, does not sound very promising as a popular reading book, but of course that's the joy of really great writing.  And Allegra Goodman is definitely a great writer: funny, insightful, casually profound.  I've enjoyed everything I've read by her, beginning with a short story I found in a collection of Great Stories by Jewish Writers.  Totally unknown to me and up next to works by Singer and other icons, her story in the collection was easily the best, in my opinion.  I'm not Jewish, I might add, nor particularly interested in "the varieties of religious experience," but then she doesn't write about religion per se.  Her characters are just very interesting people.  That said, the culture her characters inhabit is fascinating and entirely accessible.  I used to teach Comparative Literature at the college level, and I would definitely recommend this book to teachers, and students, as well as anyone else who has an imagination and knows good writing when they see it 
 This book is a must for everyone, even if you do not follow Buddhism. The  Dalai Lama speaks to the heart and soul of civilization in this book, a  collection of his writings, segmented for daily reading. He has amazing  insights on how to live life as a happy, healthy, functioning member of  society. A friend calls this "written Prozac". It makes you feel  good 
 Cube was already a hiphop legend and screen star when he assembled WC and Mack 10 to form Westside Connection. This album dropped at the height of the West Coast-vs-East Coastal rap war.  These dudes come hard and get their point across that these 3 West Coast Gs aint nothing to mess with! Dub C is off the hook on here, dude is the knockout punch for real.

 We are in the last part of the 19th Century in this novel, and the Wild West has breathed its last. The book is peopled with real legends (Calamity Jane, Buffalo Bill, Sitting Bull) and fictional curiosities (Jim Ragg and Bartle Bone - two Mountain Men, and No Ears - an Indian with exceptional eyesight). McMurtry relates a sad, elegiac farewell to times past. The ever-interesting characters and their views of the world, which are wise and funny and fascinating, make the novel top-notch in the McMurtry canon 
 The Confidence Man is without question the most revolutionary work of nineteenth century fiction--enormously experimental, provocative and simply bizarre.  The experimentations with flatenned characterizations; the  episodic, even repetitive plot structure; and the sheer power of its  hallucinatory narration make this novel a post-modern work before there was  even modernism.  Greatly ignored in its own day, and for much of ours, the  Confidence Man is central to an understanding of narrative history and the  evolution of this tortured genius who, after his novel Pierre, seems to  have transformed narrative conventions in a way that few readers have ever  grasped.  A brilliant, absolutely central work that makes the much-lauded  experimentations of near-contemporary American writers seem puny by  comparison 
 You have to think about love, murder, sex, incest, and self-relinquish.  This is not what one might call the typical lifestyle.  This is an overall excellant book.  Somehow Sophicle's created a story of sex, love, murder,  incest, and guilt.  One might call it a fight for self awareness.  You   must admit, after reading this novel you feel a little remorse for the main  charcter, Odeipus.  I mean, anyone who falls in love with his own mother  and kills his father sub-consciously needs pitty.  I would recommend anyone  to read this book 
 I bought this keyboard for my daughter in lieu of a real piano for lack of space.  The weighted keys give it the feel of a real piano, and it is full-sized, but portable.  It also has excellent quality sound - I highly recommend this product if you cannot afford a real piano, or if you don't have space for one 
 I saw this on PBS before I bought it so I new what to expect, the costumes are fun where called for and beautiful or imaginitive where they should be, the dancing varies from Ballroom to Modern to interpritive Jazz, and is performed in spectacular style, it is hard to reconcile some of the negative reviews with what I see on this DVD, however if you are expecting  Ballroom dancing as you would see it on PBS, or the Ballroom competicions on cable channels, you will be disapointed, if you like spectacular Theater you will love it 
 My boyfriend and I wanted to build our new relationship around God and his will for our future.  We read this book together and felt that it has given us Biblical direction for what we want in our lives, putting God first, keeping ourselves pure until the wedding night, and the meaning of the covenant of marriage.  This book is awesome and should be read by all couples----with God as the orchestrator of our relationship, it can't fail 
 First off, you should buy this DVD.  There's no bigger Collins fan than I, so I may be a little more critical than the average fan.  The drum solo to start the show is worth the price of the DVD alone- it will give you goose bumps.  The show is great- sound quality, direction, and length.  My only complaint is the lack of older Collins tunes.  We've all heard the same songs live on other cd's and DVD's, so why not include some others like: I Don't Care Anymore, It Don't Matter To Me, Inside Out, Everyday, or something from the Face Value album besides In The Air Tonight?  I'm tired of seeing/hearing the same 15 super-commercial songs on all the live albums/dvd's.  Buy it 
 Ashlee simpson is a very great singer! This album is of course different from her other album, but her voice hasn't really changed at all, and that's fine! I like her a lot better than her sister, Jessica, cuz her music and everything is just way better. I'm not sure which album of hers I like better, but both are really good!  1. Boyfriend - 10/10 cool! I love how she did the chorus in this song, it's very creative. It's a great first single to this album. The beginning of this song is very interesting, too.  2. In another life - 10/10 This song is cool too! It has a very beautiful tune and nice lyrics.  3. Beautifully broken - 10/10 Beautiful! I wouldn't be surprised if this song became a single, I kind of think it should. It's got a beautiful beginning and chorus, and it's not very loud. The lyrics are nice too.  4. L.O.V.E. - 10/10 AWESOME! This has a very cool beat in the chorus AND the verses! It's an awesome single, and this song was what really made me like her a lot!  5. Coming back for more - 10/10 Probably my favorite! The beginning of this song is so pop and dancy. It's a perfect song to sing along to, and I really love the tune. This should be a single!  6. Dancing alone - 9/10 This one is pretty good too! In my oppinion, it's got a bit of a classy tune, and a very nice beat.  7. Burnin' up - 8/10 This one is ok, but not my favorite. She just sounds a little too ditsy in this song, and it's not really my type of song, although the lyrics are pretty interesting.  8. Catch me when I fall - 9/10 At first, I didn't really like this one either, but now that I think of it, it's the kind of slow song that I like! And the tune is very unique, I really like it.  9. I am me - 10/10 Another great song, and the perfect title to this album! This may sound like a stupid title, but once you listen to this song, you'll realize why she titled it "I am me." It makes good sense, and the chorus in this song is very pop and attractive!  10. Eyes wide open - 8/10 This song is ok, I kind of liked it at first, but it actually doesn't sound right. I'm sure the music-writers could have thought of a better tune than this! But as always, the lyrics are pretty good.  11. Say goodbye - 8/10 Once again, this song is just ok, and I don't even like the lyrics too much, cuz this is a sad song and it's not the type of sad song that I prefer. If she makes another album, she shouldn't end it with a sad song, she should end it with a happy song for a change, cuz her last album ended with a sad song, and it's not really the best thing to do!  Overall, very cool cd! I REALLY hope she makes another album, she just needs to! She is a very great singer and she can't stop now! So, if you have Ashlee Simpson's other cd, you'll like this one, I'm sure! Buy it 
 This is such a Great book I have boughten copeys for all my childern 
 This is the first and only published work that presents the complete prophecies and scholarly translations. This volume  houses the first comprehensive translation. It is printed with a word for word translation  from the French with the English translation on the facing page. Dubious  wording is explained in notes within the text. The most famous  interpretations, and also the author's, are presented in a commentary  section.  Indexes are provided for every level of reader, from the casually  curious to the elite historian and researcher, which are essential for  comparing the quatrains with references to geographical ,proper names, and  themes that may be the predictions Nostradamus correlated with astrological  alignments. The biography of Nostradamus is also the most complete one  existing in English.  His last will and testament and his letter to King  Henry of France  provides the much needed definitive examination of this  remarkable man.   Finally, a very exciting inclusion, is the the treatment  by the author, entitled Background and Rules of the Game, in which the  author queries, how and why did Nostradamus do it?  A great Work 
 I enjoyed the story.  I was fascinated at how so many people can think like the Religious Right.  I didn't necessarily like the writing.  Some parts were fast-moving and other parts seemed repetitious

 In lieu of the recent fury for the highly appraised movie Brokeback Mountain, I went and bought this movie. I have seen Get Real a few years back but completely forgotten about it until today. A happier movie than Brokeback Mountain, it basically addresses the same issue of two men falling in love (except Get Real is about teenagers),one man willing to accept and embrace his sexuality, the other hiding because of society's constraints. I like Get Real better than Brokeback Mountain. No one gets killed at the end, and the boy who comes out, possibly gets a better life (the movie ends abruptly with no epilogue). They should have presented what happened to both boys or make a sequel 
 This is the the little book that my husband and I turn to when we have a communication problem. We have many, many books on our shelve, but its this one that seems to knock some loving sense back into us. I highly recommend this book to all couples, but especially couples about to enter marriage. We all should have read this book in high school 
 I've been using an HP 1012 laser printer with WinXP Pro for over 2 years.  I'm getting 2,100 to 2,300 sheets per HP Q2612A (12A) cartridge and have been very pleased with the quality, toner, print, and the fact I've had NO issues with the toner, or the printer (other than one little issue that was my fault - read on for more).  I've used about 5 cartridge's or so over this 2 year period.  I only use OEM 12A's, as I don't want to mess with a good thing.  The fusser (sp?) is built into the cartridge - so if you did get a little spec of something on the fusser, the next time you put a new cartridge in, you are back to clean again -- I know because I made a mistake once and fed a sheet with some wet white-out through the printer, and got a spec on the fusser that showed up on all pages.  My error.  Fortunately, the cartridge was just about empty, and when I put the next one in, it was clean again. 
 A very successful comedy. Highly recommendable. Players are magnificent. Especially the final scene involving Kevin Cline's dancing act is unforgettable. Enables people to overcome deeply rooted prejudices about sexual practice.Sociological context significant.Leaves fine trails in spectators' brains 
 I saw this film years ago at the Film Center in Chicago and it still packs a wallop today. Jam packed with fantastic music and info. If you have any interest at all in Cajun/Zydeco music check this out. You won't be sorry. By the way, if it wasn't for John Conquest and 3rd Coast Music I might not even know this was out 
 I got this book from a friend, and didn't think I'd read it. But after I read the begining scene, I was hooked.  The book seemed a little slow starting out (after the great opener), but I stuck with it. As soon as the main characters get to the elf stronghold, things kick into high gear. One of the characters, a woman wizard, finds a way into an abandoned 'storage' dimension, which seems interesting enough for a whole book of its own. But they just use it just to get to Dun Tharows, where the main villain infests the forest.  A good ending, and I hope to see more from this author 
 Great compilation.  Now if we can get "Bulletin Board" on CD, all will be right with the world :) 
 Awaken the Giant is an amazing book and a great first step. Read it and then take the next step and go to Unleash the Power within Seminar. If it wasnt for Tony's Books and Audio program, I would have either been in jail or be dead! I went from not caring about anyone but me, to wanting to serve everyone and having a beautiful family with 2 little angels. I went from making 1-2k a month to 100k in my first year and then 450k the next 10 months. Read this book, then when you are ready, either but the get the edge cd's or go to his UPW seminar. It will change your life forever! 
 As many have already reviewed, this book overcomes the temptation to do the mystical thing with golf.  Most of us aren't into that (maybe that's the reason we're not scoring those low numbers).  This book is about caddying on the European tour and life on that tour we're not exposed to as much as our own here in the states.  As Crenshaw wrote about this book: "joyously reflective of why and how we play the game of golf."  Must read for golfers 
 My daughter needed this book for a psychology class in college. After reading the book she recommended that I read it. It is a book that reads easily and can really make you think 
 It's so sadddddddddd to hear the years that Minogue spent under the arms of S-A production during the 80's and early 90's, she sounds so robotic and overproduced with the same beat, the Greatest Hits represented here in some case is a good CD cos is really a CD that compiles all Kylie's work before her affiliation to Parlophone, the best CD is the n.2 cos is the deconstruction years!, so is worth it but stillis embarrasing to be at Sunset Blvd,. and be hearing out loud the first cd 
 How incredible to find my much beloved Proust placed in my equally beloved comics format!  At last, the astoundingly complex and beautiful novel is being made more accessible to the masses.   The simplistic Eurocomics style is perfect in the uncomplicating process.   Heuet has quite adroitly whittled away to the essence.    This can hopefully serve as an introduction to the masterwork; at very least, it will acquaint more with what may indeed be the greatest novel of the 20th Century.   I was particularly pleased at the attention paid to Proust's droll humor.  Can't wait for the next installment.  A profound addition to the often mundane plethora of graphic novels 
 I love this key chain, it's one of my favorite characters of all time.   I put it on my car keys and now I can find them no matter how much stuff happens to be in my bag and between me and my keys. The material is very durable and very easy to clean, I can just rub it clean with my thumb.  Also, I bought this somewhere else for 8 dollars which seemed like a bit of a rip off, but I would've paid 5 without a complaint.  The pictures and dimensions show here and completely true and I recommend this to anyone who needs a huge key chain or loves the Inuyash 
 There are so many wonderful reviews already written here. I will only say that if you happen to be a person who saw this film way back when it was first released, please do yourself a favor and watch it again.  I think it takes some maturity to really appreciate all that is given in this inspiring true story.  Daniel Day-Lewis is probably the best actor we have had in the last 25 years.  When you realize how he approaches his craft and really lives his roles and becomes a part of the person he depicts, it is amazing to see the portrayals Mr. Day-Lewis presents in any and all of his films.  Again, I didn't appreciate this film as I should have the first time I saw it and am so glad I picked it up and watched it again.  I will continue to watch it from time to time because it offers so much with regard to the human spirit and loving protection and support in this family.  Please take time and really watch this again.  You forget Daniel Day-Lewis is acting.  What a talent!! 
 Childstar is a funny (yet at the same time funny) movie. It has good acting, and an original story. Childstar is a little indie film that's quaint and witty 
 This is a great book.  Takes you behind the world of horse racing.  Lots of twists and turns.  Really enjoyed this book 
 I read this to my seven year old.  He found the story very interesting and runs about laughing about things like diameter and circumference.  He remembers the names, and the way the measurements are presented is very conceptual.  Great for young kids, but above third grade or so, I'd say it may not do a whole lot except for help remember the names.  It was a *cute* story, not anything very dramatic, and was appropriate for young children 
 This jewel caught my eye as I was browsing Barnes & Nobel.  I winced at the price ($29.95) but while perusing the book my brain began filling with flashes of inspiration, creative neurons popped like fireworks, and I was hooked.  Plus, it would look pretty on my book shelf.  I did well!  This tome has all the lists I regularly create (forgetting that I already made - and misplaced - two years ago), all the ones I haven't because I can't, and scores I would have never thought of.    The "Content Words" section is exceptional, covering math, science, social studies, and geography vocabulary.  Quiz the kids to see what they remember over summer!  We are having a blast with the "most commonly used words in the English language" section.  We do for-fun spelling tests off of the words, in numerical order.  My girls were dismayed to find themselves missing words in the first 100 most common words, and quite proud that they were both pulling 100%'ers on words 351-400.  Do you need Greek and Latin roots?  Teacher's correction marks?  Braille, Morse code, ASL?  Prefixes, oxymorons, or sesquipedalian superstars?  How about a little onomatopoeia and palindrome word play?  As a brain-warmer book - something to start the gears shifting in the morning - it's fun.  You can find enough thought-provokers, ego-boosters, and giggle-makers to roust any sluggish student (or teacher). 
 Very solid advice for professionals, consultants and service business owners.  As a marketing consultant and teacher, I recommend the book to any professional who is serious about creating multiple streams of income from an information empire. And Bly is someone who preaches what he practices 
 I have found this treatment of statistics unusually lucid and practical for the ecologist (or, I imagine, other scientist) desiring a better understanding of statistics and guidance in practical use of various types of statistical analysis. Unlike many statistical texts, it takes an almost conversational tone in explaining many concepts, using clear examples to illustrate various statistical approaches. While it is not as complete or detailed as larger statistical texts, it covers the fundamentals of most of the important tests and methods ecologists use on a day-to-day basis. One area of weakness is the treatment of classical non-parametric analyses, which Gotelli trades in entirely for Bayesian or Monte Carlo methods.   All in all, a very useful book for an aspiring ecologist to have on his or her bookshelf 
 This album has a more drum and bass/electronic feel to it, wich we did get glimpses of in other songs on other albums but it seems to be the main style for this album. I have been a long time Soul Coughing fan, but I had never really had a chance to get my hands on this album until recently but I'm glad I did give it a chance. My favorite tracks I'd probably say are "Misinformed", "St. Louise Is Listening", "$300" and "So Far I Have Not Found the Science." But the whole album is a pretty easy to just let play through. Unfortunatley the album was in my discman when it got stolen a couple of days after I bought the album, but I am now trying to find another copy of the album. Personally I think this might be thier best album, or tied with Irresistable Bliss. I might even recomend this to people who are unfamilliar with Soul Coughing, but have an open mind about music, and a slight taste for the electronic side. this is definatley a must buy album for any Soul Coughing fan 
 Mongello is a long time Disney World fan who has written a trivia book that will give the reader a lot of information that the typical guidebook will not. Of particualr interest to me was info on the age of some of the attractions as well as some history on popular attractions that are no longer a part of Disney World(such as 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Mr. Toad;s Wild Ride, etc). My only gripe with the book is with the way it's laid out. You'll read a question on one page then have to get the answer to that question 20 pages later. It's not the way one typically reads a book. Still a very good book- 4.5 Stars. 
 I'm a beginner and this magazine came highly recommended by experts at the yarn store.  At first I was amazed at the amount of advertizing.  I enjoy the variety of patterns offered.  It still may be a little too advanced for my stage of knitting when reading pattern instructions.  Overall, I look forward to future issues 
 The review on this web-page says that Ehrman regards the  (proto-)orthodox corruption of scripture as serving a polemical purpose, whereas Ehrman argues that the 'heretics' had their own method of interpretation that was immune to polemics; therefore, the purpose of the corruptions was to re-inforce the commitment of the proto-orthodox to their understanding of Jesus 
 My five year old son loved watching this documentary about Shackleton's Antarctic expedition, even though it's fairly slow, because we were able to talk about bad fortune, sacrifice, courage, and, yes, endurance. Shackleton may have failed in what he intended to do, but he succeeded incredibly in what he was called to do--save his men.  This story has important life lessons 
 I am relatively new to the world of falconry. As a result, I am reading just about everything I get my hands on. Frank Beebe is an undisputed master on the subject of falconry. I found that Mr. Beebe's style of writing, presents the information in a very easy to read & understand format. After having read this book, it convinced me that I should order his major work entitled "A Compleat Falconer". I am certain that it is most probably "The Bible" for falconry. An excellent book by an excellent author 
 If you catch this exhibit in London, you will be amazed at how many of the photos you will recognize not knowing who the photographer was.  No wonder Princess Diana allowed only one man to catch her as she truly was, simply a woman.  The fashion shots and ad campaigns are great.  His celebrity photos are ok, but Testino is fashion and that is where his best work lie.  In either b&w or color, these photos speak! 
 Have you ever seen Green Pastures, or Hallelujiah, or any of the other Studio made films of the Golden Age that feature all black casts?  I have.  Have you ever seen any of the Independent Films with all black casts made during the same period, but only seen in theatres catering to black audiences?  I have, sadly, not.  This book opened my eyes.  Forget the familiar actors of the 80's to the present day, even the great ones, this book will open your eyes to the rich heritage of black actors, and film, between 1955 and 1975, but more importantly it will reveal to you the complicated, yet glorious, world of these films, and actors, in the Golden Age of film.  If you belong to Netflix, or some other similar service then search out the films, and actors mentioned here if they are available and rent their films.  You will not be disappointed 
 I received this product in a bout a week. It arrived just in time for me needing it for class. Thank you 
 This is a good book, about a boy who goes through many hardships,and much happiness with his two best friends, Ol' Dan and Li'l Ann. They were very special friends, not only because they were extremely cute, kind, and willing to do everything the boy, Billy, wanted but also because they were dogs! And they were loyal 'till death. It is very sad, and happy at the same time. Even though it was sad, it is still one of my favorite books. I really enjoyed it.  
 Tales Out of Dunwich is a newly released book from Hippocampus Press.  "Dunwich Dreams, Dunwich Screams" by Eddie Bertin is newly published with this book.  Otherwise the remaining stories have all been released before.  I have a pretty extensive library of mythos books and anthologies, but not of periodicals, and almost all of these stories were new to me.  "Acute Spiritual Fear" by Robert Price was in the 2003 collection Disciples of Cthulhu II from Chaosium and "The Black Brat of Dunwich" was in Stanley Sargent's 2002 The Taint of Lovecraft from Mythos Books.  Tales Out of Dunwich is a handsome trade paperback and costs $20.00.  Although not discounted you can get it from Amazon where it is eligible for free shipping if you buy $25.00 worth of merchandise, but for downgraded shipping.  Production qualities seem first rate.  The page count is a generous 302...but this includes 9 pages of title page, table of contents, dedication and acknowledgements, and Robert Price's 4 page introduction.  Yes, the editing and introduction are by the ubiquitous Robert Price.  He nicely lays out the premise of the collection, which is to build on the previous Dunwich Cycle on the Chaosium label, with stories related to, inspired by or set around HPL's "The Dunwich Horror."  Price being Price there is an overly erudite and, well, irrelevant discussion of the editing and authorship of the Bible. Ehhh, maybe not so irrelevant when we get to his own story he chose for this anthology.  What I mean by overly erudite is that Price spends what seems to me an inordinate amount of time doing serious literary analysis on trifles.  I remember in the movie The Kids Are Alright Roger Daltry telling a reporter something like "Rock and roll can't stand up to all that inspecting and detecting.  So shut up."  Or more to the point, I like to paraphrase a Shoe cartoon, where Shoe is talking to the Perfessor.  This is only as accurate as my foggy memory allows.   Shoe: Whatcha reading Perfessor?  Some science fiction junk?  Perfessor (suddenly incensed):  Junk?!  Science fiction is not junk!  These authors are highly original and imaginative!  This is not junk!  This is philosophy, heavy, mind-expanding philosophy!  Shoe: So what's it called?  Perfessor: The Feast of the Khroobles.  It's about a giant meatloaf that eats Toledo.   What I really would have liked, but only got from Bertin, are authors' notes about the stories.  The cover art, by Phillip Fuller, shows a very bosomy brunette, dressed in Goth chick dominatrix outfit, with a come hither look, holding an ancient leather bound tome, no doubt the Necronomicon, with an ancient gabled house concealed mistily in the background.  Need I say it has nothing at all to do with any of the stories?  It sure isn't a picture of (deformed, albino) long suffering Lavinia Whateley.  In fact it looks like the teen dream of a bespectacled loser who reads horror and fantasy, and comes uncomfortably close to the sort of picture that would have made the book fly off the shelf into my hands several decades ago before I started compulsively acquiring mythos titles.  Maybe that's the point...   Spoilers may follow, so don't read any more if that will bother you.  I will also level some harsh criticism at some of the stories, but let me say at the outset that I highly enjoyed this collection.   Harper Williams: "The Thing in the Woods"  This novel (novella? What's the difference anyway?) comprises the bulk of the book.  Per Price this was one of Lovecraft's direct antecedents for "the Dunwich Horror" in terms of setting, prose and the plot device of two mysterious brothers and their odd mother.  As such it is of historical interest to the mythos fan but is not a mythos title at all.  It is quite a find but only really necessary to the mythos completist.  It fits in perfectly with Hippocampus' publication goals, which is to rediscover and disseminate books that were in HPL's library.  Visit www.hippocampuspress.com for more details.  The mysterious monster here is actually a lycanthrope, with nary a tentacle in sight.  Two things stand out.  First of all Williams was better at prose (but not cosmic concept) than Lovecraft, with more interesting and developed characters, and better dialogue.  The story was well paced with tension well developed, even if it wasn't very scary.  The second is that Williams' 1924 racism is particularly virulent and spiteful, making Lovecraft's own tendencies seem positively genteel.  The politest phrase used for blacks was a racist epithet.  Other more vicious epithets appear.  And the depiction of the one black character is quite derisive.  This was so matter of fact in the text that it was positively jarring and will no doubt make many modern readers squirm.  I am including this comment in my review because it might give some readers second thoughts about buying the book.   Jack Williamson: "The Mark of the Monster"  This story is from 1937, is non mythos, is not set in Dunwich and has perhaps a tenuous connection to HPL, perhaps.  Or perhaps none at all.  It could have easily been deleted, as it was also the least accomplished prose in the book.   Nancy A. Collins -  "The Thing from Lover's Lane"  I am unfamiliar with Collins' work.  Maybe someone could fill me in about whether she has any other mythos titles to her credit.  This was a story tangentially related to Dunwich, set in the Misty Valley as opposed to the Miskatonic.  Dunwich is mentioned in passing as a similar setting where weird things happen.  Definitely this is a mythos title where a girl is impregnated by an outré being, namely an avatar of Shub Niggurath (not the more Dunwichian Yog Sothoth).  Interestingly in this story Shub Niggurath avatar is depicted as a male goat creature, instead of the more usual female.  The prose was well crafted and the story enjoyable.   Robert M. Price: "Acute Spiritual Fear"  Price is well known to mythos fans.  Usually I don't like Price's writing but this is perhaps his best story, with a great premise.  At good ole Miskatonic University there is a cult that views Wilbur Whateley as the second coming.  After all he had a supernatural father and was despised of men.  Of course they are not too interested in the common good...The prose is quite good, the plotting deft and overall was top notch.   Stanley C. Sargent: "Black Brat of Dunwich"  Stanley Sargent has many published mythos stories.  A lot of Sargent's earliest mythos stuff seems pastiche-esque to me.  This particular story, however, was very good.  It was an original take on "The Dunwich Horror," casting poor old Wilbur as well meaning and misunderstood, and Armitage as a crazy evil coot, all as related years after the horror by Wilbur's now elderly tutor.  As in most of Sargent's fiction there is a strong homoerotic element.  Sometimes in Sargent's stories this particular theme is shoehorned unnaturally into the story, just because he wants it there in a very 80s kind of in your face gesture.  But is "Black Brat of Dunwich" it is a more organic element of the story and may explain the tutor's long standing loyalty to the Whateleys.  However it bugged me that this tutor was trying to get the interest of a young teen Whateley (granted 7 feet tall, inhuman, alien, goat like with extra eyes and tentacles, but the tutor seemed to think he was just human).  The illustration of this scene in The Taint of Lovecraft makes it look even more explicit.  This is not the first such image from Sargent.  For example consider the sheriff's brief mental image in "The Paladin of Worms" from Ancient Exhumation +2, which was quite gratuitous to the story.   Brian McNaughton: "The Dunwich Lodger"  McNaughton wrote the excellent collection The Throne of Bones, ghoulish instead of Lovecraftian.  He had an accomplished hand at prose and evocative imagery.  This was a terrific little story of eldritch goings on in a seedy family in a seedy motel in Dunwich.  There is a good ghoulish denouement.  Richard A. Lupoff: "The Doom that Came to Dunwich"  Lupoff is a well published author of horror and science fiction.  He has several mythos titles to his credit, and I'm sure these are due to be compiled in the upcoming Terrors from Elder Signs Press.  His story "Dingbats" in Horrors Beyond was not mythos.  In this particular tale an undecayed Whateley (only a Lovecraft fan will understand the reference!) returns to Dunwich years after the horror to find that those crazy locals are still trying to draw Yog Sothoth's attention.  I really liked this story.   Don D'Ammassa: "The Dunwich Gate"  Don D'Ammassa is also widely published.  For example, his excellent story "Dominion" appeared in New Mythos Legends, the 1999 collection from Marietta Publishing.  A traveler accidentally ends up in Dunwich, and falls into the middle of the ongoing conflict between those who want Yog Sothoth's gate opened and those who desire to keep it closed.  Another excellent story.   Gerard E. Giannattasio:  "The N-Scale Horror"  This is my first encounter with Gerard Giannattasio's fiction.  I want him to do more mythos fiction!  Especially like this highly original and highly enjoyable work.  A young man into model railroading makes a scale model of the Miskatonic Valley Railway.  It includes a scale model of the Whateley estate....   Eddy C. Bertin: "Dunwich Dreams, Dunwich Screams"  Eddy Bertin is a new name to me.  This is his homage piece to Lovecraft, with HPL's fiction mentioned in the text explicitly as fiction (usually a plot device I don't like).  It is set in the original Dunwich in England, and is a story within a story about a tourist paying homage to HPL's Dunwich's namesake village, and the fate of the original Dunwich centuries before when it fell into the sea.  Some of the story is fiction centered on Dagon and some of it actually happened to the real Dunwich way back when.  One of the main characters in the flashback is named Sarah Lovecraft, although it is not explicitly stated whether she is an ancestor of HPL.  Maybe it was just another part of the tribute.  I look forward to more of Mr. Bertin's fiction.   That's about it!  For the mythos fan there are many good stories here, making the purchase worthwhile.  However the racism by Williams (Hippocampus is trying to preserve historical influences on Lovecraft himself, and, for what it's worth, this was one of them) and brief allusion to adults and teens by Sargent may prompt some readers to pass this title by.  I will be interested in other opinions.  
  The only reason I watched this film was because Zhang Yimou directed it.  That's the respect I have for him as a director in this industry.  At first blush, I thought that Happy Times was going to be a shallow, corny type of movie.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  While there are more light-hearted moments than in Yimou's other works, Happy Times gives glimpse into the lives of common Chinese people and a much more penetrating and uplifting look into the human heart and human spirit.  From the reviews you should already know that Happy Times is about an aging Chinese man trying to court a potential wife.  He tries to persuade her by pretending to be something he is not - the general manager of a luxury hotel.  But in the process he finds himself taking responsiblity for the woman's blind stepdaughter.  How this all works out in the end is something you just have to see for yourself.  Trust me, it is an exquisite Zhang Yimou finish.  I am not at all familiar with the actors but they were all wonderful.  In particular, actress Dong Jie gives a heartbreakingly eloquent performance as the blind stepdaughter. 
 A free and democratic Iraq was supposed to become an oasis.  The U.S. has committed over $30 billion to rebuild Iraq - more than the $2.4 billion (inflation-adjusted) spent on Germany after WWII, and far more than the $2 billion originally planned to rebuild Iraq.  In addition, over 500 contractor employees have died trying to make Iraq a better place.  Goals were rarely set, and even less often met.  Yet, after three years of rebuilding, Iraqis have less power in their homes than under Saddam, oil production is about 20% below pre-Saddam days, outbreaks of easily preventable diseases like hepatitis occur for lack of clean drinking water, and thousands of Iraqis have died in sectarian conflict.  Most of the construction will end in '06; sufficient money to help pay for operation and maintenance of complex infrastructure projects is lacking; meanwhile, a RAND study found that prior successful efforts in Germany and Japan took at least five years.  So how did we get into this fine mess?  No single U.S. agency was in charge of planning for postwar Iraq, and the State Department was shut entirely out of the process.  Then Bremer (inexperienced in such a situation) was brought in, and the Bush machine sent innumerable inexperienced Bush supporters to help.  State of the art new hospitals took precedence over cleaning up the water supply and fixing up those already existing.  No bid contracts, rigged contracts to benefit political supporters and U.S. firms, cost-plus contracts with questionable costs, lack of documentation for U.S. installed equipment, and possible permanent damage to Iraq's oil fields followed.  Miller then goes on to document riding in a convoy that is attacked, U.S. companies and many Iraqi workers withdrawing because of the danger, ballooning private security costs (50% of some projects), lack of oversight, and enormous cash payouts without even receipts 
 Simple to read.  Non-expensive formulas.  Will be a great reference book for years.  I especially like how it gives a breakdown of the traditional uses/functions of traditional components 
 The cable was perfect -- exactly what I needed, but it took way too long, over ten days, to get here 
 I bought "Ramblin'" as a scratched LP back in the late 60's and have loved it ever since.  After all these years it is pure magic to hear it as it was originally recorded.  The New Christy Minstrels went beyond  just being a folk group; they combined extraordinary musical talents and  strong personalities such as Barry McGuire putting together songs of  beauty, power, nostalgia and pure fun.  Add to the experience the album  "Today" (the soundtrack from the Glenn Ford film "Company of  Cowards") and you have a truly enjoyable album, with the title track  one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs of all time.  I only hope now  that other NCM albums, such as "Land of Giants" and "In  Person" are also going to be made available very soon 
 excellent for the backyard birder.  It offers really useful ideas for attracting birds and keeping them coming to your yard 
 If you're one of King's constant readers you will agree that The Talisman was all King.  Black House seems all Straub.    The narratvie reads like a screenplay, which at times is drudging.      You look and look and sometimes you find King, buried in a sentence here and there ... here and now.  But (and here I'll use Black House style of narrative) as we float over Straub's neighborhood, and as we float over the Safeway, which  seems to have a sale on toilet paper, we reach Mr. Straub's home.  He is scratching his head with one hand while the other tentative hand is resting on the keyboard of his computer.  He's stuck.  He can't seem to come up with the next sentence.  Then he 'flips' and there is King, next to him, and he whispers into Straub's ear, and Straub has the next sentence.  So as we read Black House we know it's Straub, but the haunt of King is evident throughout the novel.  It's Straub's writing style, but it's King's imagination.  Oh, and the DT tie-in's are executed masterfully 
 this is an interesting book.  I had previous versions of this book and they're usually very inspiring.  I hope this new book can meet the bar 
 One day, while Amelia Bedelia, the housekeeper who literally takes everything literally, was cleaning, the phone rang. It was Mrs. Rogers, calling from the airport. She was supposed to meet the new teacher, but the plane was late. To further complicate matters the phone was out at the school. Mrs. Rogers wants Amelia to go by the school and tell them the teacher will not be there today. Amelia attempts to do just that, but the principal mistakes her for the new teacher and that's when all the fun starts. Amelia Bedelia teaching a classroom full of children, imagine that. Well, my almost three-year-old son Devon and I imagine it all the time.  Devon already knows his letters, upper and lower case. He knows they make words and he loves to sit while I read Amelia Bedelia stories to him. We've been doing it for over a year now. At first I made up the story line as his didn't have the attention span or the ability to understand. Now I've started reading, pointing to the words as I go along. Ms. Parish has written an excellent series for children and in this one, Lynn Sweat's illustrations set off Amelia's tales to a tee. If you want your toddler to read early, and I do, then this is a series for you.  Jack Priest, Dad in Trainin 
 Thanks for keeping a Brit sane in a country full of "My wife says..." jokes.  Your wife is fat and ugly and I don't care what she says. Because she's ugly. And fat...  ..and not my wife 
 Everyone thinks this movie is about Anthony Hopkins living out some demented "Gorillas in the Mist" nightmare.  That is simply the catalyst for teaching us something about how we relate to the world around us.  Everything about this movie is about control, the desire to control those who are not like us, the desire of the guards to control the population, the desire of Gooding's character to contol Hopkins.  But, what Hopkins has to teach us is that we are not in control, but we simply hold onto our illusions of control.  When our illusions are threatened we become angry and frightened because we are afraid of the reality.  Ever wonder why we are so disturbed about a home invasion?  Is it because someone came in, or because we had built up an illusion that we were safe, and now that illusion is gone?  In this movie look past the gorillas and the corny guards and the predictable plot, look deeper into what the characters reveal about ourselves.  Truly, then this is a very frightening movie 
 A+ Certification All-in-One Exam Guide is an excellent choice for anyone interested in the nuts and bolts of computers. Whether it be understanding your own system, or for the A+ certification test this is the book 
 I just bought this book for my boys ages 4 and 3. And this book is great.  It really teaches you step by step how to draw.  I am very bad at drawing if it is anything other than stick people.  But I am actually learning  right along with the kids.  It is great.  It is full color, and you can  reuse it many times with many children 
 I'm very impressed!  I especially like the long playing life of a single AAA battery 
 There are very few books in my life that I intentionally re-read; there are so many books and so little time that it sometimes seems a dis-service to be re-reading things.  I have a short list of things I like to revisit - a list of literary and other classics that I try to re-read (sometimes in different edition or translation) once per decade or so.  However, this book, 'The Scope of Our Art: The Vocation of the Theological Teacher', edited by L. Gregory Jones and Stephanie Paulsell, is one that I have read four times in the four years that I have had it.  I first got a copy back in the fall semester of 2001; I have since re-read it at the beginning of each academic year of 2002, 2003, and have just finished it again in preparation for 2004.  This year I face new challenges: I will teaching in three different courses at my seminary (the heaviest teaching load I've had there); and, this will be last year teaching there - possibly my last year teaching theology and spirituality subjects anywhere.  I was familiar with Jones and Paulsell from other works; both have books that are on my shelf in ready location for easy reading.  They each have a spirit about their writing that touches me deeply; their sensitivity extends to discerning those other voices that complement their own.  This book reaches me in ways I continue to find astonishing - my deepest longing is to be a teacher in the field of theology, and this book discusses that vocation, that calling, in a truly theological and spiritual sense.  The title of the book derives from the statement by Gregory Nazienzen, 'The scope of our art is to give wings to the soul.'  I have always had a stronger call to the lectern than the pulpit, but lacked words and community in which to work through the implications of this vocation (it is somewhat ironic that many seminaries generally don't do much by way of nurturing potential theological school and seminary instructors, being so focussed on turning out ministers for the church).    The book has three organising ideas - formative practices, the context of the theological classroom, and the context of the theological school (as an institution, distinct from internal classroom issues).  Many of the practices for formation as a theological teacher can be broadly applied to ministers and teachers in other disciplines.  Looking at practices such as writing, reading, contemplation (even in the midst of chaos and overwork), and basic community and kinship that forms in vocational sharing of identity and purpose.  This formation section is introduced by W. Clark Gilpin, who makes a plea for greater connection with the public good in education, as opposed to the insularity that typifies so much of graduate education today.  The exploration of theological teaching in the classroom takes on four dimensions in the essays offered here:  teaching as conversation, as a ministry, as the cultivation of wisdom, and a process (dialectical, perhap) of teaching and learning as continuous prayer.  As these are teachers writing primarily to other teachers, they look at what they can get from their students as much as to what they can give.  There is a community sense that grows in the classroom, albeit one with various dynamics inherent in any kind of situation where there is power imbalance.  Also, the intention of students have changed - as Paul Waddell states in his essay, the idea of going to university for intellectual and moral growth would 'sound quaint to most student today,' who instead seek career-oriented courses with marketability.  The final section looks at the place of teaching - alas, not all can get a plum, tenured position in a big name European or Ivy League school.  Frederick Norris talks about 'vocation in the outback' - doing theology in non-spotlight locations, which was also true in the ancient church.  Norris looks at the example of the Cappadocians, working in places not noted for academic or political prominence.  Indeed, Norris proposes that theology teachers might be more apt to be attentive to the needs of God, community and the movement of the spirit when they are located in places that are not so heavily invested in ideas such as 'reputation'.  The editor Jones, in one of his own essays, discusses the tensions and discernment of vocation is very clear and wonderful terms - he discusses with refreshing frankness the idea that discernment is not an easy business, and that there will be those persons involved who, 'sometimes for understandable reasons and sometimes for pernicious ones,' stand in the way of vocation.  Where was Jones when I was fighting with my church, who dogmatically held that their position on discernment was infallible?  As this is my final year as a student at my seminary, and thus my final year of teaching at my seminary (perhaps my final year of teaching theological subjects anywhere), the texts are all the more meaningful as I try to discern how one can carry on such a vocation in the absence of any school or church setting.  I am certain as I continue to think about these issues, this book will be a constant companion.  I recommend it without reservation to teachers in theology schools, seminaries, religious studies departments, and those who would aspire to such vocation.     
 This is by far the best Strategy Guide I own. Just about everything was covered in the book. Yes, it did have a few Gammatical errors but it was to the point. A few secrets I thought they could do better covering, such as chocobo breeding. 
 Im a HUGE Nancy fan and have all her books original & Revised...this book is amazing! Very different from all other Nancy books very surreal... and you are insane if you pass this up. Like I said before, this book uses a different recipe and its great!!!!!!:- 
 This DVD is awesome!  It has so many different sections to it, and its only, what, 10 dollars?  The bellydancer is very talanted and there is a warm up, shimmy drills, and 3 dances to learn from beginning to advanced - within those are the performance, chorography and chorography breakdown.  The drummer is great too, there is even a rhythm workshop with the drummer and the bellydancer.  She talks as if you're right there with her, love it!   But, its not terribly easy..  I only had one video before this and it isn't very easy for me.  Its not extremely hard either but it takes practice. I recommend it 
 In the introduction to this book Joan Acocella tells Zweig's story as a writer.  One of her claims is that despite his enormous popularity as biographer, essayist, writer of great novellas and  stories, this novel is his masterpience. The novel is in essence the story of a feeling, of 'pity' of how it becoming the obsession and duty of the main character turns self- serving and  destructive. Briefly , the book revolves around the relationship between a poor Austrian officer Hoffstein and a crippled seventeen year old daughter of a wealthy family Edith Kekesfalvas. After he has inadvertently insulted her by having asked her to dance he becomes bound into a relationship with her, in which she falls deeply in love with him without his truly reciprocating. This is how Acocella reads the protagonist's reasoning and its result after her doctor informs him that it would be disastrous for him to abandon her.   "So he descends ever deeper into hypocrisy. In the process, Zweig gives us a piercing analysis of the motives underlying pity. Gradually Hofmiller realizes how much he enjoys the courtesies paid to him for his emotional services, how it pleases him that when he arrives at the Schloss his favorite cigarettes--and also the novel (its pages already cut) that he had said in passing that he wanted to read--are laid out on the tea table. Nor is it lost on him that his own sense of strength is magnified by Edith's weakness and, above all, by his growing power over the Kekesfalvas, the fact that if he, a poor soldier, does not present himself at teatime, this great, rich household is thrown into a panic, and the chauffeur is dispatched to town to spy him out and see what he is doing in preference to waiting on Edith. Beyond the matter of power, however, Hofmiller finds that the emotion of pity is a pleasure just in itself. It exalts him, takes him to a new place. Before, as an officer, he was required only to obey orders and be a good fellow. Now he is a moral being, a soul."  This end in destruction is somehow a foreshadowing of what would happen to Zweig.Having been betrayed with the rise of the Nazis  by the Europe he loves, tried to make a new home and life with his  second wife in Brazil. But it does not work out and the both of them  are found after having taken fatal overdoes of drugs hands intertwined.     
 TV on the Radio have a really creative and unique new sound brewing, but they have some work to do in terms of listenability. Their eccentric mix of lo-fi, free jazz, indie, and trip hop can be emotionally compelling and even a bit disturbing in a few places, such as "Staring at the Sun" and "Wear You Out;" while their lyrics are often very good, with a strong sense of observation and a slightly manic-depressive mood, such as in the poetic verses of "Dreams" and "Poppy." Unfortunately, the band's creativity needs more focus because their sound is usually very monotonous and dreary, especially in tracks like "King Eternal" and the a-capella "Ambulance," in which interesting ideas are repeated ad nauseam to the point of sluggishness. And while musical director David Andrew Sitek has come up with some esoteric if snoozy grooves, guitarist Kyp Malone really needs to broaden his sounds and skills, and to move beyond the repetitive drone strum and simplistic chords that he borrowed straight from Velvet Underground. TV on the Radio have an interesting ultrahip sound and they have loads of potential, but they're not groundbreakers yet. [~doomsdayer520~ 
 This case is perfect! Super heavy duty, low profile, good looking, and has a study removable belt clip.  It works with an 80G ipod. You payed $350 for a pod, why not drop a few extra bones on a great case to make sure it doesn't explode when it falls out of your pocket 
 Why in the world is it not out till 2010? or is that wrong 
 If you love Carl Cox you'll melt over this album.  It is the kind of disco/house music that makes you shed tears of happiness.  it also has the power to make you want to dance wherever you're listening to it. I can hardly wait to see him perform live at Coachella!  He's the greatest and so is this album!!! 
 'The Last Playboy' gives an in depth look at the exciting party life of Porfirio Rubirosa. In his day he was perhaps the world's premiere ladies' man --- a Cassanova of modern times. Married to two of the richest women in the world along with 3 other women during his life this didn't stop him from dating such Hollywood starlets as Zsa Zsa Gabor & Ava Gardner among hundreds of other women. His polo playing, jet setting, drinking, womanizing and car racing were offset only by his work for Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo as a diplomat whose daughter he also married. Mega bucks from many of these women fueled his non-stop party lifestyle until he wrapped his Ferrari around a tree near his home in France at the age of 56. This book also details his friendships with the Kennedy's, Frank Sinatra and other luminaries of that era. This is a high-flying page turner of a biography that really delivers the goods.  
 The original film was something close to 4 hours.  It had to be edited, cut and chopped up into something that would do well in theaters without being as long as "Titanic".  This DVD version is barely 2 hours long.  I remember seeing a movie that was at least 2 hours and 30 minutes if not 3 hours long.  It shouldn't jump right into the rookie crashing after 2 races.  There were at least 3 or 4 races that built up to the rookie's crash in which his limitations brought on by fear were all pointed out in each race showing his lack of experience.  Since the "coin bit" was one of the most important scenes in the movie, why was it cut down to a fraction of its original greatness?  The original  scene played the entire song, For the Love of Money, from beginning to end.  A lot of Joe's driving was cut out.  The DVD version focuses on Jimmy Bly only.  Beau's driving footage does not even exist on the DVD.  The only time you see Memo drive is right before he wrecks in the rain.  The original movie focused on every driver's style and noted a lot more details to help distinguish each driver.  There was also a race where Memo crashed after trying to pass Jimmy Bly and was kicked off of the team for not listening to Carl Henry BEFORE Joe Tanto was called in as a replacement.  There was a LOT more first person driving action going on as well.  This is a terrible hack job. A director's cut should be re-released containing all of the footage that was removed.  I cannot stand when this happens to great movies.  This is not fair to racing enthusiasts or the directors for their effort to truly capture what racing is about.  I don't care how well Kip Pardue can play a rookie driver.  I want to see the real driving 
 This book not only tells you the progression a child with Down Syndrome should follow, it then gives you suggestions of things to work on and checklists at the end of each chapter so you know what your child should be doing before you really move on to harder skills. Wonderful help for both a parent and a professional 
 Medjugorje Day by Day is a truly inspirational book. It was given to me by a non-believer who I work with every day. Each morning I read it, there seems to be a lesson for that day which finds it's way into my heart and  influences the way I treat others. I believe this book has been a vessel,  not only for me to receive grace and gifts from the Holy Spirit. But, it  helps me live better as a Christian and, I pray effects those around me in  a postive way. I feel my friend has, in return,  gained many graces from  the book also, without ever having read it 
 What a delightful read.  I can feel this goddess connecting from within.  I love the way the book is written, with short insightful narratives all tied together into a gentle push toward happiness 
 Fabulous book!  Every recipe I have tried so far has turned out great.  I already knew a bit of Indian cooking and I have learned many new techniques from this book.  Wonderful recipes, from simple/everyday recipes to very fancy food. 
 I'm not much for self-help books!  However, I wish I had found this book years ago. It is universal, timeless, and a "real" handbook for life. I want to give a copy to everyone I know.  It's about much more than transforming relationships in the traditional sense. No, it's not another love book or "Women are from Mars and Men are from Venus" kind of book. It's about our relationship with ourself and our life as much as it is about our relationship with lovers, friends, parents, children, or co-workers.  Emery in a very simple manner explains how to make our life and our relationships workable.  He highlights ideas, perceptions, and self images that don't work for us (any of us) and explains where they came from.  He explains the mechanics of it in a way that makes it easy to execute. This is a very simple book, easy to read, and one that I will read many times. It will be the first gift I give to anyone I have a romantic relationship with in the future 
 Just as Doug Peacock stuggles to reconcile his rocky relationship with Cactus Ed through a spiritual and physical return journey to Charlie Bell Pass, so Peacock's new book, "Walking it Off," finds itself struggling to form its own identity in the wake of its predecessor, the gigantic "Grizzly Years."  Had "Walking it Off" been a first book, it would stand as a remarkable achievement.  But Peacock has already shown what he's capable of in his earlier book, and this second volume can't quite reach the level of "Grizzly Years."  That book is the very finest of several types of memoirs -- ecological, post-war, "my life with Ed" among them.  "Walking it Off" feels almost like a long-delayed epilogue, never reaching (and not aspiring to reach) the level of its parent volume.  This is especially apparent when the long-delayed Vietnam flashback finally appears in the latter third of the book, as if attempting to conjure the power of similar scenes found in "Grizzly Years."    By all means, read it.  Buy it and reserve a place on your Abbey-related titles shelf.  It is filled with thoughtful episodes, both large and small.  Unlike so many other Abbey-related books, it presents a more delicate picture of Ed.  We find through Peacock the observant, quietly smoldering Abbey of "Desert Solitaire," not the gruff self-caricature created to sell latter titles like "Good News" and promulgated by Loeffler and the like.  But read and re-read "Grizzly Years" if you're as interested in Doug Peacock as you are in Ed Abbey, as I am 
 I love the Wei Chuan series and own many of their books, this book is a nice addition to my collection I would've given it more stars if there were more recipes. It's a small collection which includes a lot of chicken, beef and shell fish recipes. It only has one lamb recipe and some vegetable dishes. I was looking for a more comprehensive cookbook 
 This book by Jon Canfield is very well written and clear.  It helps enormously in learning the many settings and details that are needed to make good prints.  It talks about both Windows and Mac. It discusses the pointers needed to run your printer with Photoshop controlling the color management.  I think it is excellent for the serious digital photographer who is begining to print their own images and who wants quality output.  Very readable 
 Bringing the cultures of China back into the world, once again, Amy Tan completes yet another exquisite piece of work, in composing The Bonesetter's Daughter. Ruth Luyi Young is the daughter of LuLing Liu Young, two characters in which the novel's central theme revolves around, discussing the importance of family and mother-daughter relationships. As the novel is written in the perspective of both Ruth and LuLing, one can easily trace the steps of their family's early history, culture, and traditions, such as the importance of ink making and Chinese calligraphy, the history of the bonesetter, and the famous "curse of the bonesetter's daughter" which was cast upon Ruth and LuLing's family. During the course of these events, Ruth and LuLing both come face to face with reality, realizing that life is not as easy as it may seem and that everyone should cherish it no matter what, which subsequently impacts their relationship towards each other and brings them even closer together. The Bonesetter's Daughter is a story that all teens, and even mothers should read, because it reminds people of what they have and to not take advantage of it. It especially reminds daughters and mothers of the importance of that special mother-daughter bond and how important family should be 
 Great story and start to the series.  If you like Gemmell's Drenai stories, then the 4 book Rigante series is for you.  It is typical Gemmell with lots of action and great heroes.  If you enjoy this one, pick up the rest of the series..Midnight Falcon, Ravenheart and Stormrider 
 The Company is certainly an epic. It's easy to offer comparisons to Norman Mailer's sprawling 'Harlot's Ghost' but this would be unfair as they are vastly different books. The Company is very hard to put down, once you get past the slightly ponderous descriptions of the 50s and the Hungarian war, but once it hits stride, it's a top notch read. To call it a mere thriller is certainly selling it short. There's enough action to satisfy the most ardent Le Carre and Clancy fans and enough to satisfy fans of Graeme Greene's 'entertainments' as the fictional characters make their way through the narrative, there's plenty of interaction with the famous and infamous. One of my few criticisms was the stereotypes Littell reduces many of these real life people to (Kennedy the playboy, Reagan the ignoramus, Yelstin the alcoholic) but it's a small gripe.  Well worth a read 
 I LOVE TIMOTHY WRIGHT SO MUCH THAT I HAVE ALL HIS MUSIC HE EVER MADE ,I REALLY LOVE THE CD HE JUST MADE IT REALLY LIFTS MY SPIRITS WHEN I AM HAVING A BAD DAY SO I JUST LISTEN TO THE FIRST SONG AND I AM OK THE REST OF TE DAY 
 The main character and narrator of the story is Lara. She is 16, thin, beautiful, smart, and popular. Soon she begins to gain some weight. When watching what she eats and working out longer doesn't seem to help, she ends up developing an eating disorder. Over a short amount of time, Lara weighs over 200 pounds. Her life has changed dramatically. She is no longer the envy of all the other girls at her school, instead, they act differently toward her and she begins to hear negative comments by them. Her relationship with her boyfriend is strained and another girl, a former friend, is competing for his attention. Her family is dysfunctional and shallow, and they get worse with one another. Her father is disgusted by Lara's weight gain, her mother doesn't believe her when she says she is not overeating, and her brother is growing angrier by the day, especially when he starts to hear comments about her weight gain in school. It takes a while, but eventually all the doctors and her family realize that the weight gain has nothing to do with Lara's activities, and it is actually biological.   While some readers may be put off by Lara's initial attitude toward overweight people, it is an important part of the story. By inventing the Axell-Crowne Syndrome, the author made it possible to have Lara's weight gain out of her control. She has become someone that she use to pity and be disgusted by, yet she still feels herself to be better than them because she isn't lazy and doesn't eat like a pig. She feels that she should have more sympathy because of this, but nobody cares. In society today, we don't care why people look different, due to being overweight, or having a birth defect, etc, it is just wrong and therefore these people should hide themselves from the public eye. Eventually by the end of the novel Lara finally realizes that that was the person she use to be, judging and shallow, even though she always felt that she was better than that. Yet, she is able to begin to come to term with her weight through new friends that show her that what you weigh doesn't define you as a person.   The author gives wonderful insight into the days of an overweight person, by having Lara not fitting into public seats, overhearing harsh comments about herself (from strangers and former friends) and having to shop in special stores for overweight women; not to mention the depression it causes her. This was an interesting read that would make for great discussion, but it is not what I would consider to be a great writing. But it did hold my interest and I would recommend it to those who are interested in issues of weight gain, eating disorders, high school life and thought provoking readings. 
 Fans of the show know it hit the skids after losing its news anchors, the divine Khandi Alexander and the stupendous Phil Hartman. Get this today 
 I was 16 in 1986 when I was first introduced to Callanetics.  Over the last 20 years I have done my share of Tae Bo, Aerobic traing, running, and weight training. However, I can trully say that Callenetics gives you by far the fastest results.  This has always motivated me when I've been in an exercise rut.  Combining deep muscle positions and tiny prescise and powerful movements is the key to its success.  The best part is that it is a "no impact" exercise, so it is great for people with back injuries (See Callanetics web site)  But let me warn you, its a killer!!!! Until you master the positions, you will scream out loud!!  And you will see and feel instant results.  Try it, you will not be sorry.  Combine this with some cardio and some yoga and you will feel increadible in just days!! Honestl 
 Outstanding resource for accessing creativity personally and in the workplace.  Chic identifies common "Killer Phrazes" which thwart our actions and gives excellent, fun suggestions for stamping them out.   This book is extremely "user friendly".  Easy to read, funny -  with exercises along the way to drive home the points.  He gives practical  ways to use mind mapping, metaphors,and analogies to help you get your  thinking unstuck and to uncover new solutions.  As a creative thinking  trainer, I have shared Chic's ideas and strategies to hundreds of  individuals across the U.S.  The feedback I get is extremely positive.  As  a matter of fact, his ideas helped me structure my course in a much more  innovative, impactful way.  Use Chic's ideas and watch the people in your  environment become more creative, more open to new ideas, more productive  and have one whole heck of a lot of fun 
 Writing is very lyrical, with excellent use of imagery.  Ninety percent of the metaphors work.  However, some of the metaphors do not make comlete sense in context and are mixed (See LRB article by Nicholas Spice).   Although some reviewers dislike the books non-linear storytelling and structure, I thought it worked well.  Each of the scenes feeds into the next and allows reader to get a better understanding of character, events, or themes.  The book is not entirely historically accurate and is more similar to taking a trip inside a very imaginative and talented person's stories based on history. The use of imagery and the creative, if not entirely accurate, use of historical events or people as "snapshots" that evoke feelings or ideas is a theme that occurs extensively throughout Ondaatje's poetry (ex: "Elizabeth"), so it is not surprising to find it in his novel.   Another weakness with the novel was that the characters and events often functioned more to explore themes, which made the character behave in ways that would not be truly realistic.  The English patient, Katherine, and Hana and lost some depth becuase of this.  Kip is probably the most multidimensional character in the book.  The movie, especially Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas, did a far better job of bringing the other characters to life. You would probably enjoy this book if any of the following are true: you like the poetry of Wallace Stevens, you like and prefer historical fiction that is romantic or has strong story telling elements over historical fiction that is 100% true to its time (think Tale of Two Cities, Love in the Time of Cholera, Gone with the Wind, etc.), or you are not a historical event nitpicker.   A novel does not always have to be historically 100% accurate (hence the term FICTION), but is often an exploration of emotions, themes, or ideas.  I enjoyed the novel, even though it was not "perfect. 
 I don't even LIKE history or economics...but I love this book.  In the course of researching some historical background for an English Lit paper, I ran across two of Braudel's books -- this was one of them.  It was so fascinating that I read the entire book (even though what I needed for the paper was a few pages); and then I went ahead and bought my own copy, plus others by this author 
 When picking up the latest by Trevanian, a reader must bear in mind that Trevanian is a versatile author and that his latest may resemble nothing he has written before. Yet he is one of those rare authors who succeeds, no matter what genre he tries. If you read The Crazyladies of Pearl Street expecting a spy novel like Shibumi, you will be disappointed. If you are a curious reader, expecting to be stimulated and entertained, and to appreciate a good prose, then you will find what you are looking for here.  The Crazyladies of Pearl Street is an autobiographical book (sort of), which is narrated by the young Jean-Luke. The story beings with Jean-Luke, his mother and his sister Anne-Marie arriving at Pearl Street, basically a slum. His health-wise fragile, mood-wise fickle mother has received a mail from her husband asking them to join him in Albany. But we never meet the man. We learn that he is a conman, appearing for brief periods of time, enough to charm the mother and get her pregnant, then disappearing, never to be heard from again for many years. So begins the life of this small family on Pearl Street. It is actually the story of an impoverished family on welfare, hardly affording anything, feeding on what the government can spare them. But for a story of such destituteness, it is not a depressing one. Quite the contrary it is filled with nostalgia for a whole different time, when radio and going to the movies supplied the sole entertainment, when America learned to grow up with World War II, when even the soon to be criminal boys of ghetto did not swear. It is a real story that takes you to the 30s and 40s America. Yet I think the trick here isn't that those were the good old days, but that these are the childhood memories of our author. Like every other childhood memory, this one has a longing you can associate with, even though you have never listened to a radio show that did not include pop music in your life. I can only imagine that such childhood memoirs can be very boring as the subject of a novel, but this one's written by Trevanian and not even for one sentence does it lag. From the first page to the last, it is captivating. I love it when a novel can transport me to a time and place I have never been, and does it so successfully that I do not feel like a stranger for one minute, and Crazyladies of Pearl Street does just that.  For Trevanian fans, this novel is double fulfilling because it gives you an insight into the mind of this mysterious author. I thoroughly enjoyed reading his takes on radio versus television, IQ tests, religion, contemporary American politics... Some of which are in his cybernotes, not in the novel.  Highly recommended to Trevanian fans and non-fans alike 
 So I compared book one in this barely connected duo to "literary tiramisu".  Too (maybe) overwork the food metaphor this novel is like a silly, crunchy first course like coconut shrimp.  Kinda makes you smile, completely enjoyable, definitely too light for the whole meal but too much fun to resist on special occasions.  The most fun about the novel is the sense of play--right from the beginning the bored, overworked and dour male lead finds a pretty young woman fallen on his floor and rather than send her on her way to the police--maybe out of boredom or attraction--he plays along with her fantastical story.  He is helped to discover his more lighthearted, romantic self and our female lead a more serious, maybe even mature side.  Plus the secondary characters are a delight and I even learned more about oil paint vs. water paint and glass blowing as an art form.  No way to go wrong here--just remember it's only a snack!   
 This is one of our favourite books.  A humorous look at a new addition to the family.  This was the perfect story for our two children when #3 child arrived, the humour takes away some of the stress and expectation for young children when a new baby is joining the family.  Also a great gift 
 Every illustration in this book is a cartoon, and in many of the illustrations a cat, dog, lion, or some other animal will make some kind of random comment.  This was pretty funny, but not quite as funny as the cartoons in another Lets-Read-and-Find-Out Science book called Digging Up Dinosaurs.  According to this book, the sticky saliva in your mouth catches germs and prevents them from going inside your body to cause further damage.  I didn't know that.  Hope all the information is correct 
 Gregory Corso must have been sitting in an empty room, with nothing more to think of than the emotions controlling his mind. In this book of poetry, the reader will gain a new appreciation for his work. The Happy Birthday of  Death is one of the most powerful, and intense collections of writing  available 
 This is a terrific book.  It by the far the most readable and enlightening yet on a battle that rates among the most fascinating to anyone drawn to military history. 
 The DaVinci will find this book a mirror of his/her being.  Loporto has nailed and reaffirmed my own life experience. I have just read the book and haven't had time to determine how much difference it will make in my life, but I find I already have a different attitude toward myself and my purpose in life.  A very important aspect of The DaVinci Method is that it will be helpful to those who have a relationship with a DaVinci.  I doubt that anyone who is not a DaVinci can grasp the totality of what they read here, but it should go a long way toward helping them to understand and give support.  Most all of the ADHD books I own are really about suppressing the DaVinci gene (impossible!) so the individual will better fit into society and relationships--a recipe for further neurotic behavior.  This book is about how non-neurotic DaVinci's have changed society for the better.  This information has given me the knowledge, motivation and courage to move ahead with my life.  I intend to read it again and again.  I expect it to become the new ADD'er's "bible. 
 This book was great.  It read well and never was too slow.  It was fair to both sides of the war and the leaders who fought the battles and planned the campaign.  It was complete in that it discussed the men, tactics, weapons, and terrain in the southern campaign.  Not only was this book a great souce for the southern war but it also gave good insight into the revolutionary war in general.  If you're interested in this topic and want to increase you're knowledge of the southern war, get this book.  It's informative as well as pleasing to read 
 This book really explains what the stages of writing a book proposal feel like and look like. Maisel discusses all the false starts, sudden endings, and re-starts, the works.  It is equally heartening to have someone clearly spell out the single most important aspect of writing a book (or proposal), that it involves repeated, concentrated, hard-worked-on thought.  As I coach people who want to write book proposals (and books) as part of what I do professionally, I can't thank Eric Maisel enough for offering such an insightful and truthful book on this topic. He has done everyone who is thinking of writing a proposal an enormous service. This book is vastly different from all the existing books on this subject, too -- no mean feat, in and of itself -- considering how many really good books there already are on this topic.  
 let's be honest, as a first year book, kaldeweij is better, but oxford undergrads, suffering morgan's lectures, have to suffer the novel too 
 Oh boy, oh jeez, oh what an album. I'd give it 10 stars if I could. Sonny Stitt is on your left speaker and Gene Ammons is on your right. It's good to know that because these two guys go at it lick for lick, and it's up to you to choose your favorite. I'm goin' with Ammons on this blowing session! "Blues up and Down" is the 'Hammer' of the album. It is explosive in every sence of the word. The more I hear it the better it is, and I've been hearing it for quite some time now. Every person that has hung out at my house and heard this album has either bought it right away, or has begged me to burn them a copy. As smokin' as this album is, it has a romantic side to it, especially on tracks like "There is no Greater Love" and "Autumn Leaves". "Autumn Leaves" is more beautiful than any woman you can see on the street, and we all know how many beautiful women walk the streets of New York on a hot summer day! Ok so I'm a cheez-head, but listen to it and you will hear my point. Buy it and play it loud!! 
 Nice, heavy-duty grapefruit spoon, but elegant, too.  Narrow handle, but very, very sturdy.  I'm very pleased with these spoons 
   This doesn't come across on the pic as well as in person.  Well made, excellent buy, great vendor.  Prompt, have used before and will again 
 So what would happen if nuclear terrorists and drug traffickers linked up to threaten the United States?  Peter Schechter explores this twist in his first novel Point Of Entry.  I got the opportunity to read an advance reader copy of the novel, and I really got absorbed into this one...  The United States wants to push an international sanction on Syria for their involvement in housing terrorists.  There isn't a clear-cut majority in the UN Security Council to pass this, but Columbia's new female president is willing to deliver Latin American votes if the US changes some policies (like their Cuban embargo).  Even though the US president isn't likely to change the current policies, he does start communicating with her via email accounts that no one knows about.  In the process, they both start to fall for each other, although it would never work out in real life.  When she discovers a plot by her political rivals to transport uranium via drug channels into the US for a nuclear bomb, she has to make hard painful choices.  The right thing is to tell the president, but by doing so he'll end up sending troops into Columbia to find the material, thereby dooming her chances to remain in power.  And if he reacts the way everyone wants him to, he'll destroy the woman he's fallen in love with as well as alienate an entire region.  But to do nothing means that millions of Americans will likely die...  What to do?  This book reads like the headlines of CNN.  Many of the assumptions and situations underpinning the story-line are pulled from real events and current hostilities.  While it might not be completely believable to think that two heads of state could carry on a cyber-relationship without discovery, it works well enough to set up the conflict between personal relationships and national responsibilities.  And unfortunately I had *no* problem believing the logistics of how drug smugglers could get uranium past our borders.  And that's scary...  If you're into thrillers based on current political headlines, grab this one and prepare to be somewhat unnerved.. 
 The book begins with an inspirational and somewhat simplistic insight into lighting design.  Simply as a study of lighting contrasts.  While this is a very important aspect of LD,  it is by far one of many concepts a professional must use.  The book refers to many technical aspects of lighting without giving any "meat" or more in depth information,  which I would have enjoyed.  If you are new to LD or are an architect or engineer who has little experience with lighting,  it is a very good lauching point.  If you are technically knowledgable about lighting and want some inspiration,  read chapter 1 and the last chapter on Design for concept 
 This is the best Tai Chi video on the market.  I've been studying martial arts for 16 years and this is the 1st Tai Chi video that i have seen that teaches the correct form move for move.  Excellent video for learning this form.  
 In Arms Of Morpheus is the history of laudanum, morphine and patent medicines is revealed from the addictive growth of a drug widely available as an over the counter medicine to treat ailments ranging from boredom to a lack of creativity. Manufacturers claimed all kinds of cures from the use of morphine: In Arms Of Morpheus traces the history of such contentions and includes plenty of ads, photos, cartoons and other embellishments to make for lively general-interest reading 
 You can't go wrong with this one. It's great. My all time favorites are The Birds and Rear Window. A great collection to watch 
 I read this book some time ago. It is one of the most fascinating books I've ever read. Eric Haney is one of the most fascinating people I've ever met. A very confident but unassuming person, that once you meet you realize he has no need to embellish his life's in Delta story with accounts based in fantasy.  Eric Haney is the real deal and a genuine person. Eric is a true leader and a brilliant man.  I am absolutely appalled at some of the claims made about Eric being less than honest in his book. What a shame that such a good American has to be trodden over by cheap and meaningless gossip. Jealousy is a terrible thing.  By the way, I believe much of the gossip is fueled by Eric Haney's comments about the Iraq war being a debacle. You simply can't go unscathed when you refuse to worship at the foot of the golden calf of the George W. Bush Iraq War.  Great book!!! Great American!!!  Gary McClaran B'ham, A 
 I see that the reviewer below hasn't heard the news. Trent has planned on releasing this on DVD. There was some protesting from his ex-manager about it, but now that the battle in court is over, Trent can re-release this. The DVD should be out before too long, so anyone planning on buying this version should wait. It's rumored that the DVD version will include the Broken movie and the videos he's released since the VHS of Closure. Until then, you can watch most of the songs on NIN.com, albeit with crappy quality 
 If you are at interested in TV or the entertainment business, this is the first book to read.  It is an extraordinary read.  It is a bit dated now, but don't let that deter you.  Auletta is an excellent writer and shows it  here.  It is long, but is as engrossing as any novel.  With apologies to  Bill Carter whose Late Shift is awesome, this is the 1 book to read if you  want to learn about TV 
 Linguist and management consultant Sarah Myers McGinty, Ph.D., shows how to communicate in many situations using just two basic styles of talking, language from the center and language from the edge.Myers McGinty also shows how to tell whether you communicate from the center or the edge and how to mix and match the two styles to attract new clients, correct employees and run meetings. Power Talk is worth a listen.    
 I love this little story of the relationship between two sisters. The performances are heartfelt and the score is haunting. It still gets me : 
 Blackberry Wine  by Joanne Harris...   By far her best.   (Yes, better then Chocolat!)  I have read all... and  I would love to see this story as a movie!!!    The Main character, Jay, a writer finds himself completely at a loss when it comes to life; despising himself, his life, even his home.  He starts to drink this "Special" wine, that was left to him from his old pal Joe... The wine makes him remember things from his childhood...  And In remembering Joe, he goes back to his childhood haunts and settles down in the village...  Where... you run into characters from Chocolat... but neither here nor there...  this books is about trust, frienship, heart and finding Joy in life.  Oh... I just LOVE this book     --Here's to hopes she continues to keep these characters... alive.  
 THIS BOOK HAS SOME DELICIOUS RECIPES AND USEFULL TIPS. CHEF MESNIER SAYS IN HIS BOOK THAT HE WILL ONLY USE INGRIDIENT THAT ARE NECESARY AND THAT MAKE A DIFERENCE IN THE RECIPE, SO HE WON'T MAKE YOU BUY AND GO CRAZY LOOKING FOR INGRIDIENTS THAT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE NEEDED. I'VE TRIED SEVERAL RECIPES AND THEY'VE JUST TURNED OUT GREAT, I MADE ALMOND DAQOISE, COCONUT MOUSSE AND SOME OTHER AND THEY'RE ALL GREAT. I TOTALLY RECOMEND IT! 
 This years madden wasn't worth all this hype over. I have every madden so far and this one was no different than last years game. Graphics are o.k,gameplay gets repeditive at points and it doesn't have the true madden gameplay as before. It's just ok not super and semi dissapointing. The things that caught me off guard was Vince Young and Reggie Bush arent starters so you have to do that on your own by going to rosters and actually making them right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Overall i wasnt amazed. Also the worst part is the new controls. You need to use the right analog stick to juke, spin and do shake n' bake moves.  please agree with me people!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Today, many people desire to see what lies ahead in life but fail to realize the ceaseless consequences that can transpire if premonitions about the future come about prior to its arrival. Macbeth is the victim in this situation, when he receives a foretelling from three supernatural witches that he would become the king of Scotland. From then on, fueled by his greed, Macbeth does anything to reign, and goes far enough as to killing his best friend. As the previous noble knight becomes a malicious evildoer, many people in Scotland yearn for his abdication or someone to put an end to his life. Soon, their wish comes through.   Though it is difficult to understand Shakespeare's style of writing and some of the language he used, this did not keep me from enjoying the book. The story itself was action-packed and had many metaphors that related to human nature.   My suggestion on reading Macbeth is to receive an overview of the story before actually reading the text, as it is extremely convoluted (but meaningful). I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading classic literature. 
 I love Fiestaware and these canisters go perfectly in my kitchen. I like that they are large enough to get a decent amount of flour and sugar in them.  The seal seems really airtight, but I did accidently splash some water on the top of them, and the water did get into the canister.  They are easy to clean and look very classic 
 This book is a must have for every public speaker. Rather you are a beginner or seasoned speaker, you can't go anywhere but up once you read and apply the success tips offered by Dottie.  Easy reading and easy to follow. Enjoy 
 Kenny did a great job with his first CD. I love all the songs on  this CD, my favorites are "All I want for Christmas Is a Real Good Tan" and "Thank God for Kids". I live in COLD Michigan and I love the upbeat sunny Christmas feeling Kenny presents in the title song. I am a preschool teacher and enjoy being around children, so when I saw Kenny recorded and included "Thank God for Kids" on its CD I definely wanted it. He does an awesome job with that song. I think he does a terrific job with all the traditional Christmas songs and it was wonderful that his Aunt and Mom join in on the song "Silent Night". Keep up the great work Kenny and keep the songs coming : 
 Margaret Atwood is a master of rhetoric and one of our most talented and original literary voices. She is an imaginative and probing investigator of life and relationships. "The Robber Bride" offers us the opportunity to follow the lives of three women friends through three decades and to vicariously experience the plethora of destructive deeds heaped upon each of them by "the villainess" of the piece who systematically befriends and betrays each of them.  Reading this book is akin playing with nesting dolls.....you keep opening them wondering what the next one looks like. 
 This book is outstanding... Period! The work that went into this book results in a standard that will be incredibly hard to beat. Even though this is a serious work in natural history I certainly WOULD recommend this as a gift for a younger child, because they would be thrilled with the photographs all by themselves. Fun to read, this book is primarily a book of nature photography. And Oh, what photographs... the book would be worth every penny just for the photos of these small animals. If nothing else have your local library obtain this book 
 Sarah Orne Jewett's THE COUNTRY OF POINTED FIRS is a visitor's tale. Set in the fictional Maine coast town of Dunnet Landing where the author/narrator has settled for the summer to write. As a visitor, the narrator inevitably recounts only the pieces of history she comes in contact with through her landlady and the people she meets in the community. The stories are portraits, bits and pieces, of lives that exist outside the narrator's brief visit. As a result, the reader feels like a companion on this holiday. The novella moves at the pace of a quiet seacoast village, and is refreshing to read for that very reason. Like a vacation, outside cares fade while focusing on the lives, habits and landscape of this place. The writing is finely wrought. A real affection for a place and people one knows briefly shines through the work and makes one wish for a time and place when travel, life and writing unfolded at a the speed of a long walk.  Some editions incorporate other stories written about Dunnet Landing into the body of the novella. This can lead to a change in the narrator's voice that is incongruous with the rest of the work. Look for a version that preserves the order of one of the early publications with other short works in a separate section. 
 For anyone wanting to understand the theory and importance of writing, whether it be fiction or nonfiction, get this book. Flannery O' Connor delves deeply into the mystery of writing, why people do it, struggle over  it, sacrifice so much of themselves in order to do it, to a slew of other  fantastic bits of information and reasons. Mystery and Manners has narrowed  my own overly broad understanding of why I write. It has helped me to  focus, not on just the many types of writing, but also on the type of books  that I read and should read in order to be a fully developed writer. O'  Connor discuses a lot on voice and plot and theme; her views are so clear  and exact. Any professional or novice writer will really appreciate her  collection of essays. More than anything, writers will appreciate O'  Connor's affirmation of their own views. They too will appreciate her  understanding of the difficulty and importance of why people write. I can  not praise this book enough 
 I had to read this book for a seminar I was going to attend.  Not being a great poetry reader I did not expect to enjoy it.  I read the book in one session, and after the first few pages did not remember that I was reading poetry.  It flows really easily, the language making it very easy to dive into the strange world of the author's Roman London.  The modern slang and approach make the setting familiar in some ways, and then the very different customs of the period bring the reader up short.  The scene set at the local "games" needs a strong stomach to read.  Highly recommended 
 I really enjoyed this latest memoir of Mr. Burroughs, almost as much as his first - RWS, Dry and MT.  My favorites were his essays on Cow & Bentley, his French Bulldogs, Julia's Child, and the essay on his paternal grandmother.  There were a few that seemed like he might be reaching for things to remember to fill out the book, but overall it was with much enjoyment that I read his latest 
 Before this album, Sepultura struggled to make a decent album. Their first two albums were plagued with horrible production quality and lack of substance but then in 1989, Sepultura released "Beneath the Remains" which became an instant classic. First of all the production quality was much better and still holds up today. This is Sepultura's heaviest album and the one with the best guitar work. The best solo is probably the one in "Inner Self". This album doesn't have the Brazilian influence on "Chaos A.D." and "Roots". This is straightforward death/thrash metal that's very similar to Slayer. My favorite songs are the title track(one of the best intros ever) and "Inner Self". This is a must-own album and is my second favorite Sepultura album. Only "Chaos A.D." comes ahead. Avoid all of the Derrick Green [...] 
 I have seen this movie twice and it is a very funny movie. I am a big fan of Jean Reno I have seen almost every movie he has stared in and every movie of his is great. I highly recommend this film to anyone that likes action and humor combined 
 Excellent book !! If you love 80's music, this is a must have. It has everything you can imagine. I bought it for my husband for christmas for his radio show and uses it almost daily ! 
 As an adult I have become more interested and fascinated with magicians and illusions.  This biography of Houdini is fantastic!  The book presents Houdini not only as one of the greatest illusionists but you see him as a person and what really motivated him.  There are lots of great pictures and much insight as to who Houdini really was. 
 The first song is so good, it's hard to allow the CD to move to the next. I need to get the rest of his albums.  Heard one of his songs on NPR, which prompted the purchase. Well worth the money spent 
 Oh BABY! What a ROCKIN collection of music we've got here! REO Speedwagon is my favorite band of all time. They just manage to produce gem after gem, effortlessly. I can't even pick a favorite song b/c in my mind they're all hits! Even the so called "bad tracks" just rock my panties off. I've been to 17 different states to see them perform plus I've thrown at least 29 bras on stage! I love these guys so do yourself a favor and pick this collection up! I'd say just get all of the albums actually but if you insist on only getting a "greatest" collection, this is a fine selection. It will save your life and give you a whole new perspective on life 
 I'm a sales manager who needs to do some training not an HR guy. If I had a dime for every book I have ordered, read or borrowed and then thrown out, I'd be rich!   Most of them are either too boring or too philisophical or too academic and they all seem to be written for the training professional in the same unrealistic way.  This book cuts right to the chase and just gives me the practical tangible stuff I need right now. There's no lecturing or tons of background theory. My people appreciate it too. After reading a few chapters I passed it along to the busiest guy who never has time for training and always makes a reason not to go--or grumbles terribly when he finally is forced to attend.  His response: "If a trainer actually made something to fit what they tell him to do I would love it! I'd even promise to go willingly!"  I passed it along to our training manager and can't wait to see the results 
 I used this product on my feet at night. When I woke up in the morning, they were so soft. I used it every night for seven nights and it worked like a charm. My feet used to be cracked and dry. Now they're very soft. I'd definitely recommend this to friends and family 
 i have the book in my lap.  i got it from the library.  very good for what i was looking for...nutrition.  very good for other stuff, too. all i recommend is taking a look at "Healing With Whole Foods: Oriental  Tradi..."  i checked it out at college last year and really liked it.   seems similar but deeper and different, too.  take a peek 
 When I first saw the "Spider-Man" film, not only was I in awe of the impressive visuals that were appearing before me,but also as much with the spectacular score that the genius Danny Elfman had composed. This is one potent,powerful and memorable Motion Picture Score that enhances the quality of this film. From the very first notes of the "Main Title",I knew this score was going to be something special - and it is! It has so much going for it.  The "Main Title" and other compositions throughout the score make great use of the choir,whether it be for fast paced action sequences or personal,emotional scenes that occur every so often.  The track "Costume Montage" also is a beautiful combination of score and guitar,and the two compliment each other well.It being one of my favourite tracks on the album. The track "Revenge",this is another pure delight from the score. It firstly commences in great style with orchestra,then as the pace and emotion gradually picks up, the forces of orchestra, choir and synthesizer combine,to produce another memorable piece.  If I were asked to mention a few of my favourite tracks from this admirable score they would have to be the following - the "Main Title","Costume Montage","Revenge","Revelation" and "Final Confrontation". This score would have to be one of the best that Danny Elfman has composed thus far in his long and illustrious career. A bold statement, but a true one nonetheless - to my way of thinking anyway 
 Short work the lays out the interesting story of the invention of the chronometer timepiece. It is bound to be found enjoyable by anyone interested in History, Sea Navigation and Innovation 
 I have been in Thailand and I like to enjoy street food, which I find it the best and tastiest of all. This book has taught me what ingredients to use and how to prepare the dishes I ate there. Now I can cook and enjoy  Thai real street food whithout going to Thailand.  My wife is Indonesian  and we have an Indonesian restaurant in Barcelona. Both cookings are  similar and we serve some Thai dishes as well, which by the way were  learned from this book 
 I am a great fan of the Chicken Soup Books.  They are a wonderful way for me to start my morning.  Being an avid gardener, this one was truely special.  Although many of the stories left me teary-eyed, the messages relayed were always positive and uplifting. -- Highly Recommen 
 First published in the 1980s, Tadao Sato's CURRENTS IN JAPANESE CINEMA was always an indespensible rarity - a comprehensive collection of writing on Japanese film NOT written by a Westerner.  This was one of my first guides to Japanese film, and it definitely stoked my interest; this book has gotten rather hard to come by, which is very unfortunate, as Japanese film seems to have gone through an enthusiastic rediscovery in recent years.  Like any great critic, Sato balances opinionated writing with accessibility; his own background - a working-class fan-turned-journalist who ultimately became one of the foremost scholars on Japanese film - gives his writing a directness that is refreshing.  Certain of his opinions and assessments can be debated; in that the man is doing his job engagingly well.  This collection is presented as an introductory work for non-Japanese readers; a bit of early Japanese cinematic history is related, but the bulk of the book focuses on major figures (Ozu, Kurosawa, Mizoguchi, Naruse, Oshima, Suzuki and Kobayashi all get some examination), with a few thematically oriented chapters as well (yakuza, period films, war films, etc), and a brief look at developments in the 1970s.  Any fan of Japanese film would do well to look for this.  -David Alsto 
 Hope Partlow proved to me there is potential in that enormous mass of pop/ rock females though. She is one I just happened to hear on the radio and I really loved the song Who We Are. The lyrics mean a lot to a world we live in these days and her voice is actually pretty strong. Then I heard Sick Inside a few times and I grew to really love that song as well for it sounds like such a painful song. I knew then I had to check her c.d. out and hear what she holds. I eventually bought it after hearing such tracks as the amazngly powerful Don't Go, the fun Crazy Summer Nights, and the hearbreaking It's Too Late. Here a short review of the entire c.d. of Who We Are:  1) Who We Are- A- The first song I heard from Hope, and it is still as powerful as the first time I heard it. The Saturday Night Mix at the end isn't much different then the original version- but the original version is better- sounding.   2) Don't Go- A+- This song is probably the strongest on here to me, and just greatly passionate Hope uses her voice just right in this song and the background music fits into the mood right.   3) Crazy Summer Nights- B+- I really like the fun feel to this song after such a serious song as Don't Go, but it definitely pales in comparison as well. It's still a fun song to hear though.  4) Sick Inside- A+- The next most powerful song on here, and now one of my most favorites. The lyrics are very mature and as I said before painful.   5) Girlfriend- B - This song kind of steps Hope back into those old songs from so many other pop- rock females. I've heard this kind of song so many times from so many young women and it's kind of immature to me, but the guitar adds up for the weakness of the lyrics.  6) Like You Do- A- She saves herself in this song. It is a slow and sweet song that I really like hearing from her, it brings back the potential I hear in her.   7) I Believe In You- C- Probably the weakest song on here to me. There's just not a lot of power to this song, I would call it a filler track for there is nothing really to praise about it. Just an average- sounding song.   8) It's Too Late- A- Once more Hope saves herself and makes a heartfelt and beautiful song here. She uses her voice nicely and it blends in well with the background sound.   9) Cold- C+- Not that good of a track either. If you're a major fan of females in this genre it probably is a fav but it sounds just average to me- ntohing unique and Hope's voice is kind of bad to me in the chorus.   10) Through It All- A- I really like the catchiness in this song. You can just really sing along to this song I really enjoy hearing it.   11) Everywhere But Here- A- - Again this song is very similar to so many other female pop/ rock songs but Hope does this song really well I must say. I can't help but know it is a good song to sing to. Not the strongest, but definitely good.   12) Let Me Try- B- Very lovely kind of song, and I think the lyrics are very beautiful, but the way she sings the song makes it also kind of boring. I usually skip this song because it doesn't really interest me and it goes on a little too long. But I can understand why she wanted such a song to wrap up the entire c.d.  So yes there are a few weak spots on this c.d., but there are also plenty of strong spots as well that should be noticed. Hope's power is there and I think if she is truly honest about wanting to make music she can grow into something great. She already is on a good path to me. I recommend this c.d. for people who want smart rock/ pop. 
 Maybe some of you can relate to this.  I played giutar in high school back in the early '70's then left it behind for decades.  Recently, I decided to go back to playing, but wanted to avoid trial-and-error, tedious drawn out lessons, and find a sort of "unified field theory" for the giutar, if one existed.  It does!  After some searching, and almost by accident, I came upon Fretboard Logic SE, Fretboard Logic III, and the DVDs.  It almost sounded too good to be true at first, but as I've worked with this remarkable program over the last month or so, I find that everytime I pick it up, I'm amazed anew!  This was EXACTLY what I was looking for, and has organized my understanding of the guitar and its fretboard like nothing else I've seen! With a sense of humor, and clear writing, and logical organization, Bill Edwards explains the guitar in a way that, as stated correctly on the back cover of Fretboard Logic SE, "...will take years off the learning curve."  I gave this program - Fretboard Logic SE, Fretboard Logic III, and the DVDs five stars, but in truth it has been invaluable to me, and I don't think any rating system would do justice to this program 
 When a former client of Patrick Kenzie kills herself mere months after he warned off her stalker, Kenzie, out of a profound sense of guilt, investigates.  After reconciling with his former partner and lover, Angie Gennaro, the two stumble upon a the truth: that the client was systematically stripped of everything in her life until she committed suicide.  The responsible party is a man who does not like to be crossed, and has now set his sights on Kenzie and Gennaro.  After the ambiguous villains of "Gone Baby Gone", Dennis Lehane returns to a more traditional type of villain for his fifth Kenzie/Gennaro book, "Prayers for Rain."  While nowhere the monstrous serial killer Lehane created in "Darkness, Take My Hand" (the second book in the series), the villain of "Prayers for Rain" is sinister, smug, brilliant, and sadistic, inflicting pain and death because he can.  Kenzie and Gennaro, in turn, want to stop him out of a sense of justice and vengeance.  The tension mounts as the detectives must struggle to protect their own loved ones and safety while finding a the key to bringing down an invisible and brilliant killer.    As with the rest of this series, Lehane explores the basic theme of power: who has it, why they want it, what they do to get it, and what they do when they have it.  At the beginning of each novel, the most powerful character is the villain.  They exercise their power violently, harming people because they can, and because their victims cannot fight back.  It falls to Kenzie and Gennaro to exact revenge, which is usually pretty gratifying, if problematic, since our society generally frowns on revenge.  Nonetheless, sometimes justice is not pretty, and it's understood that Kenzie and Gennaro are in the best position to fulfill that justice.  While "Prayers for Rain"is the last Kenzie/Gennaro book for the time being, Lehane has not written a "last" book in a series.  It would be easy for him to pick up this series if he so chose.  I hope he does, as I have enjoyed Patrick Kenzie and Angie Gennaro's company for the past couple of years.  "Prayers for Rain" embodies much of what is great about this series and Lehane as a writer.  It's sharp, taut, intense, funny, and gripping.  
 My first introduction to Nathaniel Philbrick was this particular book, IN THE HEART OF THE SEA, which I bought over three years ago and kept it in my "to be read soon" stack. After hearing the recent reviews of Philbrick's latest, MAYFLOWER, also in my "stack," I pulled out IN THE HEART OF THE SEA and decided to read it. To say that I felt idiotic for not reading it sooner would be an understatement.  Many authors of factual-based books, regardless genre, don't have the touch to make non-fiction readable. (I noted with a chuckle the high school/college student who reviewed HEART OF THE SEA, and indicated how boring and dry it was...well, it was a class requirement, so of course it is boring and dry.) My opinion is diametrically opposed. There are a few authors that bring non-fiction to life: Roger Lowenstein (in business), Kurt Eichenwald (in business tales), David McCullough (in history), and, of course, the late Stephen Ambrose (in history). Philbrick can now be added to that list. While he doesn't present presumed dialogue like Eichenwald, Philbrick brings the story to life with titillating detail and gusto.   HEART OF THE SEA introduces readers to the island of Nantucket in the early 1800s, where whaling was the primary, if not only, industry of any import to the islanders. At that time in history, Nantucket was considered the whaling "capital." Philbrick introduces the readers to the customs of whaleships, the ranks of the seamen, and the incredible journeys a typical whaleship made. Each journey, with little variation, took the seamen from their Nantucket familes for periods as long as three years. Upon return, they might only be with their families for a few months before the next voyage. However, given the dire need for oil provided by the sperm whale, and the riches it brought on the open market, this was a standard and fully accepted custom, not only by the seamen, but their families as well.   The story within the story provided the basis for one of the great works of literature of all time; Melville's MOBY DICK. Philbrick indicates that Melville was ardent, and somewhat transfixed, by the story of the Essex, and its ulimate plight. Of course, MOBY DICK is a work of fiction, but it is centered in fact...that being the tale of the Essex.  IN THE HEART OF THE SEA revolves around the  whaleship Essex, which set sail for the last time in 1819 in search of sperm whales. Now, think about this: the whale hunt was to take place in the Pacific. The Essex had to sail from Nantucket (think Boston) in the Atlantic, around Cape Horn (the southern tip of South America), and then back north to the whaling grounds of the Pacific. No wonder these voyages took years! The Essex had a number of "events" occur before making it to the South Pacific, which, in hindsight, should have given the crew a hint that this, indeed, could be an ill-fated voyage. After having some decent luck in their search for whales on their way to the whaling grounds, an extraordinary and unprecedented event took place while the Essex's latitude was approximately the Equator. The Essex was rammed by an eighty-five foot sperm whale, twice, which sent the 228-ton whaleship to it's death in the Pacific. The crew, numbering 20, took the three available lifeboats, called whaleboats, and began pondering how they were going to survive, literally, in the middle of the Pacific, thousands of miles from any known civilization. While the crew was able to save some food and fresh water prior to the Essex going under, most knew it wasn't enough to make it. Their ultimate journey from the death of the Essex to rescue was filled with hope, dispair, and human behavior none of the seamen thought they'd ever consider or engage in. This journey is heartwrenching and fantastic.  Philbrick has put together an incredibly vivid tale bringing to life the tibulations facing each of the seamen of the Essex. Philbrick has given enough, but not too much, information on whaling, sperm whales, 19th century industry, and the culture of a seamen and whaleships to give the reader a firm grasp of the time without becoming inudated with minutiae. IN THE HEART OF THE SEA is an outstanding effort by a very talented author. 
 This film is worth watching over and over again, if only to see Sinatra's rendition of "The Lady is a Tramp", which he sings with riveting style and musical finesse.  Based on a book and play by John O'Hara, it boasts some snappy dialogue and a fabulous Rodgers and Hart score, with songs like "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered", "I Could Write a Book", "What do I Care for a Dame ?", "Plant You Now, Dig You Later", "Happy Hunting Horn" and "That Terrific Rainbow". Rita Hayworth does a sumptuous "Zip" (I love the way she uses her lavish Jean Louis gown in the number), and Kim Novak is absolutely stunning singing "My Funny Valentine". Novak was one of the loveliest and most underrated stars to ever grace the silver screen, and this was her second film with Sinatra, having done the dramatic "The Man with the Golden Arm" two years earlier.  The film only received some Oscar nominations (Art/Set Direction, Costume Design, Editing, Sound), but Sinatra did pick up a 1958 Golden Globe Best Actor/Musical-Comedy for his part as Joey, the womanizing, fast talking, con-man singer, who goes from town to town, leaving debts and broken hearts behind; Sinatra makes the most of the part, and one cannot imagine anyone else that could have played Joey to such perfection. Terrific direction by George Sidney and choreography by Hermes Pan complement this trio of great stars and splendid music, with the backdrop of San Francisco and Harold Lipstein's cinematography.  Total running time is 109 minutes. 
 I love this book!  I had to have my own copy after seeing one in use at the Cooperative Extension's Master Gardener booth at last year's 4-H Fair.  It doesn't ID everything that I find growing around my property, of course, and I definitely agree with S.C. Watson's wishes for information on edibility and invasiveness.  Still, this is a terrific book.  The ID process format (the part you look at to try and ID a mystery plant) takes a little getting used to, but that is true with any detailed plant book.  There is "plant language" ("cotyledon" and the like) but not an impossible amount.  The photos, as has been pointed out, are amazing.  Each plant is shown in several forms, from seeds to total plant, even just to different ways (darkness of hue, etc.) that individual plants may look.  For example, last night at a salad bar, I saw a sprig of something that didn't look like salad, some kind of stalk with leaves and flowers from a plant of some sort.  Maybe it was a tomato plant or something.  So I wrapped it in a napkin and took it home and looked it up.  And -- I swear I'm not making this up! -- it seems to me like it was Eastern Nightshade, which is toxic.  OK, it's related to the tomato, but it didn't belong on the salad bar.  Someone out there has a sick sense of humor.  It's fun to see what's popping up in the lawn and at the edges of the wood, and it's educational too.  Recommended without reservation 
 I absolutely LOVE this CD!! I can listen to it everyday, anyday, no matter what type of mood I'm in, it always makes me happy. Similar to her other CD's, Testimony is soul-stirring, and encourages you to look at life from a different perspective. This CD is definitely a must-have! 
 I am 12 yrs old and take singing lessons, I thought at first my singing teacher was a total bore- until she got out this wonderful song book. I now have my own copy and and have sung Wick, Winters on the Wing and A Bit of Earth in concerts. I am happy to say all have one first prizes 
 Great read and very informative. Suggest it for all leaders! 
       This is an excellent series.  We have enjoyed watching it and the rest of the series too 
 I have a love affair with historical romance novels, and "The Feast" doesn't disappoint.  The writer has you imagining all the machinations of the Indian court of the 1600's, along with rooting for the proto-feminist of the story, Mehrunnisa, the 20th wife of the Emperor.  I also enjoyed Sundaresan's lead-in novel, "The Twentieth Wife".  
 For many years race hustlers like Jackson and Sharpton, abortion mongers at NOW and NARAL, gay bathhouse mafia, and tree huggers have justified their beer-hall putsch conduct by saying that America's founding was racist, sexist and elitist.  Now finally, Thomas West comes out with research and well-reasoned arguments to answer these Leftist loonybirds. Most reviews of the founders force contemporary viewpoints on colonial Americans. The "progressive" critique of the founders also assumes that we understand the declaration of independance and constitution better than the founders did. "We're evolved, the founders were primitive hypocrits," so say the America Haters.  Rather than concoct a theory to fit a radical leftist agenda (what most professors studying the founders do) West actually dug into public papers, colonial demographic data and other colonial-time data to see understand the founders as the founders understood their beliefs.  The Left tried to ignore West's work or personally attack West (standard operating procedure for modern liberals)  After years of browbeating of American kids from elementary school textbooks to "scholars" cranking out "social science" deliberately designed to highlight the hypocrisy of America's founders, WEST'S EFFORT PERMANENTLY RECLAIMS THE HIGH GROUND.  The Left cannot and will not rationally debate America's founding. Actually, the only real rational debate on the founding is going on between conservatives, that is, between Robert Bork, and Thomas West and Harry Jaffa. West and Jaffa think Bork does not elevate the declaration of independance to the status of the constitution, thereby inadvertantly denigrating the founders.  Hey Hey Ho Ho Left Wing Protesters Have Gotta Go!! 
 This big collection of letters is remarkable in so many ways. Lowell was a tireless and prolific correspondent and never dull. He expressed love, wonder, and a surprisingly cheerful interest in mundane things and events. He wrote, for example, to Elizabeth Bishop, congratulating her (somewhat self-consciously) on her weight loss, among many other achievements. To Elizabeth Hardwick (second of his three wives) he sent tender and intimately newsy letters - often with an ache.  Randall Jarrell, another friend, received a letter that began "Lying awake in bed the other night after my reading, I thought of the joy of seeing you."  Lowell would have loved email: he complains every now and then about the slowness of the mails, especially between the US and Europe. He is by turns thrilling and everyday in these letters, and often tender and loving.  Much has been made posthumously of Lowell's bipolar disorder. It's sad and sweet to read his notes to his mother. After beginning "psycho-therapy" in the late 1940's he writes to her that "I've been trying to understand my first six or seven years, and have many questions to ask you." He is uncynical and open. After her death in 1954 (also documented in letters) he had a psychotic break during which, as ever, he wrote letters.  Editor Saskia Hamilton has arranged these chronologically so you can read them as a sort of a biography. This is a terrific window on Lowell and his world 
 I have read a lot on the subject of writing, yet I learned more from this one book than all others combined! Unlike many books on writing, this one is easy to read and understand. Rather than teaching you "how to write", it targets common mistakes that writers make and shows you how to edit what you've already written. The best part is, after you've learned how to correct the mistakes, you can avoid creating them in the first place. Your finished manuscript might not be perfect, but if you follow the advice given, it will be readable and much closer to a professional level. I only wish these authors had more books on the subject, to cover the areas of writing they didn't include 
 If you are trying out step aerobics for the first time, then you NEED this DVD. The instructor does an excellent job of teaching you at a comfortable but sweat-breaking pace. The workout is broken down into 10-minute increments, so you can increase as you get better. Not for anyone who already knows how to step.  5 stars 
  This is a very very very very good movie, action lovers would love it!!! Harrison Ford does a great job in the acting. Gary Oldman's pretty good, could be better. 5 stars baby!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 This book will greatly encourage those who believe that the spirituality of the book of Acts can be ours today. Like the Bible, it is brutally honest, yet marvellously encouraging spiritually. Abundant proof is provided that miracles are not just for 2,000 years ago. God is alive and well, not just doing miracles in the third world but also here in North America and in the relatively recent past. This is a must read for those interested in ministering with the power of the Holy Spiri 
 i read the first book by mister brokaw and was extremely impressed.  his second book is not quite as significant in it's effect.  there are some great follow-up stories in this book and a few examples of how people "found" each other after 50 years.  this is still a book that should be purchased if you love  stories about W.W. II 
 I am a LMT and I purchased this cd for song #1- I overheard on XM radio. This cd is awesome. I never get tired of it. It is perfect for relaxation. I play it at home and at work. 
 We purchased the stainless steel version of this flatware when we got married 16 years ago.  It has held up so well, that I just purchased ten more place settings (the Friday only sale) to use for entertaining.  Our older set still looks new even though we have used it every day.  This flatware is heavy and really nice to hold, (the handles are not so heavy or thick that they are hard to hold or to eat from).  The super simple design works and looks beautiful with any table setting design from casual and contemporary to completely elegant for special occasions.  
 I had originally seen this book at the library and loved it. Had many recipes that you just won't find in regular books. Recipes are easy to follow and in most cases use ingredients most people keep on hand. Especially recomend the glazed lemon-poppy seed hearts. Cut them as stars for Christmas 
 I was finishing up seventh grade when the Everlys hit the charts with "Bye Bye Love" which made me a perfect target fan. I bought all their singles for three or four years, then got their album with "Cathy's Clown" on it. This Rhino collection has their biggest hits, as originally released. While only 38 minutes long, it's enough, for the price. Back in the days, I liked their uptempo songs best, especially "Problems" and "Wake Up, Little Susie" but listening to this CD tonight makes it clear that their enduring performances come on the ballads, especially "All I Have to Do is Dream", which is perfect, and "Let It Be Me." Phil and Don offered rock/pop infused with traditional country roots, which later became a common blend, but was rare in their heyday. Lovely voices, good melodies, nice guitar licks here and there make this CD a nostalgic treat. My son is a DJ on a radio station with an "adult contempory format" but I don't hear him play anything as musical and universal as these hits. The late '50's pre-Beatle charts may have been dominated by simple and short songs, but my gosh, the artists were The Everlys, Elvis, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Buddy Holly and so many others whose contributions are still enjoyable decades later. I don't think many of the artists on today's chart will be loved and missed 40 years ahead 
 I read this book so many years ago.  It is a beautiful, magical story.  It seemed as if I went through the mirror with Sally into another time.  A person can go anywhere in the world while reading a book. I look forward to sharing this book with my 11 year old niece 
 I have been waiting for this album with great excitement, being an ardent Patty Griffin fan. Once again, she has surpassed my expectations. It took me a couple of listens to get into it, but now I can't stop playing it. We all know what a gifted songwriter she is, but the production and delivery of the songs here reflect her ability to connect with her material - even when I don't understand what she is singing about! This album has everything - from the ethereal, haunting sounds of "Railroad Wings" & "Someone else's tomorrow", the lovely pictures she draws with "Burgundy Shoes", "Trapeze" & "Stay on the Ride", to her gutsy delivery on "Getting Ready" & "No Bad News". She has verntured more into the gospel gentre this time with "Heavenly Day" & "Up to the Mountain", the latter of which she has sung with such restrain, it's heart-breakingly beautiful. I think my favourite though, (for now!), is "I Don't Ever Give Up". It's pure Patty, and I love it. The album has been beautifully produced, in a simliar vein to "Flaming Red". Get it as soon as you can, and don't stop playing it!! Rose H, Victoria, Australi 
 This was an impressive text.  I am not personally knowledgeable about  textiles, although my mother an artist who is a consumate spinner and  weaver is, and so I have come to have an appreciation for the weaver's art  through my association with her.  I was especially impressed by the  authors' thorough knowledge of the craft and of the archaeological  implications of the textiles preserved with the famous Urumchi mummies of  the Tarim Basin of the Taklimakan Desert.  These naturally preserved  bodies, like the freeze dried mummies of the Andean mountains and the Early  Bronze age body found frozen in an Alpine glacier, provide archaeologists  with direct information about the health, genetic relationships, and  cultural affinities of the people in these regions.  In particular the  Urumchi mummies are unique in that the population appears to have been  caucasian rather than oriental, suggesting early settlement of the area  from the West.  Prior to the discovery of these bodies, it had always been  assumed that the cultures of the East and the West had developed in  relative isolation with respect to one another.  Now it is clearer that the  human populations of both areas were in far greater contact and that there  was significant potential for both genetic and cultural exchange, with  ultimate implications for the later civilizations that developed in each.   With their intensive evaluation of the fiber crafted cultural remains  entered with the bodies, the Barbers' add fine points of detail to what is  known about the people of the area and of their likely origins.  The book  clearly illustrates the value of textiles in the approach to archaeological  problems 
 Richard Clarke is an unsung hero who tells a riviting story, although in a rather impassionate, matter-of-fact way. However, his style adds greatly to the credibility of his written accounts about how the "powers that be" underestimated Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network prior to 911. He goes on to describe how we have yet to put the appropriate safeguards in place to better protect us from future attacks. With such a huge cast of characters, it was often difficult to remember who is who. But all in all, Against All Enemies is a good read 
 I was familiar with the series but didn't really get to fully enjoy this until recently.  We did a full on "weekendfest" and watched it all.  We were joking about how perhaps the music was subliminally charged with messages and that is why we couldn't stop watching it! Or was it the political and evil corporate zest? I am more prone to going for the fact that it was a unique artistic delight.  An evolved comic book meets drama meets sci-fi meets art and music hmmmm? Characters in this have enough depth to them you want to get to know them more. Raimi and Kamimura were delivered deliciously.  The tie in of the four superb.  I could go with the anti Saints haters and say it was loaded with politics and opinion of corporate evildoers but everything we watch is plugging some opinion or belief.  That is the Way. This too had its opinion but as in many brands of Art, it did so with beauty and seductively captivated your mind.  It entertains you. It was great artistically. Surreal fantastic and a very entertaining piece.  Watch it for the characters, the art, and the music, driven story line and be "entertained".  Or put your freedom fighter gear on and become a Broken Saint and go fight for your right to get entertained Majestically!!!!  For my comics lovers, its a tasty treat 
 This book has received some poor reviews and been unfairly compared to Hofstader's previous book, Goedel, Escher, Bach. While both are books about cognitive science, the former is a book of philosophy -- it's written for the layperson and discusses the topic in relatively abstract terms. This book is no less interesting for the fact that it deals in concretes: it discusses the actual architecture, the design of the programs which simulate the intelligent processes described so well in GEB. Those with a background in computer programming will especially appreciate the novelty of Hofstadter's architecture, and will perhaps be inspired to implement their own. Those without a background probably won't have any trouble visualizing the processes for themselves. The book is written as a collection of essays, so my recommendation is: skip around. Read whatever interests you, and think about it for a while. This book is neither a narrative nor an exhaustive reference, and you won't enjoy it if you try to read it as either 
 Simply put, this album is great through and through.  The Charlatans UK have really put together an album that is worthy of praise.  It is one of those albums you want to listen to over and over again.  I am a fan from back in the day of Some Friendly and I am glad to see they are peak form again 
 This is a work of nonfiction, though at times you cannot tell the difference. COncise, to the point, and supplying important historical data, David Cordingly didn't disappoint.  What did is a personal issue with his writing ability - and thus it begins. All of the things are presented. But they are presented like this. There are very short sentences. All facts are shorted as such. Read it, you'll see. It starts to be maddeningly noticeable. I liked this book. Because of the info it offered. It gets a 4. I hated. The writing. Though.  4/5 - Bad technique aside, this is one hell of a good account of pirates in the 1500- 1900s 
 Once I picked up PANDEMIC, I just couldn't put it down. Scared the pants off me, but I enjoyed every moment 
 I just ordered, but do not yet have my 1080p Sony Bravia XPR2 tv and my Dish Network HD package.  So what I am watching at the moment is a Sharp Aquos 26" 720p-ready tv.  I took the Sony dvd player out of the box, connected the HDMI connections to the player and to my tv, turned the player on and put in a digitally mastered retail dvd.  I didn't even have to open the operating instructions booklet.  The picture is so incredible that it makes it hard to watch regular tv with my non-hd tv Dish Network receiver.  I played a musical jpeg slideshow made with Memories on TV and burned onto a DVD+R.  Not only were the 6 megapixel pictures beautiful, but the HDMI connection gave me the full quality of the sound, even without a surround sound setup.  I then tried a movie slideshow made with an old version of Roxio.  The player actually improved the look of the little movies taken with an old Sony still/video camera.  These were very grainy as they were not really dvd quality.  They were over 100% improved when played through the dvd player.  Installation took about 2 minutes (because my tv HDMI connection is in an odd place).  I highly recommend this playe 
 Devil In A Blue Dress is a beautiful book, with its Southern dialect and the change of the pace of Los Angeles's tough streets. Devil In A Blue Dress tells the story of Ekeziel 'Easy' Rawlins and his quest to pay his mortrage after he is fired from his job at a defense plant. The books explores the racial and gender segregation in post war America. It invites you, the reader, into a web of desire and intrigue 
 Finally a book that seeks to escape the narrow paradigm that has seemed to have trapped scholars of judicial behavior.  Lawrence Baum's impressive account of judges' audiences as an influence on their decision-making is refreshing as it departs from the intuitive but overstated theory of judges as "single-minded seekers of policy". Baum's book provides a thoughtful, comprehensive and more realistic examination of the multiple motivations of judges.. 
 Democracy in America" , in the abridged version of the quite voluminous full work which totals something like 2.000 pages of texts, is worthy all the money the reader spent in search of a good content and which  fully conveys the inteligent writting style and the penetrating innovative ideas of one of the most brilliant thinkers of all times, the superbly bright French nobleman , Alexis de Tocqueville, a household name in America's schools. I would be at a loss if I had to name the area of knowledge where the author impresses me most: as an historian?, as a sociologist? as an economist? as an anthropologist or a philosopher? In all of these fields of knowledge his approach is innovative, his style vivid, and his ideas spring from the seemingly endless source of his mental apparatus, certainly one of the best of his time.  Getting in first contact with such a cornucopia of new ideas and thoughts is very estimulating, specially if one has in mind that Alexis' work is not a panegeric of his condition of nobleman(after the French Revolution). Quite to the contrary, his open mindedness is revealed in the futurity he ascertains to the United States as the new economic and social power of the world, leaving behind all the decadent fashion and way of style of ancient nobility, English or French. All this in the 1830's!!!  He analyses the formative concepts of the social and economic life in the States and many of the concepts and aspects of day-to-day life of Americans are to be found even nowadays, there cemented in the social and economic life of that country.  The reader , even in this abridged edition, which very adequately compacts the two voluminous full editions, will be at in a very gainfull position to get in contact with one of the most important thinkers who has given its precious mind to study what is behind the success of the United States as a nation. As a minor flip-side the book, in a very poor paperback edition, is very difficult to handle phisically and to peruse. But, as a bottom-line, the book is so good that I will order the unabridged version to read it in totum 
 The ability to understand underlying facts.  The skills to present an argument in a calm and rational manner.  The maturity to understand that there are two, if not more sides, to an proposition.  Not one of these assets are objectives that necessarily come to mind when one thinks of what the primary and secondary education system ought to provide.  Deanna Kuhn, Professor of Psychology and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University, believes that is precisely what is missing from the process of developing not only citizens who can read, write and perform math equations, but also contribute to the civic society.  Education for Thinking argues that schools should not only fill children's minds with facts and processes, but actually teach how to think.  Professor Kuhn, through this well-written and researched book, views that the product of education should be thinking and understanding the ideas that underly the facts.  Schools, for the most part, do not focus on those cognitive abilities.  I am  a board member of the National Association of Urban Debate Leagues, a nonprofit organization which seeks to build competitive debate programs in urban high schools.  Debate fosters research, analytical and rhetorical skills that are the key to advanced thinking.  Professor Kuhn's book reads like a blueprint of so much that we are trying to accomplish.  I recommend this book to administrators, teachers and parents who are frustrated by what seem like the inherent limitations of the current educational model in this era of No Child Left Behind.  This book will provide the foundation and ideas to, at the very least, start the conversation of what our schools should be preparing our kids for 
 Set in the world of championship dog shows and cast with kooky characters who strive to have their pooch named top dog, BEST IN SHOW is a hilariously funny film that will easily have you laughing out loud.  Though there is a scripted premise, most of the dialog in BEST IN SHOW is ad-libbed by comedic greats that include Christopher Guest, Catherine O'Hara, Eugene Levy and Ed Begley, Jr. to name just a few.  The gist of BEST IN SHOW is simple: five dogs whose owners have virtually nothing in common with each other, travel to Philadelphia to enter the Mayflower, a prestigious championship dog show, loosely based on the Westminster event.    Beatrice, the emotionless Weimaraner is shown by an uptight yuppie couple (Michael Hitchcock and Parker Posey) who are nervous wrecks, read the J. Crew catalog like it is a work of great literature and constantly bicker with each other about their dog's mental health and the subtle differences the colors putty and ecru.  Rhapsody in White, the highly coiffed Standard Poodle is owned by a 90 year old kajillionaire's trophy wife (Jennifer Coolidge) who is having an affair with Christy Cummings, the dog's severe lesbian trainer (Jane Lynch).  Winky, a spunky Norwich Terrier is adored by a former party girl (Catherine O'Hara) and her nerdy, two left footed husband (Eugene Levy) who at every turn is forced to confront his wife's promiscuous past and her sloppy bookkeeping skills.  Miss Agnes, the fluffy white Shih Tzu is the prized pooch of two gay men, played brilliantly by Michael McKean and his campy live-in boyfriend (John Michael Higgins).  Hubert, the sad-eyed Bloodhound is shown by a single country boy, played by Christopher Guest, who created the series of mock documentary films that BEST IN SHOW is one part of.  There are far too many hilarious scenes in BEST IN SHOW to recount.  Particularly great ones include the scene when Winky's owner and her husband check into their hotel and are offered a room in the storage closet by a stiff inn keeper who you may or may not recognize as Ed Begley, Jr.  Another great scene is when a very inappropriate color commentator (Fred Willard) reels off one bizarre observation after another about the dog's trainers, the judges and the clothing of its owners.  But perhaps my favorite scene is when Winky's owners visit an old friend who works as a hostage negotiator and announces almost demonically that when people are on top of a building and threaten to leap to their deaths, "they all jump."  BEST IN SHOW is a highly recommended DVD from the same mock documentary genre of This is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman.  With star performances by some of the most talented comedians of our time, this movie will have you laughing out loud from start to finish 
 Not knowing about the U3 software that comes on this memory stick I was appalled to have it install on my Dell Inspiron laptop without asking. That said, it was easy to remove the software and U3 partition with the removal option. I experienced none of the problems reported by other reviewers.  The rugged metal case is a plus, however the USB connection doesn't have a cover anymore like earlier cruzer models. I'll be watching carefully where I put it - I'm not usually wearing it around my neck.  Not bad, not very special, just a rather ordinary USB memory stick 
 I bought my juggling clubs 20+ years ago, and now my daughter is learning the art.  Naturally, she needs clubs, too.  These are excellent clubs for beginners, but they are good for the experienced juggler as well.  The clubs are well-balanced, solid (as is a necessity for any juggling equipment!), resilient, and brightly colored for performance.  The grips are firm and clean, which is great for any juggler.  At some point, my daughter might want some foam tape for the grips, to give them a softer feel (and to give her less bruises on her palms), but that would be a luxury 
 To prepare my presentations, I went through a dozen books on presentation skills. This book turns on the light bulb! The carton illustrations throughout the book are funny and strike. Just give you an example of how practical the techniques are. I actually used something I learned from this book helped my little daughter on her life crisis. When she told me about other kids were teasing her at school. She had tears in her eyes. I told her to laugh with them the next time. She said, "Are you kidding? How could I!!?". "Just imagine they are ..., looking funny, use your imagination.". Later she told me it worked! And most important, it changed her attitude 
 Very well researched and touching.  Sometimes it seems like you "know" famous people and artists, but you forget that our perceptions are filtered through the media.  You rarely get to hear about artists --not just from the perspectives of one person who knew them -- but from the perspectives of many who knew them.  I also thought this book was very energetic and fun to read 
 The Casio Exilim EX-S770RD is a great camera for the price.  Camera is the smallest on the market and will fit in any pocket.  LCD Sreen is large and very clear.  7.2 MP produces great picture quality and the functions are easily accessed.  As this is my first Casio purchase, I am very pleased with the quality 
 Luis villegas is one of the passionate guitarist. When I heard his debut cd, Cafe ole, I knew that luis has a talent and passion for spanish guitar.In his second album, Spanish Kiss, Luis expressed his feeling beautifully on his guitar.His third Cd,Casa villegas has melodious,romantic,and unforgettable songs. Luis added some new gipsy style with hot latin style music.He has develpoed his music very much. Luis plays beautiful music with some talented and dedicated band. Casa villegas will take you to the place where you feel romance and the magic of spanish guitar.I always admire Luis villegas's music because he is creative and brings latin music into vivid picture.His music takes your pain away and gives you a hope,and it enables you to see the new possibilities in life's journey.My favorite track is number 4 and 5. Buy this Cd, and take a journey to casa villegas. Viva Luis villegas.... 
 It took me a year or so to appreciate all the places that this one goes, but after careful deliberation and a continuously ballooning obsession with Mars Volta, I have decided that this is better than DeFacto and Omar's newest solo album, the projects that have come outside ATDI and Volta.  It goes all over the place, the highlight to this approach being the acid-soaked salsa freak-out "Deus Ex Machina."  Really, this is true salsa, with a salsa singer singing about "la reina de [su] vida" or the queen of his heart.  The whole time the traditional instruments are drenched in phaser and distortion, creating a salsa song like none you've ever heard.  There are some very intriguing guitar-noise experiments that differ from track to track, the whole thing being capped off with a song that sounds like Mars Volta since Cedric sings on it ("the palpitations form a limit").  The rest is pure instrumental esotericism.  If you are curious to hear what Omar and Co. do outside of ATDI and Mars Volta, this is the place to start.  I have a strong feeling that you will want to buy all the other side project material after this one, exposing you fully to the constant joy, wonder, and mind-blowing that goes with being a Mars Volta fanatic.  I would love to describe all of these strange excursions on this album, but I am not going to mar with words the terrains that Omar plumbs with sounds.  I am going to leave it up to your perception to discover them for yourself 
 My husband, son, and I just got back from Disney World a few weeks ago. We planned the trip in just a month's time, and WDW guides were very helpful!  The first two guides we bought were the Birnbaum's 2006 Official Guide and the Birnbaum's 2006 guide for kids. Because these are official books, no drawbacks or negatives are discussed. However, at 273 pages, there's a lot of great basic information on WDW.  For example, this particular guide features lots of colorful pictures on its glossy pages, as well as descriptions. It's an excellent guide for first timers who don't know what to expect and want to pore over the book in anticipation!  In addition to describing attractions, shows, restaurants, and hotels, the Birnbaum 2006 guide to WDW provides several charts--such as the Walt Disney Resort Finder. A picture of each resort is displayed, as well as information on location, setting/theme, what types of people favor a particular resort (e.g. honeymooners, families, conventioneers, etc.), amenities, and more.  The Disney Dining Plan is also described, as is Disney's Magical Express Service. There are directions to getting to the parks from the Orlando International Airport (MCO), the average temperatures and rainfall for every month, park hours, admission prices, new attractions, most/least crowded times and so on.  I found the maps to be especially helpful, and tore them out to use when we went to each of the parks. The WDW Birnbaum guide is a great book for first timers, but I would also get the Unofficial Guide to WDW, as well--especially if you're the type that counts pennies and enjoys strategizing. However, the Birnbaum guide is replete with solid information, great pictures, helpful maps, and feel-good enthusiasm. It's a gerat primer for getting into the Disney spirit 
 Those of us who have kept up with this series will be both amused and touched by the birth of Mavis' baby.  The ending brings a tear or two especially if you have gone thru the 'process'.  Eve and Roarke's reactions are downright funny and right on.  And the concept of male birth control pills is a forever dream of mine in my field of abuse counselling!  The two mysteries melded together nicely. For a while I thought I would have to keep up with two separate ones.  But it worked beautifully.  Nora is a wonder!! Loved her picture on the backcover and imagine she sees a little of Eve in herself.  Well done.  The words were terse.  Hip lingo keeps omitting words from sentences but it fits in Eve's world.  All the usual characters are included in the book; some more than others.  Well worth the read.  
 to be truthful Dylan hadn't released anythingh amazing since "Blonde on Blonde", ans that was almost a decade ago when he released "Blood On The Tracks". This is a seminal work of subtle beauty and brillient story telling. Each track tells a tale of deep characters being created from the conscience of a depressed and destrought man (Dylan's marriage had collapsed) and this leads to a wondeful album, both depressing and uplifting in equal measure. This is a must buy.   
 This book is a good all around source of ACT review. It has a regular review of geometry and basic algebraic concepts. However, it does not come close to everything you kneed to know, which would be nearly impossible. I  have studied the whole book and have raised my math score by 4 points 
 What can you say, if you have the cannon printer you have to have to have the cartridge. and original manufacturer product is the sure way to g 
 I'm very interested in apologetics, and this is exactly what I wanted! The language is easy to understand, but the meaning and explanations go much deeper. Some of the points Little discusses are a little confusing, but for the most part, he explains it very well. There are separate chapters for each reason we believe. The major reasons are covered in this book, and because of that, the book doesn't drag on and on, covering each minute detail. This is a wonderful read for someone wanting to know why they believe 
 I've just completed a Women's Kayaking Workshop which Shelley taught.   She's a great instructor as well as a wonderful person.  I learned so much  from her and she motivated me to do and learn more.  Her book is fabulous  and wonderfully written, which is no surprise 
 Judging by the liner notes, this was one of the first albums to be made in quadrophonic sound.  I never heard that version, but I have to admit, this version is pretty awesome.  This was recorded in a church with four organs.  You can hear the different organs in each of the speakers and if you close your eyes, you can almost imagine that you are in a magnificent cathedral in Germany somewhere.  The crispness and clarity of SACD comes out and the warmth of the organs comes out very well.  I hope that this format sticks around because I am getting more and more impressed with it as I listen to new CDs of it 
 I had never heard of Ms. Richardson until a friend recommended this book. I bought it, began reading and immediately connected with her personal story and approach. She is reader friendly and offers seemingly endless lists and exercises to help us reduce stress, simplify and create balance. Some of Ms. Richardson's tips and suggestions resoundingly resonate a "Martha Stewart" style, which is at times cumbersome and a bit over-the-top with to-dos. I like referring to this book, either when I'm searching for another book or URL (she lists many resources at chapter ends, very useful!) or when I'm looking to create new ideas for my women's support group.

    This book is very well done and I would recommend to anyone seeking to establish Revelation's date. Gentry considers both sides of the argument, and even treats with dignity the early date opponents.      "Before Jerusalem Fell" wastes no time in laying out the pretext for the polemic. The preface alone does a tremendous job at identifying eschatology as a doctrine relating to the closure and opening of covenants. This is called "Covenant Eschatology". The author explains this idea by clearly examining the allegorical references to old(earthly) Jerusalem and the new(heavenly) Jerusalem as the divorce of an unfaithful wife and the marriage of a new bride; The Virgin Church.      This book is a great read for the honest seeker of scriptural truth. I read this book after James Stuart Russell's "The Parousia" also a great read. All the internal and external evidences are considered leaving the reader to ultimately make his own conclusions. 
 This is an excellent book as always by the Atkins foundation. It motivates you to start watching your blood-sugar levels and lose the weight. This book was very helpful in understanding the current diabetes epidemic we are facing.  Robert C. Atkins does suggest you go off coffee slowly before you start the plan. This would minimize headaches during detox. I couldn't wait to get started so, of course, did it all at once and had the most horrible awful headache for 4 straight days. I finally broke down and had a 1/2 cup coffee one day instead of taking aspirin and that did the trick...for the moment 
 I picked up this book at the library expecting to be bored after a chapter or two.  I share many of Medved's political opinions and I suspected he'd be preaching a manifesto and I'd be the choir member with toothpicks in my eyes.  Instead, the book turned out to be a personal journey not of policy, but of how he wound up in unexpected careers as a book author and movie critic.    Along the way he also reveals how his conversion to Orthodox Judaism changed his political outlook from war protesting liberal to cultural conservative.  In many hands, such conversions could be bland as well, but Medved reflective nature is honestly revealing.  For instance, Medved explains how his beliefs at the time naturally led him to support lefty politicians like Allard Lowenstein and George McGovern.  I've always wondered how someone smart could do that and I know I better understand why.  One thing that makes Medved's book particularly relevant today is his personal reflection on his Yale classmates like Hillary Rodham whom he found quite warm and caring during their law school days.  Medved met Bill Clinton before Hillary did and wasn't so impressed.  He still has trouble understanding how the Hillary he knew would marry such a man.  He's not much for John Kerry either, a self-promoting blowhard in memory.  Regretfully, he ran in different circles than George W. Bush so he has nothing to offer there.    I bought his earlier book HOLLYWOOD V. AMERICA more than ten years ago and I admired it more than enjoyed it, so I'm pleasantly surprised that his personal journey was so enlightening and entertaining.  
 In life, he was sentenced to a cruel fate--in death, he would become a legend. Alexandre Dumas tells the tale of the mysterious man who was imprisoned in the Bastille starting in the 168o's until his death some thirty years later. During that time his face had been hidden by an iron mask. While his identity remains a mystery, there are some tantalizing clues which might remove the mask from the man. Most prisoners of the French prison were usually important people who had fallen out of favor with King Louis XIV. Given strict orders by the king, the Musketeers were to kill him if he removed his mask. He ate in the mask, slept in the mask, and eventually died in the mask.   In 1717, Voltaire was imprisoned at the Bastille. According to him, the man in the iron mask was around 60 when he died, and bore a striking resemblance to a very famous aristocrat. Of course, the most famous aristocrat in France at that time was King Louis XIV, who was also in his 60's. Another prisoner at the Bastille, Joseph de Lagrange, asserted that Benigne d'Auvergne de Saint, the governor of Sainte Marguerite, treated the mystery man deferentially and referred to him as 'prince'.   Stories about the mysterious prisoner are conflicting. Some state that he wore a mask of velvet, not iron. Evidence has surfaced saying that the prisoner was buried under the name M. de Marchiel. And later, a death certificate giving the prisoner's name as Marchioly and his age of 45 was found.  Another states, that in 1789 Frederic Grimm, a famous writer, claimed that a valet had revealed to him that Louis XIV had an identical twin. And that Louis XIII, feared the brothers would grow up to fight over the throne, so he sent the second-born baby away to be raised in secret.   The boy was taken into a nobleman's household and treated with great respect, but he was never told who he really was. As he grew up, he saw a portrait of King Louis XIV and guessed the truth. He was immediately arrested, and spent the rest of his life as the Man in the Iron Mask. Many people believed this to be false, and believe it was elaborated and embroidered by Alexandre Dumas as the years passed. It has been said that when the Bastille was stormed by a revolutionary mob, the prince's skeleton was discovered, still wearing his iron mask. Of course, there is no record that this actually happened. 
 My boss wanted extra seating in my office for visitors. We ordered online but were a little worried. This loveseat was delivered very quickly, assembled in minutes and is so comfortable that my boss has decided to keep it in his office! Now I have to wait for another one - good thing it only takes a few days 
 True, this movie may be strange even bad to most, but I found it hard to turn off or turn away from. There are messages and points through out this movie if you let go and take it for what it is. This is one of my favorite movies of all time so maybe I'm Bias. Overall I consider this movie to be what a true cult classic really was and is meant to be. 
 This book was one of three Bullseye Classics we bought for my son's second grade English class.  He picked this one up as soon as the box arrived and had it read within an hour.  He loved the stories and was able to re-tell them to his little sister. I hadn't heard the stories about "Big Hands" or "What do women want?"  This collection really got his imagination going and he wants to read more about King Arthur.  To tell you the truth, I didn't notice the problems with sentence structure, etc...I was enjoying the stories too much 
 The calendar is as pretty as was advertised.  I love looking at the pictures.  I look forward to each new month 
 This is just one of those fun books...the heroine has no training other than the obligatory cop boyfriend.  The book is one of those great summer reads.  You can sit down and curl up with Cece and the wacky friends, family and acquaintances.  I read her first book ("I dreamed I married Perry Mason"...who could say no to that title?) and became thoroughly hooked.  
 Angela Peterson was just fourteen years old and her older brother Thomas sixteen when their parents died, leaving the two teenagers to care for their three younger siblings and keep the family farm running. Now three years have passed. Angela and Thomas have been able to provide the children's material needs, but Angela is still worried. She feels that she will not be able to raise them to be good people as well as her mother would have. And now that she is seventeen, she is thinking about her future, but how can she have a life of her own when she must care for her siblings? Angela becomes even more confused when her new neighbor, Carter Stratton, a wealthy young man from the city, begins to court her. She isn't sure if she loves Carter, and longs for her mother's guidance.   I enjoyed this sweet, heartwarming family story, set on the prairies in what appears to be the late 1800s. Angela was a bit perfect at times, but she was still a likable character, and her love for her siblings and her determination to raise them the way her mother would have was very sweet. I would recommend this book to teenage girls who enjoy stories of love and family set against a historical background. I look forward to trying more books from this author 
 ...thanks to a stellar cast. It`s sad, humourous, cynic... but all in all... It isn`t difficult to fall in love with the main characters or even understand the "villain"(read "mother").   To me it says: "Make your own happiness. U and u alone are responsable for your life. It`s all u got. Now go on and LIVE IT and don`t sulk! 
 Julia and Patrick have to do a project for the Wiggle club.  Wiggle is the pet name for the WGGL (work grow give live) club, an extra curricular organization similar to 4H. The two kids partner up to do a project that can go to the state fair as both an animal husbandry and domestic  arts entry. When Julia's mother suggests raising silkworms, Patrick is excited because such a project was unheard of. Julia is anxious because it is too Korean. Linda Sue Park meets all expectations as an author and writes a wonderfully entertaining story. Park does a great job in staying focused  on the life of one girl, yet touching on tangents of other issues. Julia Song is a well-developed character that grows beyond her personal limitations to understand herself, hermother, little brother, and friend. In the character of Julie, readers experience the life of a young girl who learns to reconcile being Korean and American. It is refreshing to read about an experience with a world that in many ways is not Black and White.  In less drastic, yet by no means less dramatic ways, one is confronted with the issue of animal husbandry and cruelty. Julie learns that to get the silk, she must kill the pupae, which she has grown to love. Unlike other popular examples of Asian American literature, Project Mulberry is not riddled with flashbacks; it stays in one single narrative that is direct and still charming. Project Mulberry is a good read for third to fifth grade students.  
 The fabric and cut of this underwear is decent and comfortable; perfect for everyday wear.  The front pouch is slightly different from the other similar underwear I own, but it's still quite comfortable.  All in all, this thong is essential for the guy who likes variety 
 As a boy growing up in North Long Beach in the 1930s, I often camped out with my friends on the banks of the Los Angeles River. We would go skinny dipping, catch pollywogs and lizards, make willow whistles, and trudge  through the oily sludge that lined the river bottom. We did not know that  once the river flowed year-around crystal clear, teeming with fish and  supporting a heavily wooded flood plain rich with swamps, lakes, and  wildlife. My first surprise on reading the biography of this once-ample  river was the fact that it supported one of the largest concentrations of  natives in the country. The first Europeans who settled on its banks named  their village after it.  This book really tells three stories. The first is  how the river contributed to the growth of agriculture during the first 100  years of European settlement, creating a lasting image of fertile vinyards  and orchards in the sunshine. After the railroad came, the needs for water  grew so rapidly they pumped the river dry and built an aqueduct to the  Owens River in the north to supply their needs. The second story is about  the river's revenge and the periodic devastation it caused by flooding.  Time after time, the river, swollen by storms in the San Gabriel Mountains,  would smash through its levies, carry off whole houses, factories, herds of  cattle, orchards and vinyards, destroy roads, bridges, cemeteries, and  towns, putting the whole county under water. It was not until the late  1930s that an earnest attempt was made to tame the river with a system of  dams, catchment basins, and pavement. The third story is about the recent  attempts to restore the river to its natural state, an exercise about which  the author is skeptical.  Blake Gumprecht has given us a splendid book that  again shows us how much geology, climate, and topography affect how we live  and think of ourselves as a people 
 Great movie. The photography, sound, story line and acting was outstanding 
 "The Birth of Tragedy Out Of The Spirit Of Music" is Nietzsche in the raw. This is before the later, "mature" posturing armchair philosopher took over. This is the philologist unearthing a great treasure - the Ancient Greeks REALLY lived, and in their super-abundance of LIFE, they had room for Tragedy/Pessimism! The opposite then, is also true, our modern society that cries out for OPTIMISM and "positive-thinking" is therefore the clearest sign that we are less than alive. This book is Nietzsche seeing in ART, that blazing passion for being ALIVE. This is Nietzsche as the young, unsystematic YEA-SAYER to LIFE. Aesthetics as the true metaphysics - not morality, since LIFE is beyond temporal, earthly taboos. ART-LIFE as the representation of transcending good and evil (later formulated more fully in "Beyond Good And Evil". This is art seen under the lens of life 
 This is my favorite alot of young girls can relate to this book ecspecially me with my best friends dad being a preacher! It is hillarious and frighetningly sad at the same time! I love it 
 If you enjoy A. Manette Ansay, then this book is a must read. I was hard pressed to let these characters go after the story ended. Highly recommended to fans of her writing 
 Japanese Homestyle Cooking is one of my favorite cookbooks.  It has over 135 easy to follow recipes. The directions are simple and straightforward. It has pictures of tools used, like the deep-fry pan (Tempura-nabe), wooden tub (Handai), etc.  Has an average of about 7 great pictures per page showing dishes at various stages of preparation.  It shows oil at various temperatures, different types of knife cuts, how to tell if a clam is alive or dead, how to clean a squid, and more.  The tools and ingredients are listed in both English and Japanese, in the recipe the ingredients are listed by name, if it is not that common of a name, say like mitsuba, it will have the English common name listed in parentheses (honewort); Kinugoshi-dofu (silken tofu).  The book is broken down into 14 basic sections, four being seasonal menus (each recipe also has a season in the corner just to let you know the what season is recommended for that dish), and another 12 that cover things such as: Basic stocks, Unique Ingredients, Daily Menus, or How to eat Dobin-mushi.  There are also tips throughout the book.  One last note on the pictures, they are all in color with many wonderful dishes and bowls, very visually pleasing.  This cookbook is great for everybody, beginner on up that wants to add Japanese Homestyle Cooking to his or her lives 
 This book is just filled with gorgeous photographs, in a beautifully dramatic and romantic style that is often missing in the photographs taken in more recent times.  A wonderful book for photographers looking for a little inspiration, or those who have had a surfeit of the modern, photojournalistic approach to portraiture.  Look at the light, the composition, and the drama! As photographers, we've shown these images to prospective bridal clients, who thought they only wanted "candids" taken at their wedding - "very few posed images" - who summarily changed their minds about "stuffy posed photography."  Many of our portrait clients, who came to sessions loathing the idea of having to pose for the camera have found themselves having so much fun they don't want to stop when we've introduced some of the more dramatic poses similar to those used by Hurrell in a session.  This book is also a bonanza for movie buffs - to see images of a young Joan Crawford, BEFORE retouching, freckles and all, and then to see the results of Hurrell's handiwork, is fun for fans -and his techniques impress those of us who do this for a living 
 I first read this book in 1979.  Since then I've successfully used many of its techniques in my job as a research engineer.  Recently I was asked by an intern how I was able to think so creatively.  I told her about the book and assumed it was long out of print.  I'm delighted to see it is still available.  I highly recommend this book.  For me it has stood the test of time 
 I would recommend this book, not as gripping and captivating as One Hundred Years of Solitude but still interesting 
 I found "People Who Don't Their Dead" to be a very interesting book.  The only downfall was that the author tends to jump around quite a bit, and so the ideas seemed a bit "scattered" to me.  However, even with this "downfall", I think it's definitely a worthwhile read.  This book covers many diverse ideas & experiences, but the main theme is that many people who die don't have a clue as to what has happened to them because our society does not make an effort to teach us what to expect - and, since we are still "alive" after death, and appear to still have a body, many people don't realize that they've transitioned to the "Other Side".  The idea is that this is the cause for earth-bound spirits or ghosts.  The author also discusses in depth the theory re: "hitchhikers" - the idea that those entites who don't move on after death tend to "reside" in the bodies of loved ones, those addicted to the same substances, and really anyone who had lost conciousness during the same time period that the deceased left their own body.  I'm not sure what I believe re: this, but it's an intriguing theory.  So, how do we get rid of these unwanted visitors?  A form of spirit counseling is described where someone explains to the spirit that they are dead, and that it's time to move on.  A counseling "template" is provided.  Overall, this book kept my interest, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who's interested in the "paranormal" 
 An excellent treatise on the subject of human error, written with a cognitive psychology approach. The treatment of the subject matter is more theoretical and less practice-oriented. The book begins with clear definitions, classifications and explanations on the different types of errors, quickly runs through the relevant literature and scientific studies and expands on the typology using Rasmussen's classification as a base. The author then goes on to describe his well-known Swiss Cheese model and provides an excellent overview of accident causation from a system-thinking perspective.  He ends with a note on the methodological assessment of error risks which is perhaps more relevant to safety practitioners.  The entire book is written in clear simple language that is easily understood, fascinating and intellectually stimulating, even to non-psychologists 
 Using stories told by her Grandfather, Aimee Liu provides an insiders tale to a time of turmoil in China.  The story starts in San Francisco at the time of the big quake.  It is a love story of an American girl and a very educated Chinese boy at a time when women hardly spoke to a Chinese person, much less married one.  Her husband is a part of Sun Yet-sen's battle to topple the Manchu Dynasty.  Within the novel is the history of China from the Opium War in 1840 to the Communist's  War of Liberation in 1949.  Good insight into the people of China and their relationship with the Western Powers 
   There are several classical books that withstood the test of time and in one way or another deserve attention. One of them is "The Prince". Why? Its applicability to the democratic state remains a question, however I'm sure politicians read it for how to make one nation the dominating force in the global community. But, if you're not interested in international relations (how to rule over a principality), read this for its uncanny insight into the darkness of the human nature. Believe it or not, it is a great psychology tool. Of course its center stage is reserved for the leader of a monarchy. But then again forget about what's obvious and focus on what's written between the lines. Take for example the following statement:  "...men are wretched creatures who would not keep their word to you, you need to keep your word to them."  Here is the perfect example of how a mid-16th century writer characterizes the eternal and unchangeable human nature. Time and again he addresses the lack of trust one should put in people and how one is to handle his enemies. Many of us have already established our own framework of how to do this, but checking this framework against such a historical artifact would be extremely beneficial.   In addition, the book possesses a wealth of historical information on the topic of political strategy and to be fair - all of us can take advantage of a political lesson (especially in this day and age).  A short and quick read, I recommend it not only for its lessons, but for the mere fact that history deemed it worthy of preservation.   -by Simon Cleveland 
 If you swim in the ocean, lake, or just like to be around water and want to take pictures, this is the thing to have, it's worth every penny!! The only thing you can't do when it is in the case is upload pictures to your computer, change out memory cards and charge the battery. It is truly amazing. I've had my eye on this for a very long time and with a cruise coming up I knew I had to get it. I'm a snorkeling enthusist and this is definatly the thing to have. Instead of those silly disposable cameras that limit you to only 27 pictures, and you haven't got a clue of exactly what you've taken a picture of, you can take as many as your memory card will allow you. There is also a filter for the flash you can slide into place to help dispurse the light to get that ideal picture underwater! 
 This book is very good for the new and the experienced. It has very detailed safety issues. There is a lot of references and something new for everyone to learn. Loved the book 
 Lacanian Ink provides a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the work of French psychoanalyst-philosopher Jacques Lacan. The essays by authors as diverse as Slavoj Zizek, Alain Badiou, Jacques -Alain Miller, David Hayman and Juliet Flower-McCannell as well as art critics such as Raphael Rubinstein, David Ebony and Josefina Ayerza, and feminist-theorists Peggy Phelan, Jan Avgikos and Joan Copjec, not to mention Richard Foreman, John Yau and Lynne Tillman, map the shiftings of Lacanian theory in the USA. Linking key psychoanalytical and philosophical concepts to social and cultural phenomena, Lacanian Ink represents a powerful contribution to a psychoanalytical theory of ideology as well as offering persuasive interpretations of the contemporary art scene 
 I like different shoes and I like to match my shoes with everything that I wear.  I purchase these without knowing what I was going to wear them with but when I got them I was pleasantly surprised with the diverse colours in them.  They are also very comfortable for casual dress 
 agree with Johnny B. Good's review "100%".  I had this on album as a teen, and loved it.  I just purchased it on CD. I did not realize it was still available.  I am so stoked! 
 Five stars for the film, four stars because this DVD has no extras. This is among Truffaut's best films, and in some ways, even better than Jules and Jim because Truffaut was older when he made it and was able to deal more complexly with the difficulties of  love. The control of the color palette (beautifully shot by Nestor Almendros) and the references to the Bronte sisters add to the beauty of the film. The acting is at times stilted and melodramatic yet somehow this deepens the melancholy of the film. The British actresses give themselves fully to their roles. Leaud could be more expressive but I see why Truffaut used him and in retrospect, I'm glad he did because he connects the film to the director's other work. I would normally rate this film with five stars but the DVD is not an entirely satisfactory transfer and I'm waiting for the Criterion version, with extras. Even the chapter settings on this DVD are inadequate. Please Criterion, put out all of Truffaut's work with the neccessary extras 
 Tears of Rage is such a brilliant book. It is very touching, tragic, and even insightful. Not only did I truly enjoy it, but also I found it hard to put down. Such hard times for this fellow after the sadistic murder of his lovely child Adam. Yet he does not give up and he battles and battles for justice for Adam. It was not easy and the police unit were not very helpful and competent with handling his son's case. And it broke John's heart. But he never ran out of fuel to find justice for his beloved son. I admire that. I fully admire his heroic deeds in becoming the host of AMW and has been contributing immensely to snatching sick predators that cannot linger around in the world any longer and especially caring about missing children. If John Walsh have not audaciously fought for our safety, how much worser will the country be in right now? Thank you John Walsh. And I am glad that Adam Walsh bill was successful and was made into law recently. 
 Once again,Roberts delivers unforgettable characters, unlikely new twists and phenomenal descriptive narration.  Ryan Boldari is one of the most adorable characters she's written, even though he's a thief he's an irristiable one.  Wonderful layering, great secondary stories - brava! 
 Scazzero's book highlights a glaring weakness in Western discipleship... that it is mostly a knowledge based venture. He advocates a more comprehensive approach to deal ALSO with emotional baggage that hinders growth and presents roadblocks that (if gone unexposed) can hinder long-term growth in God's grace. I highly recommend this book 
 This is my most recent purchase towards my South Park collection. I so far have all 9 seasons and the movie, and they just DO NOT disappoint. I have seen season 9 twice in the few weeks I have owned it. My advice: GET IT. That is, if you have the stomach for a bit of scientology , global warming, and catholicism bashing. When watching this show, especially season 9, don't take anything seriously. Live through the best episodes, such as Best Friends Forever, Trapped in the Closet, Ginger Kids, Die Hippie Die, and the Losing Edge. 5 out of 5 stars 
 I like Isis but never heard of Aereogramme. I must say the combination works great. I listen to theis cd a lot. It's not heavy like Isis but more like Red sparrowes only better 
 A solid book indeed. It has the right mixture of theory and practical cases well dealt with. The techinques must be tried for performance analysis and implemented in real time projects.  
 The problems at Bloor Academy intensify for young Charlie Bone in this second adventure.  Poor Henry Yewbeam, actually Charlie's great-granduncle, goes missing from the year 1916 and turns up in the present.  Charlie discovers his distant relative and the powerful Time Twister that allowed him to make his incredible journey.  Unfortunately, it doesn't take long before Manfred Bloor, his father, and grandfather pick up the trail.  Things get very complicated as Charlie keeps losing Henry while trying to figure out the riddle of the Time Twister.  Jenny Nimmo has written five books so far in the Charlie Bone series.  She's also written other books for children, including THE SNOW SPIDER, the first book in her Magician Trilogy, for younger readers.  The Charlie Bone books are easy and entertaining reads.  Even though they usually clock in at 400+ pages, the language, the storyline, and the characters lend themselves naturally to the reader.  Charlie's world is large, filled with mystery (what DID happen to his father?), villains (most of them from his own family!), and magic (what else does that wand do that Charlie got from evil Skarpo?).  I had a good time reading this one to my 8-year-old.  We laughed together, and fretted to, and we got to enjoy solving some of the mysteries.  The scene changes still remain somewhat abrupt in the books.  Maybe it's just me, though, because my son never once complained.  Overall, CHARLIE BONE AND THE TIME TWISTER is another good read from Ms. Nimmo.  Readers wanting something like Harry Potter will be pleased with this series 
 check out Dru Down on track 5.  a tight CD 
 The National Geographic Society is known for producing high quality books and this is a fine example of one of their best works. The book is being promoted using their brand name rather then the names of the authors. I would like to acknowledge the authors Steven Foster and Rebecca Johnson; with Botanical paintings by Jane Watkins and Mary Eaton; and color photographs by Steven Foster.  I am familiar with the writings and beautiful plant photographs of Steven Foster and believe that he is one of the finest authors on medicinal plants.  This book contains in-depth and up-to-date profiles of 150 medicinal plants including herbal and pharmaceutical uses, cultural and scientific information and a botanical painting, map and color photograph for each plant.  The book has been well researched and provides a significant amount of information that is both succinct and clear, not lacking in any way. A reader would have to consult dozens of books to find the same information presented in this one volume.   The book is highly recommended for the general reader, herbalist, health professional and certainly every library.  
 this second book of Dan Brown is a joy to read. For readers interested in historical places such as Rome, this book points out several new facts unknown to most of the readers, although many of them have been to Rome before.  The story is thrilling and keeps the reader interested, wanting to know what happens next. Dan Brown's explanation about the Illuminati is well documented and tickles of the curiosity of the reader. The illustrations in this book are beautiful done and helps the reader to understand even more the setting of this compelling novel. Due to use of larger typing, it's easier to read (for instance in bed with less light). 
 This is my fave Neil Young album. All his records have a kind of loose, inspired vibe, but this one sounds like the soundtrack to some cold autumn night up north spent at the local bar where the band is rockin and you have a good spiritual buzz goin. it always gets tagged as a precursor to grunge , and that it may be, but to me its just a good heavy jam album played by a bunch of guys who are really enjoying themselves. The guitars are distorted and resonant, the bass and drums laying down a solid rythym and Neil singing from an uninhibited inspired place. I wish more bands would make records like this because it never gets old and I don't think I'll ever get tired of it 
 People attempting to apply the Unified Process definitely need help, and Ambler has done a fine job providing some. As a Rational certified instructor, author of two books on process patterns, and someone who really  applies the UP, he's well qualified to assist others. The articles he has  pulled together help cover some of the missing information on the UP and  his commentaries unite everything into a useful whole. I recommend this  book totally. [One complaint - the editor/publisher really dropped the ball  on some of the illustations, but buy the book anyway. 
 Mr Taylor's book clearly explains terms and definitions for a successful investigation. He provides the basics for beginners as well as more thorough information for the professional. An excellent addition to the professional investigator's library! This is also the required material for Mr. Taylor's home study course, and is the perfect "text book" for any beginner 
 i saw superman returns 5 times and still enjoy the previous superman movies...i was wondering about the superman returns dvd, but this is the box set i'll be getting...also, it'll bring back a lot of great memories watching christopher reeve as superman...so five stars for giving us the ULTIMATE collection 
      When I first started reading this book I thought that it was boring and I felt like I could fall asleep, but then it started turning out to be really interesting and enjoyable. 	In this novel, war hasn't started yet but it soon does, after. This book has many different characters but the subject is all the same. Some of the characters were sometimes convincing, but sometimes the story got boring because at times they just talked aboutwhat there children did or what the characters were worrying about, like war. I really liked the way that Lily Malloy would describe things such as, mother wailed or other type of describing words she used. The book was really interesting here and there.  	Northerners and Southerners were talked a lot about in this book. Pretty much all the  characters were either from some state in the South or from some state in the North. The theme to this book was war. This book really isn't my kind of reading because I like books that have a little bit of love or romance in them, but I sort of liked this novel. I can relate to this book with my friend Ann, because in this book Shem Suggs loves horses and so does my friend Ann. I don't like books that talk about historical facts or anything like that. I guess in school that's what you would read, books like that.  	Bull Run was a Newbery Award-winning book, which the author wrote. I feel that if your are an adventurish person you'll enjoy this book. This book, kind of left me hanging, becuase of the end . I'm not going to ruin the end of the book for you though! Read the book and then you'll find out how I felt. Very touched and agervated at times. It made me feel like I was hanging on to the edge of my chair. 
 When I read this book its told in such a great way, that you forget throughout the whole book that it is in fact a non-fiction book. Pat Conroy tells about his life in very good detail. He places every quote from his friends in here literaly word for word, you can tell as some charactors have much stronger (colorful) language than others.   The main storyline in this book is how Pat Conroy, a teacher at an integrated high school at the time of Martin Luther Kings Death, gets tired of all the racism between White people and Black people. He thought that by being a High School teacher he might be able to change the world. After he accepts the fact that society wont ever change in this school. He asks to be appointed to an open position on Yamacraw Island as a teacher and principle. Yamacraw is an island off the coast of South Carolina. When he arrives at Yamacraw he finds out just how dumb the children are. It's hard not laugh at some of the plain and simple reatarded remarks they make. Within a few chapters of the book you can tell that Pat Conroy is finally begging to make a difference in the lives of the children.  You really need to get the book and read the rest of his story. Find out if he gets fed up with a false cause of teaching future farmers or if he sticks with it and helps to develope Yamacraws first succesful people 
 The song "Up Againt the Wind" sung by Lori Perri is on the soundtrack by Christopher Young. You can find it in CDNow.com That's where I got mine. I looked all over the place for the lyrics to "Up Againt the Wind" but can't find them anywhere 
 Every Italian American should read this book to understand why our forfathers and mothers came here 
 These two very talented and beautiful ladies deserve so much more attention for their true musical gifts.  They keep turning out some of the best music ever and hardly anyone gets the chance to hear it or know about it.  This cd is just too cool to describe.  You better buy it and see what Wendy and Lisa have created 
 Season six is one of the best seasons in the whole nine year run of the X-Files.  The beginning: The X-files are to be reopened, but Agent Fowley and Spender are the ones who are assigned to the job. The episode also features the return of Gibson Praise. Drive: Mulder and Scully come to the aid of a man who must continue to travel west at incredible speed or else his head will explode. Triangle: Mulder ends up on a ship that has been missing since WWII when he goes searching for it in the Bremuda Triange.  Dreamland I & II: Mulder switches identities w/ a man named Morris Flecher after witnessing a UFO fly past them. How the Ghosts stole Christmas: A beautifully written story about  the true meaning of Chrismas. Two fathers/one son: The truth about the fifty year long conspiracy is finally revealed. These are perhaps two of the best mythology episodes since Redux and Redux II. Monday: Kind of a take off of Ground Hogs Day, but is an excellent episode all the same. Milagro: A thrilling episode about a writer who's novel comes alive. The unnatural: One of the best episodes in not just this season, but in the whole nine year run. Very heartwarming and entertaing. Three of a kind: It's the Lone Gunman. What's there to say?

 This is the Basie band at its best, missing only Eddie Lockjaw Davis.  It swings and it roars.  What a glorious memory.  The film quality of this DVD is excellent, as is the sound.  The performance is marred, however, by a dreadful vocalist, Irene Reid, and by an overly long Sonny Payne drum solo, complete with stick juggling and fumbling.  Basie came from an era when people expected to be entertained.  Don't miss this one, jazz fans.  The swing machine will help you remember better days.   
 I have to say, Angel is my favorite song on this album. It appeals to me on a deep level, since I got married on the one year anniversary of my grandmother-in-law's funeral. The concept of celebrating while missing someone struck home hard 
 Ted Sturgeon was a nudist, a wild man, a tortured soul who reinvented himself and turned around to help the rest of us reinvent ourselves. It's a pleasure to watch his mind work, and a pleasure to see his stories still  running wild and free without him. But his stories may upset you and make  you wonder about things you've always taken for granted. His were the real  dangerous visions, and his tears are mixed into his work. Reading Sturgeon  is like grabbing a live wire, except being shocked never made me bellow  with laughter 
 Once again, the Lonely Planet has outdone itself with its guidebook, Guatemala.  Even Guatemalans recognized the book and held it in high regard.  My traveling companion and I started calling it, La Biblia--the Bible--by the second day of travel. It was, however, a 2004 edition. I traveled in February 2007. Some things were out of date or not mentioned. Nonetheless, as someone who mainly hit the tourist spots of Antigua and Pana, I felt very well satisfied with the advice and guidance in the book.  
 Unlike this Native Son, I am not nor have I ever been a New Yorker. I go there when I want to unwind.  With each book, Hamill proves his love for his City.  Although I felt I knew this City after starting this wonderful book, I found I didn't know bupkis.  This slim volume packs in so much history about the city itself, its evolution into the greatest City in the world, warts and all.  Most books I tend to sell or give away once read, after taking notes so I don't forget the essence of the writing.  This one, I plan to keep and take with me when I return, using it as a guide to areas I am not familiar with.  Near the end, Hamill describes a scene in which he had tears in his eyes after watching the passing parade and reminising about the rejuvenation of a neighborhood.  Suffice it to say, I was reading that passage through tears of my own 
 Women In Love needs no apology, and those who love this rich, poetic, disturbing, thought-provoking novel make none.  Unfortunately, students from facist Christian schools, and other lazy college types are assigned this book and they react beacuse it means they must actually think beyond a special effect film. Further, this novel should never be taught to any group other than adults who have a context, with exceptions of course. D.H. Lawrence is not for the masses who barely know standardized English; he is for those who have engaged in the discourses of philosophy, theology, languages, and fine art. These are prequisites, as for Joyce and Pound, and it is insane to take seriously the reviews of college "kids" who know nothing, as their evaluations indicate.  Buy this book and read it with great care; it will astonish and enlighten you and you will not forget it, beacuse you will want to re-read it often. 
 ...because you'll be laughing too hard.  I can't even explain how much fun this book is.  Money well spent if you love to poke fun at horrific hairstyles.  Many feathered mullets and styled facial hair; need I say more 
 Palast bares it all. Put me through all 5 stages of mourning- from disbelief to anger to despair 
 This DVD has it all. It has the movie and the radio version of the movie which I've been looking for a long time now. It also shows how the movie was made which was really amazing to me. A lot of work went into the movie 
 This book is packed with very useful advice. It forces you to consider aspects of pricing that would typically be ignored. As a bonus, the book doesn't read like a textbook 
 I've been giving this book to friends and family for their birthday and everyone seems to enjoy it!  The principles are good, and it's well-written.  I highly recommend it 
 Training is synthetic experience.  This fake experience is valuable because greater feedback is possible, telling me exactly what happened in the clinical training session.  This "play " is inexpensive compared to the real thing-nobody is supposed to really die or become crippled, and the safety rules prevent criminal and civil charges when followed.  Training is great stuff because training can focus in on a specific aspect of life, an aspect that happens too rarely to otherwise gain enough real-world experience, such as exchanging gunfire with an armed opponent, and the trainee can experience handling this situation successfully.  Training is great-but it is phony!   Ralph Mroz points this out in different words.  His "Defensive Shooting for Real-Life Encounters" is not a recipe book of handgun techniques, but a yardstick to measure a training program.  This book may go over the head of the casual shooter, someone who is seeking only the minimum training required for professional certification (a majority of our professional police) and most of the private citizens who carry concealed handguns for self-protection.  These casual shooters' needs don't include self-criticism and introspection-they have a specific goal and just want a cheap, simple way to reach the goal.  Mroz is also certain to alienate many because he reminds us that not only is training NOT "real-life," but that it cannot be.  As many gun people have invested thousands of dollars and years gaining measurable skills that they can perform upon demand-on a structured shooting range-being told that their skills are not always the right answer is going to hurt their feelings.  Mroz states that most self-defense shootings happen at hand-to-hand combat distances; on page 63 he wrote that 54% of gunfights happen at 5 feet or less and 74% happen at less than 10 feet.  Then he turns around and states in the footnote that some of the shooting data is based upon self-reports and may not be entirely truthful or accurate.  For the serious (obsessed?) student of the gun, "Defensive Shooting for Real-Life Encounters" is a gold mine.  Miners know that a lot of gravel has to be moved to get a handful of nuggets.  This book's information can't really be used directly as a training blueprint or a performance yardstick.  The 74% of gunfights at 10 feet or less figure I quoted above doesn't take into account the dynamics of a lethal force encounter-that the participants don't just stand at a set distance from each other, but they move, sometimes several miles at high speeds.  Ever hear of a freeway shootout between two speeding cars?  Mroz writes of gun-FIGHTING rather than shooting because often, at these close distances, the defender has no chance to use his gun and has to rely on running or empty-hand techniques to create enough space.  Mroz doesn't call the skills imparted by intense competitive shooting useless.  Instead, he points out that the performance envelope for those skilled at these games is limited and that real-life lethal-force encounters take place outside of this envelope.  Here's and example: virtually no shooting schools permit their student shooters to shoot at moving targets or targets closer than 9 feet-in real-life encounters, most "targets" move (and move AT the shooter with deadly intent, else shooting isn't justified) and there's that 74% of shooting incidents taking place at less than 10 feet figure again.  On Page 51, the chapter that includes point shooting is worth the price of the book.  I was introduced to point shooting by Rex Applegate's "Kill or Get Killed" and I learned to shoot by using a cheap BB gun.  When I read the controversy about point shooting versus "aimed fire," I was mildly amused.  Mroz not only settles the issue (use both, depending upon the situation), but he details the strengths and weaknesses of both, discusses the psychological and physiological factors involved, and then in his examination of police departments who successfully use point shooting instruction to better their street shooting results, reveals the real secret of success: lots of realistic practice.  If you train to a performance standard that is related to real-world incidents, you are better prepared for those incidents.  Mroz covers subjects including shoes and eyeglasses.  How much detail can you get from 148 pages, anyway?  This book is a primer on THINKING.  One thing which can upset readers is that many of us buy a book to get the answer to questions such as "what is the meaning of life?"  Since real life isn't a fully-instrumented laboratory, there are going to be a lot of unknowns.  If you don't know the questions, how are you going to find the answers?  "Defensive Shooting for Real-Life Encounters" is a series of questions that I'm going to use to re-examine my own training programs.  Besides, in my case Mroz validated much of what I've been doing for years.  For example, due to safety concerns and feedback issues I use Air Soft "toy guns" for close-quarter shooting exercises.  I also insist upon referees for force-on-force training, and when I can, I videotape training.  The street does have video cameras (remember Rodney King?), but referees only intervene afterwards-in the courtroom.  In training, the referee is there for safety (training is synthetic experience) and to provide performance feedback.  Still, nobody's perfect! 
 This sountrack by Hans Zimmer is terrific. I don't believe you can watch the film and not leave the theater without the music in your head. Ethnic, violent, hanunting and tragic all at the same time it continues to bring to life the tragedy of the film with each listen. A powerful ride and well worth the purchase 
 William Monk, now an inspector with the Thames River Police is on a routine patrol of the river when he watches helplessly as the bodies of a young man and woman fall from the Waterloo bridge. Even though Monk was an eyewitness, he has doubts about happened. Was the fall an accident, a deliberate push,or a struggle?  It's always a pleasure to read about Monk and his wife Hester. They are compelling protagonists and fully fleshed-out characters who have grown with each subsequent story. Anne Perry's plots rarely disappoint, and this one is no exception,  but her real gift is the atmosphere and the sense of time and place that she evokes.  
 It's a shame they havent brought this out on DVD yet, its an old pastime thing i remember watching as a kid. Aint seen it in years, and been wanting i 
 I purchased this toy for my son's 1st birthday. I looked high and low for a pop up toy that didn't sing long annoying songs, or have lights, noises, etc. We have plenty of those toys. I wanted a simple, yet entertaining and educational toy. And that's what I found with this one. My son loves to work the buttons to make the dinosaurs pop. Even my 3 year old likes to play with it too. She helps him by pushing the tops back down. The entire toy is very sturdy. Others have mentioned that the tops break off, but I even tried to break it with my hand and couldnt, you'd need a hammer! Best of all, it doesnt need batteries 
 This CD is thus by far the best to me in my opinion. I can relate to majority of her songs on this CD. I can just sit back and listen to the whole CD without seeking or skipping any of her songs. I would recommend it if you like Smooth/ Up beat R& 
 David Albert is without a doubt, one of the most refreshing voices in the alternative education movement. He shows you what is possible in educating our children; and does it with infectious joy and good humor. Life should be fun! Learning should be fun! Why do we make such a drudgery out of it? Why do we torture our children so? I am speaking mostly to myself here, lest anyone take offense. David's book are the first ones I grab off the shelf when I am having a drag out the workbooks and sample tests kind of day. I just pray that I will have the courage to keep fighting against (and it is a fight) the old tired ways of doing things that I was subjected to. I hated it; and David's books help me remember that. I am lending, and/or buying copies for all my homeschooling friends. God Bless you David 
 This is a fun film.  As long as you don't go into it expecting much, you will find it a good way to occupy your time.  
 True. Though probably not for beginners, this book is probably good for anyone with alittle college experience in biology. Sapolsky writes in his normal clear, thoughtful style to explore the affects of stress on the brain. The ability of this book to describe a scientific problem and then explore the experiments and the analysis of experiments to come up with a hypothesis demonstrates the artistry and passion which underlies the  scientific experience 
 This book is easy to read and hilarious.  Each chapter is about someone famous and he rips them good. From polititians to media personalities to Rush Limbaugh (Hush Bimbo) to Howard Stern etc. Not only is the book funny but very educational. He also rips hollywood types. Each chapter is about 4-5 pages long. You will laugh out loud and you can't stop reading Savage's take on famous people. This guy is right on. He makes Rush Limbaugh (Hush Bimbo) look like a liberal 
 OH YEAH I BEER TO GO ALONG WITH THE MOVIE 
 The Summer of 1969 seems a thousand years ago.  I was eighteen years old, had just graduated from high school, was on vacation in Hawaii with my family, and terrified of the draft because the Vietnam War was at its height.  Watching Michael Wadleigh's Oscar-winning documentary, WOODSTOCK: 3 DAYS OF PEACE & MUSIC (1970), on letterboxed double videocassette, I don't know how I survived that Summer of 1969.  For those of us not gathered in a field in upstate New York over one weekend, the movie is a priceless cultural record of an era.  No one got killed, and at least one person was born.  The crowd size was estimated at 500,000, with minimal toilets and highways turned into parking lots.  At one point, mention is made that "This is the third largest city in New York".  Fences were broken down, so some people got in to the musical concert for free.  People were making love in fields--it was called "balling" in that long ago era.  There was nudity elsewhere as people washed their only clothes in a muddy river.  Maybe because there was so much drug use, almost everyone was too stoned to be unruly or unhappy.  There was a loudspeaker announcement that some of "the pot" was bad.  "Use it at your own risk, people."  Wadleigh, at least five camera operators, and a huge team of editors (including Martin Scorsese and his future collaborator Thelma Schoonmaker) brilliantly employ split screen to show the crowd trying to get in by any means possible and the owners of the land talking about the kids; their opinions naturally vary.  Certainly, it was difficult to helicopter in medical supplies and food for half a million people.  But through it all, everyone survived and seemed to have an adventurous time.  And now everyone can see it all on home video in their homes or apartments, whether they were there or not.  Originally just titled WOODSTOCK, the movie ran 184 minutes.  But now it is called WOODSTOCK: 3 DAYS OF PEACE & music and runs a whopping 225 minutes.  The 40 minute running time difference is mostly music performances, making this maybe the greatest concert film of all time.  Included over nearly four hours, often in split-screen Panavision and Dolby Surround Stereo, are three numbers by Crosby, Stills & Nash, two songs by Richie Havens, "Joe Hill" and "Swing Low Sweet Chariot" by Joan Baez, The Who doing an enthralling number from "Tommy", Sha-Na-Na doing "At the Hop", Joe Cocker and the Grease Band, Country Joe and the Fish, Arlo Guthrie, Two Years After, Jefferson Airplane doing two songs not in the theatrical cut, John Sebastian, a song by Country Joe McDonald,  Santana, Sly and the Family Stone, Janis Joplin in a song cut from the original film, and Jimi Hendrix ending the weekend with three numbers (one cut before), including "The Star-Spangled Banner" on an acoustic guitar.  It is one mindsucker of a musical lineup.  To especially watch The Director's Cut of WOODSTOCK and in one evening is to be grateful that Michael Wadleigh, his camera people, and his editors  put up with inconveniences galore over this 1969 Summer weekend.  They have captured, now and forever, what one aspect of that drugs and sex era was like for 500,000 attendees.  And they have preserved on film for the rest of America--and maybe the world--what Woodstock was like as a concert event.  Set aside a weekend and watch this almost-four hour musical masterpiece.

 Awesome greatist hits package- The videos are so simple and entertaining you just want to watch them over and over. Debbie Harry is so cute that you just want to eat her up. Great songs and just a great album. I really recommend this to any fan of "new wave" or the whole New York Underground scene from the 1970's. One of the best Greatist Hits albums I have ever heard!  Long live Blondie and I love Debbie Harry!!! 
 This is truly one of Steel's better novels 
 If you are looking for the ultimate sweet movie that tells of just about every teenage girl's dream come true, then definitely buy The Biggest Fan.  Chris Trousdale, solo recording artist, plays the lead role as himself as he winds up hiding in the house of one of his biggest fans, Debbie.  Debbie has to keep this big secret to herself and in the mean time gets to know the real Chris Trousdale and just how sweet he really is.       The music in this movie is awesome and it is the perfect one to watch with your kids.  Dream Street fans and Chris Trousdale fans you will not be disappointed.  Chris is definitely a natural born actor, so talented!  I guarantee you'll want to watch it again and again.  
 Jedi Healer is the continued story of the Clone Wars MASH unit on the Planet Drongar. The Republic medical team of surgeons, nurses, and droids is still headed by Dr. Jos Vondar, but his close friend Dr. Zan Yant did not survive Medstar I. The wounded clone troopers continue to be brought in by medlift, and the doctors continue to exert every possible effort to save lives.  Much of this tale deals with the efforts of the Separatist spy to create chaos on Drongar and the efforts of the Black Sun operative to obtain as much of the miracle plant bota as possible. At the same time we are treated to the ongoing love affair between Dr. Vondar and his chief nurse Tolk le Trene as they try to overcome cultural prejudices stemming from Vondar's upbringing. The droid I-5 and the reported Den Dhur are still with us and have significant roles as the story unfolds.  Much of the book deals with Jedi Padawan Barris Offee and her experiences with the Force. She discovers that an injection of the miracle plant bota opens up areas of the Force that she never dreamed existed. She would be able to perform miraculous feats by using the bota. However, could this be a direct path to the power of the dark side? Offee struggles with this situation and finally manages to reach a conclusion.  This book, along with Medstar I, gives us an extremely interesting look at the world of the medical teams serving in the Clone Wars 
 Wow!! If every woman read this book, they would affair proof their marriage. I have read many relationship books before, but never read one that was this easy to grasp and that I could put into practice immediately. The author tells you exactly what to say and do and it works! My husband didn't know what hit him. He's got a smile from ear to ear and all of our friends want to know our secret. I tell them that the secret is in a magical, red covered book, called, "Light His Fire."   
  I found this book to be very informative. A big part of my job is interview and interrogation. This book was able to put into context what I have already been doing for a number of years. I found that I was referencing the book in my head as I watched the people I was speaking with and knew by their actions how truthful or untruthful they were being. If this is the type of work you do the book is a very good read 
 I just got done reading The Rescue last night. I just didn't like the part when Taylor blamed himself for his father's death. He had a right to be happy and live his life. The boy really likes Taylor. Denise was a sweet lady. I am surprized they got married and the little boy finally had a Dad. You might want to read that book again. I am a Nicholas Sparks fan. I have been his fan for 1 year and a month. I love all his stories, I will be looking forard to the next one in October 
  I have been reding the series through starting with master and commander. Desolation Island and The Maritius Command are both fast paced and hard to put down. the story moves along well and reding it I can see much of it is setting the reader up for future adventures with Aubrey and Maturin. Both of these books move at Sea and give great insight into political and military strategies of the Napoleonic world, but don't get overly stuck in domestic (home life) and the social mores of the day which make Post Captain an Treason's Harbor(which I read out of order) move slowly and somewhat of a struggle to read.  I have just gotten Fortune of War and hope that it will be as good as Desolations Island 
 One thing needs to be made clear before reading this book; the words "sense" and "sensibility" do not mean the same things today as they did in Jane Austen's time. Though `sense' referred to intelligence and the ability to judge situations well, `sensibility' had connotations to having appropriate sensitivity toward moral and artistic issues, linked with the superiority of a person's aesthetical `senses'. As such, there is room for debate over which sister represents which trait, something seemingly obvious from the outset of the book, but which dramatically changes by its conclusion (which amusingly mirrors the ongoing debate over which traits Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy embody in the title of their story "Pride and Prejudice").   "Sense and Sensibility" was Austen's first novel, and as such is considered her weakest by the critics, though this also means it is also the most accessible and easy-to-read novel. First novels are almost always the most amateurish, and as such it is a much simpler work, from the storyline to the sentence structure, which leads to an easier reading experience than her more complex novels ("Emma" and the aforementioned "Pride and Prejudice"). Anyone new to the world of Austen is best to start here as the easiest book with which to ease into her range of novels.   The sisters Elinor and Marianne Dashwood are extreme opposites; oldest sibling Elinor uses her head, whilst the younger Marianne follows her heart; but for all of this, the two are very close. After the death of their father, Elinor and Marianne - along with their mother and younger sister - are forced to give up their comfortable estate to their stepbrother (the product of their father's first marriage) and sister-in-law due to the inheritance law. But before relocating to Barton Cottage, Elinor forms an attachment with Fanny Dashwood's brother Edward Ferrars, a shy and awkward, but good-hearted man. Hoping that her feelings are returned, but unable to make any advances, Elinor travels to Barton Cottage in the hopes that he will return to her there in the near future.   At Barton Cottage, the girls make many new acquaintances, in particular the loud and bustling matriarch Mrs Jennings who is determined to marry the girls off as quickly as can be, and the quiet and gentlemanly Colonel Brandon. As for the romantic and dreamy Marianne, she's fallen hopelessly in love with the dashing John Willoughby after he rescues her from a rainy day and a twisted ankle whilst out walking in the countryside - much to the dismay of the smitten Colonel Brandon. Already concerned at Marianne's overly romantic disillusions, Elinor is concerned at her rather wanton behaviour in the presence of her new beau, but is then has her attention drastically diverted on being introduced to a Miss Lucy Steele who has a secret to share about Edward Ferrars...  The story winds its way through the girls' negotiations with the society they live in, the restrictions held upon them and the individuals which hold power over them - not with the same deftness that Austen displays in later novels, but still with much thought-provoking commentary. The family's plight in being reduced to guests in their own home at Norland, at the mercy of their somewhat dim-witted brother is particularly revealing as to the social injustices of the time, and though the frustrations of the girls' status is never explicitly stated, it is readily evident for anyone willing to read between the lines. At the end of the day, all they have is each other and the fervent hope that they will find both happiness and security in marriage. Their trials in love are perhaps the most heart-rending experiences of any other Austen heroines, (where romances are either touched by irony or poignancy) in the fact that a happy ending is not guaranteed for the sisters and that their future happiness depends on a good match - it particular it is hard not to feel your heart break for Marianne, whose unswerving belief in her own feelings and the raptures of her heart are so cruelly put to the test.   The characters of Elinor and Marianne are utterly irresistible. Elinor is the sort of person you would desperately wish for in your life in order to benefit from her good sense and protective nature, whilst Marianne is utterly charming in her romantic flights of fancy (in fact she's so winsome and dreamy that it's almost a shame when she gains some `sense' at the novel's end - one would have been contented to have her indulge in her dreaming forever). Though the novel is told almost solely through Elinor's eyes, in several ways Marianne is the main protagonist, who goes through the most trials and changes. Whatever your own opinions, the two provide an excellent foil for each other, and at all times the sisterly bond between them is apparent.   There have been so many adaptations of Jane Austen novels throughout the years, though to my mind none is better than Ang Lee's "Sense and Sensibility" starring Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. As I was reading the novel, I often found myself switching on the DVD in order to compare the two. It is a beautiful film, loyal to the themes, storyline and characters of the novel and in some cases improve upon it, and so comes very highly recommended as a companion piece to Austen's first novel 
 somehow this album is great to fall asleep to. i say somehow because it's not the type of album that i'd typically expect to be great to fall asleepto. but it is, face the facts 
 Reviewed by Paige Lovitt for Reader Views (8/06)  "Fine Dining Madness:  The rules & realities of fine dining," should be required reading for everyone that dines out.  John Galloway writes about his personal experiences in the restaurant business from the restaurant employee angle. From his experiences, I learned a lot about what not to do if I don't want bad things happening to my food.  Since I am a pretty considerate diner, I always felt that I was relatively safe from waiter or chef retributions; however, I learned that dining with rude guests can result in both of us getting food that has been tampered with.  There are acquaintances that I will never dine out with again.  As a matter of fact, after reading this book, I would like to invite some of them over to dinner and do what some of the waiters have probably done to my food just because I was with them. 	 While the stories are entertaining, I also learned a great deal about dining etiquette, not just how to treat restaurant employees, but also useful information about subjects such as ordering wine.  Galloway does the reader a huge favor by providing a lot of useful information in a format that is totally enjoyable to read.  Galloway also talks about diners who earned top respect and treatment from the staff, a lot of it is based on their behavior and not all of it involves how much they tip.  There are some heartwarming stories about dining guests who earned a great deal of respect from the staff.  To Galloway, decorated war heroes ranked highly, and this was justifiably so.  He includes some historical facts that help highlight the importance of what these people were involved with. 	 Galloway also talks about the colorful personalities that he dealt with on a daily basis, either being his co-workers or being the guests, several of which were celebrities, including President Bush.  Galloway's recollections tend to be hilarious.  He uses his dry wit to make comments that instantly will make you laugh out loud. 	 I highly recommend this book as a gift to people who are rude restaurant diners.  Hopefully, they will recognize themselves and make some needed changes.  I also recommend it to people who enjoy a good, humorous, non-fiction book.  The subject matter is not typical, so it will be a fun change for them.  You will just have to read it for yourself to see what I am talking about.  Enjoy 
 The little book is adorable, and there's an average of one recipe per 2 pages.  The author gives good descriptions of the recipes.  There are no pictures, though, so I give it a 4-star.  I've tried a few of the recipes, which turned out fine 
 This was absolutely the funniest parody I have ever read. The eager repetition of "The Supremem Court interpreted the 14th Amendment to give civil rights to Corporations" as the SINGLE WORST argument to ever come forth from that body was one of the funniest lietmotif's in this hysterical parody of US History told from the standpoint of an over-the-top Marxist. Worse than cowboys were BUSINESSMEN!! Eugene Debs and WEB Dubois were the ONLY white americans who were not evil!  All in all, a very funny read, skewering the extreme Left's take on US history 
 It is very important to have a book detaling the crusades from the arab or muslim point of view.  But is also sheds sometime on the entire problem with the crusades and all clashes between Islam and CHristendom.  From Lepanto to the Johad that almost took Paris to the siege of vienna, to the Ottoman colonization of Europe or te European clonization of Africa to the Muslim slave trade in Africa there are rarely if ever books using Arabic sources.  This is not because they do not exist, it is because Western authors choose to use thier own slef hating hyperbole rather than read what actually happaned.  Most books on the crusade in fact tell most of the story from the arabic point of view but dont use Arabic sources, they simply decided as post modern authors that the crusades are 'bad' and therefore they must be judged as such.  Little attempt is made ever to understand the motives of the crusaders, or their humanity, or the fact tha they were doing nothing different to Muslims that had been done t Christians since 632 AD.  Instead authors have decided that while Saladin remains 'pure and honorable' a trait he was given by crusader writers, the crusaders are 'currupt' and 'immoral' and 'savage' and that they are only in the deed for money.  So it is worthwhile to have a book using the Arab sources from the Arab point of view, no matter the polemics the Arabic judgement of the crusades is the one adopted by the west anyway, so it might as well be read strait from the propogandists mouth than passed off as scholarhsip as most books on the crusades are.

 Jane Yolen's text and David Shannon's shimmering illustrations come together in a lyrical, beautiful introduction to a collection of sacred places around the world. A sense of wonder and mystery that pervades a  sacred place like the Ganges, Stonehenge or the Wailing Wall come through  in a simple yet haunting manner that will touch children and adults alike 
 My 5 year old daughter is all about pretty girly things.  This cute little story of a girl with a unique name is one of her favorites.  It's a wonderful story about being proud of who you are regardless of what others think of you.  A+ 
 I have been using this product for my electric razor for over 4 years.  I find that it gives me a closer shave, and extends the life of my razor head and cutters 
 As luck would have it, the author of this fantastic tale teaches at my college.  That's right, I get to experience (and even be taught by) her any time I feel like sneaking by her room or dishing out money to be a student.  BS aside, it's a good book--buy and read it, or forever be lesser than you could be 
 Becoming a Mom was the most wonderful thing in my life and the most stressful time my husband and I had ever faced.  These two women not only reminded us that we are not alone but encouraged us with valuable insights  on keeping our marriage strong in the midst of the adventure of raising  small children.  (Mine are 2 and 4 mos!)  I recommend this book to anyone 
 I had this album 30 years ago, and wore it out.  Two years ago I bought the Elektra CD, and was astonished at how bad it was.  It made me wonder if I misremembered how good the album was.  This Gold version is the answer -- the difference is like night and day.  Whatever was done wrong when making that Elektra stinker, has been set right on the Gold CD.  If you REALLY want to hear Judy Collin's voice in all its glory, this is the CD to buy.  If I hadn't compared the two CDs myself, I would never have believed there could be so much difference 
 The Rick Steves guides are more update to date than other guides. It's clear in  using the 2003 and 2004 editions  that Rick has recently updated the books . Other guides seem like fact checked revisions. Rick's books give me  info that only someone that has "been there" and "done that" RECENTLY could provide. Besides all of this, Rick is one heck of money manager.  I was sometimes thrifty and sometimes not, but I always felt I got my money's worth thanks to Rick 's advice about what's worth it and what's not 
 ....than you will probably like this one. I did. Nice driving CD. 
 I bought this book as a gift for my 5 year old daughter who had just learned about Coppelia at summer dance camp. This book not only has the wonderful pictures and stories of the ballets but also a wonderful CD of the music to accompany it.  My ballerina really like the pictures of the pros as well.  We read it over and over and make up our own dances to the music.  A must have for any ballerina 
 I would have given this compilation a 5-star review except that there were four great songs that were ommited: 1. "Strong, Strong Wind"  2. "Surrender to Me"  3. "Tall, Dark, Handsome Stranger"  4. "Back to Avalon". Other than that, this is a wonderful 2-CD package from an awesome group 
 Boyz II Men's Coolhighharmony is 1 of the best CD's i ever bought. I LUV IT!!! first, i was only getting the cd for the hit, "End of the road". when i had just got the cd, i listend to the entire thing and soon i wasnt skipping tracks to go to end of the road, i was listening to the whole thing. Every song on this cd is good. its been almost 9 years and i still favor this cd 
 Very good and compact. Took it to my doctor and caliberated with the conventional pressure measuring instrument they use in the clinic. The results were exactly same. The doctor was impressed and had to buy him one for Christmas present. This is one of the best out there in the market in its category 
 I am a newcomer to Dane Cook.  But, having heard this CD, I am a big fan.  Am looking forward to him in Employee of the Month which is coming out on October 6, 2006 
 Essential reading? I dunno. Nonetheless, Bulosan's story is intensely personal and has historical weight in its documentation of the migrant experience. His isn't unique in any regard and you need only look around at the fields that hug the California freeways to catch a glimpse of migrant workers who are, to this day, living experiences similar to what Bulosan described then -- migrating up and down the coast, often without papers and in fear of authority; work conditions that can be intensely hot and bitterly cold, as well as low-paying and piecemeal; often overcramped living quarters; meager or no health services for those who suffer illness; rampant alcoholism and drug use to deaden one's existence. That the book was written several decades ago indicates that not much has changed, except for the major ethnicity of those in the fields. But enough about that.   I acquired a copy of this book from a friend, from an affluent California family who had it assigned to her in a college class, which I believe was her own forced attempt to learn more about a Filipino now-ex-boyfriend's heritage. Her quick assessment: "boring." I, on the other hand, found it fascinating, because of the similar experiences my uncle went through prior to and during his time as a migrant worker in Dole's pineapple fields in the Marshall Islands: both my father and uncle described to me stories of being poverty-stricken working the land, then Japanese occupation driving them further into destitution, which eventually drove them to seek a better life in what Maxine Hong Kingston's relatives describe as "The Golden Mountain" in her book "China Men." My uncle related the harsh working conditions in the fields; the ethnic infighting (dark-skinned vs. "mestizos") and culture clashes among differing ethnic groups. His world didn't seem as brutal as Bulosan's, but the mere memory of my dad's and uncle's stories can be stirred up by reading passages from Bulosan's book. (My father's route took him to California by way of recruitment into the Navy prior to the Korean War; this is not covered in the book, although "America..." does cover laws and enactions that affected Filipinos in the preface.) My dear, departed godfathers where also migrant workers; I don't remember their stories, but I do remember visiting them in their migrant co-op housing in Oxnard, where I remember the smell of Jim Beam, pipe tobacco, and oranges, in the fields now covered over by parking lots and strip malls.   To sum it up: Intensely personal story that might be lost on some readers (such as my friend); if you're Filipino, read this book. If you're of another ethnicity whose part of the migratory experience of California, it's worth reading for a comparison to other, similar stories 
 Over the years, I have developed an affinity for Texas Swing music.  And Asleep at the Wheel is the best band currently performing this style.  Their appreciation for the genius of Bob Wills is evident throughout this  recording, with the exception of track #6 ("Write your Own  Song").  They could eliminate this vulgar cut and improve this album  at the same time.  "Cotton-Eyed Joe", "This Is the Way to  Mend a Broken Heart", "Across the Alley from the Alamo", and  "Deep Water" are terrific renditions of classic songs.  The rest  of the album is a showcase of the versatility of this great band.   Fortunately, Asleep at the Wheel have released many more recordings...all  worthy of residing in your collection.  Please, though...no Willie Nelson  pollution 
 No, people, your eyes do not deceive you. I, Anthony Nasti, a self proclaimed Who fanatic, have deemed their 1970 classic live album "Live At The Leeds" overrated. This will shock you, and you'll probably disagree with me. "Live At The Leeds" is often deemed the greatest live album ever made, but while it is no doubt a solid show overall, there are some problems I have.  I'll start off with the positives. "Live At The Leeds", as I said, is a fairly solid representation of the band at their peak. Great performaces of songs such as "Heaven And Hell", "I Can't Explain", "Happy Jack", "A Quick One, While He's Away" and "My Generation" highlight this. The sound quality of the recording is very good, and the liner notes and overall packaging is very well done.  Now, for the negatives. I feel that the show often lacks energy. The performance of "Substitute", for example, a regular Who showstopper, is performed in a very slow, monotone and overall boring manner, and lacks all of the excitement of the single version as well as other live performances of the song. Another big problem is Pete and Roger. John and Keith are on fire as always, but the other two seem very distant throughout the whole show. Pete's guitar playing is often quite sloppy, and Roger has been better vocally.  While "Live At The Leeds" is no doubt solid and worth the money, to experience a far more entertaining show by the band at their peak, seek out the two disc "Live At The Isle Of Wight Festival 1970", which includes many of the songs here as well as an incredible live performance of "Tommy" in its entirety. "Live At The Leeds" is quite good, but also not quite what it's cracked up to be 
 I bought this book two years ago when my eyesight was failing. It described in detail using both text and pictures the cataract surgery I was to undergo, thus allowing me to be an informed patient. I recommend this book highly for anyone interested in educating themselves about eye health and treatment.  An intelligent and concise read 
 myself, family, friends, have found this tape so versatile, no more gaping shirts, handy in emergency situations - hem suddenly coming down! Bra strap breaking Braza to the rescue. Love it, cannot have enough of it. Great for also holding annoying slipping bra straps especially spaghetti straps! Value for sure 
 I recommend this book highly.  It successfully descibes the idyllic childhood of two brothers, and how this childhood, and a Canadian aboriginal culture's attempt to adapt on its own terms to Euiropean-based  culture are heartlessly ended by forced assimilation, land expropriation,  and horrifying abuse. 	The story follows the two brothers from  conception in the 1950s into their 30s in the 1980s.  Once they leave home  to go to a religious residential school, the tone of the story is of an  ever-returning, inescapable sadness, which nothing--not flamboyance, not  artistic creation, not sex, not consciousness-altering substances, not  numbness, not attempting to reintegrate into aboriginal culture, not  helping children of the next generation--can allay. 	The book had a  powerful effect on me.  I'm not sure whether or not it is a masterpiece,  and thus deserving of 5 stars.  Much of what it was telling me was so  surprising, so shocking, or so emotional, that on first reading, I am  unable to look at the book with enough detachment to make that call.  Read  it and see what you think 
 Reads like a sci-fi novel while providing a solid understanding of how and why the Internet works.  At times the detail is almost overdone but this only adds to the credibility  of the author. I started with a Timex Sinclair computer and have lived through the period covered in this book without really understanding just what made the internet work. Now I know 
 "The Black female is assaulted in her tender years by all those common forces of nature at the same time that she is caught in the tripartite crossfire of masculine prejudice, white illogical hate and Black lack of power." The story of Maya Angelou's childhood, portrayed in her autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, truly sustains this notion. For two uncontrollable factors, her gender and race, Marguerite faces the burden of racial prejudice and sexual inferiority on a day to day basis. At the young age of four, on the separation of her parents, Maya and her brother Bailey are sent by train from Long Beach, California, to Stamps, Arkansas as "poor little motherless darlings" to be taken under the care of their grandmother, "Momma", and handicapped uncle, "Uncle Willie". During the years of the Great Depression, (through which they remain unaffected), Maya and Bailey enjoy the simplicity of childhood. They spend their days working in the family grocery store, attending their African American primary school, and basking in the joy of each others' company. But on returning to California at age seven,  in order to see, for the first time, her long lost parents, Maya faces an abrupt realization of the imperfections of this world when her perfect image of her mother and father is shattered, and she is raped by her mother's boyfriend -destroying her sense of self-worth. Maya returns to Stamps only to be faced with racial prejudice. Under severe pain, she is refused service from a white dentist who would "rather stick [his] hand in a dog's mouth than in a nigger's," - further crumbling her self esteem, and leading her to believe that not only is she an African American woman, but an ugly, unworthy, inferior, human being. But through all of these and many more challenges Maya prevails. She permanently returns to her birth mother in California, where she becomes determined to make something of herself - resolute to succeed in her plans to become a "conductorette" - an occupation for which black people are "not accepted."  "I WOULD HAVE THE JOB. I WOULD BE A CONDUCTORETTE AND SLING A FULL MONEY CHANGER FROM MY BELT. I WOULD," Maya reflects, proving her strong will against all odds. Through much struggle she gains her dream job, and eventually becomes the strong woman that she is today. Angelou describes her journey's successful conclusion as "an inevitable outcome of the struggle won by survivors."  	Angelou tells her inspiring story in such a way that the reader begins to mistake her autobiography for a lyrically-written novel. Each chapter beautifully shares an individual unique memory, each adding detail to Maya's voyage to maturity and plight in desire for love. Angelou is a descriptive writer who paints a clear portrait of each event. She provides laughter and tears, disabling the reader from putting her book down until it is finished. I truly enjoyed I Know why the Caged Bird Sings and believe that everyone should have the opportunity to learn and grow from Angelou's story at some point in his/her lifetime.  
 This is truly "The Best" of Ed Bruce.His rich baritone voice and smooth styling make this CD a classic collector's item.Songs like "Everything's a Waltz","My First Taste of  Texas","Ever Never Lovin'You","If It Was  Easy",& "After All" can put a smile on your face or a  tear in your eye,and makes you wish "ED Bruce" was still writing  and recording music.If you like his style,you'll love this CD 
 This classic from the silent movie era is great fun and an historically accurate romance/adventure about the battles against the Barbary pirates.  There is plenty of action in what must have been one of the first films to depict a sea battle.  And yet the scenes are very realistic in what it probably was like.  The only literary license they took was when the cannonball bounced off the side which resulted in the USS CONSTITUTION being dubbed "Old Ironsides". That actually happened in a later war 
 this is well cool i have never seen somethin like this i cant wait to get this i found out theres an tamagotchi town for v3 on tamagotchi.com p.s i cant wait to get my hands on thi 
 Someone mentioned that this is just a glorified trash bag.  It is not.  It is pretty durable and with careful use will last a long time 
 What a wonderful book! Now I can eat great tasting desserts without feeling guilty! Karen's recipes are very tasty, directions presented clearly and I like the fact that she has included nutritional information for each dessert. If you have a sweet tooth but want a healthy dessert, this book is for you 
 I've read dozens of books on getting organized and coping with clutter.  I really like Morgenstern's method.  She uses SPACE for the system. Sort Purge Assign a Home Containerize Equalize Work your way around a room, getting one corner or section organized at a time.  Set out boxes to sort things into (label them: repair/give away/store elsewhere/sell). The Equalizing part is the daily picking up and putting away.  You can have all the storage containers you want, but if you don't take time to put the things into them regularly, then it will all pile up again. 
 Jim Cramer...wow, what a freak job.  Fortunately, I enjoy freaks...people who dont let times define them and try to define the times.  This guy is hyper type A and he lets it hang out in this auto-biography.  I did get the impression sometimes that he was making some passive apologies and not telling the whole story or softening his role in one controversy or another but I cant say for sure.  I read the book, enjoyed it, will read his others...and yes, I even learned a few things about investing 
 First off, I'm not a huge Graham Greene fan.  I can appreciate him, but I don't necessarily always enjoy him.  I recognize that his reputation as one of the great men of 20th-century English letters is a well deserved one.  But I don't love his stuff.  I'm not sure why, but it just doesn't ring my bell.  But The Heart of the Matter is the exception for me.  I won't claim that this novel is somehow remarkably different from his other stuff.  It's vintage Graham Greene, that's for sure.  It's slow and methodical, well crafted, building up patiently to a subtle yet powerful crescendo.  Like The End of the Affair, and every other one of his books that I've read, it has a tragic ending that somehow you see coming even in the opening pages.  And yet you don't end up with that not-so-satisfied feeling of a bad detective novel that gives too many clues too early on.  Because you anticipate the tragedy from the beginning, you feel the characters' pain all the way through.  And it still hurts in the end, even though by that point you have long since come to accept it as a fait accompli.  I think the reason I'm not wild about Graham Greene is because sometimes I feel like I really need to work to get the most out of him.  He is the undisputed master of understatement.  And because of that, you really need to pay attention or you just might miss something.  I made the mistake of devoting less than 100% of my attention to a key passage, and found myself missing a crucial turn in the plot.  With Graham Greene, the big stuff doesn't need fireworks and a spotlight to draw attention to it.  In fact, the big stuff grows in size and importance the more he under-emphasizes it.  I think there's something very British in all of this.  Sex, infidelity, violence, death... they all take place off screen, and that fact gives them a greater importance than if they were laid out graphically for us to see.  Has there been a movie made out of this book yet?  I think it could be adapted well for the screen.  It would lend itself well to that artsy, period-piece feel that came through so well in The End of the Affair. 
 The film (one of my favorites) inspired me to acquire the book and as usual I found the book to be far superior to the film. The norm since converting a book to film is similiar to condensing.   The book did lack in factual detail which would have made it longer and far more interesting, as a factual historical novel. As a piece on racial discrimination and women's fight for equality it is the best of reading.  For those interested in the subject the book and film are well worth adding to your collection.     
 I was quite taken aback when this book spelled out many of the ideas I had long been thinking concerning this problem. Namely that the Palestinians should not simply be dismissed as "terrorists" for rebelling at the loss of their homelands and property they had long held. I had suspected that the message our media was delivering wasn't the whole story. If one puts the current violence into perspective of the last few decades they'll realize that its not simply a matter of terrorists spontaneously creating violence or terror. These people have been stripped of many basic necessities of life! Home, food, property, livlihood and family. Think about it? What does it take to make a person angry enough to take their own life in a suicide bombing. They can't all be religious nuts or "mindless terrorists"! Carter methodically lays out the historical record and also deals briefly with the older and ancient times in these lands as well. This war is not about one aggressor and one victim as many would have you believe. There are aggressors and victims on both sides.  Sadly, there may be little that we here in the US can do but one thing is clear in my mind: We should be treating both sides more even-handedly and not doling out the huge military assistance dollars and technical know-how that we have been giving to Israel over the years! Read this relatively easy-to-read book.  
 This is a lovely little collection from the My little Pony collection of toys. If your children want to create the Princess Promenade then these breezies (small winged ponys) can be part of that. There are two different sets you can get.   Anyway, they are really lovely toys and my children have had weeks and weeks of fun with them. The whole thing, the carriages and the breezies are incredibly tough (really surprising!) so they have lasted some pretty hard knocks, they are brightly coloured and the little wings on the back, while getting crinkled up in the packaging, are firmly attached and haven't been removed. The little antenna do come off with some tugging, but are easy to reattach. They are overall a really nice toy, they are versatile, small and pretty. 
 This was a great book. I never liked reading plays before I read Oedipus Rex. It's a really interesting plot with a really cool (disgusting) ending. Read this book. You won't regret it 
 I think this album is one of the great documents of free jazz. For anyone curious about the style, it's an ideal starting point--Holland's compositions nicely balance structure and freedom, and he and Barry Altschul are one of the most swinging rhythm sections in any jazz style. Added bonuses are horn players Sam Rivers, a sadly underrecorded master, and Anthony Braxton, playing a lot more accessibly and approachably than he sometimes sounds on his own albums. This album is more "out" than some of Holland's more recent recordings, but I still think it's his most challenging and original statement 
 This is an awesome book! This book is about the overlooked details involving scurvy, but goes into some great detail about life on a sailing vessel.  Read this book 
 I learned so much about the esbats that I am surprised I got along at all with out reading this book sooner.  I learned about the feast of cake and ale, which is left out of most of the pagan books I have read.  And not only is this given for one person to do it also gives an example of when two or more people ar participating.  I love the light hearted style and the true student feeling I get from her writting.  Another taisty tidbit found in this book is her examples of rituals for every moon phase.  And last but not least is the glossery of moon dieties from around the world, and not just goddesses either 
 Very soft, nice colors, good deal for two pillows. Only downside is filling seems to bunch up after a while, though it can be beat back in to shape easily. Very squishy and comfortable 
 With all of usual aforementioned accolades here, I saw the film as part of the university film series. As a deaf individual from Germany, I felt lot of empathy here associating with the issues of defining the deafness, medical intervention, respect for the deaf community and identity, and so forth.  At some points in the film, a pressing matter bothered me so much. I wonder why the parents and their parents didn't receive the counselling to deal with their emotional ramification of the deafness as well as their profound and deliberating insecurity assocating with the deafness. The film illustrated the glaring omission amongst the families so well that the counselling was no-brainer...  The hearing mother of deaf parents seemed to be so utterly devastated and in grave turmoil upon hearing a sound clip of how a deaf child might hear with hearing aid. Her 'shock-and-awe' facial expression and trembling body language were more suited for death of a child rather than over the deafness. Upon the first response of their deaf son to the sound after the surgery, her hearing husband reacted as if he had been given a not-guilty verdict.  The hearing parents of deaf son pestered and nagged on and on about their wishes for their deaf grandchildren to function as 'hearing ersatz', conspiring the family members against each other. That poor deaf girl was more confused about her identity and her place in the society. If she could choose the phrase from Shakespeare, it would be 'alas, woe is me' and 'to be (deaf) or not to be (deaf), that is question'.  The most tragic part was that little girl with cochlear implant. When the deaf family visited her to learn about the cochlear implant, the girl was perceived as a medical curosity rather than as an individual. She sat there the whole time, presenting her implanted device whilst her mother desribed the procedure, discussed about the device, and like.  It is same for the classes that the deaf parents and their deaf daughter visited. In the class where the oralism (speaking and lipreading along with hearing aids or cochlear implants) was a de regueur method, the children seemed lifeless and lacked the energy of typical children. In the deaf class, the children were burst with energy and engaging.   The bottom line is that the film compels the need for counselling for the families affected by the deafness. We have so many resources where the parents can draw from our experience and learn what work and whatnot. Some states in the USA have laws requiring the collaboration between the parents of deaf children and state agency or programme. That collaboration specialises in providing the unbiased resources and supports as to ensure their success in raising the deaf child to lead the autonomous and fulfilling lives.  That sort of collaboration works well in Denmark and other Scandinavian countries as well as in USA.  FDA certifies the cochlear implant as 'elective surgery' in same category as breast augmentation, rhinoplasy, etc. In other word, the deafness is neither a life-threatening condition nor a detrimental condition affecting the quality of life. We have so many choices of medical devices to support our participation in the greater society. For instance, the people can choose wheelchair, electric wheelchair, crutches, arm crutches, walkers, canes, and like to support their mobility.  Cochlear implant does not correct the deafness like the eyeglasses or contact lenses can. It is also fraught with so many contradictions and tragic outcome. I have seen it too often to wonder whether the cochlear implant is even legal procedure or a proper medical device. Oftentimes, the parents were misled to think the cochlear implant is the answer to the deafness when in fact many well-proven methods work much better for the deaf in long run 
 Many fans who grew up watching Mel's early movies of the 60's and 70's, would probably agree that "Blazing Saddles" (along with the first "Producers" and "Young Frankenstein") represents his finest work. Therefore, I was disappointed to discover that a number of classic scenes have been cut from this version of "Blazing Saddles." In a single casual viewing, I noticed that (at least) the following scenes are missing:  1) The scene where Mongo is tricked by Sheriff Bart into duelling with a mechanical sheriff.  2) The scene where Mongo is tricked by Sheriff Bart into diving down the town's well to search for hidden treasure.  3) The scene where the gibberish-speaking prospector ("Gabby Johnson") tries to explain why the dynamite didn't go off.  Yes, getting all these great Mel Brooks movies for under $60.00 was a great value. But to have Brooks' "crown jewel" edited in such a way was a great disappointment 
 If you are looking for a math book filled with practice problems, then this is the book for you. I am a private tutor and I am currently using this book with one of my students. This book covers many topics (for 8th grade). After each chapter there are tests, which is a good thing. Well, overall this a good practice book for 8th graders. Also, seventh graders can give it a try as well. [... 
 I am a prfoessor of anthropology with a particular interest in Vodou and I regard this as one of the finest practical books on its study and application. We need more books on this which transpose anthropology into useful everyday technique. Mr Heaven is the new Joseph Campbell! Bravo 
 Manufactured of a soft gray felt like material, a tough leather bottom, and draw string closure at the top, this lens pouch helps protect your lens from dust and the elements.  I store my lenses in a camera bag, and these cases fit nicely around the lens taking up little precious space.  This case is meant for use with the Canon 16-35mm f/2.8L USM, 17-40mm f/4L USM, 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 EF/EFS lenses. These L lenses normally come with the case when sold new.  There is no need to buy one as Amazon often suggests.  However if your case is worn, replacing it to protect your lens is recommended.  PROS: Protects your glass investment  CONS: I cannot think of an 
 I devoured this book in 2 days - we are considering older child adoption, and this was a good introduction.  It is a bit outdated, which is rather distracting at times, but it mentions a great variety of behavioral problems and some solutions.  Written as four gripping stories, the technical information is easy to understand 
 found the research very informative. The book has very elegant style of writingand tons of data. As HR consultant i used the book extensively to educate a number of my colleagues in innovating with hrm policie 
 I get this book every year, and have for 9 years. The best written, insightful tome on baseball and baseball statistics available anywhere 
 Child molestation is an uncomfortable topic. But far worse, it is a very real danger. A large percentage of childhood molestation goes unreported, silently scarring a child for life. This book strikes the right balance: it is not too technical, not awkward, and most importantly not frightening. The message is conveyed through a mom telling a story to her child and through repetition. The content and wording is geared toward a child as young as 3 although concepts such as trickery and secrecy are a little difficult to teach at this age. The book gives context and viable solutions that a child can handle. My child is now very good at screaming "Get away from me; I'll tell my mom and dad!" Don't take the risk; read this book 
 I was very pleased with the improvement of picture quality (colour and clarity) over the standard playstation cable. Anyone with an S-Video input should consider making this simple upgrade 
 Received my book pretty quickly, and it was well packaged -- but was surprised that it was actually a previous library item! Don't believe this was mentioned in the description of the book, only that it was like new. Good condition and this was fine, just not expected and I would have preferred a more current printing of the book 
 This book certainly has moments of great insight. Emerson's passion is quite clear and often well-articulated. But this is a very lengthy book, and many of the essays no longer have as much to offer as they perhaps once did. There are several that are invaluable, of course, but many of them have simply become too obtuse and arcane to be really relevant anymore. I read the book all the way through, but my recommendation would be that people purchase it simply for reference, and maybe to read the more famous essays now and again. In the end, many of the essays have disturbing undercurrents of racism or anti-democratic sentiment and Emerson's inability to see nature as a dark force, as it can sometimes be, sinks large portions of the book. We must bear in mind that Emerson was writing in a different time and that his comments that are now unacceptable were not always that way. Clearly this book is historically important, and it is obviously a worthwhile one to have sitting on the shelf to quote or occasionally reference, but it is certainly not the bulletproof guide to living that many have made it out to be 
 I really don't have much to say about this book holder, not that it's just a book holder.  It's a nice one.  It does it's job.  It's a little too expensive for just a piece of plastic.  It's strong, sturdy, and it's big enough, even for those massive heavy textbooks, like the Calculus ones.  Although, I would not recommend putting a dictionary or reference that's like 6" thick (even though it still may hold).  It's got little clamps at the bottom to prevent the page from flipping all over the place, although those tend to fall off when you move them.  But that's no big deal.  Just put them back on.    This book holder is kind of big, and I would not put it on a small desk in the middle of a classroom, but it's not too big.  You should be able to put it almost anywhere when studying on your own time.  
 and I don't regret it. Not one bit. This has some beautiful acoustic psychodelic ballads such as "1 of the 3" and "out to get you," along with some catchy more upbeat tunes such as "Sometimes" and of course, the title track, probably they're most known song in at least the states. I remember hearing that song as a high school student and never knowing who it was by. I think I was wondering if it was an early Verve song or something. I guess that just goes to show how ahead of their time James was! 2Bad I didn't know better. Oh well, thankfully, a local radio station played it again a couple of years ago and actually announced it. I'm just curious to know what some of their other stuff sounds like. I'll have to check that out too. If u like acoustic music of any kind, definately pick this up.   On Christmas day a couple of year ago, I got Laid for the first time. I suggest that you get Laid too. Not that I would get Laid more than once. I mean, who wants two copies of the same cd? 
 Many people who grew up or lived through the 70's gender identity crisis here in the US have adopted certain kinds of stories about the relationship between men and women.  Women are the victims of male oppression.  Women need to be protected from men.  Often cited in support of this view are studies that show girls don't get called on as often as their male classmates, women are discriminated against in the workplace and suffer from unfair expectations about the division of labor at home.  While it is true that we can improve the lot of women in society, Gurian makes the argument that we should avoid thinking that because society has been unkind to women, it must be nice to men who are the villians of society.  Society isn't very kind to boys either:  Boys, not girls, are more likely to be victims of violent crime in school; on average, girls today have higher educational aspirations than their male classmates, as many boys aspire to manual labor jobs like carpentry or plumbing; girls, not boys have better self-esteem through most of their school years; girls, not boys tend to get better grades overall; in total, there are more women in graduate programs in the US than men.  Even today, when we send citizens to fight in wars, those armed forces are predominantly male.  Lastly, societal expectations and norms both at home and at work prevent many men in the US from enjoying fully who they are as humans... rewarding them for being the "strong silent types" who deny their emotions and are not allowed to develop fully their social skills in a way that expresses their unique qualities as men.  Society isn't treating most men very well either.   Gurian's book makes the case that the path to a healthier society involves improving conditions for boys as well.  For both men *and women* who are interested in improving gender relations in their community or even just understanding the male half of the population, this book is a well-written, thought-provoking read. 
 This CD is a nice collaborative effort with more than a few guest appearances and zero skits.  The references to 70's sports, 80's funk, and old school hip hop make this very entertaining.  Kool Keith is as nutty as ever.  Highlights include Break U Off, I love You Nancy, the silly tracks I Drop Money, MANE, and Bamboozled, and the downright funky Kenworths with Wings.  I was a bit disappointed by the track with Motion Man, Serve 'Em a Sentance.  I was expecting some humor and banter, and it was a head-pounding beat with the most serious message on the album.  At least they worked against my expectations.  I can't wait to see what they crank-out next.  They have been on a roll since Masters of Illusion.  Put this on in your car and give alternative hip-hop a try.  
 This book is great for someone who is just learning how to think while in law school. While some of the reviews claim that it lacks substance, this book is not trying to lay out for you everything you should do in law school. It is sensitive to the fact that different people learn differently and so some things are going to be different. However, the basic tools it is laying out for you are the necessary tools to have a head start. I found that each page was jammed packed with tid bits on what not to worry about, what to focus on, what little things mean that will just make it easier when you get your books and feel overwhelmed... basically, it is not a step-by-step guide on how to be the best law student possible - that is up to you, but it gives you the tools to understand what you are supposed to be looking for and what not to stress about.  Get it, if you are a worrisome person like me who likes to plan ahead, this book will help you create a clear vision of the basics, tell what not to worry about, and one of the most important things, show you how to write a brief. I found it very useful and am glad I read it!  p.s. I am only giving it 4 and not 5 because I would have liked for them to come up with more examples than they did, but if you are an intelligent person (and you obviously are if you are going to law school) then you will be able to figure these things out and remember them for yourself 
 THIS MAY BE MY SECOND FAVORITE BILL BRYSON BOOK BEHIND SUNBURNED COUNTRY. AS I SAID IN HIS FORUM, IT'S BEYOND BELIEF THAT HE AND HIS OVERWEIGHT FRIEND GOOD OLD KATZ WALKED AS FAR AS THEY DID IN THE WILDERNESS AND SURVIVED. IT IS A WONDERFUL, RELAXING, EDIFYING, LAUGH-RIOT OF A BOOK AS ONLY BILL CAN PROVIDE. I LOVE HIS WORK AND TRUST ME, BUY THIS, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN. EVEN READING ABOUT THE DANGERS YOU'LL FEEL LIKE IMMEDIATELY GOING FOR A HIKE SOMEWHERE. ONE WARNING, TAKE A LOT OF BILL'S HISTORY WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. HE TENDS TO BEND THE FACTS A BIT FOR A LAUGH AND HIS "HISTORY" OF THOMAS J. JACKSON (STONEWALL) IS JUST NONSENSE, BUT VERY FUNNY. IN FACT, JACKSON WAS PROBABLY THE MOST BRILLIANT MAJOR OFFICER THE UNITED STATES EVER PRODUCED AND HE, NOT ROBERT E. LEE WAS THE STATEGIST IN THE SOUTH'S GREATEST VICTORIES. BUT I DIGRESS, BILL BRYSON IS MY HERO AND FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE I'M A REPUBLICAN AND HE DETESTS REPUBLICAN'S SO YOU KNOW I FIND THIS MAN FUNNY. GO BILL 
 Bravo to Vicky Oliver for explaining the inside scoop on mastering the art of the interview. She does so in an intelligent and entertaining fashion.

 I loved this book - Ram Dass has been a pioneer in so many areas, and now he's leading the parade of aging baby boomers into a whole new territory. I admire his courage, his humor, and his boundless spirit. This book is simply written, yet the message is profound. It was just what I needed to hear at this time of my life. 
 I didn't like AYTYKWLA at first but after listening to it numerous times I've grown to love it!  It still ranks as my least favourite Dishwalla album but it does feature their best song of all time, Until I Wake Up.  I'm glad I gave And You Think... another chance because it's yet another great album from a terribly underrated band

 Since I have become aware of the abilities that some people have to communicate with animals I have been enthralled by the stories.  At first when I read J. Allan Boone's books - I thought, "What a gentle man he was.  I wish that I could communicate with a fly like that or ants even!"  The more I read and become more used to the idea - the more I want to do it!  Then I read Communicating With Animals and I really believe that I can.  As lots of the animal communicators, Arthur Myers writes about says:  We all have the ability.  We just have to do it!  Myers is a delight to read!  His scepticism/belief is a wonderful mix!  I'm going to read more of his works 
 This backpack, in khaki & dark pink, has been perfect for my young middleschooler. She wanted something hip & trendy and got that but also got a pack with several pockets, well constructed, & of great quality 
 I loved the story of Ruth Harkness, her beloved China, and those unforgettable pandas. I live in DC, which is currently caught up in panda fever as we're watching little Tai Shan grow, so I enjoyed reading this book and totally immersing myself in pandas.   The Lady and the Panda is the true story of a Manhattan socialite who carried on her beloved late husband's quest - to be the first to introduce the world to the giant panda. The young dress designer left NY and, over the course of several expeditions, she found adventure, beauty, love, meaning, and - yes - pandas in the wilds of China. Harkness did indeed bring the first panda to the West, and America fell in love with the baby Su-Lin. After making his new home at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago, Su-Lin drew up to 53,000 people A DAY to see the adorable and exotic black-and-white bear.   The story could have ended there and been a fairly typical adventure/travelogue detailing yet another veiled story of America exploiting another culture. But Ruth Harkness lived an even more interesting life than that. In the midst of China's war with Japan - the outset of World War II - and "panda fever," with hundreds of explorers killing and trapping pandas across China's previously unspoiled wilderness, Harkness made a heart-breaking realization. Her quest and international popularity had in fact hurt the panda, threatening their very existence. She then did the unthinkable, returning a captured panda to the wild, and for the rest of her life became a leading voice for conservation.   Croke's book was a wild ride, as Harkenss herself was a larger-than-life character. I loved the glimpse of the hard-drinking, hard-living expatriate community in China, the poetic descriptions of both the beautiful land and people, and the insights into the relationships between zoos, money and "explorers" of the day 
 This book was very helpful in guiding our church leadership to begin thinking about pastoral transitions.  I think it is written broadly enough to apply to many denominations and situations 
 After a long downhill run beginning in the 80's, Santana came back with unbelievable force into the music mainstream with the 1999 release Supernatural.  The album gave the band numerous Grammy Awards, and A LOT of recognition and a sort of rebirth of interest in the classic Santana songs.   Supernatural is the first of three albums in which Santana collaborates with numerous artists.  Being the first, it was somewhat revolutionary and very creative at the time.  However, it's sequels Shaman and All That I Am have overused the concept of making duets with other artists. The music of Supernatural is mixed.  The best songs are the ones performed by the Santana band by itself.  Da Le (Ya Leo) is one of the best in the whole album, along with Migra and Africa Mamba.  Corazon Espinado, Put Your Lights On, The Calling, and Do You Like The Way are some of the best collaborations with other artists.   Some songs are way too radio friendly, counting more as pop than classic Santana. (e.g. Smooth, Maria Maria.)   Overall, this album is recommended.  Carlos soars on guitar and Raul Rekow and Karl Perazzo play percussion masterfully.  Chester Thompson is somewhat dwarfed by everyone else, being seldom heard throughout the album, having almost no keyboard solo's in the songs, and one the keys to a great Santana sound is having a solid keyboardist.    
 The first couple of chapters are excellent for getting down the basics (i.e. line drawings, resonance, and electron pushing).  The last couple of chapters concentrates on how to think and learn organic chemistry.  The method of studying he recommends, especially creating a notebook of reactions, was especially helpful, even more so in Orgo II.  Some students may try to use the book as a stand alone crutch and get frustrated, but Klein emphasizes that his book is intended as a supplement and studying tool.  Use it that way and you will get the grade you want.  I got an A both semesters with the help of this book and the part II sequel book 
 I'd love to read a few memoirs from other key actors in Ritter's spy drama.  Obviously he's got one big grudge against the CIA as run by the Bushes and Clinton, and possibly with very good reason, but it would be nice to hear some of these stories from other perspectives.  Nevertheless, his is a perspective very much worth reading.  He walked in some of the highest intelligence circles of the U.S., U.K. and Israel leading up to the current Iraq War -- he knows interesting people.  If you EVER believed this war was about disarming somebody or making us safe from secret nasty weapons, I don't see how you can after reading this book 
 This book describes the process of caring for dying family and/or friends - something that more of us are likely to do in the future for various reasons.  Every story is unique and gripping.  This book is really helpful  to those of us to have to deal with the physical and emotional needs of our  loved ones, and have to take care of the healthy at the same time 
 I have been listening to this album for many years and it is perhaps my favorite album of all time. However, no one I've talked to, including my fellow metalhead friends, had ever heard of the album. It is nice to look at these reviews and see that I'm neither alone nor crazy in my love of this work.   Listening to this album, you will hear some of the most introspective, well-written, thoughtful, self-deprecating, dark and emotional music and lyrics ever written. Forget that this is Alice Cooper. This is a rock musical on a grand scale, yet frightening in its intimacy.  This album will leave you feeling the scars on your wrists, wondering where everything went wrong, then suddenly realizing you also have a smile on your face 
 Myron is unquestionably the king of Pgh. Reading this book brought back a ton of fond memories from when I lived in the 'Burg. I highly recommend to anyone who has Pgh ties or is at all familiar with Myron 
 I read this book in my 30s or 40s, many years ago.  I am only thinking of it now because I will be giving it as a gift to a high school graduate.  While I don't remember the content, I do remember that, prior to reading this book, I had no particular interest in history; after reading it, I saw history in a whole new light 
 Great book for prepping for a hospital trip,a little dated,but we were even able to read over it again in the waiting rooms,and point out stuff that was in the book.We feel it help him prepare because it was "real" information,instead of always having cartoon characters 
 I bought this record back in 1979 or 1980 and I loved it for it camp sensibility, catchy pop and danceable tracks. This is a FUN album with great songs, especially "Planet Claire" and "Dance This Mess Around". Turn the volume on these tracks and blast back to New Wave interpretations of early 60's pop. 
 Read it to find out for yourself; I found it very helpful 
 This thing works great.  I already own one for my Sansa e260 that I got for Christmas.  I bought this maybe a week after Christmas and have been using it for nearly 2 months every day and have had no major problems.  The only problem I have is that sometimes it is easily pulled out of the power outlet in the car, but that's not really a fault of the device.  I just ordered another one last week to go with the Sansa e260 I bought for my girlfriend.  It's well worth the money.  The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is that it's not a 1 piece design where I could just plug my player in and attach the audio cable 
 As a working counselor, I am constantly searching for therapeutic tools and this workbook is currently my favorite resource. Even though Huber explains the causes of suffering from the Buddhist perspective, you don't have to be Buddhist to appreciate the theory behind the exercises. In using the exercises, a person may cut and paste, draw, paint, color, or write their responses. By encouraging such creativity in responding, a person can express themselves in a wide variety of media, rather than just the normal verbal medium which dominates counseling. In the book, Huber truly covers many issues including  relationships, self-esteem, holidays, emotional health, death and grief, and so much more. I recommend that every therapist in practice would benefit from using this book not only in their work with others, but also in working on their own issues. I return to it time and time again in order to feel centered and focused as a person and professional 
 One of the most entertaining books I have read in a long time.  Truly, "a page turner".  Enlightening insight into southern society in smalltown Missouri during the 1840's 
 Vince Guaraldi, though hardly mentioned in the same breath as Ellington, T. Monk, Oscar Peterson, and other piano jazz giants, is simply amazing.  When they talk about "listenable" jazz, they mean Guaraldi.  There's a reason why he got to write the soundtracks for Charlie Brown and Co.  His sense of melody and timing is delicious, his phrasing never gets old, and he never loses you.  I thought about purchasing his greatest hits CD until I realized that every Guaraldi CD plays like a greatest hits collection!  This collection is particularly upbeat and I can listen to it any time, any place, and it always sounds good 
 I loved reading this book. It has a very good selection of poems. Highly recommended 
 GET THIS!  No body cares if they "play the same three chords over and over" or whatever. People like what sounds good. You know what sounds good? Kittie! Many many people love Kittie, and you will find people that don't... like pretty much every other band in the world. You will see people senselessly flaming the band. All I can say is, if you're part of that group who cares so deeply about how many times the drummer uses a snare or whatever, then you may not like them. If you like music, you'll like Kittie. Don't read these reviews, judge for yourself eh? I'd hate to see someone who would love Kittie be turned off because of some ignorant asses.  This album is amazing, without one bad song. 5 stars 
 If you are Banker/Banking Consultant then this book is the closest you will get to understanding Credit Risk from a Basel II perspective. Its clear & lucid style helped me understand the gamut of techniques used in Credit Risk Measurement. Unfortunately the Book does not get into the details of bulinding models so if your looking for a model building cookbook, look elsewhere. 
 THE SOUNDTRACK TO THE MOVIE "MI VIDA LOCA" IS TOO COOL TO PASS BY. THIS CD HAS A VARIETY OF MUSIC THAT'S HIP AND YOU WILL ENJOY POPPING INTO YOUR CD PLAYER. SONGS LIKE "HEY D.J." AND "TWO LOVERS" BY LIGHTER SHADE OF BROWN IS DANCEABLE AND "HEY DJ" HAS AN ALMOST MARIAH CAREY BEAT. "WEATHER 4 2" BY TONY TONI TONE, IS MELODIC, CALM AND EASY LISTENING AND BEATIFUL. NOW, TWO SONGS BY THE 4 CORNERS "SUAVECITO" AND "GIRLS IT AIN'T EASY" ARE SUAVE SONGS THAT HOLD ENOUGH POWER TO BLOW YOUR MIND. YOU WILL LOVE THIS CD, AND MOST DEFINATELY THE MOVIE. I LOVE "MI VIDA LOCA" 
 As one of the countless, grateful many who have been helped to find a rewarding and meaningful life after active alcoholism & drug addiction, it was a joy to learn more about Bill W., and the unique set of forces that shaped his life and thinking and extraordinary calling. It is precisely through such complicated, brilliant, imperfect and immensely talented people that our Creator often delivers his greatest gifts to our broken world, and learning more through this fascinating book about Bill's particular set of clay feet--every one of us have them--only served to endear me even more to him, to stand in greater awe of his unswerving devotion to carrying out his God-given mission. Few human beings have done more that Bill W.(and Dr. Bob) to help contemporary mankind, and my hat is enthusiastically off to Susan Cheever for crafting this wonderfully vivid and lovingly rendered portrait of Bill; she has provided me greater insight into his roots, his humanity and his difficult calling, the fruits of which have made such a collosal difference in my own life and in the lives of so many other brothers and sisters 
 This is one of my many cookbooks.  I like how the author gives substitutions for ingredients if you don't have them on hand.  I wish that there were illustrations and that's why I only gave it a 4.  P.S- The honey glazed pheasant/chicken is excellent!! 
 The Personal Branding Phenomenon by advertising professional and trainer Peter Montoya is a solid guide to using the process of "Personal Branding" to advance oneself and one's career by enhancing a personal ability to influence others. Personal Branding involves taking control of how an individual is perceived, including the perception of the personal values, abilities, and personality traits that other people associate with the individual in question. The Personal Branding Phenomenon presents Eight Unbreakable Laws behind great Personal Brands, such as The Law of Specialization - that a great Personal Brand focuses on one area of achievement, and trying to be a jack of all trades makes other people think that you are a master of none. The Personal Branding phenomenon is very highly recommended reading for anyone seeking to improve their skills and abilities to affect others and to enhance the emotional, financial, and social qualities of their personal and professional life 
 This review is an adaptation of my review published in Personnel Psychology, Winter 2004 issue.  As one of the pioneers in the corporate social responsibility (CSR) movement, Hollender is evangelical about promoting the implementation of CSR "in all of its forms." I'm not sure I know what he means by that. As he acknowledges, it's in the "mind of the beholder" because there's "no firm consensus" about what CSR means. I certainly can't criticize him for not pinning down the concept. Professor Ronald Sims (2003), in his own book on the subject for instance, has offered five different definitions.  I think Hollender equates CSR with the idea of a triple-bottom line of responsibility and accountability for fulfilling what he thinks should be the financial, social, and environmental obligations of a corporation.      Margaret Mead once said in effect that social change always starts and can only start with a small group of people. The small group identified in the book as pioneers in the CSR movement include small business entrepreneurs like Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield of Ben and Jerry's Ice Cream, socially responsible investment funds like the Calvert Social Investment Fund, and a host of advocacy groups or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) like the activist group, Greenpeace, and the more reserved Businesses for Social Responsibility (BSR) that was conceived as sort of an alternative Chamber of Commerce.     The book gives an interesting account of the different ways in which these pioneers promote CSR among big corporations. One way, for instance, is non-confrontational and educative in trying to "bring big business [no matter how socially irresponsible] to the table and then move the table." For example, BSR works closely with big companies to promote a set of best practices that hopefully will not only further the CSR progress of those companies but also entice other companies not to be left behind. Another way is confrontational, involving pressure tactics and sometimes law suits. Greenpeace, for example, gradually succeeded in pressuring Royal Dutch Shell to choose a more environmentally responsible way to dispose of an obsolete oil storage tanker and loading platform in the North Sea.     As you can well imagine, the notion of CSR is controversial and fraught with issues. The authors clearly know that and for the most part deal with the issues relatively well in my opinion. I'll mention and discuss a few of the issues.    Perhaps the biggest issue is over what should be the legitimate purpose of business. Hollender, understandably, totally rejects what he considers to be the "hysterical" opinion of conservative economist Milton Friedman that CSR is "fundamentally subversive" and that the only legitimate responsibility of business is to make an honorable profit. To Hollender, CSR "in all of its forms" is the legitimate purpose. Thus a corporation that seeks to ameliorate public problems not of its own making is a more socially responsible company. He cites Coca Cola as an example of a company persuaded by activists to modify its operations in ways to further the prevention and treatment of AIDS among its employees and those of its bottlers and suppliers.     Three related issues are over who should be the public corporation's legitimate stakeholders, for what should it be held accountable, and over what period of time. To people in Friedman's camp, the issues are no-brainers. Shareholders are the only stakeholders, the corporation is only accountable for maximizing their wealth and doing so through legal means, and time is marked in quarterly returns. This view is basically that the conventional bottom line is the only one that must matter. To people like Hollender, the issues are also no-brainers. Absolutely everyone and everything, including the environment, along the company's long value chain from initial product resources to product disposal are the company's stakeholders, the company must be held accountable through full and transparent cost accounting to every one of those stakeholder interests, and time is marked in the long run. The conventional bottom line is thus immensely modified quantitatively and qualitatively.         I found the authors a bit lax in relying on several of their sources about one important matter bearing on those three issues. The sources were quoted as claiming that boards of directors have a statutory obligation to maximize shareholder wealth in the short term. I questioned that claim, and one of Hollender's spokespersons acknowledged that it was a mistaken claim. But this nevertheless doesn't negate the immense pressure CEO's are under to hit the numbers each quarter. This pressure comes primarily from institutional investors who might as well be surrogates for a statute. It takes a morally courageous CEO and a sustainable company to resist that kind of pressure. In an article featuring Hollender and Bill George, the recently retired CEO of Medtronic, the latter commented that he would say at every annual shareholder meeting that the company was "not in the business of maximizing shareholder value," and he believed he "got away with that because the results were so good" (Kelly, 2004).      Another related issue is over how much self-disclosure there should be of a firm's CSR performance. Hollender proposes full "transparency," yet acknowledges that it can make the company squirm, as his did, over risking the possibility that full disclosure may end up making the company legally liable for a product shortcoming that might not otherwise ever be known. He agonized, for example, that while one of his products was more "natural' than that of any of his competitors, he was sure some of his customers at least presumed that his product "was a bit better than it actually was." Not being a fanatically unrealistic CSR advocate, he decided to put a "product self-critique section" on his company's Web site instead of putting a disclaimer on the product's packaging. It's a compromise, yes, but far more responsible than the values held and practiced by a baby food maker I remember as once having been charged with diluting its product.      Another related issue is whether to take a public company private to escape Wall Street analysts and record-keeping requirements. More public companies are apparently going private, and Hollender himself is a case in point. He took his firm private, and that is what it still is today. He points to the private outfitter, Patagonia, as being able to take socially responsible actions much more easily than if it were traded on Wall Street.     Yet another issue addressed, and the last one of theirs I'll mention, is over whether a small, socially responsible company should "sell out" to a larger corporation. An advantage of doing so besides making a lot of money from the sale is the prospect of a responsible product being introduced to a much larger market. But a disadvantage is that the seller risks seeing its values and practices diminished if not overturned altogether by the larger corporation. The authors describe how Ben and Jerry initially felt they had negotiated a deal with Unilever, the buyer of their company, to preserve the values the two pioneers held dear, only to learn later of some actions taken by Unilever incompatible with the values.     The authors claim that the CSR movement has become a "contagious trend." I think that's a bit exaggerated, and the authors offer little hard data to back up their claim. I think it is true that CSR is becoming a more popular topic, but I suspect, and the authors acknowledge, that it lends itself to tokenism or lip service for the sake of appearances or reputation. That's why incidentally I chose to mention the authors' examples of Shell and Coke. Shell reportedly regards the North Sea experience positively and claims there is now "increasingly open and honest communication with the communities," yet we read recently that its two top executives were forced to resign after lying for several years about the company's oil reserves (see, e.g., Timmons, 2004). As for Coke, it's frequently in the news for its "cozy ties to strong arm dictators and rogue bottlers" and for other alleged wrongdoing (see, e.g., Klebnikov, 2003). I could also have mentioned wrongdoing by some of the other companies the authors cite as making progress of one kind or another in their CSR performance. My point is that with so much harmful wrongdoing being committed by public corporations, I would far prefer to see a relatively more restrained movement, one that "simply" calls for public corporations to operate "harmlessly." Achieving that standard would be a quantum leap from prevailing corporate behavior, and I think corporations should direct their resources to taking that leap and not diverting them to the solving of problems not of their own making or to giving guilt gifts through philanthropy or to offering isolated token efforts.     The book is intended for a wide audience, including business leaders, employees, and NGOs. I personally think it deserves to be on a best seller list and should be read by the CEO of every public corporation who has yet to decide where to position his or her company on the CSR spectrum. I also think all thoughtful citizens should read this book. It matters a lot.   REFERENCES  Kelly, M. (2004).

 I'm also familiar with the LP version of this CD, and the conclusion of the late 60's "electrified" epic-sounding "Catch the Wind" followed by a new song (at the time): the melancholy after-thought-like "Lalena," gave the "greatest hit" collection an album feel. This new expanded re-arranged edition -- more faithful to the original folk recordings of "Colours" and "Catch the Wind" -- is still outstanding, but the album-like sensibility has been ousted in favor of it being a straight-forward compilation.  Even so, it warrants 5 stars. Heck, it adds "Atlantis." At any rate, though, I'm not sure I can recommend this newer version of the "greatest hits" over the earlier edition. Basically, I loved the "Catch the Wind" re-recording this CD lacks.  BTW: For any Taoists out there who'd like to hear a little of it put to music, check out Donovan's take on Tao called "The Way" from his late-90s CD: "Sutras." That wouldn't have been out of place here on this CD either (though not quite a hit)... 
 This enduring classic is (loosely, very loosely) the story of the WW2 POWs used to build the Thai/Burma railroad.  The larger war becomes a personal battle between 3 forces:  The Japanese soldiers looking for labor led by Colonel Saito, the British soldiers looking to serve as prisoners as dictated by the Geneva Convention led by Colonel Nicholsen (Alec Guiness winning an academy award) and the commandos looking to destroy the bridge led by Naval officer Shear.  The morality (or more specifically madness) of war is adressed in the movie.  The pointless nature of armed conflict reads true today, as do issues of handling prisoners.  The movie's a long one, but one of the few that justifies the added time.  Every piece is indeed required in this classic 
 This "spice stadium seating" - as a friend calls it - is a great space saver.  I can easily fit four rows of spices in a standard wall cabinet and see/access all easily.  Each "step" is pretty deep and easily accommodates larger jars and bottles.  This product was also a lot sturdier than I assumed; it's made of thick white pvc-like plastic 
   If you are looking to add to your beatles collection be forewarned.  This is not your typical Beatles fare.  It is however a good deal better than fair after you get past trying to peg it as a Beatles album.  Its Lennon.  He's pissed off.  He has a lot to say and he says it all on this record.  He sings these songs like he has wanted to sing them forever but was never allowed.  He breaks these songs out like they are part of a therapy session and he doesnt turn back.  This album on 1st listen is a bit of a disappointment to me.  On 2nd listen you know what its all about and you dont listen for pop hits, you listen for the album as you heard it the first time.  The only way most people will enjoy this album is after a few listens especially if your going into it with a preconceived notion.  Also a lot of songs on this album have a rocky start and then pick up steam in the middle.  This album is ultimately very good once you know what your getting into.  Its Lennon breaking the chains from the Beatles and really from himself.  After the 3rd listen, it immediately made sense to me.  Now i cant put it down 
 While there are various re-tellings or re-imaginings of the Christian story out there, from what I have read of them I can commend Norman T. Wright's Simply Christian more than most.  It is thoroughly orthodox in its expression of the faith we hold, and yet it has a fresh and relevant way of telling the story without being folksy or irreverent.  Wright begins with what may be his most important contribution, and that is raising four questions, or "echoes of a voice," within contemporary society -- the longing for justice, the quest for spirituality, the hunger for relationships, and the delight in beauty -- areas which he identifies in a postmodern, post-Christian society as "strange signposts pointing beyond the landscape of our contemporary culture and out into the unknown."  It's a helpful place to begin, as in an increasingly pluralistic society and one in which truth is devalued, these are helpful points of connection, as every TV show, movie, and song point to one or more of these areas.  Wright helps us flesh out what questions people are asking, what drives them, and why.  In Part Two of the book, he relates the Christian story, demonstrating how the Story offers itself as the answer to the questions raised in Part One.  And yet it's not a simplistic reading of the questions but one that appreciates the complexity of the struggle for meaning and community.  What he relates is an amplification of the "mere Christianity" of C.S. Lewis.  In chapters on God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit, he fleshes out the meaning of what Christians believe.  It's not a simple reading, and yet the fresh prose makes it easy to read.  A non-Christian could read this book and have an understanding of what Christians believe without all the confusing nuances of different strains of belief (whether Protestant, Catholic, or Orthodox,; Calvinism or Arminianism).  Something does suffer in the effort, that is, by drawing down the Story to its basics some of the richness is missed, but the generalizing is worth it given the book's purpose.  Finally, the author describes Christian practice, with chapters on prayer, scripture, and Christian living.  In the last chapter he returns to the questions posed by Part One and tries to suggest how the Christian story and the Christian life is lived out in answer to  these longings -- not as simply biding our time until Jesus returns for us, but as a new creation awaiting its restoration:  "The New Testament picks up from the Old the theme that God intends, in the end, to put the whole creation to rights.  Earth and heaven were made to overlap one another, not fitfully, mysteriously, and partially as they do at the moment, but completely, gloriously, and utterly. . . . The great drama will end, not with 'saved souls' being snatched up into heaven, away from the wicked earth and the mortal bodies which have dragged them down into sin, but with the New Jerusalem coming down from heaven to earth, so that 'the dwelling of God is with humans' (Revelation 21:3)."  I'm thankful for N.T. Wright's retelling of a story I thought I knew well.  I'm grateful too for his acute sense of what our culture longs for for rather than, I confess, my dismissive approach to it at times as beyond repair and hopelessly lost and decadent.  He gives me hope for where revival of the  Story may come when it comes -- out of the midst of these "echoes." 
 From the opening scenes, Jacqueline Bisset's twin assets are as much stars of this movie as the actors themselves. She surely inspired the wet T-shirt. The first few minutes of this film are wordless and virtually silent as we experience some amazing underwater photography, both of the ocean floor and Ms. Bisset's graceful form. Bisset and co-star Nick Nolte are treasure hunters (I'm sure this inspired the recent Into the Blue with Paul Walker and Jessica Alba) diving off the coast of Bermuda. While exploring a wreck they find a small glass ampule and a rusted medallion and seek out the expertise of treasure-hunting legend Romer Treece (Robert Shaw) to help identify what Nolte hopes is evidence of sunken treasure. Treece initially seems as shifty as the Haitian drug lord (Louis Gossett) who is keenly interested in the ampule, so we don't immediately expect him to save the day for our two treasure hunters. It turns out there are two treasures: the ampule is part of a large cache of morphine that was sunk on a World War II supply ship. The turbulent sea floor has merged this wreck with an older Spanish galleon believed to contain a hoard of gold and jewels. Gossett plans to make a pretty penny from turning the morphine into heroin. He soon resorts to intimidation and violence when he doesn't get his way, and the rest of the movie becomes a high stakes race to recover the Spanish treasure while preventing Gossett getting his hands on the morphine. Throw in a huge man-eating moray eel and you have a fantastic action-adventure. Shaw, who was perfect for this kind of role (a tough non-PC hero), was nearing the end of his acting career with this movie while Nolte's and Bisset's stars were just beginning to shine. They are both young and beautiful and you can understand why this was as much of a summer sensation as The Blue Lagoon a few years later. Gossett is also great as the villain 
 I love this A/V amp. I agonize over purchases like this. I shopped online and compared A/V receivers for weeks before finally buying the HK. Bought it here on Amazon on a Sunday,it was shipped for free, and arrived at my doorstep on the following Tuesday! Paid at least $150 less than Fry's or Vanns's sale prices. Beautiful aesthetics. Love the silver and black faceplate and the blue LCD display. The front panel has a dim function on the remote control which is nice if you like to watch movies in low light. The sound is fantastic to my Infinity 5.1 speakers. I have no complaints whatsoever from the Audio/Video function of this device. If you have multiple components like I do from a variety of manufacturers and genres, the cabling and setup can be confusing and time consuming, but it's no harder than other amps.  I decided that HDMI pass through on this amp was ok for me because I will be upgrading to a HD or a Blue Ray DVD player soon anyway. Older movies are what they are and I like watching newer releases anyway. So I decided against the  upconverting amps.  Other reviewers complain about the remote. I understand the complaint, but I don't think its that bad. Go buy yourself a nice learning remote and program all of your components into it and don't use the HK.  Another note. Buy yourself a nice filtering surge protector/power conditioner from Belkin, Monster Cable, Panamax or Furman. You can get some pops, crackle or other electrical interference occasionally. Expect to pay over $100 for one of these. You know you need one anyway to protect your expensive electronics from electrical crashes and other power surges.   I only gave it 4 stars because I believe there are no 1's and no 5's in this price range. 
 I'm not a big Tamia fan, I have never bought any of her CD's.  I am glad I purchased this one.  The song with Eric Benet is a hit like the song "Spend my life" they did together on his album.  Her songs "Can't get enough", "Almost" and "Have to go thru it" are my  favorites.  All the songs are good, I even enjoy her remake of Aretha Franklin's "Daydreaming".  
 All I can say is excellant reading!  Good account from Major Winters himself 
 I love all of Mr. Tolle's books and tapes.  However, the use of this book and tapes help some of the families I work with that have children with behavior problems. The material helps them to focus, calm down and respond to inapporiate behavior instead of reacting to it. 
 We were having trouble getting the 10 month to go to bed peacefully and the turtle has made a big difference. By watching the stars on the ceiling he is calmer and just falls asleep. The CD helps with this also 
 I was looking at the reviews posted and I dont know what these people (kids) are talking about.  I am a child of the 80's and I grew up listening to the songs on these albums.  Every last one of the are bonafide hits-they rocked the parties I attended-and I still listen to them.  Any real hip hop head would know not only the artists listed, (most of them have made songs that are considered classics) but they would also know the words to the songs.  If you want a real education about real hip hop, buy this compilation. I didn't, because I already have all these songs, and most of them are on cassette-how about that.  Don't let the other reviews deter you -these hits are timeless and were the hype before crunk and bling took over the culture. 
 It's a shame so few movie buffs know about these shorts.  They're low-budget affairs and can't compare technically to Hitch's features, but they offer unique rewards for fans of the Master.  "Bon Voyage" is especially interesting, with several recognizable Hitchcock touches (like the climax, which anticipates a similar scene in Topaz).  Sidenote:  The reason that "Bon Voyage" is better than "Aventure Malgache" is probably because it was co-written by Angus MacPhail (of Ealing Studios), who would go on to work with Hitch on The Wrong Man.  The films were restored by the British Film Institute when they were rediscovered in the early 1990s, and the restoration is pretty good considering that they were made cheaply by the British Ministry of Information and shelved for 50 years.  "Aventure Malgache" has fared a little better than "Bon Voyage," with less debris and speckling.  But neither has any significant damage.  In short, the restoration is fine, but it's not going to wow you like the BFI's recent restoration of Michael Powell's "Edge of the World."  The DVD was a very early (1998) release from Milestone/Image.  As such, the transfer is OK, but would be better if done today.  The image is a little soft and a little dark.  Both films appear in the correct aspect ratio, though for some reason "Aventure Malgache" seems to be slightly cropped at the top of the frame.  (It's only noticeable on group close-ups.)  Considering the obscurity of these films, I doubt anyone will ever release them in better condition, and the flaws aren't significant enough to deter you from buying it.  There are no extras whatever (unless you count the liner notes, which do a satisfactory job of contextualizing the films), and the menu is uninspired.  But the chaptering is extremely generous.  All in all, this is an expensive disc for what's on offer, so I only recommend it to people who are already fans of Hitchcock.  It would've been nice if Milestone had provided more content (this title just begs for a commentary track).  But the folks at Milestone and, of course, the BFI are to be praised for getting these rarities into circulation 
 Its  just realy sad that hip-hop dont sound like  hard to earn anymore... Gang starr still gets daily airplay on my stereo and im glad i support these guys 
 Yes, this book is biased, and in many cases my opinion differs from that of the author. (I love cozies and cat mysteries, for example.) Still, Mr. Murphy's writing style is most engaging, and I find that it's fun to  mentally argue with him as I read. "The Oxford Companion to Crime and  Mystery Writing" is more comprehensive and objective than "The  Encyclopedia of Murder and Mystery," but there is much to learn and  enjoy here that is not in the Oxford book. I see the two books as  complementary rather than as competing. If you are a mystery fan, and if  you can possibly afford it, get both 
 With the many obligations in parents' daily lives, plus so many short- and long-term decisions to make, moms and dads can become confused, short-tempered, and completely stessed out.  And that leads to feelings of anxiety, guilt and incompetence. This DVD Video Guide is supportive and informative without talking down to you and helped give me the confidence I was looking for to face some of the common challenges that arise in the first 2 years. The information is clearly presented and is organized into the following developmental periods: 0-3 months, 3-6 months, 6-12 months and 12-24 months.  For the next age group...toddlers-preschoolers (ages 2, 3, 4 and 5), I highly recommend a small pocket guide called THE POCKET PARENT offering hundreds of sanity saving suggestions to try.  Set up as a quick-read A-Z guide...it covers every challenging behavior you can think of such as anger, bad words, biting, hitting, the gimmes, morning crazies, tantrums, bedtime and mealtime refusals, separation anxiety and whining.  CHILD DEVELOPMENT: The First 2 Years and THE POCKET PARENT are supportive easy reference guides for the home or daycare setting to revisit again and again. 
 Michael Gurian has succeeded in providing the public with a book that captures the true essence of what it means to be a male in today's world.  In The Good Son, he takes his readers on a journey from the moment of birth  to adulthood.  The present broadening state of violence in our schools and  the increasing amount of youth committed crimes within our society, in  general, begs the question--why?  Gurian's latest book dares to answer this  pervasive question that seemingly remains unresolved with each new shocking  headline.  The Good Son, skillfully answers a host of how's and why's.  For  example, how we as mentors, parents, relatives and teachers can help boys  express their emotions in healthy ways.  Gurian talks about the loss of  moral literacy among boys and how we can help them develop moral codes.   Whether one is connected to a boy or not, one should read this important  and practical work by Michael Gurian 
 This KVM works exactly as described.  I was a little concerned when I read the online manual because it says that the Mouse and KB USB ports are component specific.  I'm using a wireless mouse/KB combo from Logitech - it works flawlessly.  This KVM also supports the higher screen resolutions that a competing (top brand) product doesn't.  I also like that this KVM switches the audio (most don't) - therefore I can enjoy my high end speakers with both computers.  Overall it is technically excellent and available at a very competitive price 
 This book is a must for anyone studying medical biochemistry, especially for the nutritionally-oriented physician.  It is indeed very detailed, but the clinical correlations boxes really help tie the information together and make it very applicable in a clinical nutrition setting 
 I just wanted to share with you folks, my experience and feelings upon watching this GREAT pre-code, thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining, excellently acted, fast paced, non-stop dialogue, ....This film alone shows John Barrymore at his best (as a ruthless lawyer of humble origins), I won't say anything more, in order to not spoil it....but he's top of the tops in this early Universal pictures release....kudos for KINO, for releasing a decent copy (DVD) of this gem. Bebe Daniels is outstanding as his scretary...Isabel Jewell, great as unnerving telephone operator, little known Doris Kenyon, very good as Barrymore's socialite wife... also in it an early performance by reliable Melvyn Douglas and Thelma Todd too...What more can one ask?   William Wyler is definitely one of the best american directors of all time!!! 
 Love this DVD SO much! The actors are super, and the story is hilarious! If you liked the first one, GET this one 
 Gavin De Becker's "The Gift of Fear" is the most astute and fascinating dissection of human intuition that I have ever read. As far as I know, there is nothing like it anywhere. De Becker describes -- by way of personal experience and anecdotes -- how we talk ourselves out of the inexplicable suspicions and bad feelings that could be danger signals we should attend to. In case after case, he demonstrates how we actually know what is at the root of these feelings - an unexpected flash of color in a rearview mirror, a man wearing a long coat on a hot day, an attacker closing a window - cues that can save our lives if we attend to the urges that they impel us to follow. De Becker also gives us insight into the criminal mind, helping victims to analyze their experiences and helping future targets avoid being victimized. Along the way, he describes how corporations and individuals can keep merely peculiar people from becoming dangerous. The newsman who tried to rid himself of an annoying fan through intimidation ended up alienating and humiliating the fan, ultimately driving him to murder. De Becker also helps us understand how to fire unwanted employees - firmly and professionally, but by allowing them their dignity.  This book is fascinating to read and reread. The insights it provides into weird (though common) human behavior is very interesting, as is the length to which people go to talk themselves out heeding their inner voices! De Becker tells the story of a professor target by the Unabomber. This man had numerous chances to avoid opening the letter bomb that took his life, but each was rationalized away. While what happened to this man may be rare, many of us discount our feelings, considering them signs of weakness. De Becker, a man acquainted from an early age with violent behavior, might be too intense to invite to a cocktail party. Nonetheless, invite him into your life for the length of the book, and learn both about the peculiarities of our fellow humans and about the enormous and impressive gift - our intuition - that we often chose to ignore 
 I enjoyed this book but i think "Shes Come Undone" was a much better read, another of Wallys novels.  It could be the characters were male and i related better to the female character in "Shes Come Undone".  Id say it was ok.   
 Grisham departs from his usual genre to write a book with a strong sense of place and time (Arkansas, 1950s). The events of a summer of cotton picking unfold gradually through the narration of young Luke Chandler.  The author creates much the same feel that you get from Rawling's The Yearling, though this is not really a coming-of-age story. As you sit on the porch listening to the Cardinals baseball game on the radio, you become one of the family in this book. You hear the local gossip, worry about the uncle in Korea, and feel the desperation of a struggling farm family about to lose their crop.  The relationships and events become complex with the addition of the migrant Mexican workers, the hillbilly family and a varied neighbors and town folks.  I'm not quite sure what the painting of the old house was supposed to signify, but the relationships held my attention as the story flowed and unfurled through the eyes of Luke. 
 Ok, I can't really cook, and I really don't have time to try either.  I've been looking for years for a cookbook with brain dead recipes that is cheap, easy to make, and most important to me, easy to carry.  I'm a very busy person and needs to muti-task between work and school. I heard about Bisquick for years but never used it. I bought this book, sight unseen, because I thought it sounded too good to be true on how easy it is, that I would just give it a shot.  This is the best book I ever got for realist recipes that I can make.  I baked the Cheeseburger Pie, while I was cleaning my apt and doing homework.  25 mins in the oven, it came out great. With the leftovers, I reheated it in the microwave and it came out good.  This is a great book to give to somebody who can't or has very limited skills cooking or a college student, who has access to a oven or a toaster oven that can bake.  If you want to make it a gift theme, give them the book, a pie pan, and a box of Bisquick. I can not wait till have I the chance to try out the other recipes but the best thing is that each recipe comes with a calorie count for each slice. 
 This is a great read for someone who is interested in Jimi as a person and a musician. The level of detail and the author's efforts to research the facts bring Jimi into focus far better than the other bio's I have read on him. As to some comments about the "lack of excitement" all I can say is that Access Hollywood is on every night and I am sure somewhere there is some Celebrity Bimbo drunk or in rehab. Perhaps those reviewers should check that out. 
 This is a wonderful book (if you are a fan of novels such as The Great Gatsby and The Sun Also Rises) that deals with the frustrations of not only the Indians, but the newcomers to the land as well.  Dr. Aziz, Mrs. Moore, and Adela all deal with the problems that occured during the time period, with a bit of mysticism that confuses the characters unwilling to accept the mysteries of India. Fabulous look at colonization and the many types of people involved 
 Although barely known, this novel is one of the greatest works of Jack London; the reader will certainly feel trapped by the deep voice of a narrator who reveals the mysteries of other lifes, and life and death themselves, without leaving the four walls of an early 19th century prison. The problem is not the book but the binding which is too tight and makes it very difficult to flip the pages comfortably in order to enjoy the journey 
 What a fun book! I ordered one for my father (it arrived right away despite what the shipping information said). He's an old salt who swallowed the anchor long ago. Like many other boaters, he enjoys the occasional cocktail, and it was great to see him raise his glass and hear him bellow out in laughter. I ordered a bunch more for my all my friends with boats (so that they'll keep inviting me aboard). 
 An original writing style and a true love of birds and birdwatching make this one a standout. With sections on eagles, hawks, bluebills and even birdwatchers themselves, this one is a delight for the fellow birdlover 
 I grew up with this song, and I was so happy to find a book so that I can share it with my son.  He is 3 and LOVES it.  He is always humming it, and loves the book. I also got the CD, and he loves to read along with it 
 This is mic is good for the price but i didnt realize that it had to have a phantom power adapter so i had to spend about 40 bucks on that and buy to more mic cords so that ended up costing me over one hundred dollars but this mic is great and looks very pro. You cant beat the price and the only problem i have with it is the you can hear everything around you when using it loud and clear. But outher than that it is the best mic i have had thus far 
 Last Christmas I got a Bat Detector (from Bat Conservation International).  The instructions with it were very poor so I asked a local naturalist if she knew of any good bat books and specifically any that would indicate what frequency to tune the bat detector in to for our local bats.  She recommended this book and its terrific! There's a short section up front that talks about bats and how they echolocate as well as the frequencies that they do it at so this was perfect for me and my bat detector (boy is it cool!).  The real meat of the book is an id guide with great pictures and interesting information about each ofthe different species of bats - similar to a bird id book.  Since bats are genenerally out at dusk and they fly so fast I haven't been able to make use of the pictures and actually id the bats but I've narrowed it down by where we live and what we're likely to see so its fun to have a reference to read about them more specifically.  Excellent excellent book and a must have if you've just gotten a bat detector and need to know what frequency to tune into.  Highly recommended 
 Not Nick Cave's best overall album, but certainly a very good one indeed. The title track puts things in the right context, followed quickly by Stranger Than Kindness (a very rare non-cover cut that Cave didn't co-write.) Next up is The Carny, still one of Cave's most endearing songs. The pseudo-carnival music backing is the perfect backdrop for Cave's psychotic carnival-horror lyrics, that remind me a bit of books like Ray Bradbury's Something Wicked This Way Comes. Hard On For Love is... not a ballad, but, more accurately, a perverse confession of lust, made likable by Cave's over-the-top vocal performance. The highlight of the album however, most would argue, is Sad Waters. Perhaps Cave's first truly strong ballad, this is still considered one of his best songs to this day. A very strong cover of Tim Rose's Long Time Man is handled deftly by Cave and The Seeds, and it's lyrics of spousal murder coupled with their totally commanding performance will leave you finding it hard to believe that they didn't write the piece in the first place. For all intents and purposes, this is the last song on the album. Following it is Scum, a semi-hilarous non-song that will appeal to those who appreciate Cave's sense of humor. This set is, in many ways, the step between Cave's first handful of albums and what many consider to be his masterpiece, Tender Prey. Thus, it is an excellent album, and must be purchased for this reason 
 I must admit that I had the tape for years and still play it to death.  This is one of the best offerings that Big Country have done.  It is one of my prized possesions.  The songs are pure rock and roll only Big Country know how to play.  My favourites on the album are too many to name but 99% of them will keep you tapping your feet for hours and songs will stay in your head.  This is a must and their 3rd studio album (not counting the Wonderland EP) that they release. Get it you won't be disappointed 
 Hi,  I work as an ISP development staff member and from time to time write monitoring tools for our support team. I wanted to start learning php in order to add some web interfaces to our tools.  I have found this book a very good book for the php/mysql beginner like me, great for the fact that it deals also with the installation part and even gives you all the php modules/commands you can use.  the interaction with mysql is also great from the begining and you start develop your skills using these 2 great tools.  one thing I would like to see is interaction with the system, with the exec commands for example.  beside that, this book is great 
 A very sincere Bro. who almost get's too caught-up in the moment. This is old-time religion, and Donnie has a good recall of many old-time standards. But not as smooth, or soothing as his "Live in London" CD 
 Other comments were written based on the assumption that the general reader of this text is an initiate with very little experience.  I have a different view of this text.  This book could serve as a "grounding" goldmine for the more advanced into all types of magick.  Read this just to wake you from the fast track! It supplies some benchmark for individual practitioners! And if you didn't like -or understood- what you read? well, the text takes only a few hours to read, and maybe something really worth wile got stuck to your subconcious.  I almost bet my name on it!  Then stop complaining if you consider yourself as "above level"- you then most probably have read 5000 page texts with less meaning (not even to mention the low price- I think the paper is worth more and could serve as nifty gift wrap if you really can't grasp the concepts).  The text is non-straining, practical and if allowed, "sweet". Guess it sounds like I really want you to buy it. Yes I do.  And I guess if I were payed for the "advertisemnt", then the text would be more expensive. So buy it.  I think there would be less psychopaths as a result of the process of magick, having more texts like these at hand. Great 
 This book has helped me to explore the different influences that affect our happiness in life, and it has clarified what used to only be vague intuitions for me. Clearly Dr. Cloninger has spent most of his life exploring the fundamental issues that reach us all. I think this book gives us a preview of a new approach that many people will soon use in art and science 
 Like most short story collections, the individual stories vary in length and quality.  It is hard to categorize the stories as they cover a range of topics and human emotions.  Some deal with the supernatural and some with people's desires.  The author notes that she finds it hard to write short stories.  I have personally found that writing short stories is easy, but finding editors to publish them is extremely hard.  Perhaps that is why the author has published them as a collection.  Some are longer, complete stories; and some seem to be more in the category of short scenes.  I particularly liked the man contemplating suicide who decided to indulge himself in things he would have never otherwise have done, e.g., two leather-clad blondes in a parked vehicle.  And then their is the story about the ugly sister, and her feelings about Cinderella.  There is the woman trying to use an ancient cookbook who obtains some very, very strange results.  There is the class reunion, but a class from a rather strange school.  Overall, the author is very creative, and has let her mind wander in some strange directions.  But that makes for a collection of good stories 
 I could bring this with me whenever I'm traveling. The design of the flashcards also helps you know what words you tackled. Great preparation for the GRE vocabulary section 
 The usual futuristic murder, mayhem, electronic intrigue, and psychological angst familiar to fans of Lieutenant Eve Dallas, the brainchild of Nora Roberts, a.k.a. J.D. Robb, take a back seat, again as usual, to Roberts' ever-evolving characters. Like the tough, courageous, makeup-scorning New York-loving culturally deprived but brilliantly wise Eve, the reader has difficulty selecting a favorite from Roberts' list of "suspects": the stalwart, always-hungry Officer Delia Peabody, Eve's sidekick, fretting over the detectives' exam; Peabody's main squeeze, the ultimate computer geek Detective Ian McNab, whose relationship with Peabody Eve has at last (reluctantly) accepted; Charles Monroe, the smooth-talking but heart-of-gold LC (that's high-class legal prostitute) dating Eve's doctor friend after a tense love triangle with Peabody and McNab; Mavis Freestone, Eve's pregnant but untamed friend; Dr. Charlotte Mira, the razor-sharp-within-velvet-gloves New York police (NYPSD) psychologist who horrifies Eve by inviting her to a family barbecue; Eve's mother and father, who would make Susan Smith's blood run cold, glimpsed in Eve's nightmares; and Roarke, Eve's wealthy, romantic, utterly sexy (his attempt at a private barbecue is adorably botched) husband who, like her, emerged from a rough childhood as a productive if not always law-abiding citizen.  Motherhood and family, including the extended family Eve has put together (her relationships with Peabody, Roarke and Mira in particular become richer), form the heart of this thriller, combined with the sharp police work, moral compass and hot loving sex readers have come to expect 
 The 1st time I read this book, I flipped it over & began again the second I finished the last page.  That was 6 years ago and I have read it many times since.  Joy williams tells a sort of falling-out-of-love  story...very touching, very poetic, often very funny.  The isolation  everyone feels in modern society is an omnipresent theme & it is often  explored here with a surreal exactness 
 While I was reading this book I either a) had this goofy smile on my face or b) was laughing out loud.  This was the funniest book I have ever read!  I read the first book and to be honest thought it was just alright, but I loved the first movie.  Saw the second movie and thought it was alright, but loved the second book.  I think if the movie had left out all that Daniel drama and the girl from Darcy's law office and put in more of the Rebecca drama, crazy parents and friends stories,and more of Darcy, the movie would have been as good as the book.  I guess the movie wanted to bring in more of Hugh Grant's character.  Best parts of Bridget's Jones Edge of Reason: 1) Interview with Colin Firth aka the wet shirt interview 2) Dry cleaner's Valentine's 3) Christmas cards 4) Singleton program for the Labour party 5) Cell phone in dumpster 6) Walk down aisle with bra  Bridget is a lovable, sweet ding-bat.  Even during normal situations she can somehow find a way to make it embarassing and funny.  Oddly enough I think a lot her thoughts and feelings are still understandable and relatable to an average person. Yeah some of the crazy escapades she gets herself into are far-fetched but it's way I loved this book.   
 Like a lot of people I saw here on the Blueman tour where she was amazing.  This is a solid CD throughout.  I highly reccomend it 
 Super Searchers Make It On Their Own joins others in the Informaton Today "Super Searchers" series, continuing the process of interviewing top researchers and discovering how they do business. Here the searchers are running their own research businesses, developing niches, locating clients, and networking. Super Searchers Make It On Their Ownn is an intriguing, practical guide on the industry of research and how researchers can make a business out of their pursuits 
 My title refers to Heidegger's characterization of many received views--typically, they are OK in a restricted context, but miss the boat in a broader sense. I like Szasz (even have had my own work compared favorably to his once--in a letter to Editor, Am J. of Psychotherapy, in response to a paper of mine on the false memory syndrome), but, like others have in the past, see him as going overboard in some ways. Just because the notion of mental illness is so flawed and indefensible, as are the various neurobiological explanations and interventions, that doesn't have to mean that, say, "schizophrenia", or criminal behavior, are just actions of bad faith, maliciousness, evil, etc. One does not have to see these "entities" either as "mental illnesses" or offer some simple, commonsense, nonclinical alternative. There is such a thing as early human development (including foetal development), and if a person's evolution is deeply flawed (as is so frequently the case in our society) then the inner and outer behaviors will be pathological as well.(The nature/nurture dichotomy is inane, not viable--the two factors are inextricably intertwined from the start in utero.) That is one of the seminal contributions of Freud, buttressed by 100 years of world-wide clinical exploration and experience. To understand "psychopathology" adequately, one needs to look into the problems more deeply than Szasz manages to do; notions re psychopathology and psychotherapy involve basic notions such as  the nature of self, mind, thought, intent, perception, language, inner/outer boundaries, etc. These paradoxial and elusive notions can't be simplistically explained or dismissed. I've tried to address these matters over decades in numerous publications 
 A lot of ink has been spilled over Iraq during the past four years, and for good reason.  With any subject so controversial and contested, there will obviously be a lot of polemical and harmful writing from both sides of the argument, but thankfully, a lot of well-informed and intelligent writing as well.  With so much out there, sifting through it all can be demanding, but anyone that comes across The Assassins' Gate will have in their hands one of the true gems on the subject.  If you are only going to read one book on what is currently happening in Iraq, I passionately believe that this should be the book.  It's hard to tell exactly what you're going to get just by looking at the title and what's on the back cover, but I can assure you that all of the comments on the back (made by some of the most respected foreign policy critics) are dead on in their assessment.  What you'll find in this book is the story of how the U.S. (again) found itself in Iraq.  The beginning chapters foucs on the decision making process; who was making them and how.  This is perhaps the most well-written and intelligent description of these events, and I have read more than several of them.  You will gain more insight on how we got into this war from reading Packer's book than from perhaps anywhere else.  He gives the reader wonderful character sketches of people like Paul Wolfowitz, Robert Kagan, and Kanan Makiya.  These are the people that really had a large hand in what was happening, and by focusing on them rather than the bigger names like Bush or Rumsfeld, Packer does a much better job at explaining these events than his peers.  The rest of the book deals with Packer's personal experiences in Iraq during the war.  Each chapter deals with a different theme, such as the insurgency & the potential for a civil war, and while the scope of what's covered in the bulk of the book is somewhat more narrow than the first three or four chapters, Packer still gives the reader a very satisfying account of the war as a whole.  This book's biggest strenght is that it blends nearly flawless political analysis with the readability of a novel.  Packer is a superb writer and I found it very hard to put this book down.  From an academic point of view the book is close to flawless.  This in itself is very impressive, because it does not appear that Packer had much previous experience with Iraq.  I've read the works of those considered to be area experts and some of them can't even hold a match to Packer's work here.  This is exciting and depressing all at once.  I found this book to be particularly good because it also fit perfectly with my own personal feelings about the war.  As someone that wanted to see Hussein gone, I had to support the idea of removing him (and still do).  But beyond that initial decision, the way the Bush administration handled the war has been negligent at best, criminal at worst.  Packer has not written a polemical rant here, but by the end of his book, he lets you know that very real and harmful mistakes have been made.  He occupies that well-intentioned, but pragmatic middle ground that this debate so sorely needs.  This book will appeal to casual observers and serious analysts alike.  While books by Diamond and Feldman that cover similar themes are also excellent and should be read, Packer's book is by far the best, and I believe that no one can claim to truly have a grasp on what's happening in Iraq unless they have read this book.  We can only hope that Packer will continue to produce work of such extraordinarily high quality on this and other foreign policy issues 
 Daniel Bays has written an excellent history of Chinese Christianity - one that both summarized existing research as well as presenting new mateial. It is well-written and easy to read 
 but also about the history of ethnic Greeks in Asia Minor, and in the United State 
 The program seems to be much more accurate.  I am still learning but I feel it was a worthwhile investment.  I can write my e-mail much faster now.  I highly recommend it and I feel it was worth the cost 
 This book was a overview/introduction to building a green home.  Should be a must read for builders and anyone planning on building a new home.  Not all strategies will work for every situation, but there's lots here that would apply for any situation or budget.  
 I realize this is an old title, I've not had a chance to get to all of the back list, I only first read Hiaasen a couple years ago.    Anyway, Hiaasen is a writer, pure and simple, but he also has a good idea of what goes on in the human mind and behind closed doors.  That kind of cynicism and satirical writing can be horrible if not handled well, but he pulls it off and I've enjoyed the several titles I've had a chance to read.  This one was funny and pointed out some of the absurd things we let happen in our houses of government.  While the story centers around a stripper, it is really a story about corruption and politics.  In any case, if you haven't had a chance to check out this author, this is a good a place as any I suppose and I give this one a strong recommendation 
 Man if you're a fan of Heaven Shall Burn, this will not diappoint. They come back as heavy as ever before and just brutal. One of my personal favorites of 2006. I believe Heaven Shall Burn and Caliban are one of the most underrated bands out to date. You want metal? Get it from these guys out of Germany. This is not no weak hardcore dance around bs. This is I want to kiiill some one metal! Each track is enjoyable for anyone looking for something different and just straight up brutallity 
 Overall a good book, but several chapters dragged with irrelevent and boring information. I also didnt like the way the author constantly assumes something happened because he thinks he knows the man so well when there is no evidence of it actually taking place 
 If you a big fan of horrorcore or Psychopathic Records you'll love this 
 This is a good book for young women struggling with body image and self-loathing. Those suffering from an eating disorder often feel alone and isolated - this will help them to know that they are not alone. The book sends the message of learning to accept themselves and reject the unattainable quest for perfectionism. 
 Newman's third book in the ANNO DRACULA series is arefreshingly light look at post-WWII Italy in his alternate universewhere Dracula (after having ruled England as Queen Victoria's PrinceConsort from 1885-88, then acted as Kaiser Wilhelm's chief militarystrategist during WWI) has retired in semi-exile to a large castlejust outside of Rome. Having recently announced his engagement to thevampiress Princess Asa Vajda of Moldavia, vampire elders aredescending upon Rome.

Also in Rome are the dying Charles Beauregard and hislover, 500+ year-old vampire Genevieve Dieudonne. Charles is beingquestioned by England's top spy, a vampire with a license to kill,about Dracula's possible motives for this wedding. Things soon take anasty turn, and vampire journalist Kate is soon in the thick of thehunt for the Crimson Executioner, too. The story takes great delightin lifting elements from Felini, Italian giallo horror movies, andeven THE EXORCIST! A great, fun read, not terribly scary but stillquite exciting as a vampire story where the bloodsuckers are bothheroes and villains. Can't wait for Newman's next, JOHNNY ALUCARD 
 I thoroughly enjoyed "New Jack" and recommend it to anyone.  The unique detail of this book is that it gives insight to not only a prison guard but a new one.  The lack of training that he got really startled me but it should not of.  Although being an inmate would be hell, being a guard is almost just is bad, in that you are incarcerated mentally even though one can leave at the end of the day.  The book is not a critique of the penal system but more a guide to what happens on a day to day basis.  Conover the writer explores the madness and monontiny (sp?) that goes on, yet while he still had to be Conover the guard.  He spares no grimy detail like extracting a prisoner yet does not dramatize or liberty with the facts.    I can't imagine being a guard myself, and the writer asks that same question.  Pick up this title.  
 Just like "Time and Again" is a classic for anyone living in Manhattan, "Rabble in Arms" is a necessary novel to read for anyone who wants to understand the poignant history of the Hudson River Valley, Lake Champlain and New England. This novel wonderfully describes how Benedict Arnold saved the United States three months after it was born, by heading off a British invasion (out of Canada) in a naval battle off Valcour Island in Lake Champlain. The novel also describes the Battle of Saratoga which took place one year after the above naval battle. Amid the great fictional character development, one sees in vivid detail just how important a man Benedict Arnold was in the founding of our nation...and just how heartbreaking his later betrayal had to have been to everyone involved. One clearly sees that Benedict Arnold could not later reverse the fortunes of the new nation he had so bravely fought for in the beginning 
 This book is the perfect guide for a new diabetic or dieter.  In the  colorful pages you will find out how to classify the foods you eat.  Is a  potato counted as a vegetable or a starch?  This book will answer that  among many other food questions!  As a Registered Dietitian, I use this  with all of my new clients watching their food intake 
 True Funk and jazz fans will definitely get into this cd.  Persons who aren't that into jazz will also get into this cd.  The flow and grooves are amazing, and will lift up anybody's spirits.  It's smooth, soulful, funky, sexy, etc, etc, etc! Oh and whoever did the mixing, did a hell of a great job! The 2nd track Panacea is my favorite, but they're all great! Your head will start bobbing and you foot will start tapping, without you even knowing it! This cd is for partying, wining and dining, chilling, cleaning your house, car rides, small get togethers, and most importantly it's great to lift ones spirits and make you smile if your feeling a little blue or lacking of energy. This sh#t is tight! 
 MAC LipGlass is the absolute best. There are plenty of colors to choose from, SUPER-Shiny, and the gloss is thick, stays on and doesn't run.  The best colors are.... NICO for a cute lavender pink color with a glittery shine.  OYSTERGIRL is a shimmery baby pink. OH BABY is the perfect gloss for any earth toned lipstick. CHAI looks amazing with black smokey eyes. It's the perfect neutral earthy gloss and has no glitter or shimmer - just pure shine 
 Alaska is a harsh environment with fantastic resources, and the stories of the people who chose to go to Alaska to harvest those riches make for a compelling, epic novel.  The characters vary from the early hunters, to the Russian traders, to gold rushers, to the oil drillers, and on and on, but the theme is clear:  Alaska punishes and rewards those who make their lives there.  Going on a trip to Alaska?  You'll enjoy it much more with an understanding of the history of the Great Land, and there's no better way to absorb history than through great storytelling like Michener's 
 This puzzle is great. My boys love putting the pieces in and out. It encourages them to not only problem solve but helps with their hand eye coordination. Definitely a must have for kids ages 2 and up 
 If you want to read a great book then read Silver Packages because it will just touch your heart. It all started when no one had anything so every Christmas a man came and threw silver packages out the back of the train.  Chris Soentpiet's illustrations are colorful and interesting 
 There's not much to say. This collection of the Suncoast Chronicles is amazing. A great mystery and the excitement doesn't stop at all 
 I needed more coverage than the typical FRS radios provide.  I work with people outdoors in hilly terain, reliable communications is vital, so I tried 4 of these SX800R radios from Mot.  They where easy to set up and use.  The crew trained up in less that 5 minutes. They provided the extended coverage needed and worked reliably.  Fast recharge and day long battery life was just what we needed.  The FCC has a quick and pain free way to get the license to operate at the higher power levels of GMRS. Still in use today and very handy. 
 Elizabeth Cady Stanton's speech embodies my philosophy, my theology and the definition of my own personal sovereignty.  Every woman, indeed every person, should read it 
 The Regulators is full of horror, action and well-thought-out characters. As to be expected of King. But ... it was miles different to any other novel of his I have read so far. The letters, statements and diary entries was a nice touch, heling you get more in touch with the leading female character.    As well as horror and action, parts of this book are very emotional. And then again, other parts made me laugh out loud.    Often people say you HAVE to read this with Desperation. That is not true. It uses most of Desperation's characters, but they're mixed around and portrayed differently than in Desperation. Although, if you were planning on reading both, i would reccommend Desperation first. Mainly because it is a bigger novel, and you really feel the atmosphere of the town of Desperation itself in it. This may make it easier to envision the fake mirage of Desperation in The Regulator.   A stunning must-read that you will put down with a warm fuzzy feeling 
 Starship Troopers Review  "If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself." (James Madison, Federalist 51)  Caution: Forget the movie. Like "I, Robot," this was really an independently written script that, at the last moment, had a title from a loosely-related sci-fi classic slapped on the film.  All this does is to confuse the consumers, betrays the fans, and in the long run, hurts sales.  First, H is right on with military and military force, as presented in the first few chapters.  There has yet to be a civilization that endures by sacrificing justice to mercy.  Radical pacifism empowers evil, and is ultimately a death-wish.  If we cannot see why we should live, then I am at a loss as what to say. Maybe "Adios"?  Second: admittedly his approach to discipline--flogging--is repugnant to normal sensitivities.  However, in matters of life and death--be it a hospital, police, fire department, or military--there is no room of sloppiness. Especially preventable sloppiness.  In the United States there are roughly 50K medical malpractice deaths per year.  (Compare this to 1K deaths a year in Iraq.)  I am not advocating torture (which is different than discipline, which, in turn, is different from corporeal punishment), but what are we to do when so many hyper-educated people making so many mistakes so often?  And what happens if the military makes similar sloppy mistakes against these very dangerous enemies?  Are we back to the death-wish in the name of compassion?  Of course, the most controversial is the over-all tenor of the government.  It usually gets branded as fascist, but the accuser never defines that ward.  In a technical sense, fascism is a form of statism, where government has indirect control over industry.  H never talks about the financial-economic aspects of his future system, so I am unsure why people use the word fascist.  The real issue is not fascism, but statism: centralized coercive power, guided by fallible mortals.  Obviously, H presents an ideal and idealized military.  In fact, his system only works if everyone in politics and military is a Doc Smith Lensman.  But men are not Lensmen, much less angels, and this is the essential flaw with his system.  What are we to do with the trousered apes?   Additionally, the bare bones system with the infantrymen is also unreal.  Certainly it is more efficient--on paper.  But Adam Smith said that the genius of America is specialization.  The incident with Juan being the "George" illustrates that. Of course he could not do all the George duties, but that also means that every other George most likely  has the similar problem.  It all adds up, and what is the long term consequence considering the turnover rate?  Having citizenship limited to ex-servicemen is an interesting idea.  The Mormon Church has an (almost) similar system.  Generally most of the male volunteer leadership have serves mission. Laying aside the necessity for religion to proselyte and evangelize, this regimented missionary provides a universal standard of socialization, leadership opportunity, and preparation.  Personally speaking (and Orson Scott Card would agree), serving a mission is essential to who I am, not just as a believer, but as a human being in general.  Of course the problem once again is the people problem. I do not think compulsive military service is the answer--it is a violation of life, liberty and property. But something like this would be helpful on a voluntary basis.   *  I see this book as part of a trilogy that is essential reading for young men, teen to high school.  I recommend "Space Cadet," then "Starship Troopers," and finally "Citizen of the Galaxy," with "Farmer in the Sky" as a preface.  Boys will be boys, but they do not have to be that way.  To his credit Heinlein wrote these books with young men in mind, for which I am personally grateful 
 Hilarious, heart breaking and funny all at the same time. This video will be a staple in my library for years to come 
 No sensitive, thinking person can read "The Old Wives' Tale" without being immensely touched and moved by it.  Bennet's story of two sisters who pursue vastly different lives is tough-minded, wise without being cold, emotional without being sentimental (some- thing that even Dickens was scarcely capable of).  The story grips one like a thriller, but the book is far more than that. The last section "What Life Is" reminds us that truth is just as often felt in the the heart as perceived in the mind.  And the only response one is left with is, "yes, now I see."  A VERY great book 
 As a baking fanatic, I was in search of a cookbook that would allow me to continue baking, while not expanding my waistline in similar proportions.  This book is the answer!  I was somewhat skeptical at first...as I am a firm believer in shortening and sugar.  But Ms. Woodruff's book is filled with delicious recipes!  I was thoroughly surprised, and very happy.  I make a different muffin recipe each week, and bring these low-fat muffins to work as breakfast all week long (sure beats Pop-Tarts or hi-fat muffins).  A favorite is the Mandarin Orange Blueberry muffins.  And for cookies, the Butterscotch Crisps are sure to satisfy the sweet tooth in all of us.  I can't wait to purchase Ms. Woodruff's OTHER cookbooks 
 Black & White is incredibly well-written and enjoyable to read. Shapiro's descriptions of the photo shoots, while disturbing, are captivating. The reader can visualize the scenes (and the characters) so easily. In my opinion, the image of Clara's father is the most heart-breaking; all he wanted to do was protect his daughter and her innocence from the masses. While I was surprised by the minimal sympathy I felt for Ruth near the end, I was never entirely convinced that she deserved it. I'm sure the book will leave readers debating Ruth's motives and her love for her children 
 Every parent should have this book. It covers everything you can think of. The one for birth to age 5 is excellent too. It gives you the facts, pros and cons for every situation. Totally helpful. 
 Where do I start? The band sounds awsome, the arraingements are awsome,Montanez is awsome (as usual),the songs are awsome, everything about this cd is AWSOME!!! This cd is one of those rare ones where each track is great. In fact I wish there were more than just 10 tracks on this cd. I certainly hope that the team of Andy Montanez and Sergio George make many more cds. This is the best Salsa album in years! Andy Montanez mixes Salsa With Reggaeton and the the result is: 'SALSATON '. This is going to be the next dance craze all over the world. This CD is a MUST HAVE! 
 I read this book both in Chinese and English. This is definitely a great book that I would like to keep on my shelf and read again and again to go through each detail. This is a great book not only to understand the real  Chinese culture but also to know the importance of living 
 I got exactly what i wanted in exactly the amount of time I wanted it.  The book so far has been challenging and insightful, and I'm anxious to put it into practice 
 As a busy Women's Health NP, I have used other texts on medication use in pregnancy and during lactation, as well as Dr. Hale's website.  I find this book enormously helpful in my practice.  It is clear and concise, as well as being very comprehensive.  It is great to bring into the exam room to review the information with the patient 
 Slaughterhouse five is by far a great pies of work by Kurt Vonnegut. The story's plot focuses on the life of the protagonist named Billy. The story can be a little complicated being that it is a story in a story of the author's who is a character in the book. The book more or less has no structure in it. The plot structure cannot be described as linear, but rather it is more spatial in its organization. the style of the story to me was almost bleak and depressing, with a subtle mention of science-fiction in it 
 I admit I was suspect when I first picked up this set and saw Ed Asner was reading Stormy Weather. Carl Hiaasen books get pretty raunchy at times and I was not sure I could listen to Ed Asner reading about hot and dirty action. I was pleased to find my misgivings to be unfounded. The consummate actor Mr. Asner brings Stormy Weather to life with a dry , sardonic wit that fits the material and allows the listener to get to know the characters and revel in their adventures and misadventures.  The most colorful character in this ensemble piece- the crazy ex-governor turned swamp dweller Skink is particularily well drawn in Asner's reading. This is one of my favorite Hiaasen books and I am very happy I got an audio copy to listen to in the car!  For those of you who are new to Hiaasen- the governor appears again in Sick Puppy. 
 Not for the beginner, this book really delivers on the promise of its title. An hour after opening it, I was doing things I'd wanted to do for a long time.Rubenking starts by showing you how to take control of a form's basic appearance -- yes, you can remove the caption and keep the border! He goes onto help you make Delphi's various components behave the way you'd like, and includes information on accessing helpful Windows API functions. Some ofthe other topics are date math, DLLs, the application object, data-aware controls -- and lots more. Sophisticated topics are explained in comprehensiblelanguage. Both the 16- and 32-bit versions are covered. This book can help you reach the next level of Delphi programming in a short tim 
 I loved Huey, Live at 25. It really brought me back to "my old days". Good vibe and feel good music, Huey is the best 
 Sure, Magazine has definitely made better records than "The Correct Use of Soap" but "Song from Under the Floorboards" is one of the catchiest songs I've ever heard. It's seriously been stuck in my head CONSTANTLY for years. It's always in my mind and no matter where I go or what I do I'm always singing or humming it.  I don't know what it is about the song, just one of those things that gets caught in your brain and nothing can possibly remove it. And oh yea, the rest of the  songs are great too.I highly recommend this album,infinite replay value. 
 Roger Moore is a stud, debonair and chivalrous.  Knowing that these are over 30 years adds to the fun.  Interesting mysterys that take you around the world still work 
 This book, Styron's finest, is about redemption.  Heralded by the epigraph from John Donne, the intricately structured tale with its Marlowian manipulations of narrative points of view soon becomes so enthralling that  it's impossible to put down.  But it's also to Styron's great credit that  the novel's theme, redemption through confrontation with death and  violence, is reflected through its feverish style.  There are not many  books in the postwar era, and none in the United States, that have such a  non-moralistic but intensely moral character and impact.  Echoes of the  Greek tragedians (several times evoked in the text) and of Dostoyevski  abound.  Finally, the crucial role by the most-fleshed out non-expatriate  character, a philosophical Italian small-town cop named Luigi, elevates the  moral drama to a metaphysical dimension that most contemporary writers  don't even seem to understand, let alone approach.  It's a shame that  Styron has not received the Nobel Prize yet 
 THIS AUTHOR TELLS IT LIKE IT IS IN A PRACTICAL, USER FRIENDLY WAY.  I SUFFERED FROM PARASITES FOR YEARS BEFORE MY DOCTOR FOUND THE PROBLEM.  I ONLY WISH I HAD FOUND THIS BOOK EARLIER.  THANK YO 
 This is a book with a variety of projects including a shawl, hats, a sleeveless  top and matching jacket, teacosy and a fulled bag. Some of the projects (shawl and beret) are designed to use various yarns from your stash.Most of the yarns are 8 ply (DK weight) and the sizing is fairly generous (up to finished size 116 cm bust). All of the projects show a beautiful use of colour 
 WHY IS THIS BOOK LISTED UNDER THE "HUMOR" CATEGORY????? THIS IS A BOOK ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST. I DONT THINK THATS CONSIDERED HUMOR.. 
 If Whitnet Balliett were a musician, he'd probably be someone like Teddy Wilson, whose sometimes spare but dancing lines were always distinct, no matter the context. Balliett's musings on the more important jazz musicians, published originally in The New Yorker, are models of criticism that never betray his love and admiration for the music. It is unlikely that anyone will ever write as well as he has about America's most important contribution to the arts 
 I primarily run outside and this is a great product for that. It stays on my arm and I have no problem accessing the wheel. There are 2 flaws, it is weather resistant but not waterproof. I never use it in anything harder than a light rain and the case is very snug so the stitching gets stressed. I've had mine for 4 months and I use it 4-5x/week and the stitching has started to give in one spot. I have restitched it, but I would've expected it to last longer. 
 No, seriously.  See, I am a great organizer...at work.  At home, every horizontal space becomes a pile of clutter within about a day.  Specific organizing suggestions did me no good--then I read Morgenstern's book, and realized why I was cluttered (and why, unlike every other room in the house or apartment, my kitchen never got cluttered).  A large part of my problem was that I didn't feel like I lived in the places I lived--I moved 2-3 times a year in college, and 3 times in the year following graduation.  So this last time around, when I signed a 9-month lease, I immediately unpacked, organized the bookshelves, and put up posters and stained glass and candle holders and Christmas lights.  Now I do a little cleaning every day and pretty much stay on top of things--I'm not perfect, but I have never been more organized at home in my life.  If you find someone else's storage solutions don't work for you, Morgenstern might help you figure out why you're cluttered--and which solutions will work for you 
 Kiefer provides an eclectic escape that covers nature, people, politics and history...and all within the confines of a true tale! I will never gawk at those cute bears the same way again, knowing the story of their "discovery" and what that story tells us of the specific times--and the general nature of people.  The read is "light," yet one learns a bit along the way.  This is my version of a nearly perfect summer read.  A romantic "novel" for thinking persons 
 this must be a great book it has good reviews and the author has the same name as me lol a must bu 
 Hilarious farce about a Glasgow hairdresser who comes to Los Angeles to compete in an international hairdressing competition.  Done in "mockumentary" style, there are cameo appearances by several real-life celebrities playing themselves, which adds to the illusion of reality.  Craig Ferguson, who also co-wrote the script, is outstanding in the lead role.  He is ably assisted by a first rate supporting cast, and a very funny script.  This movie this is a real hoot from beginning to end 
 I have a huge knitting library and have been knitting for decades.  While this is definitely not a book that will become your newest knitting bible, it has such a fresh and sunny disposition that it's hard not to love it.  The patterns show a wide range, and although there are plenty I will never make, I enjoy just seeing things like a knitted silk evening gown!  On the more practical end, while there is certainly nothing new about a simple knit hoodie (even with nice waist shaping), knitting it in the fiber suggested in the book makes both the knitting and the wearing a treat.  To me, it is the kind of knitting experience you get when you go to your favorite yarn store, see something really cute that you never would have thought of on your own, and walk away with a really happy purchase and really happy knitting vibes. 
 I"M INTERESTED ABOUT HRRICANES AND TORNADOES TOO THIS DK BOOK WAS JUST SO EXCITING  [... 
 Great product.  My child has autism spectrum disorder and this is a program that holds her interest.  She really likes the different music she can select and says some of it helps to calm her down.  I love it 
 I've been a fan from the beginning, and this is my favorite Sleater-Kinney album (though THE WOODS is now vying for the title!). The others always get talked up more than this, arguably their most intimate and painful record. I don't know if it's the production, the lyrics, or the music itself, but this record always feels to me like a secret whispered by your best friend in a dark bedroom late at night and long ago, or a kiss from someone you know you can't hold onto. The technique of Corin and Carrie singing two different lyrics at the same time is in itself a feminist statement -- you cannot pin us down, we are both at once. Although I loved their records before this, THE HOT ROCK is The One that made me fall IN love with them 
 This magazine is an interesting mix of pictures of hot women wearing very little, short articles on sexual improvement books, health, and beaty products. If any other these interest you; I would highly recommend this mazagine. 
 I was reluctant to buy this book based on the first reviews I read.  However, I have been daytrading for four years now, and frequently go against the crowd.  Perhaps it is this contrarian view that keeps me in this business.  I manage a proprietary firm in Denver (Bright Trading) and recommend this to ALL the new traders as well as veterans of the craft.  It is fresh, insightful and really gets to the meat of what makes one trader successful while another fails. A great companion to this book is Mark Douglas' book Trading In The Zone 
 Not as focused as the first ASIA. Yet it contains their 2 best songs of their career, Midnight Sun and Open Your Eyes and for those 2 gems it should not be overlooked. The band was breaking up and you can here it in the stale arrangments, but It's still very good 80's pop rock 
 Force of Nature and Vital Force are the first cds I have purchased by 3rd Force after hearing them on a satellite radio contemporary jazz station. Not a bad track on this CD and I am continually amazed at the variety of music on this cd and the addition of Peter White, Rick Braun and Craig Chaquico only add to it. Of the two, Force of Nature blows me away and is a great choice for anyone looking to add some great jazz/new age music to their library, you won't regret i 
 All I can say is my family LOVES this CD!  We have a blast singing along, dancing, etc.  It's made opera a new discovery for all of us 
 This book is great, whether your a beginner or an expert just wanting to go back to your roots. Every part is described and you have websites that you can order them from. It's all very good. But there are just some things to keep in mind. First of all, there's a section on motors where he describes them and what they're used for. I assumed that we needed to buy them, so I bought the 5 pack that he mentions. Now on the next chapter afterwards, it turns out that we dont need those motors, but we need gearhead motors. So to me I was a little bummed because the motors he describes are basically for you to test and have fun with. It wasn't expensive but I was a little misguided and didnt like the shipping expense I made on motors I wasn't even going to apply to the robot. This brings me up to my next point: BUY ALL THE PARTS YOU NEED IN ONE ORDER. I had the idea of slowly ordering my parts as I read the book but the problem is that places like Digi-Key charge you a ridiculous amount for shipping, and when you need only 3 resistors and the shipping is about 10-20 times its cost, it gets a little annoying. So I would suggest just skimming the whole book to see what parts you will need and then getting them all together. This will also save you time as you go through the book since you will have all the parts that you need.   One other thing is that if your a beginner, make sure you have somewhat of a small fund for this. Even though it is true that everything is cheap, it depends on what you have. I didnt really have the tools such as soldering irons, crimpers, etc. so I needed to get all of these things. But I know I will continue with other books to become better in the field of robotics so I had no problem spending the money. If you intend on doing the same, then it will all be worth it and after you make your first robot, your second and future projects will be much cheaper since you will have the tools.  I guess as a last note I didnt enjoy the idea of using lego wheels for the robot mainly because for some reason I couldn't easily find axles for them. Another problem was also the tiny diameter copper tubing that you need to purchase to make the coupler. The smallest I could find was 1/4'. It wasn't impossible to do it in spite of these problems, it made me think, so I guess it wasn't all too bad. Oh, and when you do solder the parts together, PLEASE TRY TO BE CAREFUL WITH HOW YOU SOLDER. I did it a  bit messy since I just started soldering things together but by the time I was done with the circuit, it was hard to add more circuitry, or to check if everything was well connected.   All in all, its a good buy. Be patient and have fun with it 
 This is the first of three great books by Gerald Massey on the relation between all the world's religions, cultures and languages and the ancient Egyptian that is, in itself, rooted in the lake region of Central Africa at the source of the Nile. In the first volume of this book, Massey discusses the extremely ancient origins of Egypt and then goes into great detail and depth in showing how the British Druidic culture is Egyptian in its origin. Volume two does the same for the ancient Hebrew culture. These books are a gold mine, They are filled with detail upon inspiring detail. See my review of *Natural Genesis.* Massey's books are indespensible for anyone interested in the great African cultures, the British Druidic culture, the origins of the Hebrew culture, the problems of Christianity, the origins of Buddhism, and the origins of all the world's myths, including the biblical legends, and languages; he shows Egyptian words that show up in a very large number of languages including even the American Indian, Maori, Japanese, Chinese, European, African and so on. Massey focuses through his volumes on the British Druidic, Hebrew, and Christian traditions, and explores in extraordinary depth the Egyptian, and its root culture deep in Africa. Anyone who studies the African traditions can easily see the connections of Massey's findings with the African traditions. Egypt goes back hundreds of thousands of years and comes from the same root as all the other African traditions. All of Massey's books are published by BCP (Black Classics Press). 
 I have every DVD program that Ravi Singh & Ana Brett have released, & they just get better & better -- smoother, more professional, higher quality production.  It is hard to imagine how they could top these last three.   When I began doing their first workout, Kundalini for Beginners & Beyond, I was a year beyond unsuccessful back surgery, in pain, & on drugs because of it.  These workouts enabled me to get so far beyond back problems that it doesn't seem possible that I was ever so impeded.    Yoga's potential to help people with back problems is amazing, & Ravi & Ana's DVDs are a great place to start.  Even if a movement is not specifically targeted to the back, yoga is so holistic that it works on many parts of the body at once, including the back. 
 Nothing in Bear's previous works prepared me for the nature of this book. In marked contrast to the majority of Bear's novels, Queen of Angels does not deal with speculative evolutionary biology or quantum physics. Yes, it pays to be up to date on the latest articles on nanotechnology and Jungian archetypes, but perhaps more than any other book of Bear's, Queen of Angels is a work that could pass as highly-respected contemporary literature.         The back cover of the edition I own quotes a Washington Post Book World critic saying that Queen of Angels may be the most ambitious book the critic has ever read. I can't say I disagree.        On a surface level the book is a whodunnit, except for the fact that we know who the killer is. Emanuel Goldsmith, a notorious poet, suffers an apparent mental breakdown and slaughters a group of his acolyte friends in cold blood.        Structurally the book contains four threads following the exploits of an equal number of protagonists involved in the murder case. The individual storylines are linked thematically, with only tenuous physical connections established between the main characters; in a move that may alienate some of his regular readers, Bear forces the reader to put the big pieces in place and find the elusive meaning behind it all. It is almost as if Bear is throwing down the figurative gauntlet to see who among his large fan base can handle the one aberration in his oeuvre.       The author deals with his cast without any remorse, reveling in the intimate, embarrassing details of their mundane existence in a style reminescent of James Joyce's 'Dubliners'. Mary Choy, a 'transform' cop formerly white now the blackest black; Martin Burke, a cutting-edge psychotherapist fallen from grace; Richard Fettle, an aspiring if mentally brittle poet; Jill, an Artificial Intelligence without self-awareness: all the main characters try to build a new, sustainable 'self' while carrying some deep psychological fracture within themselves. The eye of a needle awaits every one. Each storyline ultimately ends in partial redemption, but it is only the reader, enjoying a god-like perspective, who can reconstruct the trail of events behind the bloodbath.        Bear's thesis:        Some people may walk through their lives exhibiting all the traits of an intelligent person while still missing true self-awareness, the essential 'I'. Without contact to other intelligences, self-modeling (read: self-awareness) in evolutionary terms can be demoted to excess-baggage status, a quirk of nature. And without full self-awareness, there can be no social responsibility for one's actions regardless of how criminal they may be.        These theories are further explored in Slant, an inferior and loosely-connected sequel to Queen of Angels.         After finishing the book, I spent a full hour contemplating what I had just read while the implications of Bear's theories started to sink in. Trying to pin down my 'thoughts behind the thoughts', analyzing my internal monologue. Searching for clues in a desperate attempt to convince myself that I was truly self-aware and not just some collection of maintenance routines. Queen of Angels had hit me like no other book since.         'I think, therefore I am' - is that admissible evidence in court 
 I bought this book for a gift, but have looked at it myself, of course.  It looks really interesting and  very helpful.  Most books from Cook's Illustrated seem to be that way 
 A valuable working tool on self-improvement and achievement. This book is beautifully written with authority, compassion and 'knowingness' of the human state of 'being'.    The reader is presented with a sense of self and their own unique possibilites, both physically and spiritually.    Drawing on their long experience of spirituality, the authors write with humour and yet draw forth a profound concept inspired by a collective spiritual conscience called Abraham.  It is an inspirational journey and one that the reader will long remember and keep on returning to.    
 This is a tour-de-force for Jacques Barzun as he recounts and knits together the past 500 years of western culture. While it is dense and compact, it is also amazingly witty and readable. He illuminates certain main arteries that flow across the centures, such as primitivism, emancipation or revolution, proving once again that history repeats itself. Along the way, Barzun opens so many other veins for further investigation that the reader will be obliged to keep it as a dog eared quick reference.   Barzun sketches the well known and the lesser known as he weaves in and out of the primary events, movements and inventions that have shaped the world in which we now live. Barzun is a scholar and historian of the first rank and he has infused this work with perhaps the culmination of his reflection and study. He illuminates, restores color and lucidity, and doesn't flinch at arguing with the past. He isn't just reporting. He is challenging you. Sometimes challenging you to think, sometimes to reject or disbelieve. To extract the juice from this fruit, Barzun will make you wrestle like Jacob with the angel. So, if you don't have a working knowledge of Western civilization don't pick up this book. It isn't light reading and you'll be overwhelmed. If you thought you knew Western civilization, you must read this book. In Barzun's hands you'll soon discover the difference between a master and novice. More than that, you will be more educated and informed. Therein lies Barzun's primary motive. He is a student and teacher of history. He wants you to slough off that dim witted approach characterized my memorizing dates and places and discover your history, our history.  There is a hefty dose of caution within the pages, beginning with the title. Make some of these mistakes again and we may not survive next time. Maybe we've passed our epoch and are in decline? Has everything already been described, probed and discovered? Is there anything new or left to unveil? There is an equal dose of optimism that permeates throughout. The balance in every age that seems to occur despite our neanderthal lurching and as a direct result of our human intellect and supremacy.  With this sweeping panorama Barzun has undoubtedly enshrined himself for succeeding generations of students, teachers, historians and scholars. He will be a mandatory reference 
 Rawlings explores the lives and interations of the odd assortment of people living in Cross Creek, Florida in the early 1900s. It is often assigned reading for teens, but I doubt that most of them can appreciate it. Her accounts of neighbors feuding and subsistance living gives us many lessons in human behavior.  The lyrical descriptions of wildlife and the orange groves and wild landscape are very appealing. Your mouth waters as you read her essays on downhome foods like hush puppies. She turned those into a cookbook which I'll have to try out.  Modern readers squirm uncomfortably at her use of the N----- word and her characterization of blacks as irresponsible, drunken, immoral, etc. It is probably a faithful representation of common thinking at the time it was written, so recognize it as a snapshot of the times. Then move past that to luxuriate in the beautiful passages in the book. (I deducted 1 star for this)  The reader becomes absorbed in Rawlings' love of the land and the creation of a home. It gives much the same feelings as A Year in Provence or Under a Tuscan Sun

 `The Encyclopedia of Food and Wine in America' is a great 1500 page compilation of excellently written articles on virtually every aspect of the history, education, manufacture, marketing, personalities, and writing about food in America. Practically the only thing it does not include is recipes or cooking. Even sidebars whose label suggests a proper place for a recipe such as the sidebar on shoofly pie gives not one hint about how to make this delicious dessert. Given the size of the subject, it is not at all surprising that the editors have left these out, as both recipes and kitchen science can both be considered without nationality, plus the fact that there are thousands of good cookbooks and a score of books on food science available today, so why not focus on things which are not commonly covered in these books. This means that this volume can sit beside the `Larousse Gastronomique' with only a very small amount of overlap in material. These two giant books have two entirely different objectives. While both works will have articles on potatoes, Larousse will tell you how to cook them, but Oxford will tell us were they are grown, their commercial importance, nutritional importance, and their appearance in cartoons.  So, unlike Larousse, you are much more inclined to simply read the articles in these volumes for your own entertainment as much as for your need to know something. The articles are filled to the brim with interesting trivia about American food. One favorite item in the article about Spam is the fact that the word `Spam' became associated with junk e-mail on the strength of a Monty Python skit which did the same kind of number on Spam as the movie `Blazing Saddles' did on western films. Another discovery was the renaming of sauerkraut to `Liberty Cabbage' after World War I. In this way, the book follows the style of the Encyclopedia Britannica that leans heavily toward long, detailed articles rather than shorter articles with a greater chance of redundancy, especially with a hundred or more independent contributors.  It would probably take the average foodie about five minutes of searching through these volumes to find something they miss. My first sense of something being missing was when there were articles about Charlie Trotter, Alice Waters, and Rick Bayless, but no articles on Thomas Keller, Jeremiah Tower, or Richard Olney. I would not feel the absence so acutely if the editors had given us biographies on Julia Child, James Beard, Craig Claiborne, and M.F.K. Fisher and stopped there, as all four of these figures are so obviously at the very top of the heap in their influence on American eating and food writing. On the other hand, Tower and Olney between them are probably as much an influence on culinary professionals in the United States as Alice Waters. While Olney spent much of his life living in France, he was born in Iowa and all of his most influential works, most notably his editorship of the Time-Life culinary series of books in the 1960s was aimed at American audiences. This series is mentioned twice in the long article on cookbooks with no mention of Olney as the editor, a position recommended to the publishers by James Beard. Regarding Keller and Trotter, for example, both have received the James Beard best chef in the country award and of the books attributed to these two chefs, I much prefer the two from Keller than the three from Trotter which I have reviewed. I suspect the difference in the eyes of the editors is Trotter's earlier ascendancy, his substantial charitable activities, and his better than average culinary instruction TV shows.  These quibbles aside, I am genuinely impressed by the overall quality of the writing in the thousands of articles in this work. The biographical articles all begin with a crisp statement of the importance of the subject to American culinary history. In spite of the very large number of writers, all articles seem to share this same matter of factness, with virtually no sentimentality or sensationalism. One joggling act that must have challanged the editors is how to limit the book to `American' subjects. And, they seem to have accomplished this with great good judgment. In place of any mention of French or Italian or Japanese or Korean or East Indian or Chinese subjects, the editors have given us articles on `Italian-American' food and `German-American' food. I know the German-American culinary world better than any other and I give the author of this article high marks for capturing the big picture and not limiting himself to the very easy subject of the `Pennsylvania Dutch' cuisine. Although the Amish and Mennonite communities of Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, and the Carolinas are at the heart of the German / American food tradition, the greater German influence is much broader, overlapping, for example, the Jewish-American culinary world and even the influences from France and Italy.  By far the best use for this work is as a starting point for serious culinary research or simply noodling around the literature of cookery for fun. In addition to the articles with their excellent bibliographies, there are appendices on general food bibliography, general wine bibliography, list of food periodicals and web sites, major food subject reference libraries, major food museums, food organizations, and food festivals.  Be warned that in spite of the title, wine gets much less than half the volume of ink spilled in these volumes. I also detected a few minor editing mistakes and omissions. The web site for the cable `Food Network' is listed as www.foodtv.com, but this was changed close to two years ago to www.foodnetwork.com. This little mistake is less easy to understand since the article on Julia Child notes her death which occurred about 6 months ago. Still, this book is a great source of entertainment and information for foodies and foodie scholars.  Expensive, but of high quality as a reference and entertainment. 
 I got pulled-in early on, the characters are compelling and the topic seemed deep yet well explained.  A lot like Michael Criton, the author is thorough.  And as the suspense grows, I often thought I knew what would happen next, only to be suprised and deeper in the grips of the book.  This one was difficult to put down 
 If you're considering doing ANYTHING with a horse in it, get this book. It's by far the most complete book on basic horse health, stabling, activities, breeds, etc. (And I do mean "basic".) Would have been five-stars for a glossary 
 I think the audio CD may be the way to go on this book as opposed to the printed form. I noticed other reviewers didn't like the printed book for various comic strip graphics; this was obviously non existant and thus not disappointing in the audio CD (the way I chose from the library)   The narrator of the story is Carol Monda, and her voice is adequate, not melodramatic or tiresome. She does all the voices of characters in this story, and it works. But let's get to the story:  Although some reviews have suggested that Picoult tried to include too many themes in this story, I don't agree. The crafting of it and the detail worked for me. Fascinating portrayal of marriage, parenthood,adolescenct angst, and rape told by the main characters in the story (a family). Trixie, a 14 year old girl raised by a father (Daniel Stone) who is an artist and her mother  who is a classics professor at a university.  So from the beginning, it's refreshing because it's told from the perspective of a "stay at home Dad" and the relationship he has with his daughter, and his wife. Gradually, the reader/listener learns about Daniel Stone's past and childhood, about the kind of father and husband he is.   Early into the book, it also becomes suspenseful due to the crime factor of alleged rape. Point of view occasionally shifts to the police detective on the case, although I found this character somewhat flat. Note: there is explicit description of various sexual acts and the collection of evidence after a rape. This was completely in line with the story, current in today's society, and not tawdry or excessive, in my opinion.   I found the pace quick, and expect it would be a page turner. It took about 13.5 hours of listening time on CDs.   The author heavily uses metaphor and simile, sometimes to the point of distraction, although it is all effectively written. I especially enjoyed the allusions between the story line and the classics lectures on Dante's Inferno, woven into the book through Laura Stone's profession. Even if you have never read Dante, Picoult makes it accessible and relevant. You might even find yourself wanting to read Dante's Inferno after you finish the book.  I wouldn't say the outcome was obvious, although I did correctly predict the ending of the story about halfway through. It would have been better if it had not turned out the way I expected; still, it was intense at times, moving and painful.  Characterizations are rich and detailed.  A portion of the story is told in the setting of Alaska,with native language and it adds to the texture and tone of the story. Several native words are used, pronounced and defined in a clear way, to enrich the narrative and tie in symbolically and literally one part of the tale to another. As the cover photograph suggests, the setting is cold, the language is evocative of just such a bitter winter.   Recommede 
 I am a historical mystery fan, and I look for several things when choosing what to read:  a) Likable characters and protoganist that you care about and are interested in b) Lack of deep dark pyschological pretensions and no bad guys winning in the end c) good writing d) Engaging plots e) masterful evocation of a different place and time  Carola Dunn does all the above with Daisy Dalrymple, and did it very well in the latest installment of Daisy's adventures.  Here, the person murdered is satisfyingly worth having removed from the earth (whoever did it) and the twists and turns in the plot to get to that point of discovery are diverting.  This time period in England (between the 1st and 2nd World War) is particularly interesting, as you watch the twilight of the aristocracy and see how larger events on the world stage contributed to that (details that Dunn gently weaves into her story without one really noticing.)And Daisy is a wonderful character, I would pick up the next book just to see what happens next in her life. 
 All are to be found in "Epicoene," an extremely funny if slightly dark Ben Jonson play. I don't want to give much of a summary because I don't want to reveal any plot twists, but it begins with the common Renaissance theme of men looking for wives . . . and chaos ensues. I am very fond of the New Mermaids edition because it includes very interesting and relevant information about original staging and such. This play is a good starting place for non-Jonson fans; this edition is a good one for Jonson scholars. Reccomended 
 Come Spring by Ben Ames Williams is one of the best books I have ever read and I've been reading for over 70 years.  A period piece, non-stop reading on a par with Cold Mountain, GWTW or John Grisham's Pelican Brief 
 If you are a Hackett-Teagarden fan or for that matter a Jazz fan pick-up this milestone CD. Save up the funds if you don't have any at the moment and buy this CD. There is no more important Jazz recording in your collection  
 Fromm is one of the classics - along with Freud, Jung, Adler. He studied psychology, philosophy and sociology, received his PhD at the age of 22, became interested in Zen Buddhism at the age of 26. One of the true geniuses. This book was written in 1956. Here Fromm discusses love from philosophical, psychological and sociological point of view. What love is and isn't? In what ways do we misconceive love? Is love indeed an art? Why do we need it? What is the difference between love of a mother and a father (as archetypes)? He discusses different kinds of love: brotherly love (love to any other human being - just because he is a human being), erotic love, self-love, love to God. The last half of the book is dedicated to how love disintegrates in modern western society and how we can practice love. 
 Why aren't there more books on breastfeeding?  Spilled Milk fills a baffling literary gap.  Steiner writes beautifully and inclusively about a complicated, highly personal subject.  Mothering (parenting) infants and small children can be isolating and anxiety provoking and this book reduces those problems.  I have given it as a gift to 2 new moms 
 On one level, Fussell writes about World War I, and his unsparing depiction of the industrialized killing in this first "modern" war will acquaint readers with a war that now seems very distant. On the second level, he shows how British World War I soldiers viewed their experience through the literary and popular culture they brought to the trenches--through ideas of the pastoral, of epic sacrifice, of manly strength and beauty. Fussell brilliantly links "The Oxford Book of English Verse" and the battlefields of France. His discussion of how the poppy came to be a symbol of this war is alone worth the price of the book. Finally, and most interestingly, there is Fussell's idea that this particular past is not distant at all. He not only points out how accounts of the second World War were influenced by accounts of the first, but suggests how some of the ways we currently think about war are shaped by the Great War. One wonders, in the midst of it, what myths of our own we bring to our conceptions of the War On Terror 
 Still amazed by J.K.Rowlings writing and still in love with the book it's well worth the read. Too bad the movie kind of ruined it for me after.  Thsi is one of the more scary Harry Potter even though i find it more suspensful and eventful. Read it . You'll like it. 
 As an author and a publisher, I find this book an essential reference. I keep it next to my dictionary, within easy reach. (The earlier editions) have been my constant companion for over 20 years. Jan Venolia makes the rules for punctuation, grammar and style easy to find and easy to understand. Her examples in the form of historical quotations make the rules comprehensible.  This fascinating book will be a constant reference for every author, publisher, and bibliophile. And you can't beat the price. DanPoynter@ParaPublishing.co 
 The product came well-packaged and unopened. I really needed instructions on how to open the packaging. But once I got it opened and installed, the product works as well as promised. The set-up and ribbon menu is a lot more user-friendly than 2003. I downloaded the trial version that Microsoft had offered, and I must say that this is the best Office product offered by Microsoft to date 
 Larry Diamond's Squandered Victory is interesting but also somewhat disappointing.  Diamond was among those Americans who went to Iraq after the invasion to try to support democratization.  One of the sadder aspects of this book is the author's confidence that his forays into the Iraqi community to lead discussions on democracy had any chance of success.  As one reads the volume, the optimism seems to have been misplaced (especially given our knowledge of what has happened over time) that it leads me to think of the author as somewhat naive (believing that meetings with small groups of Iraqis could make much of a difference, based on the larger context in Iraq; and I am familiar with and respect his other work on democracy).  Nonetheless, there are useful insights in this volume.  On a number of occasions, he notes the likelihood that the key figures in the Administration's Iraqi policy group were caught up in "groupthink," where they lost their ability to be self-critical.    On page 205, he observes that "But by now I had become accustomed to this kind of internal spin and groupthink."  A similar reflection occurs on page 291.  Poignant was Condoleezza Rice's alleged nonresponse to his feedback to her on his assignment.  This was his attempt to pass on to her the lessons that he saw as a result of his experiences in Iraq.  All in all, another volume on Iraq that helps to provide context; it adds a useful component to the full set of books on Iraq 
 The only thing predictable about this series is that they are great.  What's not to like... witches, were-wolves, vampires, were-panthers and a telepath.  In this installment in the Southern Vampire Series witches have put a curse on Eric, the vampire Sheriff of Area Five.  Eric has forgotten that his is the all-powerful being.  He clings to Sookie for comfort and that is not all he will find 
 I really enjoyed this book from the first page. Nora Roberts just makes you feel as though you know the characters so well. It is a wonderful 3 part story of 3 sisters of the heart. It takes you through each of their lives and their evolution into the women they are today. This first book is focused on Margo, a maid's daughter. She has huge dreams and sets out to find them and make them come true. Read this book to see her set out, find and lose her self and then come full circle back to the place she started out 
 I had this album when it first came out, was a big hip hop fan and this was one of my fave album at the time, along with Ice Cubes Predator. Unfortunatly I lost my copy in around 1996 and shortly after moved on to other music genres (thanks to the Wu Tang crappers), however recently I have been getting back into it, mostly the old stuff I used to listen to and listening to this album again gave me serious goosebumps. It's a great mix hip hop, rock and roll, jazz and soul (what kind of power you got?). 
 I read the true story of the My Lia Massacre when it first came out, and then knew why when we came back we were called baby killers. Now that I have read this book on My Lia I wonder how they let something like that happen and what makes me mad is that nothing more has been done about the people that done it all. I personelly think that all the people that took part should be put in jail and left there, but other then that it was an excellent book to read 
 This book is really good. Some of the words are a little hard for young kids, but if your parents can help you it's enjoyable. Kingsley's style and allegorical references make this a delight to the senses, not only as a story, but as an example of a writer who truly enjoys his craft 
 I've had wonderful success by just eating or avoiding the foods Drs. Brasco and Rubin recommend.   I take only one supplement now (after learning about it in this book), and it's not a brand they listed.  They offer alternatives for people who have difficulty finding things and for the "Budgetarily Challenged".  Their suggestions helped me tailor a plan that works for me.      Their explanations of diseases, and conventional and alternative treatments enabled me to make better choices, ask my doctors for the right tests, and be an active partner in my treatment.  I had followed the advice of some other authors-and I got worse.  In this book Dr. Rubin shares how he triumphed over his own digestive disease, and Dr. Brasco shares his clinical successes with his patients.  They know what they're talking about.         There's a wealth of valuable information in the resources and books they recommend.   This book is helping me regain my health and I feel very fortunate to have found it. 
 This was an excellent movie.  I seen this movie years ago then I learned about the series written by Jean Aurl if you enjoy this movie as I did, the following four stories on audio tape are a must have and the story does have a happy ending for the main character 
 This is an excellent beginning book on breathing for anyone who is interested in yoga.  It covers the importance of breathing, basic respiratory physiology and the relationship between science and yoga.  The authors of this book are credible and have excellent professional credentials and established practices.  They are associated with the Himalayan Institute in Honesdale, PA that has a long standing commitment to getting science, modern psychology and yoga together.  Many of their publications are excellent and certainly this one is as well.  I think any yoga practioner at any level will benefit from this book and even very experienced people will learn a lot.  As the title suggests, this book focuses on the practical aspects of breathing and provides a good foundation or launching point for moving on to pranayama practice.  However, the value add is the tie in to modern science.  As part of my living, I do workshops on such topics as meditation, pranayama and biofeedback, loving-kindness practices and other topics that integrate East and West.  Before becoming involved in psychology and spirituality, I was both a research scientist and Teaching Fellow in Physiology.  While I am not an expert at respiratory physiology or a top pranayama practioner, I have an established yoga practice and enough expertise to judge the merit of this book.  If you are serious about the breath and especially about pranayama, I would pick up "Light on Pranayama" by B.K.S. Iyengar.  This book is very comprehensive and covers the physiology of the various breathing practices in great depth.  If you are looking at breating for relaxation, you may also want to consider some of the meditation resources listed on my listmania lists.  I also have a yoga resource list that might be helpful for those interested in pranayama.  Another book in the pranayama vein that is quite popular is "The Yoga of Breath" by Richard Rosen.  In summary, this is a good book on the basics of breathing as a foundation for a yoga practice.  It provides the basic concepts required to move on to more advanced breathing techniques such as pranayama 
 Professor Fitzpatrick has chosen to write a History of Stalin's Soviet Union during the 1930s (that is, at the height of the Great Purges) by focusing on doings at the private life sphere of common Soviet citizens of the time. Problem is, after we have read the book, we realize we've been told about the same old issues: de-kulakization, collectivization, shortages, queues, Yezhov, social mobility through the Party apparatus. The problem being, perhaps, that the whole book was based on a flimsy foundation, that of the opposition between the "private" & the "public" sphere, when actually, in the early Soviet Union, there was no "private" sphere at all, private life merged with public life entirely - something Professor Fitzpatrick acknowledge at the conclusions, but fails to draw the conclusion that the opposition between the private and the public is an historical construction, not an ontology. Therefore the book is informed and readable, but offers nothing that is altogether new.  
 Outstanding first CD. Problem is, it is the ONLY CD I can find by them. It rocks and then shifts to ballads, then back to rock. 
 Who knew that disco would ever become respectable enough for a wave of books about it? By the time disco had transitioned from minor club scene to worldwide phenomenon in the late `70s, punk had also arrived, and the two styles were like armed camps, with disco dissed as "gay music" (like that's a bad thing) and punk extolled as raw and real. I guess those sad, grim, grungy straight punks couldn't stand the image of all those queer party boys, mindlessly writhing on the dance floors of every major urban center with their black brothers and sisters, dressed in chiana and sequins and waving fans and feathers while the fog machines cranked and huge speakers thumped out trancelike beats and diva shrieks at earsplitting levels. Punks declared "death to disco" and mounted record-burning campaigns but could do little to stop their least favorite musical form.  Author Peter Shapiro, who appears to be straight, seems to know more than any non-queer should about disco, and says it with panache in what is probably the best of the recent slew of books on the subject. Shapiro expertly ties the emergence of the form to the new gay freedom mixed with an increasingly empowered African-American community - the perfect musical marriage between queers and blacks as both consumers and creators of the joyous soundtrack to liberation. The author has obviously done deep research to uncover the personalities  behind all those obscure sounds. The dates, personnel, even studio locations are all here. This was no small task; no musical genre has ever been as faceless as disco, with many of the "groups" simply studio musicians hired for a session or two by the real creator, the producer. But Shapiro casts his net much wider, weaving such elements as DJ culture and its superstars, disco's influence on hip hop, legendary venues like Studio 54 and the Paradise Garage and even gay bathhouses, and much more into this rich portrait of a music-based culture pulsing with creativity. A detailed discography, an amusing photo section of period disco performers and fashions, a useful song index, and a notes section round out this wonderful read. 
 This checkbook cover is exactly what I was looking for. It is spaceous and is a beautiful color. I am very glad that I bought this item 
 "Bull" is one of the most powerful biography's written. La Motta went step by step relaying his life story, in a transparent way. He not only draws us in round by round to him being on the top of the world, he also clearly gives the reader his blow by blow decent into hell, and even worse for a showman, anonymity. He became a nobody, because of his unhealthy actions. I for one give La Motta a tremendious amount of credit, for coming to terms with his greatest opponent and knocking him on the mat, himself. The movie is equally as engrosing. Great read.  
 This one of the most remarkable books you'll ever read; over and over. It is the book you grab when your house is on fire. People pestered Meher Baba to tell all. He perfered jokes and games. So, the Avatar explains how the whole of humanity is structured. As only he can. There are large fold out illustrations and graphs to augment to His unbelievable words. Mind you, this is not an easy read. I would suggest reading "The Discourses" first. But this is a crowning acheivment amidst a vast array of so called "spiritual" books. I wouldn't live without it 
 Orley is simply timeless. Just as in the Palliser series, the characters are the people all around you, in the office, in the news, and on the tube.  Trollope's ability to understand the subtle differences that shape the mind of men and women is simply uncanny.  If you are a truth seeker, this is a book for you.  Anyone with exposure to a legal system with its basis in the English common law will understand the perceptive analysis it is subjected to in Orley Farm.  The distinction between evil deeds and the often sympathetic humans that are their authors is one that modern American culture often forgets to make.  Orley Farm is here to remind us.  As a trusts and estates lawyer, I can not believe that I practiced for fifteen years before someone told me about this gem 
 can you believe it , dean is the BAD guy in this film and he's good at it. i always liked this film and was happy to find it on dvd and in widescreen.not for the whole family but a good adult western.check it out and you won't be sorry 
 I love mystery books and I love pastries so I didn't need much encouragement to start reading this series. But once I started I was hooked up. I love it! The cases are very interesting and intriguing but what really steals your heart are the characters. You can relate to them (especially to Hannah) and they are so real that you want to know "What happens next" in their lives.   Joanne Fluke's stories are so good that you always want more... books and recipes! 
 This is a hilarious second take on the action in Shakespeare's Hamlet, from the point of view of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, the two unsavory nobles who think they are escorting Hamlet to his death via a distant king.  In this play, the two titular characters are fleshed out to be absurdly, and comically, inept in some ways, and very human and sympathetic in others. They play at deep thought, and this play is meant to lead the audience into musings that aren't necessarily articulated on the stage.   The humor is very off the wall, reminiscent of both Waiting for Godot, to which its often compared, and certain parts of Douglas Adams' "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" trilogy.   The showdown between logic and the absurd is always, thankfully, entertaining, and this is as much fun to read as it is to see on stage. In fact, it might be a better read than it is a play, as the slow, thoughtful pace may give some audiences too much time for checking their watches.  
 Read this book!  It is the best book I've read on development and growth in the LA basin.  It's very well-written and incorporates both political and professional planning vantage points.  Describes very succinctly the interplay between water, developers, and municipal leaders over the past century.  Don't believe the whiner who rated this at two stars: he's a disgruntled slow-growther who has a personal bone to pick.  Fulton captures the essence of Los Angeles without necessarily endorsing or advocating a position 
 Reading this book is uncanny because all the vague, hushed impressions that I have had over the years since I first came to consider myself a reader and thinker, are here laid out pretty articulately and well.  As a  high school student I saw the apathy around me and hated it, it depressed me horribly.  As a college student (now in my third year) I am finally finding that I am not alone in thinking that something is missing both from education and from the whole spiritual (if you will) surround of American life.  Bloom makes excellent points on just about every page.  A review complaining about Bloom's "misreading" of Nietzsche made me snicker.  The philosopher with a hammer is apparently infinitely hijackable.  Okay, so I am no Nietzsche expert, but from what I could tell, Bloom read the man thoughtfully, which is really all that one can do with such a slippery figure.  I have to confess I have not finished the book but at page 100 I am sure it will give me a lot to think about, and not only does it provide good summary of Western social thought but also a way to think about these theories applying to reality, to today--arguing for the continued relevence of these dead thinkers.  I always believed this--I just needed someone to push this home, eloquently argue it.  Read this book!  Even if this review of mine is less than perfect, pick up the real book.  I think it's a great starting point to reading the thinkers themselves 
 I really, really enjoy this CD. I think this has to be their best album since "stereophonic" and is their "sweetest" music yet. I really do like all of their other albums also (with Jackie Cane being my least favorite), but this one really stands out to me as being extremely well crafted. And the fact that it includes an additional disc with remixes of every song really expands the value and the listening experience. 
 The Hunt Ball kept me enthralled in the continuing story of Sister and the central Virginia Jefferson Hunt Club. I love the way the animal characters are full participants in the plot development. (Do I detect the influence of Sneaky Pie Brown?) While each novel works independently, I can hardly wait to see how the next book in the series picks up the continuing plot lines and takes off with them. Tally Ho 
 Le manteau de Pascal is so  great.The guardian angel of the little utopia is so touching and understandable.It's graham at her best!! 
 This is definitly the moovie worth seeing. Made in 1959, this film didn't aged at all, recommended for any age, any nationality, very powerful film , director and leading actor Bondarchuk, creator of masterpiece "War and peace" 
 To hardcore conservatives who believe that the plight of the poor is no one's fault but their own, I say: Read this book. To hardcore liberals who believe the poor are oppressed by society and not responsible for their situation, I say: Read this book. "There are No Children Here" shows that life is more complicated than either extreme. The lives of the people in this book are governed by complex interactions of both personal choices and unavoidable bad luck. The author sympathetically examines the terrible hardships his subjects were born into, but never shies away from showing how their situation is perpetuated by the harmful behavior and relationships they choose to pursue. Whatever your ideology is going in, you will not look at poverty the same way after reading this book 
 More than any other book I know Jed Diamond's The Irritable Male Syndrome provides valuable insights and practical information for men, spouses, and parents of boys. He presents a straightforward look at male depression and its basis in childhood traumas including non-therapeutic circumcision, which harms the boy's penis and his psyche, leading to life-long anxiety and a profound loss of integrity. When society learns what Diamond is teaching, that boys are to be raised as men, not forcibly indoctrinated into manhood, we will all live better lives.

 The best book about Win32 programing, get it and enjoy the wonderful world of Win32 Programing! 
 For a reader that likes Boris's classic early works and who wants to know more about the creative processes that went into these paintings, it's hard to go wrong with _Fantasy Art Techniques_.  _Fantasy Art Techniques_ by Boris Vallejo was published in 1985, and is a guide to how he creates his paintings, the steps he goes through in the process, and some of the areas he pays special attention to.  He specifically discusses the uses of models & photographs, rough sketches, how to do skin tones, and how to approach the painting & underpainting.   I found his discussion on all of these topics to be very fascinating, especially the discussion of skin tones. Boris has a very recognizable style to his art; after reading _Fantasy Art Techniques_, I understand that part of his style is his treatment of skin tones and his extensive use of human models.   In the Introduction, Boris states "I have always had the facility to draw. I can't remember a time my life when I wasn't drawing or painting. In this sense, art has always been a natural part of my existence." Given this statement, it is not surprising that _Fantasy Art Techniques_ is written for the artist who has already mastered basic drawing techniques such as shading, foreshortening, anatomy, color theory, proportion & composition. However, _Fantasy Art Techniques_ does do a good job of showing an accomplished artist the steps & thought processes involved in starting with a concept and creating a finished piece.   _Fantasy Art Techniques_ includes a lot of prints of Boris's works, and is worth purchasing just for that. Many of his most recognizable paintings are included, such as "Siren Song", "Dragon Tattoo", "Counterfeit Lover" , "Lavalite World", "In the Moons of Borea", "Primeval Princess", "Of Men and Monsters", "Iron Warrior", "The Victorious", "Scarecrow Angel", "The Magnificent", "Broken Sword", "The Sorceress", "Red Amazon", and "The Witch and Her Familiar".   There are many more paintings besides those included in the book, and also a number of rough sketches, pencil drawings, modeling photographs, and pen & ink sketches. Truthfully, I found I liked the pen & ink sketches even more than the resulting paintings.  [For anyone reading this review, I would also like to note that I am very biased towards Boris's earlier works. While the details in his more recent works are crisper and things such as proportion, posing & reflections may be more technically correct, I find that much of Boris's later work is . . . well, kind of boring. In his earlier works, including many of the paintings shown in _Fantasy Art Techniques_, it is easy to look at the painting and almost immediately start imagining the back story of the characters and how they wound up in the situation depicted. In his later works, I find myself looking at the painting and thinking that it's great technique, but I don't get a sense of any story at all, just someone who said "wow, painting such-and-such scene would probably be really difficult, so I'll go ahead and do that just to show that I can."  All of which is another reason I give _Fantasy Art Techniques_ five stars: it is a GREAT collection of his works from a stylistic period that I like a lot more than anything he's done since the mid 1990s.]   
 An amazing book detailing the differences between global, international, and multinational companies while providing a new innovative way to approach business, the transnational way. Great for students and professionals alike 
 I've used Verbatum products for a while now and have never had a problem.  These disks are no different.  Solid for storing Data or DVD Playback 
 I enjoyed this book and have bought it as a gift.  It's a fun book and I don't care if the dogs really built the works listed or if someone decided it would be fun to pretend that they did.  As a dog owner, I know that dogs can do some funny little things, like lining up chew toys in a special order and it piqued my imagination that perhaps the little things I've seen mine do mean that dogs are not too far off from creating something bigger that has meaning to them.  Don't let the issue of hoax vs real keep you from enjoying this book 
 This, along with Home of the Brave, is probably my favorite Laurie Anderson cd.  Using state-of-the-art sythesizers and sonic technology she manages to create an amazing collage of images and scenes which treat the mind to its own image scene.  Sharkey's Day, Blue Lagoon, Kokoku and all the songs infact work together to take the listener to a place which is regal in its sight and pungent with its scene 
 Gerald's Game starts out with such dripping, rich detail that it makes the reader understand why Stephen King has millions of fans world wide.  The story grabs your attention and dosn't let go until the very brutal, nasty, ending.  Basically, Gerald's Game is about a man and woman trying different sexual ideas to spice up their sex life.  Gerald hand cuffs his wife to the bed posts and about halfway through the event, she decides that she dosn't want to do it anymore.  Of course Gerald is already caught up in the act and dosn't want to stop.  The story takes a nasty turn of events and a chapter later, Gerald is dead.  His wife, still hand cuffed to the bed.  What makes matter worse is that she is miles away from anybody and it seems like she's stuck in that situation for quite a while.  I won't go into too much more detail considering the story itself is "tied" up in those small details and it makes the read very interesting to the very end.  Fans of Stephen King will find much to enjoy here.  New fans will find their next favorite author after reading this book.  Check it out! 
 I loved the cd, very nice music as background for a dinner or a reunion, relaxing but nice to listen to! 
 I bought this pump about 6 weeks after my son was born and I love it.  He's 5 months old now and I have used it while working since he was 3 months old without any problems.  I have to pump in the ladies room where I work, but this pump is so quiet that no one knows what I'm doing.  I work 10 hour shifts, so I pump quite a bit, but this pump is so easy to use that I don't have the hand/wrist pain that I've had with other manual pumps.   Overall, the bag is stylish and discreet, the bottles are fabulous (no nipple confusion problems) and I have not had any problems with any part of it.  The only thing I would suggest to someone looking to purchase one of these is to acquire additional ice packs if you can't keep your milk in the fridge.  I had to buy two more solid ice packs to keep my milk cold all day.  Otherwise, I have no complaints.  Excellent product and service 
 A disclaimer for this book...to fully enjoy it, you really need to read Term Limits and Transfer of Power first.  There are a LOT of characters here that were in the previous two books.  Trying to digest all of them at the same time might be a little rough.  I'm surprised at the amount of negative reviews this has received.  I actually enjoyed this book more than Transfer of Power or Term Limits.  I had planned on making it through the entire Flynn/Rapp series anyway, so the fact that the ending is incomplete is no biggie for me.  
 As received, the printer would not work because the accompanying software would not install.  Troubleshooting as prescribed in the printer manual did not solve the problem, which caused frustration which caused me to call Canon Tech Support.  Quick, expert diagnosis identified a faulty USB output port on the printer as the cause of the problem.  Canon dispatched a replacement printer to me on the same day as the call, and I received it in two business days.  The replacement installed and worked perfectly. Kudos to Canon for good Tech Support on a good product.   
 These shorts are great for working in a warm climate.  I have several pairs of these I like them.  The cell phone pocket needs a flap because the phone can slip out when you sit down.  The people at "Andrew Christian" who actually provided the shorts were really first class to work with.  Exceptional 
 I'm a student and this book was a required reading.  Easily the best required reading I've ever had to do.  I had never fully understood Vietnam.  Why we were there, what we did while there and why we left.  This book was an excellent asset in understanding Vietnam and I recommend it especially to students since it can be easily read in 2 to 3 days.  :

 A refreshing restoration of faith that you CAN make money without compromising your ethics.  An excellent read that you will refer to again and again 
 Another British film from back in the days of Quatermass with a second string American actor in the lead (Forrest Tucker this time).  A mysterious unseen menace tears off the heads of climbers on a popular European mountain.  A famous scientist, an eminent psychic, a worldly secret agent of some sort, a journalist, and a government geologist are all drawn in to investigate.  The film was far more graphic in its use of violence then the usual fare for the time.  The 'eyes' of the title look good sometimes, look awful at others.  Like all British SF from this period, there is at least one laughably bad effects shot and here it must be the shot of an 'eye' grabbing the journalist and hoisting him to the rooftop.  The effects crews never seemed to be able to do much with fire (watch the end of Village of the Damned) and here, with napalm and Molotov cocktails galore, they are at a loss.  The scenes do not work.  I once read an account by one of the men responsible for effects.  He said that he had been asked to provide a shot of a strange cloud clinging to the side of a mountain.  So he took a photo of the mountain, nailed on a piece of cotton, and filmed that.  He assumed the shot would be used just once and briefly.  When he saw the final film, he was horrified to discover that the shot was used again and again.  Nevertheless, discounting the effects failures and the constraints of a miniscule budget, the film is quite effective, the actors are competent and professional, and the story is very entertaining for those who like angry aliens.  If only the film had been made at a time when the effects were equal to the imagination of the filmmakers.  The DVD presentation is good but not a lot extra on the disc.  But for this price, who cares 
 i will, the song by rebecca has a smooth refreshing sound for evening listerning,or at the beginning of the nite.another good song is icy, an the song by monet,and orange factory.they make this cd good 
 If you've been into Christian studies for very long, then you know Philip Yancey is a name to pay attention to, and this is no exception. Some Christians find themselves engaged in arguments with other believers who think only the New Testament is important. Once they read this book they will be able to win the argument, that the Old Testament is as much Jesus' story as the New, and that the Old Testament is relevant for today's people. Although I was disappointed that Mr Yancy did not discuss the earlier Septuagint translation that Jesus would have read, as opposed to the Massoretic we read, nonetheless, I found it an instructive book. It is well complemented by the accompanying study guide and video set. His lessons are laid out in a logical order that is easy to follow, but it is not dumbed down either 
 The author admits up front that she got fat in her late teens / early 20s after living in the US for a year.  She pointed out the challenges we have in our culture to maintain an appropriate weight.  She then goes on to explain cultural differences and how to enjoy life while eating moderately, exercising during your everyday life (as opposed to joining a spa) and taking a positive outlook into your day 
 This one was book 2 in the Navy SEALS Team 16 series.  And I gotta say, I'm getting really attached to this series. The characters are awesome, as are the storylines and the romances. And I love that even after (or before) characters have their own book, they are big parts of the others. They don't just slink off into the post-book netherworld as happens in some series'.  This one is about SEAL John Nilsson and a woman named Meg Moore. Years before the book occurred, they'd met and become friends. They wanted more, but she was married, but separated. So they never got together and hadn't seen each other in three years. Meg works as a linguist and does translations for a lot of government stuff. A terrorist group kidnaps her daughter and grandmother and forces Meg to take an opposing terrorist hostage, telling her that if she brings the man to them, she'll get her family back. She goes to John for help. The book is then about how they go about getting her daughter and grandmother.  There isn't a lot of direct romance in this one. The actual plot is a main part of the focus, but even so, the characters are clearly connected and you don't really feel left out in the romance front. That kinda is helped by two of the sub-characters, Alyssa and Sam, who have this love-hate thing going - they are actually the main pairing in book 6. So you end up really interested in what's going on with them. And like the other books, this one also has it's bits of historical scenes. As before, for a while I'm like, what do I care? I dont' want to read this, the other stuff is so much more interesting. But then you get drawn into the story of the past that is being told in bits and pieces, and by the end, you want to know the conclusion to that part as well.  All in all, good book. I'm dying to read the next one. So many great, inter-twining storylines that are weaved through all the books.  Rating: 3.5 /  
 MAYA Character Animation by Jae-jin Choi is a book that covers a huge amount of information and advanced techniques.  This book is not a good choice if you're still a beginner but it's not so hard to understand either.  It is exellent if your intermediate.  It does have some good new tricks for advanced users. The book covers polygon, nurb and subD modelling although you should know about modelling a little bit before reading.  It covers facial expressions, skin binding, *good* rigging, texturing, some rendering and of course animation.  It has very valuable information scattered around on topics like fluids, fur, and new things on Maya 4.5 that of course persist on Maya 5.  It even has a tutorial on Deep Paint 3D.  Full color and filled with pictures that aid the text perfectly.  You get to work with different characters and many settings.  The information and data on the CD is a big ++.   Not to go any further I would like to say that everytime I open this book on ANY page I learn something new.  Im a 3D veteran and a Teacher on Character Animation that came into 3D from the world of comic pencilling and inking and this book I can tell you is one of the few books I find useful and believe me... I'm close to compleating all the book list you'll find here at Amazon.com... IF YOUR SERIOUS ABOUT MAYA BUY THIS BOOK!!! (check my list for other great books 
 It's just like the Hit TV Show!  In fact they probably got the idea for the TV show from this movie. Actually I thought it was more of a comedy than anything. I saw it on the "WE" network. It's worth the price if you feel like buying it.  
 I read this book in my early 20's and it served as a catapult to getting my life going.  At 23 I had so much potential and didn't know where to start with it, but reading this book got me going and motivated more than ever.  I became a huge fan of Ms. Sher for helping me put reasonable goals together and follow through on them. 20 years later, I have everything I wanted at 23.  I charted my path clearly and confidently after this book and I recommend it highly for people who need guidance, but who are motivated to acheive 
 I have an enormous cookbook collection, but I still buy more...  The title of this book says it all - Essential Techniques and Recipes from a Lifetime of Cooking.  It's slim but every page has valuable wisdom from Julia Child - you can almost hear her as you read each page.  I have already purchased three additional copies of this cookbook as gifts for my two daughters and my mother.  It is totally appropriate for the beginning cook as well as the most experienced. 
 Anyone who has more than a passing interest in the space program, particularly manned spaceflight, will find this book invaluable.  Here is the story of the people who made Apollo and the technological challenges they faced, both on the ground and in flight.  Many books focus on the astronauts and their accomplishments, but  this book focuses on those who designed the spacecraft, the rockets that propelled them into space, the launch facilities at Cape Canaveral and those who controlled the flight from the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston. For example, their are fascinating stories about the ultimate spacecraft designer Max Faget, who designed every American spacecraft from Mercury to the Space Shuttle; the story of how an obscure engineer named John Houbolt managed to convince NASA to use the Lunar Orbit Rendezvous mode for landing on the moon against formidable opposition from already legendary figures like Faget and Wernher Von Braun; the nightmarish combustion instability problem that plagued the immense F-1 rocket engine (five of which powered the Saturn V moon rocket's first stage); the development of the huge transporter/crawler (and its "golden slippers") that transported the already assembled rocket out to Launch Complex 39 and the building of the gigantic Vehicle Assembly Building where the assembly took place with the use of immense cranes that could set down a multi-ton rocket state onto an egg without breaking it. What is especially noteworthy in this book is the description of how the legendary Christopher Kraft built the flight control system that ultimately became Mission Control at the Manned Spacecraft Center.  The authors explain what the job of each of the controllers was, how they communicated between themselves and the Flight Director and what personal characteristics were needed for the people who manned these jobs.  The book also says how the different Flight Directors like Gene Kranz, Glynn Lunney and Gerry Griffin, among others did their job and the crushing responsibility that was on their shoulders.  Frankly, the autobiographies of Kraft and Kranz do not describe these fascinating things like this book does.  What is particularly engrossing are the descriptions of the crises that faced the controllers during the "1201 Alarm" episode Steve Bales confronted during the first lunar landing by Apollo 11's Eagle LM, the lightning strike that hit Apollo 12 during its ascent that John Aaron fixed, and, of course, the ultimate crisis of Apollo 13. Reading this book left me in awe of the people that worked on Apollo facing the crushing pressure created by Kennedy's deadline of "by the end of the decade".  It is truly an inspiring story, and unlike a similar crash technological program called "The Manhattan Project", this one was made "in peace for all mankind".  I would also recommend for the reader who finds this book interesting, the book by Mike Gray called "Angle of Attack" which also deals with North American Aviation's role in building Apollo, led by Harrison Storms. There, other interesting examples of technological problem solving are illustrated regarding the building of the Command and Service Module in addition to the harrowing story of building the S-II Saturn V second state 
 What a whacky idea to mix spam and the Japanese Haiku!  If you are looking for a way to wile away the hours writing sometimes profound and sometimes worthless words, use this little book for inspiration.  Then you can go to the spamku's web site and submit some of your best/worst efforts for others to read 
 Truly an elegant, messy piece of work. Tom Phillips' Humument is one of the most affecting marriages of image and text that I have viewed/read.  Visaully, it is stunning, with its layers of subsumed text and inventive imagery.  Moments of profundity bordering on Zen surface intermittently, whilst bawdy puns [...] up beside. If you're looking for sustained, easily interpreted narrative, then this book simply is not for you.  If, on the other hand, you long for a story that is as much in your head/heart, as on the page, I can heartily recommend A Humument 
 This game is really good.Theres a wide varity of lvls to play,and a very good multyplayer system.The game only has a few faults, like a blown up frigate in space sometimes goes through the capital ship.The game also gets a little boring after a while.Besides that,its a great game 
 I had never read a Ludlum novel until this one, although I have seen the "Bourne" movies. The Prometheus Deception is one of the best suspense thrillers I've ever read. It keeps you guessing and it is very fast paced. And it wasn't a simple plot, but a web of intrigue. I enjoyed every page and highly recommend it. I look forward to my next Robert Ludlum. 
 I found the book to be a very good introduction to Spring Forest Qigong as well as a short biography of its founder, Chunyi Lin.  It was interesting and very easy to read.  The book provides a look at a healing process for the whole body, mind and soul which appears to be an effective alternative or addition to western medicine.  The last portion of the book contains numerous endorsements of the effectiveness of Spring Forest Qigong.  I recommend it for anyone interested in alternative healing or meditation 
 I bought this wallet and it's really nice, exactly as it looks on the picture. I totally recommend it 
 This is my second Hard Case Crime novel and I'm hooked.  These short, easy to read novels are full violence, sex and gritty murder mysteries.  This novel is from author Ed McBain, written in the 1950s when $10,000 in life insurance was worth killing over.  Matt Cordell is drinking himself into the grave over the adultery committed by his ex-wife Toni.  A childhood friend asks Matt to lookover some thefts being committed at his Tailor shop.  At the shop, they find the dead body of his partner.  From their, Cordell, an ex PI tries to find the killer while negotiating the underside of NYC and staying one step ahead of the police.  This is a fun novel where the women are hot and sultry and none of the men can be trusted.  I'll definitely check out more HCC books in the future 
 If you already believe in Psi, you will have to wade through much boring material till you get to the interesting parts. If you don't believe already, this may convince you 
 There wasn't much new in this book, but it was a lively tale nonetheless and there were some things. I enjoyed reading about how Nancy Reagan as First Lady tried to (and did) minimize Barbara Bush's role on several occasions. Also, Marton's perspective on the Nixon relationship and the Kennedy's too, ones that I'd never really seen before. Goes fast because you'll want to keep reading 
 From start to finish a gripping film, which could possibly be the way the CIA work. Rourke is as always a cool man and Samuel L Jackson the interesting actor he always is. Very well worth watching and once purchased you wont want to get rid of i 
 I enjoyed the way the author added humor to the book. Overall, great book, but the recipes are not really something that can be prepared "Last Minute". Would have like to have seen more recipes that did not require so much prep. But, great tips on invites and decorations 
 Cover to cover, this book outlines a gospel-centered plan of action  for the local church pastor.  Dever and Alexander pleasingly blend theology and methodoloy in this practical book.  I strongly recommend it for those involved in church leadership - particularly seminary students or young pastors 
 enjoyable though this author's novels are, it is his 1st two collections of writings for the new york press that i absolutely love. this is the 1st one and it made me a devoted fan of the author. i now buy any book with his name on it. these autobiographical pieces are hilarious throughout, and written in a completely unpretentious straight-forward prose that is pure pleasure to read 
 I loved this book and finished it within days ... even though I have a young baby and not much time!  Reading Fame Junkies allows you to be a fly on the wall in all kinds of interesting places, from modeling & talent conventions to the Hollywood apartment complex where hopeful child would-be-stars live with their parents. The book is really a collection of fascinating stories. This is journalism at its best; Halpern gets his subjects to say all kinds of funny and (sometimes unknowingly) insightful things. My favorite: Halpern asks one guy so many questions that he finally snaps, "Where are you from, kid -- Buffalo?" Of course, Halpern *is* from Buffalo.  And the topic could not be more timely: large percentages of young people long for fame, and value being a celebrity over many more worthwhile things like being a leader in their community or being the CEO of a company. After all, we live in a world where kids are constantly told they can "be anything" and are "special." Many of them want to be celebrities, though it's hard to imagine why. So the book is a cautionary tale as well -- we need to think of a way to stop the fame obsession before it gets any worse 
 "Lucky Me" stands out as a unique film for two reasons.  First, it was the first musical to be filmed in CinemaScope.  Second, Doris filmed it while she was on the mend of nervous exhustion.  To see Miss Day's  breezy and carefree performance, one would never guess that she was having  to muster every ounce of available energy just to get through the filming.   She so stated in her autobiography, "Doris Day: Her Own Story."    Doris is a much underestimated performer who made her work seem so  effortless.  In this film, Miss Day demonstrates that against all odds, she  gives a completely charming and gratifing performance.  She is supported by  Bob Cummings, Phil Harris and the hilarious Nacy Walker.  This film  improves with each viewing as you admire Doris Day, a true artist, at work 
 The first time I saw this film was when it came out in 1986, and at the time I was terribly disappointed.  Didn't like the film at all, thought it was amateurish and pretentious.  But then I watched it recently on DVD, and realized that it was a really good film - performances were all really good, I liked seeing the DC scenery, and the directing by Mike Nichols was wonderfully subtle.    Despite the fact that both Nicholson and Streep can sometimes be overpowering, and that Nicholson did get a bit hammy at times in this (I still can't abide the scene where he sings), I found both of their performances to be deep and nuanced.  The co-stars were good too, added a lot, and I especially enjoy Catherine O'Hara's portrayal of a gossip.  Carly Simon's singing really does set the tone well for this movie, which is definitely worth watching.  And if you don't like it the first time, watch it again in a year or two, and I'll bet you'll re-appraise it more positively 
 It's about time someone wrote something truly practical and DO-able for the artist who doesn't know where to begin to get their work recognized.  This book is extremely helpful.  I recommend it whole-heartedly 
 In this discerning and somewhat humorous essay, Virginia Woolf remarks on humanity's experiences with illness, whether mental or physical, and on how it is rarely the subject of literature or art. She notes our contradictory nature toward sympathy and offers an opinion about what illness tells us about the natural world. Hermione Lee's fascinating introduction firmly places this remarkable work in the context of Woolf's life and writing. This Paris Press edition recreates the original artwork and typeset of the 1930 printing of "On Being Ill" 
 Making Sense is an excellent source for those wishing to study world views. It is a clearly written and well-documented book, which demonstrates the validity of the Christian world view as the thinking person's world view. In preparation for world views presentations, I have gone back to this book several times over the last few years. Making Sense is the best all-around book covering the pivotal issues of world views 
 This is a great book.  The personal fears of our crew are manifested in  separate "worlds" partly of their own subconcious making.  It's a  pretty scary thing to be thrust into a world with your deepest darkest  fears made flesh. This book is pure genius.  The characters are perfect in  all their inperfections.  Spencer Gill is really the greatest character and  I wish there was really such a person so I could meet him.  The only reason  I didn't give this five stars is because of the science fiction factor.  I  would like to have seen a bit more supernatural elements, but thats just a  personal preference.  This is great horror right up there with Clive Barker  who is my all time favorite.  I highly recommend this book 
 The title should be "build built-in furniture to get rid of your space problems."  I think the ideas are worth considering: sure, if you have chairs for desks and vanities that slide right in, you can save a lot of space.  Yes, build little drawers out of the stair case, and nifty pull out cabinets everywhere.  Certainly having less furniture and more built -ins is the best way to reduce clutter.  Yes, build underground "closets" in your floorboards and crawl space.  However, for most young people and for renters, the solutions are not practical because of lack of investment capital or long term plan for a space.  Hiring carpenters to construct these designs would be of prohibitive cost for most, except for the wealthy.  I see from this book that Schindler and Neutra and all the modernists got lots of their ideas from the Japanese built-in solution 
 This is the first "Counterpoint" series book that I've read and I love the format.  Instead of reading through a whole series of books and trying to compare and contrast different views of apologetics on your own, this book puts it all together.  The authors, who support the different views, discuss and counter the other authors' views directly.  They don't attack, but have frank discussion about pros and cons.  It makes for great learning!  
 If you only buy one Sara Evans album, this should unquestionably be the one.  This is a truly superb album.  I have found it very, very rare to have the reaction that I had to this fine collection of traditional country songs.  From the very first Patsy Cline-ish introductory notes of "True Lies", I was entranced by the warmth and emotion of the words and music.  Sara's voice is wonderful and many of the songs were penned by her.  This is not Pop/Country crossover along the lines of Faith Hill or Shania Twain;  this is "Old School" country at its very best.  (Unfortunately, Sara diverged in that direction on later albums before returning triumphantly with "Real Fine Place", another wonderful country CD.  If you have a few dollars more, get "Real Fine Place" next. 
 It's hard to believe, but it's true.  The 4th CD in the SYR experimental series (titled Goodbye 20th Century, appropriatly) of Sonic Youth Records, is a fantastic double album soundscape of the finest kind. The CD has reinterpretations of post 50's era classical pieces (by such illustrious names as John Cage, Steve Reich, Christian Wolff), and they sound great for the most part. But Sonic Youth was not alone in recording this double album. They enlisted the help of many people, like Jim O'Rourke, Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon's daughter Coco Hayley Gordon Moore (who screams out Yoko Ono's Voice Piece for Soprano), and...surprisingly...Christian Wolff collaborates on his pieces with the band. There are many other contributors, but I can't recall them at the moment.  Judging from all the other tracks, the one that stands out the most (to me, anyway) is Pauline Oliveros' Six For New Time (composed specifically for this project). Thurston intones lyrics over rising and falling drone guitars. Genius. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of other tracks that are as great, such as Steve Reich's Pendulum Music (swinging microphones over amps, creating a pendulum effect of feedback), and George Maciunas' Piano Piece #13 (hammering down the keys of a piano till they no longer produce sound).  The centerpiece of the album, though, is John Cage's Four6. There are 2 other John Cage songs on the album (Six, performed twice) but this one stands out the most. It may seem like random banging and aimless instrumental wandering, but give it a chance, and it will slowly reveal its beauty.  Overall, this album is a fantastic piece of avant-garde, and will certainly entertain the artier person in you.  If you enjoy this record, why not try other CD's in the SYR series, Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music, or seek out the works of the composers on this album 
 This is a complete , modern QM book ... Authors discuss issues which are usually missed in other QM textbooks . Not for beginner ... This is rather 2nd or 3rd reading ... 
 Absolutely one of the best books I've ever read to my children.  There is nothing "cookie cutter" about Tacky - and his individuality makes him stand out in the most endearing way.  My sons asked for this one over and over again, and it was often the one they'd choose for me to read to their class on our reading day.  I think they related to Tacky!  Every child should hear this one -- they'll just love Tacky, too 
 I recently purchased this book that was recommended to me by my sensei in Uechi/Shohei-ryu and I have to say I thouroughly enjoyed these great essays by Dave Lowry on different aspects of traditional budo.I read the entire book in three days and at the end wanted to read more so I plan to get other books Mr. Lowry has written..I love the respect for the arts shown and talked about in this great book and it's nice to see the traditional martial arts presented in the way they deserve to be and should be presented.In short this is wonderful book full of great and honorable lessons and I would recommend it to anyone who cares about preserving and honoring traditional ways...five stars for sure..

 A very good read , very honest and compelling . I can only recommend the book to all the people who wants to know the whole story . I'm fascinated by the Kennedy family , and I was glad to got the book . However , I have to subtract one star , because the author perpetrated the myth and the fairy tale of the lonegunman .  With all what we know today , this is an offense for the intelligent mind . Otherwise the book is absolutely great . 
 This 2nd book by Patricia Haakonson is a wonderful companion to her 1st successful book "Easy Low Carb Cooking".  It is co-authored by her husband, a retired physician, and together they provide lots of enthusiasm, encouragement and valuable information! They take the mystery out of the "low carbohydrate" trend 
 This was quite the powerful book. I was reminded again that everyone in high school has something to deal with. Some of us have harder things than others. More than a few times during my reading of this book I said a prayer of thanks to whomever was listening that my life was never threatened, that I was never attacked physically, and that I had an understanding Mother who didn't seem to think the problem was with me. Still, I have my scars from childhood and high school; my scars though are emotional rather than physical in nature 
 This book explains a lot about a very difficult subject. I would have liked some info about easements. I would recommend this book to those interested in this fiel 
 I knew from the opening notes of track one that I was going to really enjoy this album, Willie Dixon's "I'm Ready" is one of those toe-tappers that gets everybody onto the dance floor, and when you have sidemen like Eric Clapton and Levon Helm and steady-rollin' Bob Margolin, how can you miss?  Then comes track two, the most riveting Keith Richards performance in recent memory in a dark north-Mississippi-style rendition of Muddy Waters' "Still A Fool."  This one has a broken bourbon bottle in one fist and your throat in the other, Sumlin plays lead, Stones sideman Blondie Chaplin is on bass and George Receli on drums, and Keith Richards' husky, moaning vocals bring this tale of adultery and guilt to life.  Legend has it that Sumlin developed his finger-picking style after Howlin' Wolf complained that Sumlin was playing too loud, wait 'til you hear the positively spooky fingerstyle solo that closes this song.  Paul Oscher's harmonica is on many tracks and it sounds like blues harp is supposed to, like an old Green Bullet mic wired up to a Fender Champ with the volume on eleven.  The whole album has a thick, reverb-laden sound, it was actually recorded on vintage analog equipment.  Clapton does a stinging version of "Long Distance Call," all the pop smaltz over the years can't disguise that the blues is where Clapton feels at home.  It must be something for Sumlin to see some of the giants of rock line up to play songs like "The Same Thing" and "Don't Go No Further" with him.  But then Jimi Hendrix told Sumlin on first meeting, "I've been waiting all my life to play with you, man."    There is just a hint of studio chatter before and after some songs, lots of laughter, these guys were having a good time. "This Is The End, Little Girl," an acoustic number with just Sumlin, Keith Richards and Paul Nowinski on bass leaves Sumlin literally giggling with delight.  This album was delayed for years due to contractural quicksand and even the bankruptcy of a label.  And then came Sumlin's 2002 diagnosis of lung cancer followed by a heart attack and stroke, but he's still with us and shows every sign of not going quietly.  I wonder what happened to the tracks with the other stars who participated, James Cotton, Kim Simmonds, Susan Tedeschi among others, maybe their contributions didn't survive the legal foolishness that kept this release in limbo for so long.  I would love to see Volume II appear someday once the lawyers have finished adding up their billable hours 
 I am a huge fan of Grey's Anatomy, and one of the best parts of the show for me is the music.  So when the soundtrack came out, I was really excited, even though I was really only familiar with about two of the songs they included.  The first time I listened to it, I fell in love with a few of the songs, but a few of the others took awhile for me to get used to.  The songs are all very different, with a wide variety of sounds and voices that you don't hear much on the radio, and it works.  It is now my very favorite cd and I listen to it more than the rest of my cd's combined.  It's that good.  
 This production of Alice in Wonderland is pretty fabulous.  I loved it as a child.  It has a lovely mix of classic stars (Sammy Davis Junior, Imogene Coca) and flavors-of-the-month from the mid-80s (Pat Morita, John Stamos).  It would make a great DVD set 
 My son and I really enjoyed the book.  It has alot of twists in the plot that keep you hanging on every word.  I highly recommend the series to anyone who enjoys a good suspense story with alot of fun attached.    
 I love this album, and you probably will too. Thought I'd post some reviews that are out there that may help you decide if you'd be into it:   "The furious threesome, fronted by angelic bassist Manda, charm us with Blondie/Joan Jett vocals and synthesizers galore. Angels With Dirty Faces has an excellent balance of power pop and punk, especially on cuts like "Ode To Rock" and "Boys Will Be Boys", and flows into more mellow tunes like "Seventeen". This album has a wide range of melodies and is well put together, so much so that anyone can find something to like about it." - Sal Swayzo - Tastes Like Chicken   " it's about dancing, not art. Angels is a fabulous party with big bangs, neon socks and cheap beer. The Marbles do offer the quieter, semi-acoustic "Seventeen", a dramatic and delightful summer-y song dedicated to lost youth and puppy love. But they jump back into the fire before leaving their audience with the fist-pumper "Let Them Talk".For a good time, forget that lame dude's 864-5789 number and dial up Manda & The Marbles. They channel the spirit of bands long gone, but with a boundless energy that saves them from being accused of merely rehashing the past." - Anna Giulani - Girlstown Productions 
 Finally, an encyclopedia that covers the folk and blues artists that I love.  Very informative and well written, Stambler's book is a must for those who want to learn about the many musicians who have helped to shape the unique American genres of music.  For true fans of music history and trivia buffs, I also recommend checking out Stambler's other two music encyclopedias-'Country Music: The Encyclopedia,' and 'The Encyclopedia of Rock, Pop, & Soul. 
 Well written with great character development. Am currently re-reading it in anticipation of starting the next two books in this series. I'm amazed at how well it holds my attention the second time through. The wealth of details which were forgotten by me make it a great read again. One of the top ten authors in my book 
 Ken Jennings isn't just a nerd who answered 74 games' worth of Jeopardy! questions.  He's an erudite, witty, conversational, easy-to-read writer. This is a wonderful book! Ken explores the history of trivia and all its modern-day manifestations. He also takes us to meet people who write trivia books, compete in high-stakes trivia competitions that make Jeopardy! seem simple, and in general, revel in the pursuit of the neat nugget of fact. Interspersed through the book are chapters telling the story of Ken's Jeopardy! journey. Ken also offers a lot of insight into why "trivia" isn't trivial at all.  I don't think this will be Ken's only book because he's such a good writer and has such curiosity about so many things. I'm looking forward to the next one. 
 The original Wolf Man and Frankenstein Meets The Wolf Man were really the only reasons why I purchased this boxed set. The other movies were o.k 
 Hedda Gabler is one of the greatest plays in modern theatre.  The introduction is a bit redundant in places, but it gives an excellent account of Henrik Ibsen's writing process and other literary interpretations of the play.  The translation is never sloppy and it is entirely understandable to a native English-speaker 
 A Great and Terrible Beauty was fantastic -- what book could compare?!  This one. Rebel Angels is a magical, creative, and remarkably interesting sequel to AGATB. It is filled with new adventures and surprises, mystery and fun, and twists and turns, gluing readers' eyes to the pages. Libba Bray is better than ever -- you won't be able to put it down! If you liked A Great and Terrible Beauty, you are in for another great read.  Also, keep an eye out for the third book, entitled the Sweet Far Thing 
 I am not going to summarize the plot of this movie again since it has been nicely done by several other reviewers already, but I would like to stress out that the cast of this movie is excellent. Edie Falco, Martin Donovan, Shawn Ashmore are tremendous. Camilla Belle who plays the young Dot is quite touching and very true. But most of all Elisha Cuthbert (Popular Mechanics for Kids, 24, The Girl Next Door), dazzling as usual, gives here an insight into her great skills as an actress by vividly portraying a teenage daughter who conceals her fragility under an apparent casualness, torn apart between the love she feels for her father and the deep-rooted hate she has for him too.  The subject of this film, quite dark as you probably know by now, benefits from a great visual and musical atmosphere. I would like to take off my hat to the Director of Photography who did an awsome job here.  The only tiny little flaw I see in this movie is the ending. I grant this film only four stars because of that (although I have to say that four and a half stars would have been more fair, but it is not possible!). Indeed even though the outcome is quite unexpected and very well thought, the conclusion of "The quiet" feels a bit rushed (shortage of money? lack of time? poor choice during the movie editing?), as if the Director had to push herself into getting through the end of the film faster than planned. However this is the only minor flaw of a movie you won't soon forget after watching it and moreover, I have to admit it, you will watch (and watch all over again) with renewed interest and pleasure 
 Buy it!  Every song on this cd is so good!  Whether you are a die-hard country fan, or more of a southern rocker, this will instantly be your favorite cd.  (I have xm in my car and 6-cd player, BUT this is the only thing I've listened to since I bought it 2 weeks ago.) Yes, it's THAT good!   
 Great book! Probably the best of the "Rich Dad" series. I've read a few of them and haven't learned too much since my background includes being a CPA and attorney. However, what I liked the most about THIS book was the background information about the authors that is disclosed.  Have you ever wondered what Kiyosaki is REALLY about? After reading this book you will come to realize that he is a seminar presenter who wanted to package his seminars in the form of a board game. He consulted an attorney who was married to a CPA, and the attorney/CPA team helped Kiyosaki with creating the board game and then marketing it through writing a book. Voila, the Rich Dad series of books came into existence.  I highly recommend any consultant/entrepreneur read this book and outline it so he or she can fairly easily write a business plan template for later use when he or she writes his or her own business plan.  You probably should read a number of books on consulting and self-promotion as well as this book. Consultants market themselves by writing articles, books, and doing talks, seminars and workshops. These are the things that the author of this book says he did to promote his board game and series of books - and look where it got him 
 The story of an innocent young woman who falls in love with a mysterious older man with a dark past is tried and true.  In the hands of Ms. Bronte, it acquires a depth of feeling and sincerity of emotion that raise the story type above the maudlin.  There may have been other gothic romances similar to "Jane Eyre" before this was written, and there have certainly been many after it, but none have been quite so wonderful.  Lord Byron may have supposedly invented the Byronic hero when he wrote about "Manfred", Mr. Tortured By A Troubled Past... but Bronte's Mr. Rochester is a perfection of the type.  He's sensitive, yet abrupt.  Demanding, yet tender.  Proud, yet remorseful.  Every time I read this book, I fall in love with him all over again.  Jane Eyre herself is an even more complex character than Mr. Rochester.  She's tough and stern, yet playful.  She has a firm moral center and does not hesitate to do what she believes is right, even when it hurts herself or those around her.  And by being true to herself and what she knows is right, she ultimately triumphs over a variety of people who might do her great injury (intentionally or not).  Again, literature has seen many sturdy, spunky heroines come and go, but Jane Eyre is a perfection of the type 
 Here we have what is probably Sonny Rollins' most popular album, although I do believe he has much better music on other records, such as G-MAN and THE BRIDGE.  However, SAXOPHONE COLOSSUS still measures up to all the hype it receives.  This limited edition remaster sounds great and up-to-date, even though it was recorded in 1956!  The group is a quartet made up of Rollins (tenor sax), Tommy Flanagan (piano), Doug Watkins (bass), and the genius that is Max Roach (drums).  Roach is undoubtedly one of, if not the greatest jazz drummer of all time.  Name a musician, and he's probably played with them at some point in time.  The presence of Roach is a defining element that brings the quality of the performance up a few notches.  'St. Thomas,' named after the island Rollins is from, is probably the most popular track.  It's a simple song that shapes the whole album with the smooth flowing tenor playing of Mr. Rollins and the syncopated, carribean influenced percussion and drums from Max Roach.  I actually listened to this track when I was visiting St. Thomas last summer, and the mood of the song fits with the beauty of the island  My favorite track here is 'Strode Rode,' because I'm a sucker for hard swinging be-bop.  It reminds me of the Rollins tune, 'Airegin,' which can be found on COOKIN' WITH THE MILES DAVIS QUINTET and BAGS GROOVE.  This track includes a masterful solo by Flanagan - his shining moment on the record.  We also have two standards in 'You Don't Know What Love Is' and 'Moritat,' which is the popular 'Mac The Knife' without the words.  I prefer this much better than 'Mac the Knife' because of the outstanding performance by this quartet.    If you are new to the world of jazz, this is a great place to start, and I would recommend it alongside records like KIND OF BLUE and GIANT STEPS.  
 Don't be mislead, this is an ab-so-lu-te-ly great product REGARDLESS if you have big or small hands. And it fits the new Rebel XTi (400D) too!!  My hands are small, but before the BG-E3 grip I had no real use for the fifth and fourth fingers (except tucking them underneath the XT's small body.) With the BG-E3,  the hand grip is firm and the whole hand grabs the camera. This gives you an extra feeling of pleasing assurance, not an unnecessary sensation.  Better still, the front panel of the BG-E3 is rubberized so the bottom half of your hand won't slip away (Canon should have covered the camera's own grip with that material instead of using the average plastic that makes the body mould.)  Having a little extra weight is NOT a problem, rather it always comes handy as a counterbalance for you zoom lenses (say in the 300mm range).  In short, this accessory gives the Rebel camera user a welcome feeling of overall control and the sensation of having a more professional gear in your hand. The extra slot for a second battery, of course is a plus.  I'm selling my XT as soon as the new XTi is available, and it's nice to know the investment I made not long ago with this Grip, will prove to be useful when I switch.  Now, if only the future  40D (who knows) were to have the same compatibility... 
         "The Crying Game" immediately signaled that here was an author with original and imaginative vision, a writer with the power to hold readers transfixed.  "Shade" solidifies that impression.    	A member of Dublin's Abbey Theatre and the National Theatre in London, Terry Donnelly is both beguiling and bewitching as she inhabits the ghostly voice of Nina.  	Nina's death was not pretty.  Her throat was cut with gardening shears by her childhood friend, George.  He was many things, among them thorough as her body was never found.  We learn this as she speaks to us from the afterlife.  	Her narrative recounts a happy Irish childhood spent beside the River Boyne.  Her companions were George and his sister, Janie.  They were not born as fortunately as Nina, so they lived on the other side of  the river.  Nonetheless they were all boon companions;  friendships were formed.  Nina's half-brother, Gregory, completed the once carefree foursome.  	However, time passes and things change, as do people.  War takes its toll and one may never be the same.  In true Jordan style the reason for the brutal killing is not revealed until the story's conclusion.  It's unlikely that listeners will not be moved by this sometimes poetic, always powerful tale.          - Gail Cooke  
 Throughout this book, you'll find practical advise on devising and implementing a effective crisis management plan.  Though not a theoretical approach, the cases presented are very helpfull 
 I gave this to my daughter because she cannot have a regular washer in her apartment.  I didn't think too much of it at first but she wanted it.  All I can say is she loves it!  She even washes jeans in this machine.   
 This was my first W. Dale Cramer book and I loved it. I won't go into plot summary since there are plenty of other reviews to do that for you. Suffice it to say; Mr. Cramer had me from the first page. I'm not sure I had even heard of this writer until I met him in Denver and he autographed a copy of this book for me. But I will not forget him after Levi's Will. Beautiful prose. Something for other writers like myself to aspire to 
 For ballet students, instructors, and performers: Basic Ballet by Joyce Mackie is a must for the studio. The ballet steps are carfully defined and easy to follow through the step by step illistrations. Many of the defined steps are basic, but a good number of them are intermediate to advanced in ballet training. If you're serious about ballet, you want this boo 
 I am an old beginner in Economics. I just wanted to study to prepare my CMA certificate. Schaum's series are very popular in Korea, and  maybe in the United States also for their selected many problems. That's why I chose  this book for my preparation in Economics exam.  Economics is very broad  and practical studies. This book is written in 1995, 5 years ago from now.  Someone feels it is too old to study. But I don't think so, because how  much change in 5 years in Economics. The economy of a society is changing a  lot in 5 years evidently but the Economics cannot be changed a lot in 5  years even in these E-days!  I graduated from school longtime ago, and  sometimes I was stupid in my school days because I just studied the text  only without so many problems. I am now sure that the problem-driven study  is the best way to conquer the complex theory.  Good luck to you, and hope  to find this book to help your understanding the Economics theory and  extend to your real life 
 i checked this book out of my school library read it in 1 an a half days and loved it. but for other sixth graders i do not reccomend this because it will take you forever to finish the first part. unless you skip everything and just read the 1st and last words. i personaly think that the Lady Guinivere is a royal pain 
 I got this mat for my Bengal Cat Tristan who loves to jump on my counters. The mat has three setting, Low, Medium and High. The first time he jumped up and landed on the mat(I used the low  setting)he went up in the air and re-landed on the mat with all four paws. He did not go into the kitchen for a day and we bribbed him with treats at that. He stood and staired at the counter but did not jump back up. The mat has a mild shock on low and we have leaned on it ourselves and gotten shocked but it is enough for him not to jump up again on it. It takes some time to break the habit,and I have other counters still to do. But it works great. The only down side it when leaving on the counters everytime you need to use the counter you have to turn off the mat and move it. I don't have a lot of counter space so this effects me more than some I am sure 
 I ordered this 2 DVD set, including both the original "The Fly" and "Return of the Fly" starring Vincent Price, the "Grand Seigneur" (the Master) of the fantasy and sci-fi genre.  I am glad I did.  I could have ordered the remake and its counterpart "The Fly II", but I preferred to start at the beginning and I was right.  The classics may have less sophisticated SFXs (Special Effects), but the acting is far superior. The ambience of the two, typically Fifties, adds to the charm of the whole.  The music is tense, but not overbearing as in eighties movies and the screaming girl is there, where one wants her, and at the right time too...  Who can forget the finale of the original "The Fly", almost a work of slapstick comedy, but so dramatically funny.  The second and follow-up, "Return of the Fly" is not so brilliant, lacking the glamour of color (although in CinemaScope), and its story comes and goes, but still a valid sequel for those very campy "drive-in" movies.  Whilst in the first, Vincent Price is just the shoulder to Al Hedison, in the second he truly becomes the star of the action.  Everyone who loves that particular feeling of Fifties Widescreen movies, won't be disappointed.  Both are not to be considered as Horror movies, or just Science Fiction ones, although elements of both genres are present, no, more likely, I would call them a twist in the "Film Noir" genre.  In fact, especially in the first one, the entire plot is told while a Police investigation is being conducted, to clarify a vicious murder case.  In the second, we have more of a crime movie, in which a mobster is blackmailing the hero, with obvious tragic consequences.  While watching these two installments, one has to keep in mind that in the Fifties, Science Fiction and Horror movies were considered a minor and secondary genre.  The taste of the time were Western Spectaculars and Crime Movies, such as said, the so-called "Film Noir".  Combining both in a Fantasy/Sci-Fi genre was a truly daring move, as well as a touch of pure genius. Doing so, allowed the producers to take some liberties with its contents, emphasizing some elements and exagerating others, to build the necessary tension in style and reaching a well constructed climax at the end.  Both movies are more than worth the money spent, even for newcomers to the Fifties movies.  While the '80s version has its own appeal, being more modern and adding some truly scary effects to the story, it does not make it more interesting or more appealing to the viewers.  I like Jeff Goldblum as an actor, but I cannot see him stealing the seat of Vincent Price.  Granted, he does not play his role. While in the Fifties you have a happy Canadian family, with at its head, a hard-working scientist, we in the '80s, receive an eccentric scientist who slowly goes mad and moreover is a solitary guy with a lose tie to a female journalist.  This for "The Fly" Part One. For Part Two, we also have differences. As said, "Return of the Fly" (1959) is more a Crime Movie with the legendary rescue of the hero and the its final revenge scene. "The Fly II", in 1988, is a fumbled attempt to create a sequel.  Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis are gone altogether. They don't even get a chance at Cameo roles. We have totally unknown actors in something that is meant to be a new story altogether.  In "Return of the Fly" we have Vincent Price reprising his original role and stealing the show.  Nevertheless, now that both versions are out, when in doubt, buy them both. Also the 1980s "The Fly" series is available in a compact collection and also at an affordable price.  My suggestion to you, the viewers, is to buy them both and then compare them for yourselves.  But be warned. If you have a faint heart, the '80s collection is rather gory and could cause you some visual shocks, while the '50s versions are more stylized and a lot is left to your imaginations to work out.  It is up to you 
 This is the fourth in a series written by a Scottish veterinarian who takes a job in Yorkshire, England, working under Siegfried Farnon. James Herriot, Farnon and his brother Tristan work on all sorts of animals from parakeets to draft horses. 	 James Herriot has a wonderful ability to poke fun at himself, as is illustrated in one of his earliest essays from the first work, All Things Bright and Beautiful, where he clips the beak of a budgie, inadvertently suffocating the poor creature. We then see him struggle to find a replacement for the little bird, its owner's best friend. Later, we watch Herriot's bumbling attempt to court his future wife Helen.  In The Lord God Made Them All, Herriot is returning from World War II where he served as an RAF officer; he's married with two children but he still works for Siegfried Farnon. Siegfried will remind you of a character from Dickens. He's an excellent veterinary but his many quirks and foibles make him a trying boss at times. Then there's his ne'er-do-well brother, Tristan. They're constantly fighting and Herriot usually winds up in the middle. The Yorkshire farmers are also fascinating. Herriot has a wonderful facility with dialect and some of the dialogue is hilarious.  In the first story Herriot sets out to "nip" (castrate) a calf. "There's nobbut one, Mr. Herriot," the farmer says. "An enormous black animal galloped out . . . I stared at the spreading horns, the great hump of muscle on the shoulder and the coldly glittering eyes. It only needed a blast on a trumpet and sand instead of cobbles and I was in the Plaza de Toros in Madrid."  Quite often Herriot serves as a psychologist, to his human clients. In one story, Herriot is awakened at one in the morning to treat Myrtle the beagle, whose drunken owner has a guilt complex about leaving his dog alone to attend the races. There's nothing wrong with the dog, but to assuage the owner's fears, Herriot gives Myrtle a vitamin tablet. This happens again and again, and when Herriot finally confronts the owner about the imaginary illnesses, the dog is really sick.  Yes, the joke is usually on Herriot, but if your animal is sick, you call James Herriot and sometimes you call him just to talk. These are wonderful, nostalgic stories that take the reader back to a simpler time. It's so good you'll find yourself reading it as a pick-me-up when you feel blue. 
 Looks awesome and the fact that its to scale works great for game mechanics.  Wizards of the coast continually gets better at listening to the players for feedback when it comes new product concepts.  Although I would have gone with a "on all fours" pose it still looks great 
 I have to admit, I am relatively new to the Byzantine Empire. This was THE first book on the matter that I read, and I am thankful I did. A book like this is focused on just the cause of, and collapse of Byzantium, so people who are a bit weary of delving into the subject matter need not worry -- this book does NOT require previous knowledge of Byzantine history.  The author, Steven Runciman, takes you step by step from the migration of the muslim Turkish people in what is modern day Turkey to the last fateful days when the walls of Constantinople fall for good. I couldn't have asked for a better book to peak my interest in the world of Byzantium 
 This is a pioneering cultural study of the relations between gender and technology. Why do we think of engineers as stereotypically male and of technology as part of the masculine realm? Ruth Oldenziel has cleverly  utilized many kinds of sources - including an astonishing amount of  information about American women engineers - and has applied insights from  cultural and feminist studies in order to create this fascinating answer to  those two questions 
 After reading all the good things about this showerhead i figured that i would try it.  I had tried the Cascadia Showerhead by waterpik, but the darn thing kept falling.  I am glad I found this one.  The showerhead was easy to install and now i got my bf hooked on it.  If you're looking for a shower head that doesn't spray too hard or too much at one time, then this is your new best friend.  When I eventually get a house, this showerhead will be in every shower.  This is a must have if you enjoy your showers as much as I do. 
 We used to stand in the driveway on Sycamore and watch them play in the garage on our way to and from 7-11 as kids. What a great intro into Rock at a young age...thank 
 This would have been the perfect back-scrubber if the brush-head were replaceable 
 I loved this book. I don't think it is the kids that are impossible though. Their mom is. She is as disorganized as Dawn's mom. But Sharon spends more time with her kids. Anyway, this was a very good book even though it was a little scary when Buddy got kidnapped by his dad. It turned out fine. I will read Babysitter Club books til i die 
 As an art student studying the techniques of the masters, this little book has been invaluable to me. This is for anyone who seriously wants to experience Manet's genius. His little florals leap off the page! The printing is good, too. Faithfully shows detail and tone well. While nothing replaces seeing these works in person, this book is one every artist should have 
 I picked up this book out of the blue and thought it could help me in a new marketing position I was starting.  I was right.  I learned so much while reading this book that I could hardly put it down.  I am now using the principles in this book in my new position with success.  
 This oldie-but-goodie succeeds where so many others have failed miserably.  The careful attention payed to historical fact as well as Charles Laughton's breathtaking performance all compile to form a thouroughly  enjoyable biographical feature.  The manner in which Laughton's performance  matches wit with integrity makes this masterpiece a true prize of the  silver screen 
 The one-star review of this book from "a common reader" warns that this book will "muddle your thoughts." That reviewer's thoughts are certainly muddled, though it probably isn't this book's fault. If you can only read a third of a book, you might not want to review it. Contrary to this review, the authors represented in this collection do not make observations that "any film fan" could intuit, but rather mobilize complex historical, institutional, and theoretical concepts that require long and careful study that go beyond the intuition of a casual film fan. Moreover, this book is of interest to more than "20 people," and was extremely controversial among the large international body of film and media scholars whose discipline this book critiques. Just because the "common reader" might not be interested in advanced theoretical studies of film doesn't mean nobody else could possibly be interested - other people who committ their lives to the study of the moving image found, and continue to find, this a very important and ground-breaking book. Yes, some of the essays are rather weak - like any collection of essays, Post Theory has its ups and downs, but its open challenge to the dotrines of film and media studies as it is practiced by thousands of scholars and hundreds of thousands of students all over the world is a very important gesture for film studies. Bordwell's and Carroll's two introductions are especially good, summarizing the field's theoretical and methological preoccupations very well and asking very disruptive and thought-provoking questions about them.  Yes, if you are a film fan looking for a good introduction to the study of film, this is not the book for you. It does not advertise itself as such a book; it is explicitly aimed at professional film scholars (and there are more than 20 of them). But if you are interested in the current state of speculative writing on film and are already familiar with basic concepts, then this is a very good collection.  Finally, contrary to what the "common reader" review suggests, this book is avowedly ANTI-psychoanalytic. It challenges psychoanalytic film theory and attempts to advance more sensible, and clearer, theoretical models and approaches into the field. To construe this book in any way as psychoanalytic is go misunderstand it completely. 
 Very entertaining movie. This should be a stepping stone for Jennifer Esposito for bigger projects. I would be surprised if she doesn't breakout after this. Outstanding job by directer and cast. Seems like a much higher budget movie than it actually was 
 I don't own this book, but my parents do and I love it. It has been a big help in alot of cases. It has helped me totally take care of some health problems and I will buy it. 
 The book really showed an expansive knowledge of American Brewers since their beginning as Corporate Giants (1800's).  This is not to say beer did not exist prior, but the capacities of different outfits were never too large prior.  I enjoyed the history of Carl Conrad and Adolphus Busch the most.  Like most things, success comes from good business sense and accessible capital, the author makes the very clear. Not too impressed with Maytag however, who for all intensive purposes was from wealth, which I (unfariyl) see as sort of "cheating" when they've acually succeeded.  Three cheers for Grossman!!! 
 Amazing -- a bassist leading a session without a single solo.  A great mix without four contact mics attached to the big fiddle.  This guy gets a major "bravo" just for that. Allison still puts himself out front, but only in the best possible way: with his fabulous compositions!  Made me think of Charles Mingus a couple of times as I listened.  Great stuff, and truly progressive without getting into obnoxious dissonance or "free jazz."  That, friends, takes some talent. Any drawbacks?  Well, the playing time won't blow you away; but personally, I'd rather have quality than quantity. I've withdrawn a full star, however, for the clunking anti-climax to this great recording; it's a real letdown of an attempt (apparently) to find some high artistic merit in "Across the Universe."  Why do even the most ingenious musicians wreck their own work by indulging some Beatles fixation?  I've never understood why so many people cling to this ancient junk. Oh well, If I were putting out the kind of killer music Allison is, I suppose I'd expect an occasional indulgence myself, so big props to the guy and his whole band 
 I was hesitant to purchase this vacuum because of the price, so I borrowed my friend's DC 14 Dyson to test it out.  I have 3000 sq. ft. house, much of it being carpet.  I knew that my old vacuum wasn't doing the job, but I didn't realize how badly.  I had to empty the canister 5 times while cleaning my house . . . ew.  I immediately ordered my DC 14 complete (which was in perfect condition, even though it was refurbished), and I have not been sorry.  I still have to empty the canister about 2 times each time I clean my house -- it is that powerful.  It is even pulling up matted areas of my carpet, and areas that I thought would be grey forever are changing back to the original color.  I hated vacuuming before, but now I love it 
 Great melodic album, played masterfully, full of ideas, does not bore after lots of listening. I recommend this album to any music lover 
 WOW!  That is the only description I had as my first 13 X 19 print rolled off this printer.  I printed on HP soft gloss premium plus paper, and the prints are perfect, better than the ones I have purchased.  And they print quickly.  They are rated for over 100 years without fading, and the ink is water resistant (waterproof on some papers.) I am driving my spouse nuts as I bring print after print to her with the same "WOW!  Look at this one!"    It is a BIG printer.  Heavy and solidly built.  Takes a lot of room, but if you want quality archival prints up to 13 X 19, clearly this is the printer for you.  Set up was easy, unlike several previous HP printers.  The instructions are clear and easy to follow, but they  do have to be followed exactly.  The set up "manual" is 24 pages long (in English, French and Spanish)and is clearly written.  Included in the box is enough quality paper to calibrate the printer (I believe this is either the only one in this price range to do this, or at least one of the few,) a process that takes about a half hour as a number of pages are printed in the process.  And you do have a few sheets of HP Premium Plus paper left over.  But when finished, you are set...you should not have to ever repeat this process...  There are 8 ink cartridges...they seem to have a good capacity, rated for close to 800 4 X 6 prints... and it is a good thing, as the best price I have found is $28.99 EACH from Amazon, including shipping.  The unit comes with a set of fully filled ink cartridges, unlike many printers that include only partially filled cartridges.    The printer can print without much input from you, and it also can be fine tuned to your specific item.  It works with Photoshop plug-ins as well, and the list of print sizes is fantastic...most every size you could want from 2 X 3 to 13 X 19, plus as many custom sizes as you wish, each of which can be saved with specific paper and quality settings for future reference.  There are a lot of printers out there, and most are far less expensive than this one, but if you want to sell your photography, or if you want to print quality presentations or even photos for framing, I believe this is the printer for you 
 Don't give me any nonsense about yet another old fossil. Yes, I've heard it all before, and no, I don't care.   What continues to amaze me is not so much the conviction of the voice, that you coudn't miss at a mile away, but in many ways, the sheer inventiveness and variety of the arrangements. Theoretically, this recording, some forty years old, should have been buried long ago and forgotten. It lived, doubtlessly on countless worn out vinyl LPs and tape recordings made surruptitiously in the 70's or 60's; surely these would now be virtually unplayable. Someone had the sense to keep the master copy.  The medium is esentially chorus and vocalist. Unusual for these days, if ever heard at all. In this case, Ford sings in his unique and distinctive style and the chorus does all manner of things, sometimes vamping along in the background (just a closer walk with me), or taking quite a dominant role ("Peace in the valley" and especially, "Get on board, little children").  There are very special moments when the harmony gets into the bones, such as "Stand by me" and everything drops still and quiet. And when he sings "where you there", I can only think about when I was very small and only beginning to learn about what that particular episode in history was all about 
 I enjoyed watching and liked this video very much and would recommend it to all who are interested in the WTC and all the firefighters and emergency people who worked and died there.  It is a well done video that covers before and after 911 events 
 This isn't anything new but what they with the song felt like you were with them recording the songs.  All very raw and I like it 
 This is a very usefull and interesting book for everybody who wants to know up-to-date information in simple words about the place of nuclear energy in the modern societ 
 I got 2 of these and they are great.   I use them as a night light,  emergency light and a tent light when I'm camping.  It works great keeping critters away from you camp. I put one in the tent as a light and put the other outside aimed at my cooler and food.  If you have ever been raided by a bear/racoon/etc. you can appreciate this.  It would be a great product at twice the price.   Good company. I highly recommend it.   
 This is essential reading for anyone even remotely interested in the stock market. He describes with uncanny insight the psychology of the stock market. A fictional yet utterly authentic biography of a real stock player, Jesse Livermore (1877-1940), whom Lefrvre interviewed at length for his book. He was a speculator, a market timer: "The speculator is not an investor. His object is not to secure a steady return on his money at a good rate of interest, but to profit by either a rise or a fall in the price of whatever he may be speculating in" (122). Livermore couldn't care less about the "fundamentals" of a stock, its inherent worth. He looked at the pattern of its rises and falls, the volume of trading, and the general trend of the market. Thousands if not millions do the same today, with much less success that Livermore. Even for the most die-hard "buy and hold" stock investor, the temptation to try to time the market is almost irresistable. In any case, Livermore made many millions, although he lost several fortunes also.   One point that he makes that is often quoted is that "there is nothing new in Wall street. There can't be because speculation is as old as the hills. Whatever happens in the stock market today has happened before and will happen again." That's true, of course, but I was struck by how much different the stock market was back in the early years of the century, especially how much smaller and simpler it was. Livermore lived in an age when one person selling a large block of stock could put the price down temporarily. Only the very largest mutual funds have that kind of power now. Livermore himself comments on how much bigger and more complicated the stock market became during his lifetime: "Difficult as profitable stock speculation always has been it is becoming more difficult every day. . . . It requires more time and work to keep posted and to that extent stock speculation has become much more difficult for those who operate intelligently." If that was true in 1923, when this book was published, think how much truer it must be today. When Livermore was young, it was possible for him to keep track of all available stocks and virtually every important factor affecting market trends. Now the stock market is so vast and complicated that professionals must specialize in one sector, and even then have very little success predicting future movements.  Lefrevre also does a good job explaining how insiders manipulate the market and profit from ordinary traders without inside info. The laws prohibiting trading on inside info are much more strict now, but there's still a lot of truth to that. 
 A collection of poems from southern India at about 1200 AD from the Siva cult, these poems range from profound intellectual theology to the loveliest of devotionalism.  A find for readers from all traditions 
 You  won't regret reading htis book. It adds to the human experience and you come away from it enriched by both the writing and the content. It explores areas of morality worth thinking about without telling you how to think.  It's hard to read at times because the author so aptly describes the human experience that it can be painful.....but that is life afterall.  I recommend it as a book that promotes growth.  It is strictly a secular book in that God is never invoked, and that is where I would have changed it a bit... I believe that all of life is providentially designed, and an acknowledgement of that would have given some hope beyond human endeavors. But then, I am not the author and do not possess the gift of being a wonderful writer like Jodi does!  From start to finish, it is a wonderful, wonderful book that I highly recommend.  If you ever read these reviews, Jodi, let me thank-you for enriching my life. Sincerely, Arden Detweile 
 I was so happy to find a Dick Francis Book after so many years,and written in his usual format.Sid Halley,in his usual form and thesubject matter was great.I am not a good writer,but,believe me, if you are looking for an enjoyable read,pick up Under Orders and start in 
 Very good reading if you are interested in the diabolical mind of someone without a conscience.  Had to put it down a time or two because of the blatant disregard for the rights of others, but it was enlightening.  
 If you are looking for the 2007 spiral bound calendar, this is it. Good pictures, colorful 
 Wow this book was very gripping!  From the first page you are drawn into the unfortunate story of that fatefull trip to Everest.  Krakauer doen't lay blame or point fingers, he tells the story the way you or I would tell the story; straightforward and right to the point.  You will feel moved by the tragedy and awed by the power of nature and the elements.  Fascinating 
 This is a well made coffee grinder that does as well as the ones at the supermarket that cost much more money.  Yes the beans will stick and not feed evenly from the upper hopper but the one at supermarket does that too!  That is just the nature of coffee beans.  I use a chopstick I keep on hand to break up the beans before I turn on the grinder.  The upper lid doesn't fit tightly but I don't find this a problem as it is making an adequate seal and doesn't rattle during operation.   It is much quieter than my old blade unit and grinds much more evenly.  Disassembly for cleaning is very easy.  The glass hoppers cause minimal static and sticking of beans and grinds.  I think the engineers at Kitchen Aid that designed this coffee grinder made one that seems to me works as well as the big ones at the supermarket.  If they threw in a good motor I would imagine this unit will last many years.  Judging from the sealed roller bearing they used in the grind adjustment assembly instead of a cheap bushing I would guess the motor matches the excellent quality of the rest of the machine.  This unit was a great value for the price 
 This is one of the finest cd's I've ever heard. I have a collection of over 400 cd's (and ever growing) and I would rank this one in the top 5. This cd is to drum 'n bass what "Kind of Blue" is to jazz, the standard by which everything else is measured. Goldie composes these songs with great finesse and tremendous emotional impact, at one moment subtle, the next lush, even trippy. The singing is beautiful and ethereal, the instrumentation well crafted, and effects are used smartly, such as the sounds of ocean surf and seagull cries in "Sea of Tears" that help impart a sense of loss, these effects blend in seemlessly and it's sheer genius. I've listened to this cd for 2 years now and it never gets old. The three part song "Timeless" alone is worth the price of admission with it's slow steady build, frenetic middle piece, and ghostly, delicate ending, just a wonderful musical movement. The flow between songs is superb, the production is excellent, and the song structures are inspired. If I had to sum this cd up in a word it would be "haunting". Hauntingly beautiful 
 The book, Body Language by Julius Fast, is a book I would recommend to anyone over the age of fifteen. To really understand the book and grasp its concepts, you have to have already experienced, or have been in the situations explained in the book. For example, the book talks about relationships and the actions men take toward women and vis versa. To really understand what Fast is trying to say, you have to have experieneced that type of relationship.  The book analyses motions such as a simple smile or the crossing of your arms. It really makes you think about your everday actions and helps you to better read the people around you. 
 Even more than Pepper, I think this was the album that changed pop music forever. I was in the UK and a teen at the time, and I have to admit it took several listenings and a healthy dose of illegal srimulants to figure it out. Today the music is still revolutionary and I no longer need the stimulants (sniff) but it ranks as one of the best 5 albums of all tim 
 I bought this book yesterday 7/1/04 and I bought it much higher at a pet store and it's worth EVERY penny! This book is OUTSTANDING! It's so simple to read and understand. It has gorgeous color pictures of REAL dogs and no cartoon pictures. It's so easy to read and understand. The pages are beautiful the information is fabulous. If you are getting a new puppy please BUY this book you will NOT be dissapointed. It covers everything from Do you really want a puppy? Down to why do puppies do that? It's a must have! I am picking up my puppy today and will have this book in my hand all the way to the checkout counter 
 Did you know that certain companies offer a free single-developer-license, banking on business generated when you succeed ?  Well *I* didn't, so the book has already paid for itself and I'm not done with chapter 2 yet  
 I found the translations included in this book beautiful and clear. A good example that narrative poems can also be translated in verse as contrasted to prose, preserving rhythm and imagery. A brief and precise introduction completes the work by helping the reader into the context of the poems and offering a very short but lucid discussion of Greek meter for those who like me can't read Greek. I just pity so elegant a book being less than 100 pages (but this probably contributes even more to its elegance, I acknowledge) and not having found the translation of Theocritus' Idylls by the same Thelma Sargent 
 Charles Bronson Raymond St Ives bumps into quite a bit of trouble including a pirce on his head. Being Bornson though gets through it doing all his own stunt work. Watch out for a young Robert Englund and Jeff Goldblum 
 It is getting to the point where Hollywood is turning out better cartoon features than good comedies! I have watched all the CGI movies that have come out over the past 10 or so years and I am impressed by the ratio of good to bad there are in these releases. Shrek is at top notch entertaining film! The sequel is very funny too! The DVD transfer looks great 
 the huntingtons are the best band around today... and this is their best release! they bring a certain element of songwriting that no other band can duplicate.. they are funny lyrics but they also mean something unlike many  other bands. The guitars stick in your head all day and it doesnt even  bother you! There should be 20 stars for High School Roc 
 With a cast like this, you can't miss. One of the best 
           I am still reading the how to self publish section.  I am a complete novice writer attempting to write a first non-fiction book.  The book has opened my eyes to the pitfalls and made me aware of many details I would otherwise miss.  Marketing being one of the details I needed to be more aware of.           I recommend the book highly 
 I have read more than a dozen instructive books on chess and find this a nice easy read with games and commentary that provide a well focussed view of the lessons that Mr. Weeramantry is teaching. These include the basics such as strong outposts, weak color squares, etc. Once the student has digested classics such as Chernev's Logical Chess Move by Move, he/she is ready for this book. Has elements of Silman's The Amateur's Mind, but at an easier level. Good for Class C player and below I think 
 Upon completion of this treatise all readers should receive a Master's Degree in Black Studies. Robinson provides a detailed and complex study of Black Radicalism and Marxism's relation to it. This book works on a number of levels; Historical, Sociological and Philosophical. I think one of the book's strong points is that it broadens the reader's mind to other interpretations of Black Radicalism. His analysis of DuBois, and C.L.R. James' transformation is interesting along with his dissection of Marxian / Lenin dogma. Also, the way he traces the origins of racism in European culture to early Ethnic Group stratification in anitquity is insightful. 
 This should be the "second book" you read on OO design, after any of the introductory books.Martin's lucid writing painlessly introduces the reader to "real world" OO analysis and design. The use of iterative design, exploiting the tension between static and dynamic modelling is explained beautifully with detailed examples.Buy,buy,buy!! 
 simply love it!  Read Wife of Moon first and now Dream Stalker...what a teriffic storyteller.  Likeable characters, interesting local color and I learned a bit about Plains indians I did not know.  If you like Hillerman, you will like this series, I think. 
 This first volume of "Pastel" sets up the standard formula for a boy's romance manga.  A high school boy, Mugi, is freshly heartbroken when his girlfriend moves away.  Trying to get his mind off of her, he joins his roguish friend Kazuki working at a restaurant over the summer.  One day, while taking empty bottles out to the back for recycling, he happens across a beautiful girl changing into her bikini.  He is caught peeping.  Hijinks ensue.  Rather than playing it for laughs, "Love Hina" -style, "Pastel" is incredibly sweet and all of the characters are honestly likable.  Mugi is no tongue-tied loser, and the girl, Yu, is no brash-mouthed stereotype.  More in the vein of "Ai yori Aoshi," these are two characters who you really want to see get together, in their own time.  Yu's little sister Tsukasa adds spice to the mix, and looks to be even more fun as the series progresses.    If you like the genre, chances are you are going to like "Pastel."  The character designs are great, especially Yu, and author Toshihiko Kobayashi makes sure you get to see her to full advantage, as Mugi seems to have a habit on walking in on her changing clothes and taking baths.  The background scenery is lovely, and very authentic of a rural Japanese island lifestyle.  There are a few surprises, which I will leave for you to discover.  I know I will be picking up the next volume 
 I bought this book on Amazon thinking it would be a hip birthday gift bound to please a huge Tom Waits fan. I browsed through it before wrapping it and the next day I went to a book store to buy myself a copy. Turns out this book has essays and stories from some of my favorite artists and writers like Frank Black, Jim Jarmusch, Terry Gross (npr!), Charles Bukowski and Elvis Costello. It's been on my nightstand for a few months now. Indeed, this book was a nice surprise. 
 As good as this translation is, it should be used in conjunction with a reading of the original poem in Middle English verse.  And the reader who is too impatient to deal with Chaucer's language should, at the very least, try a modern verse translation before reading this version in prose.  There's something to be said for prose translations of epic verse, since the translator need not make compromises between precise meaning and poetic form.  Homer's "Odyssey," for example, is so much like a novel that  there's little justification for requiring the translator to format the language in metrical hexameters.  But Chaucer's poem is a different matter--a lyrical, romantic drama, or subtle, psychological "melodrama," that almost demands a poetic translation for its genial musical qualities to come through.  For the reader not planning to read the poem in the original language, I'd suggest checking out "Chaucers (sic) Troilus and Cressida," translated by James Donohoe.  It may not be the easiest book to locate, but it's worth the reader's effort to do so 
 I am somewhat of a fan of Alastair Horne's, having come to him via his trilogy of books on Franco-German conflicts, and I went looking in Amazon to see if there was anything new from him. And I came across this book, whose purchase many years ago was prompted by the desire to know more about the world of Freddie Forsyth's outstanding thriller "The day of the Jackal". Seeing it again on the Amazon website reminded me as to how relevant it is to the modern story of the US and Iraq. Of course, there are substantial differences; the US is not Iraq's colonial power and the US most certainly does not regard the place as part of the USA, the way the French did Algeria. And because of the lack of a US equivalent of "pieds noirs" (French settlers in Algeria), no matter how badly George Bush messes up, no US paratroop regiment is going to mutiny, try to assassinate him and bring the US to the brink of civil war.   However, the similarities are scary - the reliance on pure military power to win, the use of tactics (particularly in the battle of Algiers) that alienated the locals and effectively made them into allies of the FLN rebels or at least tolerant of them, and the widespread use of torture (a subject that touches raw nerves in France to this day). As with Iraq, the FLN didn't confront the French military head-on, but relied on ambush and, more particularly, on intimidating and murdering local allies of the French, policemen, local officials and the like. There were also French near-equivalents of "Mission Accomplished", even as the war was being lost where it desperately needed to be won - in the hearts and minds of Algerians themselves.  As I write this, former French soccer captain Zinédine Zidane is in Algeria, being feted as a hero. He is the son of harkis, the Algerians who fought on the French side and who had to leave Algeria or face severely curtailed life expectancies. Time has finally healed the wounds. One hopes it will be so with Iraq. One wishes that the Bush Administration had read this highly perceptive book before launching its ill-considered venture - and that it had had the honesty and wisdom to see the lessons therein. 
 "The stories are all about the power of life-changing books. As a book-lover, I found this a good read and a valuable resource. 
 I have to say when I first heard of this book I thought it was going to be one of those exotic esoteric presentations meant to wow the reader but that was about all. So many books claiming so much until you start using them. I even stopped all my book buying for a couple of years because of this. But for $11 I figured I would give it a shot and I'm happy I did. After using it on a few things, and getting the results I didn't expect but which the book said I would get, I now appreciate the esoteric a bit more. That is when it's used correctly. There is a lot here and it's going to take time to really understand it all but I think it will be worth it judging from the results I got so far. Anyone looking for some true help in dealing with their life should try this technique given here. It really is different and helpful and deserves a real WOW 
 Antonline had not only the best price available at the time but sent the product immediately. Completely sealed I was able to unpackage (although it is difficult to open the hermetically sealed packaging) the microphone arrived intact and ready to be plugged into my computer...and most importantly it was SKYPE ready. Those that I speak to through the microphone have said that the voice is quite clear...and I have not encountered any problems whatsoever...I am quite satisfied with both the quick delivery and the quality of the product...Thank yo 
 I found this book when looking for supplemental materials for elementary school science units.  This book is a good introduction to the concept of atoms.  My sons (7 & 9) enjoyed it immensely; and it provided a good basis for a further discussion of what atoms and elements are 
 With the Shiloh Trilogy, Phillis Reynolds Naylor has crafted a trilogy that is on par with some of the finest trilogies ever put in print or on film and has joined a class with members like George Lucas and Peter Jackson.  Simply put, the Shiloh Trilogy is the most brilliant book trilogy of all time.    Shiloh tells the story of a beagle puppy who was amused by its alcoholic owner so it ran away.  A boy named...well I forget his name, but he found Shiloh and took care of him.  Then the drunk guy wanted Shiloh back and there was this big fight.  At the end Shiloh saves the day by biting the drunk guy's toes on one foot and then playing "this little piggy went to market" with his other foot.    In the second book, Shiloh Season, the boy is worried that the drunk guy will shoot Shiloh, so he writes his congressman a letter to try and prohibit the hunting season.  The congressman says he has to get a petition with 100 signatures, so the boy sends a petition around town and tries to get people to sign it. At the end he gets 99 signatures but can't get the last one.  Shiloh is sad and in the middle of the night dips his paw in ink and puts his pawprint on the last blank and saves the day.  Saving Shiloh is the third and final book.  At the very start Shiloh falls off a very high cliff and the boy who owns Shiloh must run down the trail on the side of the cliff and get to the bottom to catch Shiloh before Shiloh goes splat.  It's a fast-paced adventure that will get your heart racing.  I haven't read the books in a long time so some of that stuff may have been a little off, but the most of it is true.  Definitely pick up this great series 
 A Tramp Abroad, Mark Twain's tongue-in-cheek, semi-fictionalized account of his second European trek, is, despite it's 600+ pages, a lightning quick read.  Twain's singular wit is on full display engaging the reader to such an extent that pages swiftly fly by.  Though not his best piece of travel writing (see Innocents Abroad), I devoured this book in large chunks eager to see where Twain wandered next.  When he arrives in the Alps, A Tramp Abroad vaults from an amusing piece of travel writing to a supremely satisfying form of entertainment.   If there was any disappointment it occured with Twain's unexpected exit from the stage.  A Tramp Abroad covers Twain's travels in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy, but concludes quite suddenly with mere mention that the Netherlands are next on the docket.  Yet, wishing a book to continue confers no blackmark on an author.  It is further confirmation that A Tramp Abroad easily merits 5 stars. 
 With the way things are going nowadays, it seems sometimes that we won't make it throught to tomorrow.  This book really gave me hope in whether or not I'll see tomorrow 
 Ivy's best friend, Thea, has just died.  Before her death, she discovered that tombstones in the Country Peace Cemetary, where her aunt and uncle are buried, have been vandalized.  Ivy and Thea had reported it to the police, but it didn't appear that they were going to do anything about it.  So, now Ivy decides to investigate for herself.    She stakes out the cemetery at night, waiting for the vandals.  She doesn't think about being in danger.  She's just hoping to get a license number to give to the police.  One night she seems something ominous happen, and she finds herself unable to stop investigating.  Then Thea's tenant, Kendra, is found murdered.  She had never given out much information about herself, and when Ivy begins to look into Kendra's past, she finds more questions than answers.  Soon Ivy realizes that she is invisible.  Oh, she can be seen, but most people just look through her as if she isn't there.  She begins to use this to her advantage in her investigations.  The authorities try many times to get her to stop investigating for her own safety, but she doesn't listen.  I really enjoyed Ivy.  She is such a spry senior citizen, and she does things I wouldn't do.  She always makes me laugh!  It's a great Christian mystery and very much a cozy.  I highly recommend it!  I can't wait to read the next one. 
 While this book does not cover every possible situation, it does provide insight into those which are most relevant.  It was well written and proceeds in a logical fashion.  I found chapter 10, covering taxes and fees, particularly helpful.  If you are new to the commercial aspects of the telecom world, this is a good place  to start.  I have read several books on the subject and found this one to be the most complete 
 this is a MOST welcome return of a band that's been MIA for a spell. elements of ELO, guided by voices, and of course the beach boys charm, delight, surprise here to the nth degree...and other cliches... words cannot do justice to the freshness of the melodies here, the loopy loops and odd experiments in sound manipulation--with good old fashioned catchy choruses and ultramemorable melodies.    this is up there with an obscure record of the year (for me), the black watch's "tatterdemalion"--it just makes you feel so good, like there is hope somewhere for music.  the apples are beautiful!  you will not regret this.  i have a lot of their records (i favor the more psychy elements of the band...yet love the pop too) and this is by far the best thing they may ever do!!!  
 The Thief    What does bineginfiutilazation mean? Simply put, being forced to use  a second nature skill for its opposite purpose.  When would you need to use  such a word? Well one instance could be when Magus frees a thief and  makes him steal an elixir of life. To figure out more about Gen and his  adventures with bineginfiutilazation, the only way to find out is in Megan  Turner's fantasy novel, The Thief.    The most skilled thief in the three great nations, Sounis, Attolia and  Eddis has finally been caught. Though only to be freed by the king's chief  advisor Magus, who is sent to retrieve a magical stone that grants it's holder  eternal life. The stone is called Himiathes Gift. Magus wants Gen to steal it  for him. But the two will not go alone. Magus brings his two apprentices,  Ambiades and Sophos. Sophos is a young man who is the son of the duke,  and his partner Ambiades, who is older, taller and better skilled with a  sword and shield. And last, but not least, a soldier who cooks for our heroes and teaches Sophos and Ambiades in the art of swordplay. The leader magus is witty,  tall, skilled with a sword and has a persuasive way of saying everything.  Gen thinks he's a stuck up guy who's never seen a life in the gutter like his.    I recommend this book to fifth through ninth graders who enjoy  mythological and complex tales. Representing a less extreme Lord of the  Rings, it shows similar and different characteristics to the classic novels by  Tolkien. 
  This book is, by far, on of the best clear and consise overviews that works to explain the main doctrines and spirituality of the Islamic faith.  It also did so without bias.  It is a thick book with plenty of explanation.  It gave me an understanding of the belief and practices of Islam that are based on the scriptures of the faith.    After I read this I went to a mosque to pick up a Quran.  Now I know never to judge a religion based on the actions of a few followers.  I reverted after studying the religion.  It is clear that Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance.  Muslims share a brotherhood with Jews and Christians.    I use Islam as a way to make my life better, positive and to affect the world in a positive way.  Clearly, God is speaking, and the message is one of mercy, peace and humility.  I feel like this book will help other people understand what Islam is really about.    Hopefully, we Muslims can really walk the walk and talk the talk of the kindness, charity and respect for others that God commands through Islam.    This book is very straight forward and the interested reader will have no problem with the format.  Muslims should already know the content within this book, but if you are new to Islam and interested in exploring the faith, this book will surely challenge your pre-existing prejudices and lead you to an unbiased view of the scriptures.    Thank God this book exists.  If people will only read this book, I won't have to be afraid of being attacked by Islamophobic elements when walking down the street in my hijab!  Perhaps if the USA leaders would read it then they would stop bombing Muslim civilians and committing genocide in the Middle East.  I really wish people wouldn't draw false conclsuions of Islam because of what they see in the media.  Then couldn't others draw false conclusions about Christianity if they judged it by what our Christian President Bush and the US military are doing?  No one should be so simple minded as to blame a faith for the bad actions of *some* of its followers.  Vision of Islam should be a requirement for every undergrad student in a comparative religions course.  It is truely excellent 
 I especially love the gong at the end of the tape.  Very relaxing 
 This book covers it all for both Mac and PC (I have one at home and the other at work). You learn about audio CD recording - video - data and how to design & print labels and case covers. I still have yet to build my own menu for a CD that I've burned but the author covers that too. A great book that you'll refer to again and again 
 Serge Trifkovic is fast becoming a leading authority on Islamic militancy and how to respond to it. His The Sword of the Prophet (2002) was an important look at militant Islam. In this sequel volume to that incisive work, Trifkovic continues his hard-hitting analysis coupled with a sober realism about the struggle we are in.  This volume is broken into five parts: a brief review of Islam, its founder, its beliefs and practices, with special reference to Jihad; a lengthy examination of the crisis in Europe; an assessment of conditions in America; the global situation; and a series of proposed solutions.  Taken together these five sections offer a comprehensive and informed overview of the nature of Islamic Jihad and the response of the West. The book offers, in short, a workable understanding of, and plan for, an effective response to the war on terrorism.  And the author is quite right to begin by assessing the threat. A good deal of the problem lies in the fact that many Western intellectualoids refuse to even admit that there is a problem, or are much more inclined to blame the West for the current crisis.  For example, the "9-11 Commission", the US Government report on terrorism, does note that Islamist terrorism is the main worry, but then goes on to argue that the reformist wing within Islam needs to be encouraged while the fundamentalist wing needs to be resisted.  But Trifkovic argues that this distinction between a real, peaceful Islam and an a violent Islamic aberration is false. Jihad and terrorism, argues the author, are intrinsically imbedded in the Koran, hadith, and Sharia. The jihadists are fully acting in accord with their faith. Thus the real question is not, Are there moderate Muslims? Yes there are. But the question to really ask is, Is Islam itself moderate and peaceful? Trifkovic thinks not. Thus talk of reforming Islam becomes a questionable, if unobtainable, goal.  It is this understanding of the real nature of Islam that explains so much about the current crisis in Europe and the incredibly weak and short-sighted Western response. Europa is quickly becoming Eurabia because most Westerners do not understand the real nature of Islam. Peace in Islam can ultimately come when all of the Dar-al-Harb (world of unbelievers) is converted - one way or another - into the Dar-al-Islam (the world of Islam). Thus Islam is in a permanent state of war with the Western infidels until it finally reigns throughout the globe.  While the European response has been woefully inadequate, the American response has not been much better. Basically a policy of appeasement at home and saber-rattling abroad is in place. Fear of offending American Muslims has resulted in a superficial response at home. Foolish notions of tolerance, diversity and multiculturalism have failed to deal with the Islamic threat. Moreover, the West fails to understand that Muslims are unable or unwilling to properly assimilate and integrate into the West. Instead, Muslim conclaves are springing up all over the West, with the inevitable tensions which follow.  And US foreign policy has been confusing at best. Washington seeks to placate and cozy up to various Muslim states, often with counterproductive outcomes. Trifkovic doubts that the democratization of the Middle East is possible. Just as it was delusional to believe in dï¿½tente with the former Soviet threat, so the idea of exporting democracy to the Islamic world is fraught with danger.  Like the Marxist world before it, the Islamic world is totalistic and implacably hostile to co-existence with the West. And for democracy to be exportable presupposes a framework of ideas that are amenable to it. Islam is fundamentally anti-democratic. The rule of Sharia law alone is the Islamic ideal - democracy is simply heretical.  Trifkovic offers a number of proposals to at least contain the Islamic threat in the West. He favours racial and ethnic profiling as a sensible and necessary feature of our security. He believes mosques should be monitored, sermons examined, and all preaching be conducted in the host-nation's language.  He believes that Islamic activists should be denied citizenship, or that it be rescinded if already given. He urges Western nations to follow the lead of Switzerland which has one of the toughest naturalization policies in the world. You cannot even apply for citizenship in Switaerland unless you have first lived there for 12 years, paid your taxes, and have no criminal record.  Other get-tough measures are proposed. But the author concludes with a more important requirement. The West needs to know itself. What does it believe? What are its values? What does it stand for? And it needs to realize that the historic, core Western values are ultimately not compatible with the Islamic worldview. Say Trifkovic, "Islamic beliefs, ideas and intentions as such pose a threat to our civilization and our way of life".  Thus the author reminds us that the first step in dealing with the war of terrorism is to recognize the fundamental differences between Western ideals and Islamic ideals. And then we need to ask ourselves, which are worth preserving and defending? Which are worth fighting and resisting? Unless the West can accurately and carefully answer those questions, it will not be well prepared to cope with the terrorist threat - nor with any other major threat for that matter 
 The authors confess early on in this beautifully illustrated book that they are themselves bungalow-owners and -dwellers, which makes them automatically sympathetic to the situation of the novice who finds himself with a fixer-upper or a house that needs a new kitchen, more storage, or just more space.  And they tell, in a very practical way, how to go about creating what you need.  Quite apart from the many beautiful full-color photos, they offer plenty of really vital information.  "With the right architect, a radical overhaul can be sensitively done...[integrating] many of the interior details that people love about their bungalows," they say.  "A potential side benefit of [renovating one's attic] is that [its slanted knee walls] may mean [it] isn't legally a room at all and therefore not taxed as a bedroom.  Check to see if your local ordinance states that if more than a certain percentage of a room's walls are sloping, it is exempt from full taxation."  (This is something that would never have occurred to me!)  "As real estate values escalate, you may find that the lot is more valuable than the house itself.  That, in turn, can make it difficult to get a mortgage on a 900-sq.-ft. house.  But if you apply for a loan with a proposal to add on, you may have a better chance of getting financing...Look at the local ordinances covering setback and height requirements and limits on the percentage of the site that can be built on...You also have a chance to address any shortcomings your lot [yard] may have..."  Team this volume with Treena Crochet's "Bungalow Style" and Diane Maddex's "Bungalow Nation" (see my reviews) and you'll have a core shelf that will help you understand, appreciate, and sensitively update your bungalow 
 Great cookbook with well written instructions.  Practical recipes for the most part. I have found most of Martha Stewart's recipes do work and are delishous. I wish "Collected Recipes for Every Day" had pictures like this one does.  If "jeffsdate" cannot finish these menues in an hour, he must not be used to multi-tasking 
 I love this cookbook!I have never been a very good cook,but with this cookbook I'm getting pretty good I think.I have bought many books on this subject and this is hands down the very best if you are lacking funds and want to feed your family healthy nutitious meals.I have been using it for about a month and have already started saving money(and time).I own the first edition of this book "Not Just Beans"and i'm thinking about getting this one as well because there is new information in it.When I have some exta cash I probably will.Tawra makes the whole process more fun and it becomes a game to see how far you can stretch your dollars.So often with these kind of books it feels like drudgery,not so with this book!"Miserly Moms"is good also, but if you can only buy one,this is better.Thanks Tawra,for helping so many of us with your great advice.Look at Tawras web site "Living on a Dime" and it will give you some idea of whats in her book.She is  someone who wrote a book based on personal experience,and these methods really work 
 I got these for $9 on the Friday Sale.  They are well made and the perfect size.  You absolutely will not find a better pair for the price.  Wait for the Friday Sale if you can 
 I purchased "The Orientalists" for the spectacular pictures and I ended up loving it just as much for Kristian Davies' excellent narrative.  I think he organized his book with great skill and care, choosing appropriate topics, focusing on the best artists and the most interesting explorers/adventurers.  This book is so wonderful, I can't stop picking it up and re-reading it, looking again and again at the pictures, recommending to friends, buying it for gifts.  Davies' artistic sensibility and his very fair view of peoples and places make this book impossible to replicate.  It is one of a kind and the best of its kind.  
 After reading The Perfect Ride, I felt so much respect and admiration for Gary Stevens.  He describes the athletic demands jockeys must meet and the injuries they must endure with grace.  His determination and humanity come through when he writes about his personal life.  I also liked his sensitivity to the horses he rides.  It's a great read for an inner glimpse at jockey life 
 If you're a fan of Seabury Quinn and his master criminologist/occult expert Jules de Grandin, you'll appreciate this collection.  Lin Carter was quite open that this was intended to be an homage to de Grandin (as well as Howard's Steve Harrison and Rohmer's Neyland Smith), but Carter's stories stand alone very well.  The stories by other authors are interesting, but the love for (and knowledge of) this sub-genre shines through in Carter's two offerings.  The reviewer who found no Cthulhu Mythos in these stories was mistaken.  Every single story makes reference to things Lovecraftian 
 I've met Angela Y. Davis since I currently attend UCSC where she is a professor of History of Consciousness. While I do applaud her for being an intelligent, sophisticated, and strong woman I must say this book tends to rub me the wrong way at times. What appears to be my reasoning towards being critical  is how there are moments when it is obvious that Ms. Davis gets prejudicial towards people that "wronged" her. This is not to say that they are entirely innocent but some people who read this autobiography do interpret it as prejudicial towards one race. I am not here to say that all white people are goody two shoes but there are plenty of those from European descent that are nurturing and loving people. Certainly Ms. Davis would not appreciate it if someone called her a racial slur or categorized all African Americans or Marxists as radical and violent. This is why I just cannot rank this book of hers 5 out of 5 stars. She is a wonderful storyteller and very engaging in her speeches but, with all people, she does need to strive for improvement in some areas 
 There's been a voodoo shortage in the Mississippi hills since bluesman Junior Kimbrough died two years ago. But Robert Belfour evokes some of the same dark, roiling spirits with the slithery guitar lines of Bad Luck and  other numbers on this debut CD 
 Thorough and scientific, this a good companion volume to Jim Halfpenny's excellent book on the same subject.  Whereas Halfpenny's book is an excellent introduction for students and teachers of ecology, Marchand's  book goes into more detail on physiological, behavioral, and biochemical  adaptations to winter. It is therefore best suited to biology majors,  graduate students, and naturalists with a desire for a complete explanation  of how animals and plants adapt and survive in cold weather 
 Let me first start off that I usually review Christian books, and am very discerning on issues of false teachers, and how their actions impact our world.  Let me point out that I am no fan of David Koresh, the Branch Davidians, or Seventh-Day Adventism.  Having said that, I am also concerned about how the church as a whole in the United States has turned apathetic towards military intervention overseas and here at home, not realizing future impacts that this apathy will have towards the churches current concerns of protecting Judeo-Christian principles in our society.  The video "Waco -The Rules of Engagement" is a look at the worst of both worlds: destructive cults and government oppression.  I have studied the Branch Davidians to some detail; one of my favorite books entitled "Kingdom of the Cults" dives into their theology extensively.  I myself find the theology of seventh-day adventists heresy; Koresh and his follower suffered from spiritual pride and blindness in thinking that their leader is the last prophet to speak before Christ.  It is important to note that, according to this video, Koresh never claimed to be "God" but that he had special revelation.  His followers, who had traveled from around the globe, and apparently many in the local community, believed him.  It is also important to note that the Christian church has embraced other individuals who have this corrupt "special revelation knowledge" -- ranging from cults like the Mormons to TV prosperity preachers such as Benny Hinn and Ken Copeland who have claimed that they are "little gods" and who have seen Jesus in the flesh and have special witness to Christ here on this earth.  Seventh-Day adventism forms the root of the branch Davidians and makes many biblical claims (the Sabbath still exists... but on Saturday; anyone who doesn't practice this won't be raptured, they teach) and alienates other churches who see the bible more clearly... that it is clearly a matter of conscience as to what one eats or whether or not one day is to be considered holier than another.  In fact, the only churches who have defended David Koresh and his followers are the Seventh-Day Adventists.  Mainstream Christians have simply labeled the Davidians as a cult that deserved to die, as tragic as that may seem.  The reality is no matter how evil Koresh himself may or may not have been, this video clearly shows that our government wanted to put on a show to excercise their power, and test their capability of covering up actions that the Bible clearly states that governments around the world will be involved in as a one-world government approaches.  Before the initial actions, the ATF had used government funding to prepare for what was supposedly a drug raid (obviously a lie to obtain funding and training).  ATF had notified major media outlets that something big was going to take place at Waco; the media was stationed within observation range 30 minutes prior to the deliberately broadcast event -- so that the ATF, who had lost credibility and funding, could get back on their feet as an organization.  And Waco was, they thought, the perfect platform.  All eyewitness accounts from inside the compound suggests that the government had not read anybody their rights, and had come in with the purpose of putting on a display of military strength in a highly visible gun-battle.  A 911 call from inside the compound revealed that the Davidians from the start believed that they were fired upon first, that there were women and children, and that they were only fighting in self-defense and wanted a cease-fire.  Ironically, though the ATF had many technological advantages -- from their computers, control room communications, and Public Relations -- they had cut themselves off from all contact with local authorities.  The Branch Davidians were dialing 911, and the local officials -- including the local sheriff and later the Texas Rangers -- were up in arms over the federal government's actions.  In short, after the fiasco that first day in which 4 agents were killed, the FBI were brought in.  Ultimately, tanks rigged to pump lethal and flammable amounts of CS nerve gas basically bulldozed the compound.  Imaging from a plane above clearly shows federal government agents firing at the compound from behind the tanks, which in one instance mutilate a body as it ran over and over it while tearing down one of the buildings.  Tapes also show what appears to be a detonation which initiates the fireball effect through the compound.  Most concerning is more concentrated gunfire in retreat, seemingly as government officials fired upon the only exits that women and children could have escaped from.  Federal authorities prevented firetrucks and ambulances from going in, until the entire building had been downed in flames within a matter of moments.  Later, government officials "misplaced" huge amounts of physical evidence.  The government's story: David Koresh was a total nutcase who was in charge of a bunch of criminals who died in a gunbattle that they started.  All the victims shot themselves and then burned the compound to the ground in a mass suicide.  The true story:  ATF agents, because of a political blunder, sought revenge for their downed comrades.  This was just another chapter in Janet Reno's satanic handling of a situation; not much unlike Ruby Ridge or the Elian Gonzalez case.  Because there was no condemnation, this will be just the beginning, a possible starting point of our government testing its barriers.... until there are no barriers left to test.  And they tortured innocent people unto a gruesome death -- even the elderly, even children!!! -- and then covered it up, with barely a peep from the mainstream Christian community 
 Tolstoy's inspiring translation of the Gospels focuses on the problem of life while detailing Christ's instructions to man concerning the question of how we are to live.  This work is revolutionary in the context that it summarizes all of Christ's instructions into 5 simple commands, all of which can be obeyed through one direct command: to love one another even as Christ has loved us.  In reading this book, I would recommend reading the body of the text before reading the introduction.  As the text is potentially paradigm shifting for the reader, it is best to approach it with an open mind.  Tolstoy's introduction, I have found, can be best appreciated after reading the text of the Gospel in Brief.  I would encourage everyone, Christian and non-Christian, to read this book to attain a clearer understanding of the teachings of Jesus Christ 
 Embracing the totality of Brion Gysin's output and influence was essentially impossible prior to the publication of this book.  Weiss's study of Gysin's work and his long friendship with the writer/musician/visionary results pays off:  opening the door to creative and intellectual explorations that continue reverberating to this day 
 We ordered this bed from Amazon.com.  It took several weeks to be delivered, but, when it came, the delivery men carried it to my son's room  and assembled it!  It was great!  My son loves his new bed.  I took the  adivce of another reviewer and set the box spring directly onto the floor.   Now I know my son won't fall out of bed!  My son is only 27 months old,  and, although big for his age, he has a hard time climbing into the bed on  the side.  He is able to climb in over the "hood" of the car,  though.  I also noticed that there was at least 2 inches of space all the  way around the mattress.  When I made the bed, I really appreciated that  space because I was able to tuck his comforter all the way down around the  mattress 
 An excellent and touching documentary about a period in American history when racism was strong and human decentcy was sometimes absent 
 This compact charger works great. Gets me up and running again in no time 
 I recommend this book for the rich and colorful depiction of Britain during the 5th century, as well as for providing an intelligent version of Arthurian beginnings.    Full Review:  Having read just about every version of the Arthurian legend, I picked up Jack Whyte's book: The Skystone, hoping to find something more definitive and less magical. What I discovered, was an extremely well written and historically fascinating look at 5th century life in Roman occupied Britain.   Whyte did his homework, and it shows in so many ways. Not only does he evince a formidable knowledge and understanding of Rome's military men, but also of the impact the Empire had on the entire known world.   His explanation for the sword Excalibur's beginnings makes sense, and includes magic-if only for the way it appeared to primitive eyes. Whyte, like another author, Colleen McCullough, takes no shortcuts, nor opts for facile answers to the legend of Arthur, and the birth of Camelot.   Instead, he patiently builds, step by step, a plausible yet highly entertaining historical setting.   General Caius Brittanicus is a brilliant and highly decorated Roman man, who was born in Britain. A man of deep insight and wisdom, he forsees the collapse of the Roman Empire. When not on campaign for Rome, he lives with his wife, children and widowed sister Luceia.   Publius Varro is General Brittanicus' Primus Pilus, or senior aide. Their fortunes are inextricably entwined, and how the two of them grow deep in love and respect for one another, is the main thrust of the first book.   Varro, has a blade fashioned from what his grandfather described as a skystone. This sword has a sheen, and luster ordinary iron doesn't possess, and is much stronger than even bronze. Yet Publius has no idea where to find more of this strange metal. When he finally does find it, the answer fulfills many empty spaces left by less gifted writers.   The battle scenes are interesting, even to those of us who might ordinarily find them boring, mainly due to Whyte's deft handling of Roman military tactics. The enmities that develop through the events in this book, prove to have far reaching and unforeseen consequences.   The Skystone comes with a glossary, a pronunciation guide and maps of Britain, which prove helpful throughout the series.   I thoroughly enjoyed this book for its interesting and deep characters, all drawn with a loving hand, that understands human nature in all its dimensions so well. I recommend starting with The Skystone and reading the entire series. You'll be delighted and totally enmeshed in Jack Whyte's version of Arthurian times.   
 This offering by BLS, recorded in Paris on the Mafia tour is by far their best so far: The overall Mix/Sound,Song Selection & Raw Energy are all in top form here ! Also of note to all Pantera/Metal fans is the inclusion of "In This River"- Zakk's moving tribute to his best friend,Dimebag Darrell. Highlights(there are plenty),include "Stoned And Drunk","Stillborn","Been A Long Time","Suicide Messiah","Funeral Bell","Fire It Up", AND MANY MORE ! The second disc is a four song set from London, which rounds out what is a blistering live set form Black Label and Co. Enjoy this one and marvel at the guitar alter of Zakk Wylde !! 
 I am very surprised at the negative reviews for this film. I never saw the Broadway musical on which the movie was based, so I don't have the advantage of having the live performance to compare to the movie. I have to say that the film really touched me, and I generally haven't liked most of the recent musical films that I've seen. All of the songs in Rent have heavy and deep meanings behind them since there's hardly any spoken dialogue. This means that Rent moves forward on the strength of its songs. Each number furthers the plot and reveals another aspect of a character.   Playwright Jonathan Larson was an amazing human being with such a talent for - at the time he wrote it back in the early 90's - being so "out there" and taking the risk of writing about AIDS and homosexuality, and ultimately having his work find its way into the hearts of so many people. If you wrote an actual script in which the young author of such a wildly successful Pulitzer winning musical dies the night after its dress rehearsal after being misdiagnosed by two different hospitals, nobody would believe you, but that is exactly what happened. It is also a shame that the actual reality of life in Alphabet City (now very much gentrified) and the nature of the AIDS crisis and treatments have changed so much that many people might not consider this film's greatness because they will regard it as out of date. I guess I just found the movie to be brilliant because it wasn't supposed to be absolutely realistic, it was supposed to evoke emotion, and that it did, at least for me. None of the individual relationships get that much screen time, yet I really cared deeply about all of these characters, both as a group and individually.   You could really feel the urgency of time pressing on the characters that had AIDS - the urgency to create, the urgency to love, - since, in 1990, there were not a lot of therapies that effectively prevented HIV from turning into full blown AIDS as there are today. Also, if you are not moved by Collins' tribute to Angel in the reprise performance of "I'll Cover You", all I can say is that you have no soul. Jesse Martin does a splendid job of displaying a genuine sense of loss, grief, and love that is the best performance in the entire movie.  Rent is one of those few films that I like to watch over and over just to see if I have missed anything. It does seem like some of the movie's detractors are being a bit snobby about the fact that Chris Columbus, who is well known for directing family films, directed this movie. Unfortunately, Bob Fosse is no longer with us, because I have found myself wondering more than once what he would have done with this material. 
 I'm a student who takes a philosophy class every semester, despite the fact that it does absolutely nothing for my graduation requirements. I always do well in the philosophy classes, but there is one part I hate: the reading. I was convinced that there was no point in philosophy that one could not talk through with another person; the words and semantics in philosophy, meant to clarify arguments when spoken, simply seemed a muddle to me when read. So it was with trepidation that I picked up my latest assignment--Tolstoy's Confession. I read it, and was shocked to find myself completely engrossed. Here, finally, was what I'd been looking for...the On the Road of philosophy, the self-effacing Jack Kerouac of the field. Everyone who's had worries about the fleeting nature of life and everyone who's worried that it all means nothing, this is your book 
 It's not until you are well and truly wading through the wealth of special features on the 2-disc special edition DVD of the 1947 Christmas favorite "The Miracle on 34th Street" that one realizes that the release features not just two versions of the movie, but three.  For not only does the release feature the original black & white version shown in theaters and the circa 1980s colorized version of the same feature film, but also hidden away on the second disc is the curiously titled "20th Century Fox Hour of the Stars: The Miracle on 34th Street," which turns out to be a 46 minute 1950s remake for television that is surprisingly in incredibly good quality.  The inclusion of this feature is indicative of Fox's loving tribute to this family movie gem that is this 2-disc release. Prior to its release the studio had no idea how to market what it considered to be an "unimportant program picture" and stuck it in the middle of its summer schedule with a trailer (shown here as 5-minute promotional short) that did not feature one single clip from the movie and went at lengths to conceal it's Yuletide theme.  The story is so well known that it hardly bears relating in this review. Suffice to say that it charts the efforts of a man (played in an Academy Award winning performance by British actor Edmund Gwenn) to be legally recognized as Santa Claus, which in fact he is and to persuade a doubting yung girl (played by Natalie Wood in a star-turning performance) and a practical realist (played vy Maureen O'Hara) that he is indeed Father Christmas. Picked to replace a liquor induced Santa as the Macy's Parade Santa he is a smashing success and indeed Gwenn's performance is so incredible that Natalie Wood really did believe that she was acting opposite Santa Claus.  Perhaps the best special feature in this release in what is a tough choice given its incredible comapny is the feature length audio commentary by Maureen O'Hara. Recorded at her home in Ireland this past August the DVD warns us that this is merely excerpts of that interview with frequent silent sections, but I must say that this is happily not entirely accurate. O'Hara is clearly watching the movie (discussing elements on the screen as they occur), but also is more talkative than other commentaries that I have listened to that do not have a similar warning.  In the commentary O'Hara recounts being forced to remain in the United States following the outbreak of hostilities in World War II and subsequently furious when (after being allowed to return to her native Ireland) on being ordered back to the U.S. to make this film. She tells us that other considered titles were "The Big Heart" and "It's Only Human" and how once she read the script she was determined to be involved in what she saw as a warm and affectionate movie.She also talks about the parade itself and reveals that it was the actual parade with people in the crowd not being aware that Fox was shooting a movie that day.  Also included in this release is the 22-minute "AMC Backstory" behind the scenes of the production. Including on-camera interviews with film historian Rudy Behlmer, actress Maureen O'Hara, actor Robert Hyatt (who played Thomas Mara Jr.), actor Alvin Greenman (who played Alfred), Natalie Wood biographer Suzanne Finstad and Natalie's sister Lana Wood, the documentary traces the genesis to the movie back to a fateful trip to a Los Angeles department store by screenwriter Valentine Davies. Fighting through holiday shoppers on 1944's Christmas Eve in an effort to buy a gift for his wife, Davies wondered what Santa Claud would make of the commercialism of Christmas. After working on the screenplay for over a year the project was optioned by Fox, who evidently had no idea what they had.  In what was a huge risk the filmmakers agreed, when Macy's and rival store Gimble Bros. said they would withold permission for their names to be used in the film until they had seen the finished film. Thankfully they loved it for if either store had objected Fox would have had to drastically re-cut and re-shoot major portions of the movie.  So it was that at the height of the 1946 shopping season over 100 cast and crew descended on the Macy's store in New York City to shoot interiors of the movie and when it wrapped used the likes of Rex Harrison and Anne Baxter (who were on the Fox lot shooting other pictures) to rave about the production. Fox need not have worried though because it was a critical and commercial success staying in theaters for over six months and taking home three of its nominated four Oscars. In fact its popularity is such that it has not only been remade in the included 1950s TV production, but again in a 1970s TV movie and then in a 1994 big budget production (and clips from all three are featured in the AMC Backstory).  An archival MovieTone News reel (running 1:42) covers those awards presentations and includes the famous quite from a clean shaven Gwenn when receiving his statue, "Phew. Now I know there is a Santa Claus."  But that's not all this bumper release contains. Also included is a 15:30 featurette on the history of the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade and in particular its pivotal role in the movie. This new documentary features on-camera interviews with Robert M. Grippo (author of a book on the parade) and John W. Straus who worked on the parade for 22 years and coordinated with thr studio that the filming of the parade (with their 14 camera's positioned along the route) went off without a hitch.  The special features are rounded out with nine posters for the movie.  Audio includes English 5.1 Dolby Surround, English mono, French mono and Spanish mono. There are English and Spanish subtitles 
 This book is one of the best teen books that I've ever read!  It will keep you on the edge of your seat and guessing even after you finish it.  Luckly the second book in the series is out.  The story is about six 98% human/2% bird "creatures" and their lives as they rescue their little "sister" from the labratory where they were created.  All the while they are being chased by wolf/humans.  I won't spoil the story for you though.  But I highly suggest reading this book.  You won't be disappointed!!! 
 An excellent introduction to the rich music that the Middle East provides the world. Some first class performances by musical masters who really put their heart into their playing. A must have!! 
 This is an excellent book.  It is beautifully illustrated, making it a lovely overview of Van Gogh's drawings, visually-speaking.   It is also very well-written, researched and scholarly.  The interweaving of biography, history and art makes it a great resource for research. I am particularly interested in prints and drawings as art media and work in an Art Gallery, so I find the book to be a good addition to my personal art history library. It compares well with Rubens:  The Drawings, a recent catalogue for a Metropolitan Museum Exhibition 
 This is a fantastic novel... it is so well written. You are transported to a village during the bubonic plague.   The descriptions are fantastic, the drama, the pain, the fear, tenderness, caring, worries, and above it all, the confusion of the bubonic plague in England.   Some parts are a bit crude and the end is too abrupt and simplistic for the depth and richness of the novel. A 5 star rating without the last 15 pages.  Great reading it along with Galileo's daughter -about the same time, but in Italy. 
 ...but Marcia Willett comes the closest yet to drawing me into a book!  Rosamund is the Queen, the Empress of this genre, however Marcia Willett comes very close in her character development and the feeling that you want to know these characters.  Not an overly deep book, but one just right to get lost in and hope the best for the characters 
 This book is a very useful guide for computer challenged people like myself.  I have found a number of the hints and tips already very usefu 
 The notes that John Andrews gives on all the Everyman Shakespeare editions that he edits are fabulous.  I think his editions are the most user friendly for any actor, student, director and teacher.  Some publishing house should get Mr. Andrews to do all the plays.  
  For a long time, the City Watch has been ruined and what was once many men is now three. Captain Vimes the drunkard kind hearted leader. Corporal Nobbs, know one really knows his species. And Sergent Colon, shy, timid and has a letter relationship with his wife.  And now we get to Carrot. He was raised by dwarfs and has just entered Ankh-Morpork and has just joined The City Watch. Then sudenlly a dragon is terrorizing the city and it's up to the City Watch to save the city. A story full of Dragons, mystery, accion, flatulent fire and summonings.  I REALLY enjoyed this book. It was funny, and it was just plain great. I really liked the Carrot character becuase of his charisma and his personality.  A DEFINITE FOUR STARS 
 'The Shield' is easily one of the best shows on TV.  The characters are not polarized into good and bad, everyone seems to just be a different shade of gray.  The plots have a clever way of putting you in the position where you ask yourself "what would I do?", with many complex moral questions and dilemmas for the characters.  The only negative about this collection is that it has been presented in Full Screen aspect ratio and the picture quality on the region 1 is not a clean as my local region 4, which was in Wide Screen, but only seasons 1&2 have been released here in Australia on DVD.  To my knowledge all the episodes have been filmed Wide Screen so I'm not sure why it's in Full Screen on this collection, but that is how they were originally aired by FX 
 Great lyrics-you can picture Max and Scratch sitting down in the Black Ark writing these songs-a sheer clillin' album.Reggae fans email me on geeras@hotmail.co 
 I enjoyed using this book so far this semester, It is only every other odd and a very thin book. Some gaps in some of the explinations 
 I didn't know much about Australia and until this movie I only ever saw Starlight Hotel which I own and love!  This movie made me cry and the courage that these girls demonstrated was something we could only hope for. I am surrounded by Native American culture where I live and see the disintigration of their culture every day and it saddens me. What the Aboriginal people had to go through was nothing less than deplorable and the fact that it continued until as recent as 1970 is even worse. This movie will touch your heart and make you hold your children ever tighter. You will also love the music, not only is it ethereal and beautiful but it will bring you into their world and the trials they endure to get back home 
 Just the right dosage of why a positive attitude is that important and how to attain it! Simple, straight forward, and well written with very good picks of stories and sayings to illustrate his points! A great read that can be completed within two hours, though it will take much committment to put the teachings into practice and to re-read it regularly to fight against our inertia to change and improve. Highly recommended!  Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.   Attitudes are a secret power working 24 hours a day, for good or bad. pg 12 You must first see clearly a thing in your mind before you can do it. - Alex Morrison pg 27 One person with a commitment is worth more than 100 people who have only an interest. - Mary Crowley pg 41 "Am I willing to do whatever it takes to achieve this goal?" If your answer is, "I'll do just about anything, excpet that I wont do ____," then frankly, you're not committed. pg 44 Repeat anything often enough and it will start to become you. - Tom Hopkins pg 55 My blindness is a trivial affliction and just barely an inconvenience. - Kent Cullers, Head of NASA's Search for ET Intelligence Project.  pg 60 Choose words that will point you in the direction of your goals. pg 64 If you want to be successful, you must be willing to be uncomfortable, to do things that you are afraid to do. pg 95 And the one "YES" (from a publisher) after 33 failures is what launched the spectacular success of Chicken Soup for the Soul. pg 111 Success seems to be a largely a number of hanging on after others have let go. - William Feather pg 112 If you are positive and enthusiastic, people will want to spend time with you. pg 118 I am convinced that life is 10 percent what happens to me and 90% how I react to it. - Charles Swindoll pg 129 
 My wife and I just got back from Ireland and had a great time, in part because of this book. The guesthouse we stayed in, several of the restaurants we visited, and more than a couple of the sites we saw were drawn from its pages. I'm happy to report that its guidance was uniformly spot on. We tend to enjoy simply being in a place, doing things in a low key way and deciding what to do next as we take our time wandering around. This guide was perfect for that, easy to whip out of a bag over lunch or on a street corner, though I suspect that it would be useful for those who prefer to set down itineraries, too.   For what it's worth, this has been our experience with other Lonely Planet guides as well (including those for Ireland and Yellowstone & Grand Teton National Parks) 
 An amazing book.  It tells the tale of Fosca who is cursed with immortality.  Only in reading his tale do you fully understand and appreciate that because life is fleeting it is perfect.  To outlive all those you've ever loved, as Fosca does, would be torture. A must read. 
 GREAT MUSIC AND I LOVE THE SABER DANCE 
 Controversial in his time, D. H. Lawrence's "The Rainbow" is considered one of his masterpieces nowadays. The reasons in both cases are virtually the same. Completed in 1915, the book has a modern freshness that even now -- almost 100 years later -- is still fresh. This is a novel that aged well -- or better yet, hasn't aged and is always up to date.  Banned and considered disturbed in its time, "The Rainbow" brings a formal experiment combined with sexual awakening and candidness and the praised of individualism. The events and characters are recurrent and they happen cyclically. The novel described three generation of the Brangwen family and as their world dissolves and their lives changes.  What were most disturbing by the 1910s in this novel were the sexual passages. There weren't seen as a natural act of life, but rather were claimed as dirty. One of the most interesting moments in the narrative is a honeymoon. Beautifully --and sometimes funnily-- described the event is like an early sexual personal revolution of the couple. Needless to say that people in 1915 weren't ready for that.  The most interesting generation of the Brangwen is the third one, focused on Ursula (she and her sister will be the protagonists of "Women in Love" published in 1917). Most of the book is devoted to her, but until we reach her there is an amazing cast of characters created by Lawrence populating "The Rainbow".  Story moves in a special speed. It feels like the writer has create a world apart where one must surrender to its velocity in order to enjoy the story. It is worthwhile to let yourself be immersed in the place. Lawrence writing is like a travel in place and time with a destination that we may know --from books and movies-- but the way he presents it is so unique that this journey feels like new.  Creating characters that are very human places Lawrence's literature as universal. Since his books deal with our aspirations, fears, love among other things, one --no matter where or when-- can identify his/herself with his writings. In age when one dimensional characters and disposable thrillers tend to rule, "The Rainbow" is like the sun shining in a cloudy day. It is like finding the pot of gold in the end of the rainbow.  
 This very short little volume serves as the perfect introduction to the work and style of Ernest Hemmingway.  It contains ten of his most popular short stories.  THIS IS BY NO MEANS A COMPLETE COLLECTION OF HIS GREATEST HITS.  Notably absent from this collection is "Hills Like White Elephants."  However, it does contain such perennial favorites as "The Killers," "A Clean Well-Lighted Place," and "The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber."  Ultimately, the consumer (like myself) will be tempted to buy The Complete Short Stories of Ernest Hemmingway, which is not much more expensive 
 this is the first Jeffery Deaver novel I read, and I thing I will read more of his books. Without doubt, this is a amazingly good novel, and I won't regret actually buying this. I won't be surprised if someone makes a movie out of this one.  Hero of Bone collector, Lincoln ryhme and amelia Sachs, appear again in this novel. A murder of an art student sets the two detectives on the course to find the murderer. the supposed illusionist, the killer is using the old magic tricks and escapes to kill and escape from the scenes. aided by an amateur illusionist, rhyme and sachs have to find out the true intentions of the killer's acts before it's too late.  I'm not going to reveal too much, but I will tell you one thing. This is one of a kind, and is one of the best thrillers I've read and will read 
 A proper critical account of Swift's text would exceed by far the space given here. As someone doing scholarly work on Gulliver's Travels, I would merely like to point out that Mr. Rivero's edition is a bit confusing. For some reason, he has decided that it was a good idea to move the letter prefacing the text to the end (which, as the "Advertisement" itself says should be "prefixed" to the volume). The critical apparatus is truly commonsensical, and at times, reduces the novel to a sad, straightforward allegory. One would only wish that the criticism section were as interesting as it is extensive. All this said, there is nothing violently "wrong" with this edition 
 Having been reading various WWII books this fall and winter, I rate this as one of the best. If you have any interest in what it was like to fight (and luckily survive) the US air war bombing offensive, grab this book today. You will not be disappointed 
 Between Friends is her best cd! I was hesitant about buying this cd because her cd, More, sucked. After I completely listened to each song, I was able to pick out my favorites. I am so delighted that she was able to have a creative voice on this album.  My favorites: Almost Can't get enough My last first kiss Love and I  Least favorites: Sittin on the job Daydreaming When a woman Why can't it be  Best cd I have bought, since Mary J. Blige, Breakthrough.  
 I disagree with the above review written by Mo Ramchandani and strangely enough, I took a look at 2 Days and noticed that the film was produced by an individual with the same name.  Either this is an amazing coincidence or this person has some sort of axe to grind with the film that apparently he himself is at least partially responsible for.  Either way, it's a good film.  It's a shame there isn't some sort of vetting process to prevent strange characters like this Mo Ramchandani from using this forum to file his own petty grievances. 
 I think this is a great movie about a Guilt stricken IRA gunman. Based on a book this movie will make you laugh,cry,and excited.This is a must 
 As a history buff and aspiring novelist of the California Gold Rush period, I found this volume fascinating.  I learned a great deal about slang, clothing, courtship, and how people entertained themselves.  Unfortunately, a text-only book is insufficient to properly describe clothing and hairstyles -- or convey exactly what their houses looked like.  The book desperately needs drawings or pictures!!  The dictionary-style organization is useful, but I would have preferred more narrative text describing each subject before McCutcheon launches into definitions.  This volume is definitely worth a spot on my bookshelf, but I'll keep hunting for something that provides the visuals 
 "Alma Ros: Vienna to Auschwitz" is a poignant and beautifully related account of one the most extraordinary women who ever lived.  Alma Ros, the daughter of the most renowned violinist of Vienna who was  concertmaster of the Vienna Philharmonic and the first violinist of perhaps  the finest string quartet in the world, was also the niece of Gustav  Mahler.  She became a fine violinist and musician in her own right, taking  musical Vienna by storm, and creating a famous and successful women's  orchestra which toured throughout Europe.  Soon after the Nazi takeover in  Austria, the Jewish family left for England where Alma continued to give  concerts, playing even in her father's illustrious quartet.  But she also  took the risk of concertizing in Holland.  She was trapped by the sudden  Nazi blitzkrieg and takeover of Holland, tried to escape, was betrayed and  caught by the Nazis, and sent to Auschwitz-Birkenwald.  It was at Auschwitz  that Alma's extraordinary life takes on new dimensions: within the death  camp, she creates and directs a women's orchestra composed not only of  traditional symphonic instruments, but also of guitars, mandolins,  accordions, and recorders, playing arrangements made and copied by women  inmates of Auschwitz. Because of Alma's work at Auschwitz, hundreds of  women were saved from the Nazi gas chambers; in fact, many survivors  contributed to the book through interviews with the author. 	This story  has been told before, but never as well as Richard Newman and Karen Kirtley  relates it. Mr. Newman took twenty-two years of painstaking work of  research and interviewing before completing the book.  In the Editor's  Note, Ms. Kirtley points out Mr. Newman's "phenomenal achievement" of  talking with "more than one hundred people able to provide firsthand  information about Alma Ros." The book is carefully researched with  abundant documentation, a massive bibliography, and appendices which  contain lists of every woman who played in the Auschwitz-Birkenau  orchestra, a background of the Mahler-Ros family, a list of every  interview that was conducted, and a "camp glossary" of terms used at  Auschwitz-Birkenau.  The authors delve deeply into Vienna's history,  culture, and society, which produced the strong anti-Semitic feelings, and,  ultimately, the welcoming of Nazi troops into the city.  A short review, of  course, cannot do justice to the scope and dimension of this marvelous  book; it is a work that every student of music and European history should  read.  However, the book will also appeal to readers without a background  in modern European history, for the book is written clearly and with firm  structure and form. Richard Newman and Karen Kirley have provided the  reader with a remarkable book about an exceptional woman --- a poignant  reminder of the anguish and tragedy of Nazi Germany and Austria, but also  about the courage and humanity that existed in some people. This is an  extraordinary book 
 I'm a New Yorker now living elsewhere, and when I read the book to my son I quickly realized I had to give Tucker Mouse an authentic New York accent, he's such the quintessential New Yorker.  Selden's writing of Tucker's dialogue is just brilliant, captures exactly a certain kind of New Yorker - seemingly rough on the outside,heart of gold inside.  Brings back lots of memories for me and makes me quite homesick.  My son is always in stitches whenever Tucker speaks.  We are now reading the sequel, Tucker's Countryside and it's Tucker that makes the book.  Chester's kind and quiet ways make a good counterbalance, but I can't imagine the series without the wise-cracking eloquent Tucker.  What a well-written character - read the book just for him 
 This was an awesome movie........very real.  I'm amazed that it was filmed back in 1985.......that must have been pretty brave back then.  Both Shaver and Charbonneau were great actors, but I have to say, Charbonneau was captivating!  You would think that she would have been in great demand after that movie, but whatever happened to her???  I'd love to see her star in another movie......a similar role would be nice, but I'll take anything with her in it 
 This unit works as advertised. I mounted it using the suction cups on my windshield in the lower left hand corner, and ran the temp sensor cable about a foot over to the edge of the door frame to get outside temperature. The suction cups work well if you clean the glass first. Pros: Easy setup and good results. Cons: temp gage is too small to read easily 
 E.L.  Doctorow's novel Ragtime vividly explores the lifestyle, culture, and relationship of family, business, and life at the turn of the twentieth century.  Ragtime has a heavy emphasis on progressive ideologies, which serves as a catalyst for the evolution of the historical time period and the development of the characters.  For example, Ragtime incorporates an emphasis on the changing role of women which is illustrated in change of the white middle-class wife throughout the novel.  The wife undergoes a series of changes triggered by her husband's departure for a trip and her reading of female literature that emphasizes women's sexual tendencies and the role they play.  Doctorow deliberately critiqued and placed the families in stereotypical roles so that the reader could understand and follow the transitions which the family went through over the course of the novel.  Ragtime breaks the barriers of race and ethnicities at the turn of the century and interlocks the character's struggles and accomplishments 
 Martin Knelman is a wonderful writer and of all the books I have read about Jim Carrey, his was the best written and most interesting of them all. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who either loves Jim Carrey or who would just like to know more about him and his amazing rise to fame from out of terrible hardships. Book has lots of insight, some photos and a list of films 
 Actually I saw the movie many years back and, remembering that and recently reading another Doctorow book, I decided to pick this one up when I noticed it in a store. The tale of a ramshackle little western town on the edge of nowhere in the Dakota territory, deriving its lifeblood from a nearby mine, WELCOME TO HARD TIMES grabs us from the beginning with its brutal portrayal of the town's destruction at the hands of a monster of a man who is to remain nameless for much of the tale, a natural force more than a fellow human being. The Bad Man from Bodie savagely rapes and callously kills those in his path including the town whores, the barkeep, the carpenter, the undertaker, the hangers-on, leaving only a few scattered survivors in his wake, after burning the town around them to the ground. In the shadow of his departure, with little hope and much desperation, the handful of survivors rebuild, mainly for want of anything else to do. And the town, after a rigorous winter, prospers. But the mood throughout is ominous and the memory of the Man fron Bodie never far below the surface of the broken people he leaves behind. Doctorow writes with subtlety and irony and his telling is as tight as it gets. Yet I found the ending, deliberately muddled, I suppose, to mimic the sense of collapse, rather a letdown after the crisp narrative that comes before. All breaks down, in the end, in a sudden revelation about the sustaining source of the town's hopes and the Bad Man from Bodie returns without notice, just abruptly appearing in the maelstrom of collapse. This time is a little different from the first in the town's response to the Bad Man, or at least in how the self-proclaimed town mayor and narrator responds. But the results are no less redolent of life's despair and futility. Although the characters are more than the Western stereotypes they at first appear to be, they do not rise above their situations but are sucked sadly back into the storm that blows down upon them from the larger world outside. They are a sad lot and so, we sense, are we all, doomed to live out our lives in hope and desperate striving but never able to gain a foothold in the rock to take us above the level of the town of Hard Times and the life it offers us. This is a fable, writ on Western rock, of living and dying. More subtle and many-layered than the movie it inspired, in the end it is a book of hopelesness and of the raggedness of life itself. -- SW 
 This is Todd Snider as I remember him - at the head of the Nervous Wrecks touring with the Bottlerockets on the stage at Mississippi Nights in St. Louis - where I first saw him and where I keep him in my mind's eye.  He opened for the BRox there - local favorites got to close the show (which was cool enough by itself, but it gets better).    Now, I don't mean that this is a live recording - it isn't.  It is smoothly recorded, and professional in every way (as it was his last major label release, btw).  But the damn thing growls, like he used to do live - it has an immediacy that the others lack.  The material is performed with real enthusiasm.  Songs like "Rocket Fuel" and "I am Too" actually breathe fire, and "I am Too" features the best verse ever written in the United States, in any song, ever (you figure it out).     He has a song about Jesus on this cd that would make our Savior swell with pride.  And you can't find the cd anywhere in stores - the only place I've ever seen it is used on Amazon.  Buy it, and you will never be the same.  
 This novel is certainly a portrayal of very by-gone days.  Days so far removed from the present that this novel is almost laughable at points.  Fortunately, it is the good kind of laughable; Saroyan writes with enough honesty to make this world believeable, because he knows this world.  Unfortunately, for this reader - and probably for others who, like me, came of age in a far more cynical world than Homer does - it is often tempting to say, "C'mon... yeah right.  That character wouldn't do that!"  Saroyan wrote this novel with (perhaps unbeknownst to him) too much naivete for my taste.  But all things considered, I'd wager that my reaction above is more my fault (and the fault of the world I live in) than the fault of Saroyan.  His compassion for his characters (every single one) makes this book an enjoyable read.  Ulysses is easily the most lovable character that in any novel that I have read in the past few years.  For a glimpse into a simpler time - a time of "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" and "Casablanca" - this is a very good book.  Almost escapist fare - as hard as Homer's life as a working class teenager is, the quiet, safe Central Valley WWII setting turns out to be a nostalgic treasure to us denizens of the 21st century.  Saroyan crafted a beautiful story here, and if this kind of novel is what you're looking for, then pick this one up 
 This was my first foray into the world of cyberpunk, and it really shook me. My husband and I drank in the strange visions, the dark and different world, and eagerly anticipated the release of each following book, Effendi and Fellahin. From there I've delved into Gibson (they say I should have started there, but I assure you if this is unfamiliar territory to you as it was for me, this is a fine place to begin.) I can't recommend this book highly enough. Disturbing, dark, engrossing, challenging... I am constantly recommending Mr. Grimwood's books to my friends 
 This film is best interpreted in a symbolic and allegorical way.  The plot is too implausible and riddled with inconsistencies to be taken literally.  Instead, what Logan's Run offers is a bizarre vision of the cult of eternal youth evolving into a police state.  Some of the scenes are riveting, such as the early depiction of sanitized mass murder carried out in a spectacular ceremony.  There are clear references to a commercial culture that glorifies youth and lives in denial about death.  The world depicted here is at once hedonistic and claustrophobic.  The environment is a kind of shallow, Disneyesque paradise from which there is no hope of escape.  The implicit subtext of the movie, that hedonism is a kind of deathtrap, is well taken.           
 Since the fall of communism in the late 80s and early 90s, new democracies have embraced constitutional courts exercising judicial review. Given the vicious attacks upon courts in the US, one often wonders why anyone would adopt constitutional courts with the power to attack the result of the democratic process, and push its own policy. Ginsburg presents a compelling answer: new democracies turn to constitutional courts as a source of political insurance. When creating a constitution, parties will be more willing to create a court when the political future is uncertain, where they predict that they will likely be in the minority and thus may require extra protection to ensure that the other party(s) will not be able to abuse them. Where a party believes it will be in solid control in the future, the court will likely be weaker because the dominant party would not want to limit its own powers. Ginsburg examines this theory against three case studies of Mongolia, Korea, and Taiwan; the experience of these three countries strongly supports the political insurance theory. This interesting, original work presents judicial review as an integral part of democracy especially in countries without prior democratic experience. Additionally, Ginsburg examines courts in areas that have received little attention in the US, thus, anyone interested in non-western constitutionalism should check this book out 
 I remember the first time i ever saw this programme.  It was about a year ago when i decided to watch the entire British Comedy line up that my local PBS station shows.  They broadcast shows from "Are You Being Served?" to "The Last Of The Summer Wine" to "My Hero" and "Red Dwarf."  I remember that I almost pee-ed my pants watching "My Hero" from laughing so hard.  This is an AMAZING show that i cannot wait to be able to view when ever i want.  As soon as i saw this up for sale I pre-ordered it.  I hardly ever pre-order anything, that is how you know that this series is a good one and well worth your time!! 
 This is indeed a Jay Black special. Heard Jay and the Americans live at Valdosta State College... really a super group!! 
 I'll start out by saying I am a devoted Kottke fan, but if given the unfortunate task of selecting only one album from this seminal master, I would prolly select this one.  My enduring favorite is 'Aunt Francis'...  this tune will grow on you given a few listens....If not, listen again 
 Elizabeth I CEO was a wonderful reading that inspired me a lot. My wife and I kept fighting on who gets to to have the book first, it is one of those books that you hate to leave unfinished. The lessons of Elizabeths leadership are compelling and quite inapiring.   I never thought that I would need a book on inspiration in my life, but this book indeed changed this view as well.  Excellent work 
 Good overview describing how robert parker became robert parker.  No big nuggets, but well written and good insights and background since parker clearly cooperated with the writer, who is a wine critic in her own right and thus understands the business.  Informative and a good story while also telling you how the wine industry works and how it evolved from the days of Almaden to today.  
 I've always enjoyed the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.  They play some great music with nice harmonies and mandolins...yes, mandolins.  I'm a sucker for that instrument.  This particular greatest hits offering includes some of their biggest hits from the 80's.  Just about everybody knows "Fishin' In The Dark," which, in my opinion, is one of the best country songs every placed on vinyl, or a cassette, or a disc.  "I've Been Lookin'" and "Baby's Got A Hold On Me" are also here.  Those three songs alone are worth the price of this disc.  Other highlights include "Face On The Cutting Room Floor," "Oh What A Love," and "Down That Road Tonight."  In summary, if you're interested in groups like Shenandoah, Restless Heart, and the Eagles, you'll probably enjoy these guys.  They are more country than Restless Heart and the Eagles, but they don't have that forced "twang" that lingers on some of Shenandoah's songs.  A definite buy 
 Awesome!!!! Though I'm only 10, accurate photos and easy- to- read text allowed me to learn a lot about fighters. 
 This is the catchiest, most memorable set of tunes yet from Matthew Adam Hart, but I do wish he'd stop burying his vocals so deep in the mix. That's the only complaint I have here -- and with previous Russian Futurists releases as well 
 This is my favorite book by Judith Rossner.  If you're psychologically-minded, this is a must-read 
 BOOK IS VERY DESCRIPTIVE AND INFORMATIVE .... A MUST FOR ANYONE INVOLVED WITH BIRDS 
 Great F****** album. I'm tired of people over-reviewing albums that need less talk and more listening. This album is brilliant, both in originality (except for their name) and in musical ability.  Do you try to analyze a cool breeze on a hot day or wish a mountain range could look more majestic? If you do, go ahead and kill yourself because life will continually disappoint you.   This album is great. Enough said 
  One cannot write about this book without referring to the the animated film A Scanner Darkly.  It has an astonishing combination of great storytelling, filmmaking, acting, and computer graphic skills.  The animation - brought to life by a procedure called rotoscoping - doesn't resemble anything a computer might have created.  Indeed, given the glut of computer technology in film these days, A Scanner Darkly has a rather restrained quality.  Instead of a showy CGI motion picture - the great work of master illustrators makes the film work well from beginning to end.  The artwork serves the story well and never detracts from the plot.  In addition, the films score is unforgettable.  It doesn't take long to figure out why either.  With artists like Radiohead, Thom Yorke, and the Golden Arm Trio - one can't help recognize it as inspired music.  Scored by Graham Reynolds, the musical shades of a dark unsure time and place give way, on occasion, to blitheness.  When put together it is a feast for the eyes, ears and brain - a perfect blend of all one sees and hears in this masterpiece mislaid.  Through word-of-mouth, A Scanner Darkly is gaining a wider audience daily.  It has the power to attract and hold ones interest.  It is one of those films destined to become a classic.  And in the future, people will recognize how worthy of notice it is and will remain.  Now, as for the book - it is a feast for the minds eye.  It tells the story using the artwork from the film.  It is A Scanner Darkly in comic form - thought-bubbles and everything.  I can't think of anything more delicious.  From the cover to the story and the artwork within, it's a beautiful book. My only criticism with the copy I got from Amazon has to do with the print and the size of the book.  That is, the drawings are a bit dark and the book is a bit small for my taste.  Because it is printed on a high quality flat paper rather than glossy paper could be the reason the artwork is dark.  I think glossy paper would have given the book a unique luster that would have added to the visual experience and perhaps brightened the drawings - who knows.  In addition, a magazine-like-sized hardback might have made it easier to hold.  Then again, the odd size might have been a deliberate choice to throw the reader off, just as the story itself does.  Even so, this is a great read and souvenir of Philip K. Dick's wonderful story and Linklater's film.  With all I've said, this book is still a great buy.  I recommend the movie, the soundtrack, the book, and anything else you can get your hands on 
 Without comparison, this is the best butterfly id book around.  It is really easy to navigate and find specific butterflies quickly, even for the novice.  It has maps as well as larval foods for the different butterflies.  Quite complete.  I keep it sitting right here on my desk so that when I see a butterfly flitter by I can run outside and id it.  Its also has tips on identifying butterflies that may look similar which is helpful.  I'd buy it again for sure 
 After reluctantly beginning a weekly regimen of Fosamax for osteopenia,  I began to wonder.  Do I really need this?  What will be the long term side effects?  How do medications like Fosamax really work?  I turned to this book for the answers, and as a result made my own decisions about my bone health.  The book is well written and sheds light on the many misconceptions and preconceptions about osteoporosis.  It identifies who is really at risk and helps to exlain why bone density tests can't be considered conclusive. It goes on to explain how bone medications work in the body and why we need to be wary of them.  And it points to the fact that osteopenia is a very natural occurrence, and does not always progress to osteoporosis. Every woman is different.  And bone density drugs might be right for some, but not all. The factual information in this book, combined with my own common sense and body sense, led me to decide that the drug is not right for me.  Women need more books and resources like this when doctors and drug companies are all too swift to tell us we need an Rx that not only might be unnecessary, but might also be harmful in the long run.         
 I was shocked to find out that this was his first book!!! I loved it. I've only read one other book this year that has hit me as hard as this one (Ghost Road Blues by Jonathan Maberry).  Turns out they are both first time novelists.  I think there's a trend here! This book is a must read. If you like books with action packed adventure, nail bitting drama, 5 in the morning page turner, than this is the book for you. Subterranean is filled with surpises, twists and turns, and brings your imagination to the edge and then beyond it. It has creatures wilder than your wildest dreams ,if you don't love this book than you've got something wrong with you. 
 A good workbook to help you come to terms with yourself and Buddhism 
 I loved this because it has everything I like to fit in: Yoga flow to warm up the body and work on postures, martial kicks to sweat and practice balance and agility, and meditation to end with a clear and positive mind set. And all in a 30 minute program! 
 Beautiful, funky and cutting edge interiors.  High quality paper.  Great reference because it also includes floor plans and elevations.  Super cool and a great bargain for such a beautiful book 
 In my opinion Arte Povera was the most interesting art movement in the  20th century.  This book includes many art movements, explanations, artists  involved, plenty of pictures and it is held together in a great quality  book.  I recomend this book to anyone right or left brained 
 The brilliant young protagonist, who has a rather uncomfortable relationship with laws, considerable financial resources, and access to a fantasy kingdom composed of fairies and others, leads his reader on a merry adventure.  It seems he has constructed a computer-like device based on pilfered technology of the fairies.  His attempt to sell it to an obnoxious and unscrupulous adult business mogul goes seriously badly.  From then on, it's Artemis and his resources working to right the problems that deal-gone-wrong has created.  This is my first taste of Colfer's Artemis, and I enjoyed it enough to look forward to reading some of the others.  The blend of fantasy, contemporary fiction, science fiction and adventure works well.  The reader can overlook Artemis' questionable choices and find an engaging young fellow, one easy to root for.  The secondary characters, the bodyguards and fairy-world folk in particular, are lots of well-made fun.  Young readers will surely enjoy it, and I must wonder if, after the final installment of Harry Potter, his readers will turn to this.  
 This is a great collection of poems. I recommend the boo 
 This is one of Danielle Steel's better novels. It had a pleasant and happy ending and is great for summer or vacation reading. I was captivated by it and couldn't put it down until I was finished.  It tells how 3 couples, who planned to vacation the following year in St. Tropez, France were met with tragedy when one of the couple's wives died. Robert soon began to date again and when it came time to go on vacation, he brought his new girlfriend, who was a budding actress. This did not go over well with the other wives and caused a lot of friction among the couples.  In the end, all of the preconceived notions about the new girl friend were eliminated and it taught a lesson to those who made quick judgments about others 
 I could not find this product in my area, so I relied on Amazon once more and could not be happier with the nickel magnetic bulletboard.  It is exactly what I wanted 
 A beautiful love story with clever scenery and unorthodox philosophy intertwined. Waller has a way with words. Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, Concepts to Ponder and South State Street Journal, Secrets of The Heart 
 A great sequel to the first Cocoon. Same characters but now we learn how things have gone for them in space and also those who remained at home. Those who went away now understand how they are cut off from relatives left at home. This leads to some who elect to stay behind when its time to return to space. Again, laughter and joyful living 
 My Grandkids, ages 8 and 4, really liked this movie.  The animation is fantastic.  The four year old loves anything to do with trains.  Some things seemed a little scary but they both handled it well.  Overall, it is a very good Christmas movie 
 I found this series to be fun, gritty, and lifelike.  The characters in the Precinct remind me so much of guys I used to work with on the job.  Certainly some artistic license is taken, but for the most part, this is a slice of life which most people will never experience in their day to day jobs.  Denis Leary has risen to the top of my list as not only a comedian, but a really talented character actor.  His supporting cast fits well, and all in all I would recommend this series to anyone who is a fan of Rescue Me, or Denis Leary 
     A very wonderfull historical look into the press and how it has changed in its views as well as its abilitiy to reach a certain sence of objectivity. The author states that you can never really be totally objective, but you can strive to get as close to it as possible. I would address that the study of a few of the major members of Journalism's history was one of the best chapters of the book because it gives you a shocking prespective of what these men really were and the terrible ends they faced at the end of their tourtured journeys. I was very surprised to read exactly who Pulizer was and what exactly the Pulizer Award may insue when one obtains it.      I gave it less then 5 stars because at times, the religious portions of the book get a bit too preachy for my tastes, but then, since it is a christian like peice, it is to be expected and that is fine. It may turn away some readers but I think it still is a great peice of knowledge for research. 
 I remember seeing My Life when it came out ten years ago and thinking that it was a wonderful film.  When I purchased it recently on DVD the film itself had lost none of its poignancy.    The plot of the film has relatively few twists and turns.  At the beginning of the film Bob Jones (played by Michael Keaton) has been diagnosed with terminal cancer.  Jones's wife, Gail (Nicole Kidman) is pregnant with their first child, so Bob decides to start filming a series of videotapes that can be shown to the son he knows he is unlikely to ever see.    Gail eventually also gets Bob to visit a Chinese healer (Hiang Ngor), who apparently is using a mix of traditional remedies and psychology to help Bob.  This is the point where the film could have gotten extremely corny, but director Bruce Joel Rubin does not overdo the mysticism and avoids taking the easy way out by having Bob make a sudden and dramatic recovery.  The healer is essentially just a vehicle to move us into Bob's personal history and conflicts with his siblings and brother and is extremely well done.  This is a superbly acted film.  This film stars Nichole Kidman before she made Nichole Kidman films and a very versitile Michael Keaton, who was coming off of the Batman series.  Their strong performances are buttressed by supporting roles from Bradley Whitford (The West Wing), Queen Latifah (Chicago), Michael Constantine (My Big Fat Greek Wedding), Richard Schiff (The West Wing) and Rebecca Schull (Wings).  It is an extremely deep cast.  This is an emotional film and is, at the end of the day, about someone with cancer, so be prepared to be crying by the end.  However, instead of being two hours of tension, the film is crafted so that after a particularly dramatic sequence you have a section that includes some humor, mostly involving Bob's guidance to his son.  Because the end, when it comes, is not totally unexpected, you don't finish the film feeling drained; instead, the ultimate message behind the plot is one of hope and redemption.  Overall, the film is excellent if you like drama - if you are looking for a popcorn film, this may not be for you.  Sadly, there are very few extras on the DVD.  However, if you want to see a well-acted, well-written, well-acted and mostly serious film, you can do far worse than My Life 
 I think that Rick Springfield is one of the best singers in the whole world.His records are great to listen to 
 This movie is excellent. Based on the subject matter(which is of a violent nature) it's certainly not for everyone, but I certainly believe it to be one of Al Pacinos finest performances and it is a classic as far as crime movies are concerned. I have waited a long time to purchase this DVD because I knew it would eventually be given the "royal" treatment, and I am happy to say that I was not dissappointed. The video transfer is very good and the audio upgrade is excellent. The DVD also has many extra features, although the counting of the F word feature was not necessary and actually detracts from the classic quality of this DVD. Otherwise I am very happy indeed. 
 I have used Riedel glasses for a while.  I ordered from Amazon because of the good prices.  Riedel stems are easily broken in our household. (Best to hand wash but I put them in the dishwasher :-() They are worth it, however!  A friend recently commented that she loves to have wine at my house because of the glasses I use.  They feel good.  Wine is an experience that you need to have with Reidel glasses.  
 There is no doubting the great quality of Celine Dion's voice.  She also has the ability to pick the right songs that suit her inimitable style.  This album is well mastered and the sound quality is quite good.  She even does duets with acts as diverse as the Bee Gees and Pavarotti but the big international love song from the Titanic is here which I suppose alone would be responsible for selling truckloads of this cd.  A competent, feelgood disc, nothing to shout about but nothing to sneeze at as well.  If you are a Celine fan, then you will enjoy this 
 I gotta be honest this was one of the most entertaining books on the topic I have ever read.  It is well written and gripping.  You will not be dissappointed in this book.  Not to mention it reminds us of arguably one of the greatest tragedies as well as accomplishments of the U.S. Arm 
 I always appreciate a translation of the Tao Te Ching by a native speaker of Chinese who is also fluent in English. John C.H. Wu is just that and is one of my recommended translators for friends choosing a Tao Te Ching. Wu gives the Chinese text adjacent to each chapter in English, and a translation that Thomas Merton calls superb. I must agree with Merton. Chinese idoms and the nuances of the language are familiar territory to the translator here and this becomes obvious in his very readable and clear translation 
 This collection of essays is a goldmine for the student of Ancient philosophy, indeed for all students of either Classics or Philosophy.  Here you will find important essays on the ancient sceptics, Epicurus, and the Stoics by one of the world's leading authorities on Hellenistic philosophy.  As Strikes explains in the preface, no work of Hellenistic philosophy survives intact today. Our sources are mere fragments in addition to the reports of later writers. For this reason, there is more guesswork involved in reconstructing the theories of the Hellenistic philosophers than for example interpreting Plato (whose works have all survived as far as we know). And this guesswork, Striker explains, will force the scholar of Hellenistic philosophy to treat the philosophers not in isolation from their social, political or literary context.  Nevertheless, the essays in this book are written by a philosopher as philosophy. They focus on philosophical theories and the arguments of the philosophers. But, moreover, as Striker axplains, they also discuss "the merits and weaknesses of the Hellenistic theories". While sensitive to the literary and social context of Hellenistic philosophy, Striker attempts "to find the most plausible or coherent way of fitting them together" from the point of view of a modern philosoper. This is a work of philosophy as well as being a work on philosophy.  This is scholarship on Ancient philosophy at its finest, erudite and meticulous but not lacking in philosophical rigour and depth in the least. A veritable treasure 
 This is one of my greatest knitting aquisitions of the past 5 years as a wonderfully inspirational resource for a beautiful array of colorful fair isle style sweaters and more. And just as her mother did before her, Meg has carried on the tradition of providing comprehensive, easy-to-understand patterns that challenge the more advanced knitter, but the clearly written instructions make it a perfect book for the intermediate knitter to take the next step. Additionally, the photography of the Wisconsin landscapes that surround the knitting camp were definitely a treat for the eyes.  Thanks again for such a wonderful knitting resource 
 This is a great book. It contains many continuous line shapes you can follow and has great photo examples.  I highly recommend it and will refer to it often.  As a total beginner never having quilted anything by machine I recommend you also purchase Diane Gaudynski's Guide to Machine Quilting.  Diane's book gave me more confidence to attempt machine quilting and shows more beginner style techniques.  Now I can move on to the excellent continuous line sewing taught in Show me how to Machine Quilt 
 Strange the way the book is written around Steve meeting a few F-1 fans in an airport. Nice reading but I miss illustrations 
 This was definitley one of the best books that I have ever read! I really not a "GOD" person, and I surprised that I even picked up the book in the first place, but I am so glad I did. If I hadn't, I would have  missed one of the very best books I have ever read. The whole story is  amazing, and I just loved it. I couldn't put it down, it was so good. And I  am not lying, I really loved this book. I had a few questions after I read  it, but every good book does that to you. The setting and Charity were  perfect, and it is the ideal thing that everyone loves. Adrianne was what  the town needed to bring out what they thought about people and things  about God. I would recommended this book to anyone, religoius or not 
 I was a big fan of this series when it first aired in the 80's. Like almost all of the fans I supported the effort to bring it back to life.  Now twenty years later and purchasing all of the DVD sets, I can only say again that I'm sorry to see that it's over.  For those who haven't seen the show, season four continued the excellent plot lines and easy banter between the stars.  The truncated season five was made up of three two-part episodes.  I could have done without the Roselli character put in as a rival love interest for Laura.  This may have influenced my rating of this set, but you aren't allowed half star rating so I went with the five star rating.  They did however bring a conclusion to the series and that is what's important.  Now I can pull out the season one DVDs and start watching all over again.  Highly recommended for season four.  Season five is a reserved recommendation but since they are packaged together you don't have a choice.  I just had an additional thought.  Since all the stars are still alive, I'd like to see a 2 hour made for television movie that takes place 20+ years later.  Maybe with the children grown and ready to take over Remington Steele Investigations 
 Christopher Marlowe, the Elizabethan poet and playwright, was one of the most talented members of his generation. He helped pioneer the use of blank verse in dramatic poetry and used it to produce five masterpieces while William Shakespeare--who was only two months younger than Marlowe--was still finding his dramatic footing. Who can say how great he might have become if he were not cut down (possibly on orders of the Queen, herself) at the age of 29.  As a man, Marlowe was the "unShakespeare". Where Shakespeare was a prudent man who invested his money wisely and was careful not to offend authority, Marlowe was a risk-taker both in his personal life and in his plays. In an age where not toeing the official ine was punishable by death, Marlowe never met a line he was not tempted to cross. If this is what got him killed, it also makes him a fascinating person to read about.  David Riggs weaves Marlowe's personal tragedy into an exciting volume that I found as hard to put down as any thriller. It is a book I can heartily recomend 
 This 2-CD set is a collection of some of Salsoul Records' classic tracks, all in their full-length versions.  While many songs here may be familiar to those who heard them in the clubs, there are also some tunes that became radio hits ("I Got My Mind Made Up"-Instant Funk, e.g.).  The wide variety of sounds found on this set (spanning roughly from 1975 to 1983), is just mesmerizing.  Some tunes are ultimate workout numbers:  Loleatta Holloway's "Dreamin'", "Love Sensation" and "Hit And Run", Double Exposure's "Ten Percent", and Ripple's "The Beat Goes On".  There are two Shep Pettibone remixes from 1983 of previously released records:  "Let No Man Put Asunder" (originally recorded by First Choice in 1977) and "Oooh I Love It (Love Break)", a reworking of Salsoul Orchestra's 1975 LP cut "Chicago Bus Stop".  Famed Paradise Garage d.j. Larry Levan's "Garage" version of Inner Life's "Ain't No Mountain High Enough" clocks in at 10:27.   For those who have just become acquainted with the music of this excellent record label, this 2-disc set is worth every penny!!  Other fine cuts from this collection include First Choice's "Love Thang" (1979), Aurra's "Checking You Out" (1982), Inner Life's "Moment Of My Life" (also from 1982), and Skyy's "Call Me" (1981) 
 Please, please don't tell any of my friends that I really like Blue Barron and his "Music of Yesterday and Today - Styled the Blue Barron Way". This is stuff a real Big Band fan should'nt like, but boy if I don't listen to this a lot! You know Big Bands swing and shout with tons of brass, but not Blue..its simple and soft with just a little sway to it. Similar to Kay Kyser and Sammy Kaye in style. It's just so, how do you put it? It's just so very, very nice and sometimes thats all you want in music. God Bless you Blue Barron and don't ever go changing 
 This book is a work to savor, rich with stories, lore, wisdom, e.g., the tale of Grand-Uncle Three and his coffin, the man who put rat's meat in egg noodle soup (ugh!), the description of Ms. Tham's bossy paternal grandmother, the author's coming to terms with the death of her younger sister (Jadegreen Plumblossom) and father, and so much more.  I wasn't left at a distance by the fact that the memoirs are about a girl growing up (i.e., would there be something that I as a male could relate to there?) because Ms. Tham captured so much that is universal.  If she or the book were more akin to the Princess Nohran or Fadzillah whom she described in it (Ms. Tham was, at one point when she lived in Malaysia, a tutor in English and Mathematics to princesses in a royal family), i.e., bubbling over with fascination regarding the merits of Revlon versus Elizabeth Arden skin-care cosmetics, that would have been a turn-off.  But not the beautiful rendering of the past that deals with family, love, marriage, death, mythology, and art that is in evidence throughout the memoirs 
 I first discovered UB-40 in 1981 well before they reached their fame. This album is by far their best effort ever, done before they became "educated" in music and started all of their cover versions of  other peoples songs. I remember introducing the music of UB-40 to many,  many people, and to this day, this album ranks among the top 10 of all time  for all of us that came from the early 80's cutting edge generation of  music 
 The classic pirate tale by Stevenson, "Treasure Island" has been retold in various forms for the last 100 years.  And there is a good reason why this story has been kept alive, as it is a classic adventure tale and a coming-of-age tale.  It is geared toward a younger audience, but a reader of any age should find this tale entertaining and an easy read.  Throughout the book, the unlikely hero of Jim Hawkins emerges.  He is first introduced aa a fearful young boy, who runs to his mother in the face of intruders to their seaside inn.  However, Jim quickly matures as cabin-boy of the treasure-seeking ship, and he soon realizes his full potential as a young hero.  Although he may be impulsive, his actions help to defeat the pirates.  Indeed, Jim shows his bravery and intelligence as he attempts to capture the ship away from the mutineers single-handedly.  Certainly an overriding theme is that of greed and desire.  The nobleman Trelawney becomes giddy and gleeful when he hears of a possible treasure and quickly procures a ship and crew.  The pirates, or "gentlemen of fortune", lead their whole lives whose sole purpose is the pursuit of wealth by whatever means necessary.  Indeed, it is this greed and burning desire for gold that eventually leads to their downfall.    Overall, this is a great adventure tale that appeals to readers of all ages 
 A clean and accurate book filled with great color pictures and illustrations.  Scotts is a good lawn company and it shows in this educational book.  I was able to analyze my grass type and disorders with this book quite easily 
 If like me you believe that Christology is at the epicenter of the study of Christian theology, then you cannot do better than Rausch's book as an excellent introduction to this always fascinating subject. Rausch touches all the important topics, from his well-written explanation of the three quests for the historical Jesus to his explanation of the Jesus movement and beyond. The helpful glossary in the book gives straightforward definitions of theological terms such as "eschatology" and "soteriology," a great help for those just beginning to delve into a structured study of Christ.  Rausch is a Jesuit priest. I had the benefit of Jesuit education in both high school and college, and I couldn't help thinking while reading the book that Rausch must be a great teacher, as so many of my Jesuit teachers were, and I admit to being a bit envious of the students fortunate enough to have Rausch as a teacher now. Despite his Catholic pedigree, however, Rausch never favors Catholic interpretation or Catholic biblical scholars over Protestant and Jewish interpretation and scholars. He gives a fair, balanced, and comprehensive survey of Christology, and if he didn't have "S.J." (i.e., Society of Jesus) after his name, the reader would be hard pressed to know that a Catholic priest had authored the book.   In addition to the excellent writing and the logical organization of the book, Rausch provides well chosen cites to his sources. He doesn't overdo the citations--something that can often numb the eyes and stunt the flow of a scholarly text--instead, as one newsprint reviewer of the book has said, Rausch makes the reader eager to explore the sources as the next level of inquiry into Christology.     While the question "Who is Jesus?" can never be answered with certainty or in full, Rausch has provided a very worthwhile introduction to Christology and a very helpful overview of the state of current thought about the subject. Even the seasoned student of theology will know more about Christ after reading this book than he or she knew before.               
 Did not have a single problem with this item.  Came well packed and wrapped.  No complaints 
 IN AN ATTEMPT TO CATCH A SERIAL KILLER [VAN DAMME], THE POLICE CLONE THE SERIAL KILLER [THE CLONE IS ALSO PLAYED BY VAN DAMME]. HMM, THIS IS DEFINITELY A FIRST. NOT ONLY DOES VAN DAMME PLAY THE USUAL HERO, BUT HE ALSO PLAYS THE VILLAIN. VAN DAMME ACTUALLY MAKES A VERY INTRIGUING BAD GUY. THIS MOVIE IS DEFINITELY A HIGH STEP UP FROM MOVIES LIKE ''DESERT HEAT'' AND ''LEGIONNAIRE''. GOOD ACTION SEQUENCES AND A CLEVER PLOT. VAN DAMME SHOULD PLAY A VILLAIN MORE OFTEN. THIS SHOULD BE A TREAT FOR ACTION FANS AND VAN DAMME FANS ALIKE. ACTUALLY ONE OF VAN DAMME'S BEST MOVIES 
 In short, this is by far the best epic novel I've ever read.  Having read all that James Clavell has written, this novel by Christopher New, in the same flavor of Clavell's Asian epics, actually exceeds Clavell's offerings in taste and flow of the narrative.  I am a great fan of Clavell and I thought nothing could exceed "Tai Pan" for depth of character development and suspense.  Then I read Shanghai 
 This album,is "Sweet" at their best,all the way from "Little Willy" to their soon to be released "Teenage rampage".It includes their only number one hit,"Blockbuster" and includes the song that has since become their anthem,the classy chinn-chapman compilation,"The Ballroom Blitz".It is unlike any other live album,because the songs sound almost  the same as the studio.Moreso it shows the group at their personal best!!! 
 This book works on 2 levels. First it is a beautiful coffee table book with lots of rare and beautiful pictures of the band. But that's not what is the most appealing to me. The text is a remarkable telling of U2's story by the band members themselves. I was surprised at how open and candid these guys are here. They talk freely and openly about relationships, motivations, spirituality - everything. They are very candid - completely unguarded about their lack of musical ability early in their career, and also some of the failings of their recorded work. I got a sense that these guys are real people with integrity. Frankly I'm amazed, that with the popularity of U2, that this book is not talked about more. This is the definitive biography of the band 
 This short work telling of the death of a child in the Shoah, and the subsequent life- destroying effect on the mother of the child is a disturbing and moving one. The symbolic 'shawl'  connects the two parts of the work. It had helped keep baby Magda alive in a concentration camp, , and fifty years later the Mother Rosa holds on to as if it contained within it the life of her dead baby. Ozick's writing is brilliant especially in her depiction of the aging survivors in Miami. A note of hope enters in the figure of an elderly suitor Persky who attempts to woo Rosa back to a life of her own. But as Ozick makes painfully clear the message of Rosa's life is that what has been most loved in the past is far more real than any present or future can be.  
 She's as tough as nails, a real smart cookie and she's taking on the Chicago crime scene.  Her name is V.(ictoria) I.(phigenia) Warshawski, a  contemporary private eye investigating white-collar corruption in the  heartland of America.  Sara Pareksky has created a female character in her  series of books that can rival Mickey Spillane or Mike Hammer in her  toughness and wisecracking.  Indemnity Only is the first V. I. Warshawski  novel written by Pareksky.  In this novel she finds herself employed by her  client to find his son's missing girlfriend and instead finds the son,and  he's dead. Soon she finds herself embroiled with union leaders, mob  killings and insurance fraud, as well as continuing her hunt for the young  woman whose life may be in jeopardy.  This is a novel that will hold the  interest of those of us from the babyboomer generation as we relate to  Warshawkski's return to her college alma mater. Read this novel for a great  introduction to V. I. Warshawski 
    Dylan's best songs are brilliant and immortal. Right now he's a grizzled old veteran on the music scene with his best work long behind him, but his concert albums are like windows into a mythical and emotional landscape that has a unique, haunting beauty.    It's hard to believe that just a few years ago these songs didn't exist and that a guy from Minnesota who's younger than my father wrote them in upstate New York in 1970.. I'm not religious but Bob Dylan feels like a spiritual presence of the highest order.    Many have written that the arrangements here are too baroque and 'Vegassy' - they're and broad and overdramatic, etc.         O.K.. So it's an acquired taste. For people who like late Elvis and Journey and broadway shows - Dylan is playing here to the masses.  It's not a high-brow easthetic, but I find it very powerful and moving and these versions add depth to the Dylan musical canon.   This album has him as the touring road-warrior with a full, rich entourage at the height of his powers.  The singing is passionate and expressive and Bob appears happy and upbeat.  This captures a time and place and style perfectly. It may be a better concert than any he's performed in the last 20 years. Don't miss it 
 A wonderful CD. I'm replacing most of my old LP's. Amazon is the best place in the  world to find stuff. The Brothers Four make beautiful music with terrific harmony 
 I love this album soooo much...I thought he blew me away w/ the first one..."Can't let go" has been my ringtone since I first heard it...Everytime I play his CD's, it's like I'm just listening to them for the first time...All his songs just hit me a different way each time I hear them...Soulife was also a good Album, but it doesn't get the same heavy rotation like the other 2...I went to see him in concert at the Beacon Theatre in May 2006, I was horse for 3 weeks...I sang and danced and enjoyed myself...He gives such a splendid performance and when he sings live, he sounds just like him albums or even better...I am so looking forward to the next album and the one after that and so on...Keep doing your thing Anthony...BIGGEST FAN EVA!! 
 Bill Buford's mid-life crisis is our gift. Unleashed from his day job at a desk at the New Yorker, where he was the unsung fiction editor for years (I actually spoke to him once; he was very nice when he rejected my short story), Buford has come into his own, as well as his own voice,  and found his passion, his true calling. HEAT is delicious from start to finish, and I was very sad (and hungry) when it did.  Only a couple of nits to pick: I would have liked to have heard a bit more about his personal life and the logistics. To wit, how could he afford to not work for so long? He mentions his wife's fancy (well-paying) magazine job. But is that really enough to support a whole family (they have two sons) living in one of the most expensive cities in the world, Manhattan? Also, what about his kids? If I recall correctly, they are never mentioned in the manuscript, not one time. That's a curious omission. What toll did Buford's food fancies take on la familia? I think exploring that aspect of following one's bliss would have really helped to ground and improve the book and, as Dr. Phil would say, keep it real. As real as all those four-legged creatures Buford learned how to expertly butcher. Doing one thing means giving up another. What sacrifices did Buford and the Buford family have to make to enable his numerous international sojourns? It was obviously worth it, and Buford never really lost his old day job. He now writes for the New Yorker. Not many of us have that kind of job security. All in all, nicely done, Bill.      
   or  at  least  decades,  that  Greek  guy  that  was   slated  for  Wakeman's  section  of  the  stage did  an   RCA  records  soloist-gig. Then,  this  recording  was   released.    Then,  not  selling  as  much  as  RUMOURS  or  BOSTON,   it  got  shoved  back  into  the  cut-racks. THEN, it    was  reworked  into  THE  OMEN  soundtrack.   And  it  literally  took ' CHARIOTS... '  to regenerate   this  delightful  piano-dude  into  the  top  forty.      In  time,  it  was  upgraded  to  classic-status; this   disc  is  worth  75  'Wish You Were  Here'(s) 
 If you have "Underachievers Please Try Harder"--because it enjoyed a wider release, many people get this album first--then you'll find much to love on "Biggest Bluest Hi-Fi." Much of the same breathy, mellow melodies from "Underachievers" are here, but so are more intricate songs with inventive rhythms and textures. This is a solid album; I count it as one of my favorites 
 To this day, this is *still* the best movie I've seen the Rock star in.  I share the opinion that the Rock never should have left wrestling, but seeing a remake of an old 1973 classic titled 'Walking Tall' helps me see that the Rock is a decent movie star after all.  Walking Tall is a movie that won't make you particularly happy after it's over, or make you think you wasted your time.  It's just a movie that's above average, with good, memorable action segments.  The Rock is pretty convincing in his roll but the biggest problem with the film is that it's WAY too short and actually feels rushed during certain spots (like for instance, when the Rock becomes the sheriff- there should have been more build-up here instead of him suddenly "being the sheriff").    I'm not really complaining.  I enjoyed the film.  Just a very short film, that's all.  
 Ever noticed that God is invisible?   Philip Yancy in his typical "I'm on this journey too" style talks about what it is really like to be in relationship with God. He likens it to real life relationships, with Parents, Children and other adult friends. There are times of closeness and times things people feel more distant. Times for us to learn and grow up, and times when we help others grow.   The thing I like most of about the book is his emphasis of "keeping it real". Many people feel their faith, and relationship with God is inadequate or substandard. But really it is quite normal, and part of having a relationship with and invisible God 
 As a digital photographer myself, I found Julieanne's book quite remarkable as a unique project born from a fresh look at the beauty around us that we often take for granted during the normal humdrum of our lives. Seeing something unique within our common surroundings and applying some simple tools results in both art and a realized vision. She provides the reader valuable information about her visualization process and actual image process. This work is one that I will visit from time to time...both for relaxation and new ideas. She gets the creative juices flowing. Highly recommended 
 the book is a great way to sum up the late great Tupac Amaru Shakur. the book is one of the best books i've ever read. it shows you (the reader) how Tupac was not only a rapper but also a poet, artist, and an all around influence on any community. i have always been a Tupac fan but this book bought me closer to him. i can relate to his life's struggle because i've been there and just knowing that i'm not alone makes me feel better.          long live the greatest       love    Baby 
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It helped me gain a deeper and more accurate understanding of the principles embodied in the U.S. constitution, the nature of American politics, and the structure of American government, both state and federal, as well as the relationship between the federal government and the states. It's a must-read for any serious student of American history, government, and politics 
 Having been raised on doo wop and the Beatles.... what a joy to find this album at this stage of my life An absoulutely wonderful piece and it is great for workouts at the gym 
 I really shouldn't be giving stars to my own book, but it seems to be a requirement here.  Two clarifications:  1.  It is true that I don't engage Dave Chalmers views in the book.   Dave's book appeared about 5 years after mine. 2.  The title *Consciousness Reconsidered* has understandably led some to think that it is primarily a response to Dennett's *Consciousness Explained.*  It isn't, altho. I do engage some of Dan's arguments.  My book was published soon after Dan's & most of my issues w/Dan relate to papers (alto. along w/Ned Block, I discussed Dan's forthcoming book w/him and others on a regular basis.  But responding to and/or offering an alternative view to Dennett was not my aim.  In fact my view on *consciousness* was sketched out in the long new chapter in *The Science of the Mind* published in 1991 
  I first heard "So Come Back, I am Waiting" when I was listening to KEXP.org (a fantastic Seattle radio station) and I didn't pay too much attention to it until I thought I heard the word "Abecedarians". Now, I already feel like I'm one of, hmmm, maybe 1000 people who have some idea of what that word means (a derogatory name for a group of early Protestants who denied all human knowledge, including speech) and was amazed it'd be in a song shortly following the word "wisteria" in a gorgeous, tense epic about a serial killer.   I couldn't get the song out of my head, so the next day I bought the album and, seven months later, I'm still listening to it and still discovering new ideas, themes and lyrics.  
 In 2004 a President who lied to justify an unpopular war and had the worst jobs record since the Depression still managed to win.  The Republicans control all three branches of government and a majority of governorships and state legislatures.  The national debate has shifted from real problems to distractions like gay marriage, partial-birth abortion, and flag-burning.  Waldman believes this all adds up to a need for progressives to change.  Waldman believes progressives should create a single movement (not remain a collection of interest groups) devoted to fighting conservatism and advancing a progressive view.  Ask an ordinary person what conservatives stand for and he'll likely respond with four powerful, easily understood ideas - low taxes, small government, strong defense, and traditional values.  Ask him what liberals stand for and chances are he'll give you the obverse.  Conservatives focus on emotions and the character of the speaker; liberals on logic and facts.  (A good point - look at most advertising in the U.S.!)  A majority of Americans favor legal abortion, gun control universal healthcare, strong environmental protections, generous Social Security and Medicare benefits.  Yet, they are stymied.  Part of conservatives' secret is their institutions (eg. American Enterprise Institute, Heritage Foundation, Hoover Institute) are multi-issue and make political use of their products easy (eg. recording studios are available for interviews).  Liberals, on the other hand, have single-issue organizations, poorly marketed publications, and poorly paid core staff.  Waldman points out that the South (heavy evangelical concentration) is a major problem for progressives; the problem is acerbated by Republicans use of racism (Reagan - welfare queens, Bush I - Willie Horton, Bush II - going to Bob Jones University with its ban on inter-racial dating, and avoiding a position on the Confederate Flag).  Suggests progressives point out Dobson et al don't follow their own teaching regarding the poor, the GOP is guardian of widely unpopular status quo on healthcare (would help business as well), refocusing the abortion debate to "How can we reduce it?" and pointing out it went down under Clinton and up under Bush, support doing away with the Electoral College in the interest of fairness, and attack the notion of "liberal elite" via the GOP's tax cuts for the rich and its healthcare positions.  Also suggests not letting Republican attacks go unanswered - eg. Kerry vs. Swift boat ads.  Defining Progressives:  "We're all in this together," vs. Conservatives' "We're all on our own and out for ourselves."  Good material 
 Love It Love It Love It!!!  This season is really funny! Alot of the episodes I have not seen in awhile.I would recommend it to anyone. My roommate and I watched the entire season in a matter of 72 hours because we just could not get enough! I am now just waiting for season 4... 
 This mix starts off heavy, and never lets up, with the quirky, yet hard hitting vocal track Grace (Anxiety) by Troy Pierce (as Louderbach) starting things off in a very energetic way.  This track worked well in Sascha Funke's Boogy Bytes 2 mix, but it was deep into the mix.  I feel it's even more effective starting a mix off.  Things quickly lighten up with the bloopy Claude VonStroke next, and then it's into the M.A.N.D.Y. remix of Tiefschwarz's excellent track Damage, featuring Tracey Thorn of Everything But The Girl on vocals.  Two solid tech house tracks follow, especially Touane's snappy track Bassic, and it's right into the gritty, churning, techno sound of Thomas Schumacher's incredible track Rotor.  The mix then hits a very slight snag in track 7, which I feel is one of only two so-so parts of the mix.  It's not bad, it's just a little too light and bubbly tech house for my liking.  It's quickly forgotten as the mix races through with 4 solid tracks in a row, and right after the melodic Freefall, it's into Tiefschwarz's own remix of a Depeche Mode track.  This is the only other slight miss in the mix for me, as I feel the track was a tad too long at nearly 7 minutes, and could have been trimmed to better fit the flow of the mix.  Another solid melodic track is next, and we end with the dubbed out vocals of Kate Wax.  Overall, it's an exciting tech house mix that's a full lineup of solid tracks, with not a bad one in sight, and very few dips in the scorching pace of one, very sound, top to bottom mix.  Do not miss picking this one up, as it's easily in the top 5 techno/tech house mixes this year 
 The common theme of each of the four stories that make up Stephen King's 1982 book "Different Seasons" is the call of the storyteller, an understandable preoccupation for someone who was by then the most popular storyteller on earth. Rather than merely taking a bow, "Different Seasons" stands as perhaps King's finest hour; certainly his most compelling case for being taken seriously.  Stephen King's growing legion of fans may have had cause for worry as the newly-christened "Master Of Horror" began the 1980s. "Firestarter" and "Cujo," published in 1980 and 1981 respectively, sold well but were well beneath King's standards. The former novel even served as the basis of a devastatingly funny National Lampoon spoof, "Eggbeater." Horror stories are nice, but can one make a living from them without parodying yourself?  King asks this himself in the afterword of "Different Seasons," and it may be the basis for the most problematic of "Seasons'" four stories, "The Breathing Method," a tale so over the top in Grand Guignol it may have been King's way of mocking the expectations of his audience (and, as he suggests in the afterword, his then-editor). The other three stories are not only classics as different from each other as can be imagined, but together as far away from supernatural horror as anything King tried to that time.  The first, "Rita Hayworth And The Shawshank Redemption," presents the story as a conduit for communicating the preciousness of hope. An unjustly-imprisoned man uses his imagination to find a way out of Shawshank State Prison. Made into a film today about as highly regarded as any film ever made, King's tale here is a thing of awe, no less for being the third best story in the book.  "The Body" was also made into a highly regarded movie, "Stand By Me," but as great as that film is, it really comes alive on the page. Here the storyteller is seen as a different kind of escape artist, a boy clearly modeled on King himself who makes up stories for himself and his friends as a way of escaping a humdrum life in the Maine backcountry at the dawn of the 1960s. Captivating by itself, it is serves to set up a story about a search for a dead body that brilliantly encompasses the lost innocence of youth.  Finally, there is "Apt Pupil," probably one of the most horror-filled stories in King's corpus, and a meditation on the dark side of storytelling as a seemingly-normal California boy blackmails an ex-Nazi death-camp commandant hiding in his neighborhood into telling stories that feed the boy's evil imagination. King's mastery of narrative has never been so complete, and his way of negotiating what one Nazi hunter here calls "the catacombs of the imagination" is painfully on target, as events in Colorado later proved.  Even "Breathing Method" brings up storytelling in the form of a framing device, old men gathered at a Manhattan brownstone to tell stories and read strange books like "Twenty Cases Of Dismemberment And Their Outcomes Under British Law." There's a menacing quality to the brownstone itself, and its strange keeper, perhaps King's way of discussing his own imagination as somehow alien to himself.  Whatever the subtext, you will have plenty to chew on with the text alone. It's hard to imagine the power of storytelling put on better view than in the pages of "Different Seasons," or a stronger case for the wide-ranging nature of King's singular talent. Read and marvel 
 These shoes look dressy enough for business wear, but are extremely comfortable and easy to wear 
 I expected this to be dry and mechanical like lots of other math texts - too-technical proofs, homework questions irrelevant to the material, insufficient explanations for why things are the way they are. This book really surprised me because it wasn't "mathy" at all. It doesn't just throw proofs at you expecting you to wade thru page upon page of math notation until you understand - it gives you the intuitive side of important concepts, which means you only need common sense, not an intensive mathematical background to get everything. The examples they picked simplify rather than confuse the concepts. Each easily and naturally leads to the next. If there's anything not thoroughly elaborated, they were sure to cover it in the homework questions, by gently prodding the reader along towards the answer step by step instead of smacking them in the face with impossible problems. Homework questions supplement the material perfectly and basically leave you with a full and well-rounded impression of what the concepts mean as well as when and why to use them, not just how to plug numbers into some formula. If anything, I'd say this book errs on the side of caution in that in some sections it could pick up the pace a little. But then again, you could always just skip the easier parts 
 I highly doubt this group could have any imitators. It's like nothing I've ever experienced before - delicious, dreamy, smooth and elegant. If you're with your special someone one day just pop this in and see what happens! Wow. This is more than a makeout album however. The songs are brilliantly constructed and the vocals are supreme. I love the song "Back". It has samples of Sylvia Plath reading her own poetry. How cool is that?? Plus the male singer could make anyone melt into a puddle of lovely, groovey water. The song "Slim" has sounds and vocals that remind me of Portishead, but I hate to liken it to anything. Alpha are an original. I can't wait to get The Impossible Thrill 
 Very useful book for both health personel and public. Very useful exercise tips for improvement of sexual functio 
 This is a wonderful "snapshot" of the most talented under appreciated great southern rock band of the 70's. These guys had it all and if you were lucky enough to see them "LIVE" you know what true southern rock is all about. The only sad thing about this collection is they didn't include two of Hughie Thomasson's best songs. (Angels Hide from Ghostriders & Just For You from Lady in Waiting). Enjoy & keep hopin Hughie will get finished with Skynyrd & crank up The Outlaws once more 
 My sister got this for her 6th birthday and she likes Polly pocket. She loved putting on the stickers but setting up the car wash was a bit hard for her. I had to do it. We also had trouble with the front bumper going onto the car but we still had fun "pimping out" Polly's car. 
 These Literature units have allowed me to incorporate a series of Lit circles into my classroom.  In the past trying to work up materials for a new novel took so much time that I rarely attempted more than one a semester.  This year, with the help of these plans, I was able to have my students reading a novel of their choosing as part of small group work.  The vocabulary exercises use quotes from the literature, and they are excellent examples of the novel.  The study guides focus on exactly the parts of the novels that I want my students investigating.  You can't go wrong with this purchase 
 The Sharpest Sight by Louis Owens is a mystery, a police procedural, a thriller, an exploration of identity, and magical realism all rolled up into one excellent novel.  Sharpest Sight takes place in a [lightly fictionalized] Salinas Valley, California sometime near the end of the Vietnam War.  Attis McCurtain, Vietnam vet and insane killer, has escaped from the state hospital and may or may not be dead.  Mundo Morales, who is Mexican-American, Catholic, a Vietnam vet, a sheriff's deputy, and an old friend of Attis', and Cole McCurtain, who is Choctaw-Irish-American, and Attis' younger brother, must each try and unravel the mystery of Attis' disappearance.  Mundo is aided by his duty to his buddy, his duty to his position in law enforcement, his love of his wife and child, and the ghost of his grandfather.  Cole gets help from his dad Hoey, his Uncle Luther, a Choctaw elder and shaman, Old Lady Blue Wood, another elder and shaman, and his duty to his brother.  The local crazed bartender, a twitchy Vietnam vet FBI agent, and the family of the girl Attis killed also play a major role.  As the flooded river recedes towards dry river bed, all the characters converge towards a solution to the mystery and in some cases, a greater understanding of self.  Potential readers unable to suspend disbelief in order to deal with ghostly grandfathers and magical Choctaw dirty tricks shouldn't even try to wade into this novel.  For all others, I recommend that you dive into The Sharpest Sight and see where the flow takes you 
 Castells trilogy, The Information Age, was written in the late 20th century but it is really the first sociology classic of the 21st and, as such, comparable to the masterworks of Durkheim and Weber. The first  audacious volume chronicled the rise of a new global order based on a  network of information flows. Since Castells views the human species as  essentially predatory, some remedial measures are needed to resist the  injustices that will arise. This second volume is therefore prescriptive. A  masterly presentation of the world's current social movements follows. The  author's discussion of the affect of the internet on political action and  political campaigns is especially useful. Despite the volatile subject  matter, I thought that Castells never quite sacrificed his objectivity  although a delicate balancing act does take place throughout the volume.  This book and the previous one sometimes read like some great epic of  science fiction but it is our own very real world in the 21st century that  the author is discussing. As an introduction to our brave new planet, this  book could hardly be bettered 
 This book is a terrific resource for those who want to learn more about Ma  Rainey and the Classic Blues.  Well told, comprehensive biography of an  eccentric, controversial singer.  Filled with anecdotes and  well-researched, I recommend this book highly 
 This is a handy desk guide to statistics for someone who needs a statistical referemce as part of their job but is not a statistician, ie, performance management, data preparation or other information analysis.  I compared this book to many others and found it the most comprehensive 
 anybody who knows me knows that The Elements are My All-Time Favorite Group.always glad to see them Live.but my knocks are Missing Maurice White,because it's hard for me seeing the Group without it's leader.Philip Bailey held things down but still Maurice was Needed.the Band while Still Quite Good didn't move me like the 70's Version.if you caught EWF at the Rock&Roll Hall of Fame Show then you know what I Mean.the 70's Band Ripped the Hall Show up.and lastly I didn't care for the EWF Dancers.seems kinda trendy&out of place to me. but having said all of that they still are a Must see Band&they haven't lost a step.they still bring so much pure delight to my ears 
 I heard Skye's music back in 2004 when her album had just come out. Only, they didnt release her album in my country. So i heard her music through 30 second online samples. It was then that i decided that i wanted her entire album. So somehow, i managed to get it. And i instantly loved it.  Skye's songs are catchy and fun. Some songs have really silly lyrics like "You and your friends are dense/you dont make any sense". But there are others that are much more deep - "Bottled up is where my fears go/I will never show my fear/they'll tear me up until my tears show/smoke and mirrors"  Her best songs include "Billy S", "I Dont Care", "Tangled Up In Me" and "Fallen Through". But every song on the album has something to offer.  I've said this in another review - I dont usually give an album 5 stars. This, however, deserves it 
 I'm in the process of getting my hands on Living Poor, but also highly recommend Thomsen's book "The Farm on the River of Emeralds."  Where 'Living Poor' sounds like it has more of an ex-pat spin on it, "The Farm" focuses more on his on personal experiences, observations, and self-questioning in running a farm with his Ecuadorian business partner, Ramon.  Very interesting 
 This movie has brought me and my nine year old son closer together.  In fact, after watching it together just five times, we will be Amigo's forever.  He likes the one liners... "Do you have anything besides Mexican food?"  I like the visuals; The dirty, dusty faces south of the border compared to the Amigos in their clean flashy costumes.It is stunning.  He likes the singing bush.  I like "Blue Shadows."   The next day I asked my boy if he liked the dinner I cooked.  He said it would have been better with a "light chicken gravy."  It is the only movie I have ever seen that makes me bust out laughing when I'm just thinking about it.  Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, and Martin Short....  "I like these guys.  They are funny guys! 
 This book is written with great enthusiasm and deep knowledge on the subject. This is a great source for every teacher. Being an experienced teacher I find this book very helpful in my everyday work.  Milla Hill, middle school teacher. 
 This book rather nicely covers What sharpening is, why it is needed, and how to do it.  Whats nice about this book it it breaks up the types of sharpening needed based on the the photos and the type of details in the photo.  It cover raw pre-sharpening to conteract the softening introduced by a digital camera, and then goes on to suggest detail sharpening and then final output sharpening 
 Gentle book, tells shy kids that they can influence the world in a positive way just by being themselves.  Also helps kids losing the energy on a chosen instrument 
 I've read all of Doctorow's work, but I keep coming back to Welcome to Hard Times. This slender volume is immense in its ambition, and focuses on elemental questions of courage and cowardice, the problem of evil, and its  almost irresistable power. Set in the Dakota Territory in the late 19th  century, the novel examines our highly sentimentalized American West  through a post-modern lens. Doctorow lays open romanticized notions to  expose the raw, ugly reality beneath. As always, Doctorow is almost poetic,  and his characters simultaneously repulsive and attractive. If you've not  read Doctorow, start here 
 Whether you are interested in this battle or merely in a good book to read on a boring day, this book I highly recomend.  
 Me And You is Kenny Chesney's third album, and a great album at that. Kenny shows us once again his romantic side on ballads like When I Close My Eyes, Me And You and more. There's also the get up and dance and sing songs like Back In My Arms Again, Back Where I Come From and more. His voice is beautiful and it harmonizes beautifully. This is a great album, I highly reccomend it 
 The book Heart of Darkness, written by Joseph Conrad is worth at least 4 stars, maybe even 4 1/2.  Conrad's native language was Polish, but this book was written in english.  This would make you think that it is confusing and hard to understand.  This book is hard to understand, but people tend to think so for all the wrong reasons.  This book is only 76 pages in length, but it is astonishing how much detail is crammed into those pages.  In order to understand this book you must be willing to read it for months and go back to previous paragraphs to understand why things happened the way they did.    Researching information about Conrad's life would also help in reading this book.  Alot of people around his in his life died of various diseases.  In this book he inflicts disease on Kurtz, who was given the disease because of having so much power and so little restraint.  The heart of darkness represents the jungle, having no mercy toward human life 
 Patricia Hill Collins exemplifies a practitioner's and theorist's point of view on black feminism as it relates to Africa American and our African sisters. She references critical and inspiring data and quotes from a varied repetoire of authors, historians, and philosophers.   The author explains the context and format of her subject upon initial reading.  This book also draws commonalities among the issues and concerns among African American women and our international sisterhood (i.e., African, Carribean, etc.,)  It illustrates the social and cultural values among all groups, the commonalities among the values while focusing on the African American feminist aspect.  This is a must read for any person, be it woman or not, African American or other.  It brings about a social and cultural understanding that is pertinent to the "holonomy" of understanding and appreciating varied cultural, social and historical values and experiences while commencing to the building of community. Please add this title to your collection of literature.  You won't be disappointed; if for nothing more than to open your world to receive another perspective 
 I bought a spare battery for my D70s and charged it up one time. Since then, I have been waiting to use my spare but the original (charged hundreds of pictures ago) has been going strong for, literally, months.  Follow the directions. Don't use it until your fully charge and don't recharge until it's run down. This will help maintain battery life.  Good product from a great company 
 Although its principal character, Mr Harding, the Warden of Barchester, suffers abject misery and extreme anxiety during most of this novel, the reader of "The Warden" will enjoy one of the happiest, richest and warmest experiences to be gained from the whole of English Literature.    Untypically short, yet three years in the making, "The Warden" has a simple structure that Trollope utlized again and again.  Take a moral dilemma of some sort, one that provides endless pros and cons to be argued, one that possibly takes many hundreds of pages to resolve, explore its social, political and financial implications, and show how it touches the lives of characters not too unlike ourselves.        The dilemma here concerns the income of Septimus Harding, the Warden of Barchester.  Under the terms of a will, dated 1434, twelve superannuated woolcarders were to be accommodated in an almshouse, receiving one shilling and fourpence per day.  A residence was to be provided for a warden who was to receive the income from the remainder of the testator's property.  Now, more than 400 years later, there seems to be an imbalance in these depositions.  The almshouse inmates continue to receive only one shilling and fourpence, while the warden, living on the proceeds of some valuable properties, receives eight hundred pounds annually and the use of the warden's house.    The dilemma faces a young Barchester surgeon, John Bold.  If he allows the imbalance to continue, the wishes of the original benefactor, he believes, are being nullified.  If he succeeds in having the warden's comfortable living discontinued, he will lose forever the possibility of making the warden's daughter his wife.   And so the issue is taken up, argued and publicized.   As Anthony Trollope reveals in his autobiography, this tiny novel was successful enough (it earned him twenty pounds) to lead him to consider writing more of the same, and he soon began "Barchester Towers".    English actor Sir Nigel Hawthorne, brilliant as Archdeacon Grantly in a memorable TV adaptation of this novel, revisits Trollope's Barchester to provide a robust, opulent, complete and unabridged reading that no Trollope enthusiast should miss hearing.     
 Our organization gives this book out in one of our classes that teaches newly promoted or new to the company supervisors how we lead teams.  We have a corporate culture where recognition is one of the key principles.  This book definitely adds value and insight 
 I think that the movie was great. Its like one of my favorites now. Sharon Stone is my favorite actress....and i think that she was great in the movie Last Dance..I dont like the color of her hair in that movie though....I  love ya Sharon.... 
 Esther de Waal has the uncanny ability to create in the reader the experiences she is writing about. In LOST IN WONDER she is writing about ways of living our lives with heightened awareness of the world around us, the presence of God in that world and in ourselves. She makes the book itself a retreat in which we enjoy a feast of poetry, reflections, prayers, and mediations drawn from a rich variety of sources. This is De Waal's most personal book, a rare treat for her many followers 
 Simply wonderful movie!  Combination of "Carmen" (the flamenco film, not the opera, and if you have never seen that, well, do), and "The Cutting Edge", with lots of hysterical satire thrown in.  Male lead not bad to watch and a very good dancer - his partner was not so skilled.  They were sort've like Torvil and Dean (of Olympics fame) on the dance floor.  This film won the Australian Oscar.  Rather formulaic plot; the dancing is the thing here 
 If you are an Eritrean and you are often at loss for words ( like me) to explain where, why, who, where and what of this small nation, say no more! Buy and give each of your audiences a copy of this book.  Michela Wrong plainly expounds the intricacies of one of the  longest  wars in Africa,  making this book to be exceptionally one of the best books ever written that comprehensibly states the Truth, The Whole Truth,  Nothing but the Truth about the smallest nation in the world. 
 Saw this book in a King Soopers and passed it by. (Not enough cash at the time.) Looked for it later when I did have the money. The book is a quite enjoyable time-waster. I hope there are more to come with these characters, because I had fun with them 
 It's truly a shame that more people aren't familiar with this album. Simply put, Roadwork has got to be one of the greatest live albums ever recorded. From the gospel-tinged "Save the Planet" to the raw blues of "Tobacco Road," this recording just grabs you right from the first song and just won't let go. In addition to being an amazing keyboard and saxophone player, Edgar Winter is an incredible vocalist. When you add the incendiary Jerry La Croix, an equally amazing vocalist, the result sends chills down your spine. For you guys who are air guitar specialists, I recommend that you check out Rick Derringer's rendition of Chuck Berry's "Back in the USA." Derringer proves beyond a doubt why he's a legend on the six string. But it's not enough just to have Rick Derringer on the scene. Edgar introduces his brother Johnny for a fiery version of "Rock & Roll Hoochie Koo."There are so many highlights on this recording that it's hard to select just one as a favorite. Certainly one of the highlights is "Tobacco Road." After you've heard Edgar Winter's White Trash work out on this cut, it's just like there's nothing more to be said. If I had to pick just one cut to represent the genius and passion of this album, I'd go with the old rhythm and blues classic "Turn on Your Love Light." Listen as the horns blast out that classic riff and then let Jerry La Croix take you on a trip where the soul of man never dies. This is rock n roll with a vengeance! Or, as Jerry exhorts the crowd at the Apollo: "If you feel like lettin' it out, hot damn, let it out. 
 Thanks book is superb.  An easy read.  Non-fiction that reads like a great novel 
 Broken Prey; Not Sandford`s best, but a very good read. He just doesn`t write the Prey Series stuff fast enough 
 I ordered this book from the library, not knowing that the author was a devout Christian.  All the more better!  My husband and I were looking for a Christian-based homeschooling guide and were more than happy to have found this book.  Some negative reviews have been posted, however, I'm here to tell you they are quite unfounded and actually insulting to the book and author.  The book is not "fundamentalist Christianity" as some reviewers have stated.  Rather, the author has used wisdom from the Bible to instruct the reader. This is a very solid, informative book.  Anyone wanting to teach their children a God-based homeschool curriculum would do well to purchase this book 
 My 11yr. old changer died just before Christmas.  There aren't too many available.  The JVC has all the features I needed.  Remote, random play etc.  Fits right in the entertainment center like the old one.  Very easy to operate and Amazon sent it to me in a few days 
 My boyfriend looked great in this jersey on Christmas day!  He loved it and it fit him perfectly.  Go Bears!!

 Ignore "Q" magazine's one-star review (surely one of the most  unfair in rock-journo/hacks-in-a-circle history; why do they often give  four to corporate medicrity or worse?) and trust mine (above). My only  complaint is the deluges of tuneless noise between tracks which can't be  CD-programmed out. Maybe tape it, editing these out 
 I found this book after getting Jorge Cruise's "3-Hour Diet" book. I wanted to add an easy workout routine to my morning that didn't take as long as a treadmill workout. This fills the bill. What I particularly like is that I don't have to decide which exercises to do in order to work some muscles and let others rest and build tissue. I also didn't have to go out and get extra equipment, since I had a pair of hand weights and that was sufficient to get me started. I may add ankle weights soon, and may need to get heavier hand weights at some point.   Following the routine in this book, and working with the 3-Hour Diet book, I feel like I'm making better weight loss and fitness progress than I did with another popular diet book.  It's true that the bulk of this work is on weights and not cardiovascular, but he does discuss power walking--it's just not part of the 8-minute morning routine.  My only dissatisfaction with this book is the author's expectation that I write in the book itself to keep track of my progress. That might work for the first month--the number of exercise routines given--but what about those of us who want to keep doing that circuit month after month? I'd rather have a stand-alone notebook to write in and track progress from one cycle to the next 
 Gary Smalley understands married men so well and I think this book is a classic on how men respond in relationships. Women can either be bitter at their husbands or work to make things better and this book gives so much  practical insights to make things better. I recommend his web site to where  their are great articles at garysmalley.com! Most women need this book 
 I liked this book so much that I wrote down every disease that was listed in the book and created a file for future reference. Whenever I give the book to a friend, relative or acquaintance this book to read I give them  the disease glossary. That way they get even more out of the book! This  author knows how to make learning exciting and interesting. Keep on writing  Mr. Null. We all need to hear more voices like yours 
 This is a Lazy Saturday Afternoon book.  You can read it front-to-back or you can just flip to random pages.  Either way, you'll find very entertaining stories (as long as you're an EE) packed with great information.  Covers everything from obscure transistor parameters to marketing.  It made me a better engineer and I enjoyed every page 
 dudley moore will make you laugh till you cry. i wish i was that funny when i was drunk 
 I relate to Lisa! I wish I had this book before my boys turned two ~~ then I would have grabbed it every chance I needed a good laugh! Now that my twin boys are almost three, I can have a good chuckle out of Lisa's stories ~~ I've been there!   This book is a slim volume of laughs, inspiration and encouragements. It's a realistic look at life of being a mom ~~ but it's not depressing. It's not a depressing look at motherhood or life with kids ~~ it's an uplifting book with the author's stories meant to let you know that you're not alone in the midst of all the messy messes that your children hands you. Lisa shares some frank stories about toddlerhood and a few stories about teenage years. She urges you to laugh at life ~~ it's all in how you look at it. =0)   If you know that someone is expecting a baby or someone is right smack in the middle of kiddie crisis ~~ I recommend you give this book for that mom. She'll sit there and laugh and cry and know that she's not alone. There are some passages on Johnson's faith ~~ but it's done in a loving way ~~ to encourage us moms to look outside of ourselves and count our miracles.   I am forever grateful for my friend who lent me her copy ~~ I actually had a chance to sit down and laugh at the absurdity of child-raising and it gave me more strength to go on another day with my lovable boys. This is one of the best gifts anyone can give to a mom!  5-15-05 
 I believe I use this particular pan at least 4 days a week if not more. It isn't too heavy nor too light (I sound like Goldilocks) it is just right for a majority of my cooking needs. Yes the exterior of the pan does tarnish easily but I found it was easy to clean and the interior can become scratched if you do not use the right tools with it. But the finer point is not so much the look but what it can produce. It conducts the heat beautifully so that the highest temp. ever needed is medium. I have made lemon curd, marinara sauces, soups and bechamels in this pan and each and everytime the results are deeply satisfying. The price is incredibly reasonable considering what you get from this pan. I absolutely adore this pan and would recommend it to everyone 
 Have owned this book fot 15 years and always enjoy comming back to it. Touches the soul and keeps the dream alive. Makes sane, supposidly professional poeple contimplate alternative lifestyles. A keeper 
 Do you (or your child) want to hug Clifford as you read about his adventures?  This plush doll (approximately 10")is the perfect addition to any Clifford collection 
 I had the good fortune of hearing Borges lecture once in 1976, several years after these Harvard lectures. The sense of being in the presence of a literary alchemist during his lecture happily is re-created through this little book. Borges' self-effacing wit and mastery of words,language, and literature are inspiring to both readers and writers who might like to rediscover the magic of the written 
 One of the best I've read on matters concerning the spiritual.  Moving, thought-provoking, powerful in its simplicity, while explaining much about the true nature of God.  Reading this book with an open heart and an open mind will bring you peace in these troubled times, which is fitting because the visionaries say Blessed Mary said she is the Queen of Peace 
 I fell for Donny Deutsch when he was featured on "The Apprentice" and I watch his TV show whenever I can - it's different, interesting, and full of energy.  And it doesn't hurt that he is a great-looking guy.  I grabbed his book as soon as I could and I enjoyed it - I didn't like putting it down. It is part autobiography and part how-to-succeed-in-business-by-being-yourself.  Of course, part of Deutsch's success is that his dad had a successful agency which the son joined in his twenties.  He did, however, build that agency into a powerhouse. In this book, he gives some great advice to businesspeople, all the while maintaining that he didn't do it all by himself.  This book is for those who are already fans of Deutsch.  He dedicates more than a few pages to how awesome his body is, and how he can "take" any guy in the room, and, in a few places, by inference, how he can "have" any woman in the room.  If you don't like him, this will provide support for your position that he DOES have an ego, thinks he's the greatest and smartest - just look at the title!- and that anything with his name on it is the greatest (Trump redux?) (and that's bad why?)  But for fans like me, it was a fascinating inside look into the man and what made him into the man he is.  At least one reviewer mentioned that Deutsch has a brusque way of looking at women.  I, for one, was pleased that he was forthright about looking at "hot babes."  We all notice attractive people around us.  But he also appreciates women's minds, as well, as evidenced by the women who he has elevated to positions of CEO, COO, and Vice-President in his company. He is, however, crude in some parts of the book, openly using "the f word" and comparing certain business situations to receiving oral sex.  For an inside look at the practice of advertising, and not just how Deutsch does it, I recommend "Where the Suckers Moon. 
 I'm not a baseball fan.  Hockey is the game of my heart.  Baseball?  No way.  But, I loved this book.  The only other baseball book that I've ever read that comes close to this high-water mark is Ball Four by Jim Bouton.  Funny and interesting in its own right.  A real joy to read.    Great characters and insight to management.  A wonderful story about tearing down a culture from the inside.  And who can argue with the Oakland A's success?  Here it is September 2006 and they're once again leading their division, 5 games up on the Angels ... and this is the inside track on how they've done it with one of the worst payrolls in baseball.      
 Hidden Victims, Hidden Healers is an excellent resource book for family and friends of people who are living with some form of mental or emotional disorder. Written in a no-nonsense, accessible style, and filled with  true-life stories of others in this position, Hidden Victims, Hidden  Healers offers the reader options without giving advice, lets the reader  know that they are not alone in their difficulty, and suggests additional  resources for both the reader and their loved one. Perhaps best of all is  the permission which Ms. Johnson gives the reader to live their own  life-being compassionate to a loved one does not mean sacrificing your own  right to a happy and fulfilling life. As a fellow professional, as well as  one who has herself been in this dilemma, I cannot recommend this book  highly enough 
 I bought this for a course on the Gospels and have gone back to this book every time I go to study another part of the New Testament.  Johnson covers the NT extremely well and gives insights into the text and the context that is helpful to students, preachers and teachers.  This updated version includes significant current NT scholarship.  It is very well written, making the reading enjoyable 
 I loved the ride with Grey, partly because I identified so much with the confusion and yearning of his quest for a life that is raw, true, and in the present.  Seeking to escape his ghosts and his ideas of what "should be," Grey's cathartic adventure became my own.  What more can one ask from a book?    It's a introspective read that is engaging and paced such that I whipped through it.  It's a wonderful, well-crafted novel -- and impressive that it's the author's first one.         
 An Italian opera singer sings of the beauty of the female nipples in dulcid Italian.  In German, he would be singing to breast warts, that is their word for this ornament of female anatomy.  The problem of translation is hard enough for humans, let alone for algorithmic machines.  This is one of the main points of Hotstadter's tome.  If we have a machine translate something from a source language to a first target language, then have that translation translated into a second target language, and so forth until returning to our original language, what gibberish will we get?    An advocate of artificial intelligence, Hofstadter makes the case that translation machines will have to be as complex as we are, and have as sophisticated a world view that we have, to be able to do a decent job of translation.  It is at times a wordy book, but, given how much there is to learn from it, well worth the pain of getting past these sections.    I greatly enjoyed seeing how people all around the world, in their own languages, translated Marot's little poem.  Alex Alaniz  1. Please see the reviews of my own strong science fiction book: Beyond Future Shock about the near-terms perils and promise of advanced bio/nano technology in a world still roiled with Middle Age religious conflict and ever growing extreme wealth gradients.  2. I have REVIEWED many books from undergraduate to graduate in: PHYSICS, MATH, ECONOMETRICS, and HISTORY among other areas 
 I liked it but my hubby loved it. It's a tightly written thriller. A grieving mother and child get on a plane. Mom falls asleep and the child becomes missing. While watching Foster attempt to find her daughter I was thinking she's delusional and there never was a child. My husband thought she was someone more important than an propulsion engineer. That she worked for the government and it was some sort of government conspiracy. Which is it? Or is it something stranger? Maybe they are on a flight to the twilight zone.   I'm not telling 
 This is the great ass-whuppin' that released James Clavell's literary chi-flow and allowed him to become the eternal master of intelligent historical potboilers. Never mind Umberto Eco's "Seven Seas Jim" high-cappin' in "Foucalt's Pendulum," James Clavell lays down some staggeringly beautiful historical yarns. And this, the one that came straight from his own horrifying experiences, is the one that started it all.  Where Remarque, Hasek, Grass, Vonnegut, Heller (and the list goes on) tell us the obvious truth that war sucks, Clavell fell into the ninth circle that the others were lucky enough to avoid. And he emerged with one novel that will make you sick even while you enjoy the heck out of it. King Rat, while short and spare, is truly the prerequisite to Shogun, Tai Pan, and all his other novels. That every subsequent novel makes peace with his one-time tormentors is even more extraordinary. 
 This book goes through the interesting history of Gary Larson and his Far Side books. Great book to read 
 As other have mentioned, the silverware basket hangs outside of the space protected by the tray underneath. This isn't a problem for me, but others might be bothered by it.  Otherwise, this is a great dish rack. It looks very good and is more functional than any other dish rack I've had, with more usable space, more effectively arranged. I've found that I can hang the silverware rack on the end, rather than on the back, so there's flexibility as well.  I'd recommend it to anyone. In fact, I've had family visit, look at it, admire its looks and its functionality, and say that they're considering buying one for themselves.  I'd give it 4 1/2 stars. Since I can't, I'm rounding up because the negatives are very insignificant, while the positives are fantastic 
 Simply put, I could not stop reading this book.  At first, I believed it to be a work of fiction, and when I realized it wasn't, I was chilled to the bone. Gary Taylor and his crimes bothered me enough without them being  true. I think the book drew me because it reminds me of my own best friend  from middle school. The one you don't have anything in common with, but  keep in touch with because of what you once had. I loved this book, and  hope others will, too 
 I really love this little book. Excellent for beginner Scroll Saw users. Very easy to understand with lots of helpful illustrations and photographs. I would definately recommend this book for anyone who wants to get into Scroll Saw crafts 
 "If Christ was simply a human, albeit the perfect person.... [He would have only suffered] a finite penalty, such as annihilation, is consistent with that scenario. But Christ was not simply a human.... God himself [besides simply being a perfect human] was present at the cross. For Jesus' cry, "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?" (Matt. 27:46), is that of the "Lord of glory" (1 Cor. 2:8) himself, accepting the punishment due us. Jesus' priestly work therefore establishes that the penalty for sin against the infinite must be infinite. Similarly, God's punishment of the damned will be infinite, of everlasting duration." Page 53, "Hell: A Christological Reflection" Timothy Phillips. 
 Let's face it, any of us over the age of 40 will soon have to confront the issues of death and dying with friends and family, presuming we haven't already done so.  William Griffith has done a wonderful job of providing practical examples in his book "More than a parting prayer, lessons in care giving for the dying."  His book, drawn from real life experiences as he provided care to the dying and their families as a pastor, is must reading.  If you don't know what to say to a dying friend, or a member of their family, this book has the answers 
 I first read this book the first day of beach season. Instead of spending time in the water, I just sat there and read this book until it was too dark to read.  This account is an activist account of the fight from Cuban and US fighters who see and saw the US invasion and resistance in Cuba and the United States not as history to be deciphered but part of an ongoing struggle against imperialism, against war, and for the power of working people. I never stopped caring; I never stopped seeing what was hidden from me in 1961, I never stopped seeing lessons for the future.  A good read 
 This CD is a must have for any new or experienced mother. I have a 5-week old baby girl that has a tough time falling asleep soundly, she'll wake up after 10-15 minutes every time! I always have to get her to sleep in my arms, and then pat her for a while after I put her down because she gets fussy again.  Now, I can put her down all fussy (making sure that she is fed and has a clean diaper on) and she goes to sleep by herself instantly!!!! I believe I have been saved from loosing my mind thanks to this CD 
 this book has gathered information about payment system as good as possible.I hope every one that  like E_banking technology see this book 
 This is the best textbook I've ever read.  Not just the best financial textbook, but the best textbook.  I used Van Horne in my MBA program in 1980.  Van Horne made the same mistake that most textbook authors make: he assumes that either the student knows too much or that the teacher will clarify the author. Brigham, et. al., assumes that the student knows very little, which is always the safest assumption.  In my opinion, it is impossible for an author to tell too much about a topic or to overexplain a topic.  This appears to be Brigham's opinion, too.  As a result, he has written a text that aids, rather than frustrates, the student in learning. In addition, it is an interestingly written text.  I read well over half of the book in the evenings after work, plus Saturday and Sunday, in just one week. All textbook authors should learn from Eugene Brigham how a text book is to be written.  Explain, clarify, use examples, and explain again 
 If I had to weed down my cookbook library to just 5 books this would be one of them.  I have been visiting, living, working & eating in Spain for some 40 years and whenever I read this book it takes me back to tapas that I have eaten & the bars I have visited.  The recipes are 100% authentic and mostly easy to make - the anecdotes about the sources of the recipes fascinating 
 I have read many books on the subject of WWI and found this to be something special, a must read.  Denis Winter's elegant and poetic use of the English language brilliantly described the conditions endured by the common British soldier in the trenches.  Pick this one up you won't be disappointed 
 I just love this CD,from the fantastic hit,"One Good Women," with the trading of backup vocals from Siedah Garrett, Niki Haris, Kenny Cetera and Peter,then the  wonderfull Piano break,I still can't get enough of this record."Scheherazade," is another great number,with Madonna on backup vocals.Every number is filled with excitment,except for the last cut,"One More Story," all you hear is Guitar,and Peter's beutifull song about his small child,praying the kid stays young forever.I swear there's not one number that doesn't grab you some way.I've always loved Peter's voice and style,if he was singing with Chicago,Cher,Amy Grant,or the late Karen Carpenter,you always had a great time listening to his records,like your going to when you play "One More Story.&quot 
 This was a handy little teacher's aide.  I used several of the organizers and it was nice to use something premade rather than make them up myself 
 Night is Wiesel's personal memoir, which relates his personal story before and during World War II, as he and his father are separated from his mother and sister and interned in a series of concentration camps.   "Never shall I forget these things, even if I am condemned to live as long as God Himself. Never."   I read Night in high school, and always think of it as being a particularly long book, which it is not. Wiesel manages to pack more than I would think possible into a little over a hundred pages, which relates the story of himself and his family during the Holocaust. It is a beautifully written work that relates a terrible story. I found the story of Wiesel's loss of faith and the relationship he had with his father particularly memorable. If you somehow missed this in high school, pick it up, if you didn't, find it again. It's worth it 
 My father let me borrow his copy of, Gettysburg, last summer.  When I finally got started, I couldn't stop.  Several days before Christmas I was looking for a Civil War book to give him in addition to returning the one I just finished.  I was delighted to discover that the next two volumes were already published.  I could not resist the temptation and started the middle book and once again and could let it go until I had read, Never call Retreat,   As for Christmas, well...., my Dad said he is enjoying, They Met at Gettysburg, By General Edward J. Stakpole.  His birthday is just around the corner.  Then, he will be able to really enjoy, Grant Comes East, and, Never Call Retreat,  	Another minor regret is that I did not follow my Father's advice and buy books thru Amazon.  I could have saved about 50 bucks.    	Additionally, the alternative events in the East might have had a positive impact for the Confederate cause in the West.  If the collaboration of Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen could produce an alternative history to the Western campaign, I would never stop reading. 
 this book offers some background detail about the formation of the byrds, as well as track-by-track commentary about the album. very good introduction to the byrds at a cheap price 
 Reading this, you understand how John Stossel had the scales fall from his eyes and he began to question, rather than just accept. This seems to be a rare characteristic in a journalist today. Well written, you will also find yourself wanting to look a little closer to the facts of a story 
 Have used this book in undergraduate teaching for many years because there is nothing recent to come near it in psychological coverage. But I wish someone had written a more up to date version or edition in an easier  variety of English 
 Thrice have gotten more recognition more recently, but the word mainly started with the band's sophomore album, "The Illusion of Safety." The first album, "Identity Crisis," showed promise, but it's more than fulfilled here. Each song is great. Some who are more familiar with the more sophisticated later works may hope for that, but this album is just a great hardcore/punk album with 13 songs that use great riffs from Teppei, and there's actually some soloing in here! Not just that, the songs are just as well-written as later works, even if no album by any artist has/will do as much for me as "Vheissu." I'd put this in the same level as the follow-up, "The Artist in the Ambulance." It has gotten better each time, so I may end up liking this one even more. Also, don't worry newer fans, there's hints of what is to come later, like that really cool classical piano interlude at the ending of "Deadbolt. 
 I picked this book up when I found myself stuck in another bad relationship immediately following my divorce.  Joyce wrote this book to catch the attention of women who for one reason or other do not feel good enough about themself to have a good relationship.  I would read it while working out, and it really made me think about how I deserved more than what I was giving myself.  Two years later I am married to a wonderful man that treats me like gold.  This book helped to get me started on a better path in relationship decisions.  This is a great book for anyone who keeps finding themselves with creepy, distructive men 
 If you want to actually learn Premiere, get this and you may forget all the rest. Not only will you learn Premiere , but you'll learn much more about pragmatic video production. Great book! Thanks Kennedys whoever you are 
 	I am a NY sixth grader. The book I read was Jason and Marceline. I thought it was a gossipy type of book about two ninth graders who are best friends. But now are they more then that? 	My opinion on this book is about 5-6out of 10. I would recommend this book for anyone over the age of ten. There is some language and kissing parts in the book. Do you like love stories or stories about teen age boys trying to make a move on a girl? Then this is the book for you. I have read many books and this one was not in the top ten. To me it was kind of ment for a boy to read. That is one of the reasons why I didn't like it. Also it didn't interest me mush at all. So in a way reading Jason and Marceline it was a waist of my time. Maybe it would have had my attention if I was going to Boston. Other wise it wasn't and isn't that great of a book. 	Now that you read my review are you going to read the book? I hope that I helped or at lest my review did. Since it is not that long it is great for book reports like mine. 
 LOL!!!!This is one brilliantly funny comic strip from one brilliantly sick (in a good way) mind. The Far Side is timeless. I laugh every time I read them, and that's a good thing. 
 I've never written are view for any website, but I felt I needed to compliment the authors of this book. First of all, I am a regular guy, who likes to entertain a lot along with my wife. I always grilled dinner, sampled some wine or beer, and avoided making appetizers. But we heard about this book from a friend and decided to give it a try.  Some of the recipes are easy to prepare, some a bit more sophisticated, but so far the results have all been a big hit.   Best of all, the recipes were easy enough to follow even for morons like myself and our gang!  Congrats to the authors, and if anybody likes to entertain a lot this book is invaluable 
 I came across the Immortal Yi Soon Shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels. Up to this time I had never heard of it, but immediately I was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing. As I continued to watch (it had English subtitles fortunately) I became enthralled by the acting, plot and historical theme. With a little detective work, I learned that I had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over 100 episodes. I told my wife how good it was, and after we watched an episode together, she and I both became die-hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it. We managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television. Nearly every episode was better than 90% of the Hollywood movies out there. If you like, action, drama, amazing three-dimensional characters with incredible actors, intersting history, and some of the best writing I have seen on television, or anywhere for that matter, check this out 
 I read this book a oouple of years ago, and haven't stopped thinking of it as secretarian violence in Iraq intensifies and our efforts to deomocratize that country seem obviously futile. I remember that the author sought to understand how people who previously lived in peaceful coexistence with the Jews in this  Polish town, could turn on their neighbors with such viciousness and evil. Arn't we seeing the same phenomenon occur in Iraq and the Shiites, Sunni, and Kurds inflict such horrific violence against each other? I think the author's only explanation for the violence was that when a nation's people are repressed for decades, and their personal freedoms sacrificed in an unjust society, that violence and hatred can intensity once some restraints are lifted and the "genie is out of the bottle". Is it possible that the violence we are seeing in Iraq is partly a symptom of the severe repression the Iraqi people suffered under Saddam Hussein? And didn't we see the same sort of phenomenon occur in South Africa and Bosnia during the last part of the 20th Century? Doesn't this have lessons for America the next time it contemplates "liberating" by force a country with a history of repression and tyranny 
 Horrific depictions of what it was like for the men on the ground.  Burgett's account gives a good glimpse, but civilians like us can never fully experience what it must have been like.  Reads easy; only took two days for me.  What i didn't like was all the typos i found in my edition.  There were glaring problems with the language and spelling.  One of Burgett's buddies is alternately listed as "Brinninstool" and "Brennenstool."  Not the most efficient editing job...  Overall, a good piece of memoirs.  Hard to believe no one wanted to read this book when it was originally published.  Must have been way before its time 
 This book has everything from the SSD Executor,to the ISD Avenger,to the Emperor's resurrection.This book is the one you need if you are looking for information on people,planets,starships,fighters,space colonies,EVERYTHING!!!This book is da bomb wit a capital b 
 (That's a quote from somewhere in the book) I haven't stopped laughing since I picked up this book and now I also can't stop finding Do's and Don'ts all over the streets of Chicago. I'll be giving this book out to unsuspecting friends for Xmas this year 
 This is a truly inspiring book. Everyday this book inspires me to be a better person and keeps life's adversities in perspective.  This book has become my prayer daily -- the poems are remarkable and the writings are succinct and educational.  I would recommend this book to anyone as a daily guide through life 
 FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS I ONLY USE THIS BRAND OF SOCKS. THE BEST IN THE MARKET. 
 This is Chomsky defending his conception of the mind and of language from philosophical views which are incompatible with it.  The Kripke/Putnam view that meanings are largely determined by reference is countered by Chomsky's view that it is usually people, not words, that refer.  One uses the word "London" to refer to different things in different conversational contexts, sometimes an abstract thing, sometimes something concrete, etc., and so there is no single coherent thing, London itself, which can serve as the referent of "London."  One can make similar points about "water" and "gold," which supposedly makes trouble for Kripke and Putnam.  Many other topics are treated in defending Chomsky's internalism and nativism, such as Quine on analyticity (for Chomsky, there are analytic entailments and they are largely innately based).  In fact, there is really too much here to treat in any satisfactory way in a brief review, but suffice it to add that one really intriguing thing about this book is that Chomsky is going beyond mere syntax and also considering the probability of an innate basis for semantics.  If I have one complaint, it is that Chomsky sometimes treats topics too quickly and sometimes even a bit enigmatically leaving more work for the reader to figure out what he means.  But this fault, if I am right in calling it that, is rare, and the book is definitely worth reading 
 This is a good book, although with some flaws.  It's clear that Noonan is a good writer, and a lot of the book is very affecting.  It's largely a bunch of sketches strung together by her loose reminescences and/or her exposition of some abstract theory, each taking up a chapter.  This makes it very fun to just pick up the book and flip around - the theories are often pretty convincing and the sketches (typical Washington memoir stuff, although with a few concealed identities) are interesting, of course.    The drawbacks are that such a literate book has flashes of really cheap partisan snipping.  When you consider it, what made Reagan (and Noonan's book) successful is their tapping into not just a Republican wellspring of thought, but into an American one.  Noonan reads FDR to get the "voice" of the presidency, for example (hard to imagine that happening with W's minions).  So it's jarring when in the midst of her book she makes some passive-aggressive, straw man attack on liberals, who of course aren't able to defend themselves.  I remember Reagan used to make a speech in the 1980 campaign about how "some people will tell you America's day has passed, that its glory days are behind it, that it can no longer lead in the world today" or words to that effect.  Carter did not say that, and no one with a clue ever would.  Reagan could have made the same point about American heming and hawing without the straw man method.    So it is with Noonan: every now and then she'll make some comment about how Democrats are ashamed of the lower class, or some aside about how extreme some person is, and of course she can get away with it - it's her book.  But it takes away from her appeal as a thoughtful conservative.  It's ironic to see her do this and then, for example, absolve Pat Buchanan of any extremism by noting, "wow, he likes Auden!"  Which brings me to the other flaw: as the above review noted, she acts like a schoolgirl towards Reagan.  He is SOOO perfect, nice, dreamy, etc.  Gimme a break - has she ever heard of Truman, for example?  But so much for conservative individualism: she seems content to worship the king to no end, to embarrassing and detrimental effect to her book.  So final verdict: well-done, but with flaws, but definitely worth it.

 This is a timely and thought-provoking book for anyone who wants to better understand our rapidly changing world but is required reading for anyone leading an institution - public sector or private - at the forefront of globalization.  Ian Bremmer argues that none of us can afford to ignore the risks created by failing and failed nations in a world where disease, terrorism, refugees and weapons of mass destruction can cross borders more easily than ever before.  The complex dynamics of openness and stability brought by globalization are challenging all societies, markets and governments in new ways.  This book provides an excellent framework for understanding the journey.  The J-Curve is an innovative approach to mapping these complex dynamics to the behavior of governments around the world. Much of what has been written to date has focused solely on the economic and social impacts of globalization.  This book synthesizes those impacts and explains how they can undermine or strengthen a nation depending on where it is on the J-Curve.   Understanding the political decision-making and the forces within their societies that are motivating these governments is the crucial missing piece of the puzzle laid out in the J-Curve.  His insightful analysis distills the history and the current political, social and economic forces in the countries most relevant to the world economy and global stability - North Korea, Iran, Russia, Saudia Arabia, Turkey, China and more.  Ian not only explains where they are but provides a framework to interpret current events and understand in which direction they are headed on the J-Curve.  I find myself interpreting news in a new way after reading this book.  Three environmental disasters in China this week and the government response is to tighten controls on journalism, a clear move up the left side.  Opium production at record highs in Afghanistan - we are still aren't through the bottom of the curve.  While he does provide some foreign policy prescriptions, you are ultimately left with an understanding of the limits of foreign policy in our increasingly complex world and the dangers in not providing enough of the right assistance to the nations most at risk.    
 The storyline and acting were great. The premis was too funny, and Geroge Hamilton did a superb job playing Dracula. Though I had seen it in the theater when it was released, I watched it with a friend who had never seen it, and he thought it hillarious 
 Rhett's music is very heartfelt.  He has some wonderful songs on this album 
 I purchased this for my 5 year old granddaughter.  She is in kindergarten and her mother must read her a story each night.  She just loves the book--it has become her favorite story book.  I highly recommend it 
 I love this book.  I am not a writer and I don't intend to be one, however, this book has totally changed how I read and how I perceive my books.  I now know why I prefer certain authors more than others.  It's always easy to recognize a beautiful phrase, but now, I know what it is about the composition of that particular phrase or sentence that makes it work so well. This book is also easy to read; not too text bookish 
 Vince Flynn started his series of Mitch Rapp books about a decade ago. Actually, the first book he wrote wasn't even part of the series, but all of the other ones since have been. All of his books have a political element to them, and all of them are thrillers written with a take-no-prisoners protagonist who kills first and half the time doesn't bother asking questions later. They're all long, and as Flynn has continued to write the books have gotten longer. Of the four I've read in sequence, the lengths were (in order) ca. 430 pgs., 480, 530, and 670. Those are approximate, but about right. He's actually getting better, though, something that happens to these guys sometimes.  A good analogy here is Tom Clancy. Clancy's first book, The Hunt for Red October, is pretty poorly written, if you go back and look at it now. The dialog, especially, is terrible, and the same thing holds true for Patriot Games (which I've read was written first but published second). As he's progressed, though, Clancy has gotten better editors, and as a result the books he writes are better, too. The same effect has apparently occurred with Flynn: the dialog's better, there aren't quite as many preachy speeches about how we need to defend ourselves, and he still keeps the plot moving along nicely.  In the current installment, Rapp is pursued by an assassin following a Saudi billionaire's discovery that Rapp has killed his son in Afghanistan. There are various plot twists and developments, and frankly you shouldn't read this book without reading all of the previous ones first, but suffice it to say the characters and action are about what a reader of this type of book is looking for.

 If you read only one edition of this work, this is the edition you should choose. The preface is outstanding, and the "Contexts" and "Criticsm" sections (which comprise half of this volume) are extraordinarily helpful to the nonspecialist reader. Please note, however, that there is a serious error in at least one of the footnotes. On the last page of "The Niagara Movement" essay DuBois refers to Robert Gould Shaw, whom the editors describe (in footnote #4) as an African American Union Army Civil War hero.  Not so!  Shaw was white; there were no African American officers during the Civil War.  (I contacted Henry Lewis Gates Jr. about this, and he confirmed that this was an error in editing. 
 This is the textbook that our community college department uses to teach public speaking.  I've taught from this text since the third edition, about 10 years.  Lucas updates the book to keep the examples timely and the speech selections fresh.  I've seen some reviews that talk about a political bias, either to the right or left.  I don't detect that.  In persuasive speaking, we want students to address controversial issues such as abortion, gun control, and health care, for example.  Sometimes they argue to the left or sometimes to the right, but Lucas outlines the tools for good persuasive speaking.  I like the emphasis on ethics.  The logical fallacies (red herring, either-or, bandwagon, slippery slope, ad hominem) section is a valuable tool in critical thinking.  The emphasis on internationalism, which most students will increasingly find relevant during their business careers, is excellent.  The examples in the text do illustrate the main points, while the CD allows students to see clips of public speakers, bringing the craft alive.  If Oprah, Larry King & Barbara Walters can earn over $50,000 per speaking engagement and Bill Clinton brings in over $250,000, it is a potentially valuable skill.  For promotion and success in business, communication is essential.  This is an excellent text for purposes of study.  Enjoy

 I bought the iGolf after watching a friend in my foursome use one. The most remarkable thing about it is how easy it is to operate. Basically you just pick it up and look at the screen and all the information is there, updated to your position on the course. One flick of the control knob and you are set for the next hole. Likewise, measuring the distance you hit is also easy...you tell it start measuring "here" (a flick of a button when you hit) and walk to where your ball got to and flick another button and your  hit distance is displayed. Actually though, the most impressive thing of all is the quality and speed of customer service. You phone and immediately talk to the technician. It really is magic, the computer companies could learn a lot from L1. Also has far more courses than the competition. I haven't found a local course that wasn't alreadiy mapped into the software.

 A truly remarkable, thoroughly enjoyable book! Having read "John Adams" and "1776", I was looking forward to reading Truman with great anticipation. This book exceeded my expectations! While reading this book, it seemed as if it were warmly written by a close, caring family friend. No skipping through long passages here. So interesting and informative is McCullough's style of writing,that I wanted to read each and every word he wrote. I now have a greater appreciation for a much under-appreciated president and all the noteworthy and far reaching events of Truman's era. An added note about the large size of the book - I placed a throw pillow on my lap underneath the book - made it more comfortable to read. Since first reading "John Adams", I've become an enthusiastic fan of David McCullough. I plan to read each and every book he has written!   
 Before there was RAMBO, before there was Austin 3:16, Disney kid Kurt Russell came into the scene to portray the coolest outlaw of the 20th century, Snake Plissken. To this day, I enjoy both "NEW YORK: 1997" and "LOS ANGELES: 2013" (Those were the original titles for both films), nevertheless, ESCAPE FROM L.A. will not win an academy award for anything, it's a movie that can be enjoyed by John Carpenter fans all over. What makes Carpenter's movies so cool is there is never a happy ending to them and if you think about it, there's a reality to both of the ESCAPE films: New York or L.A. can really become a island of the damned for undesirables. At least in ESCAPE FROM L.A., Kurt Russell has more activity than he did in NEW YORK, where else can you use Bangkok Rules, jump on a pick-up truck with a Harley Davidson, get capture by mr. Army of Darkness himself, Bruce Campbell, play a 10 second life or death basketball game, surf the strip with Peter Fonda, and shoot up the Happy Kingdom with Pam Grier. What more could you ask for 
 I had to read "Great Expectations" for an English class last year, and I was not a huge fan of that novel. But "Bleak House" is a hundred times better, and I'm glad that I didn't allow "Great Expectations" put me off to Dickens.  Admittedly, "Bleak House" starts off a bit slow, and the narrative (particularly the 3rd person present tense half) was a bit tedious in parts, but overall it's excellent. About halfway through it began to really draw me in.  It's a huge novel, but don't let that put you off. By the end you'll be sorry it wasn't a little longer than it is. It made me cry in places, but in others it made me laugh and smile. And Dickens's colorful language is captivating 
 I must say that after finding this book, I can honestly recommend this read - with a certain amount of caution. Even though the book does a good job of describing what Usui taught and what Traditional Reiki is, and how it differs from Western Reiki, it is still written by Westerns trying to conceptualize Eastern thought.   Before going on, please let me comment on my background. I am a Nationally Certified Bodyworker and Massage Therapist. I am an Usui Reiki Ryoho Shihan (teacher) of the Taketomi linage (not through H. Doi). I am a (non-practicing) Usui Shiki Ryoho master/teacher as well. I have been involved with Alternative Therapies for well over 20 years - of which I have always focused on Eastern thought and practice. Lastly, I am a practicing Shingon (Japanese Esoteric) Buddhist - and have been for about 25 years.    As the Buddha said: `I do not talk out about happiness because happiness is not the problem'. So too is it with this book. I can list a ton of good things about it, however, I will let you read it for yourself. I would however like to point out a few major flaws with the information, if I may.     The Stienes explain that there are different Japanese scripts and then again translate 'Reiki' by using the new Kanji definition - as does 99.99% of all Reiki books / sources out there today. Unfortunately, Usui did not use New Kanji. He used old Kanji - which translates slightly different. In old Kanji, 'Rei' would be translated as Spiritual while 'Ki' would be translated as essence. The Stienes however translate Ki as 'energy'. While energy is one manifestation of Ki, it is not the only. Essence would more accurately describe Ki when associated with matters of the Spirit. (for more info on this, please read 'A Brief History of QI'  - excellent book that really describes that Ki or Chi is more than a one word translation.)  Another thing that I was disappointed with was that the Stienes did a good amount of research, yet, throw in important bits of mis-information. The most glaring example would be the Stienes claiming that Usui was related to Shugendo / was a practicing Shugensa. What was their source for this? There are several facts that would cast some major doubt on this assertion - the first being that Shugendo was outlawed in Japan during that time and that this esoteric branch was forced to register with Buddhist temples - forcing them to assimulated into Buddhism. It may be said that Usuis practice could have been influenced by Shugendo - but to say that his practice was shugendo / he was Shugensa is incorrect.   Another assertion that the Stiens make was that Usui somehow condensed Esoteric Buddhism / mystic practices into the path that he taught. Reiki is not Buddhist nor is it mentioned in any Buddhist Text (something else the Stienes claim?) - this is because Reiki does not support the 3 Dharma Seals.  If a Teaching does not support this basic structure, it cannot be considered Buddhist. Furthermore, the practices of both Tendai and Shingon Buddhism take a considerable amount of time and practice to develop and advance through. It is almost absurd to suggest that Usui somehow cut through all this and was able to teach this abbreviate version to others. The Path of Buddhism is about the experience of, not trying to find the cliff notes to, life.   Usui tried very hard to Teach his path as a philosophy - not a religion. His practice was even registered with the Department of Education in Japan and can still be traced today. This is because non-sanctioned religion was outlawed. Religion during Usui's time was State run and was very Nationalistic - something that eventually led to Japan entering WW2. Buddhism and Shinto - which were combined before Usui's time, was now illegal to combine. Buddhism was relegated, while Shinto was placed as the country's main religion - called State Shinto.  The history in this book is a bit off. The Usui Reiki Ryoho Gakkai was formed AFTER Usui's death in 1926. This again can be proved by researching documents filed with the Dept of Education in Japan. Usui did not form the Gakkai. He was made the first president, posthumously, out of respect and admiration by its founding members, who included Eguchi and the Navy Admirals.  Another thing, the Stienes claim that Usui taught Reiki 3 different ways. They claim that one way was used to teach people who were Shinto. Another way was used to teach people who were Buddhist. Lastly, Usui taught the Navy Admirals yet another style of Reiki. This is poor understanding of the Japanese culture. There is a common saying in Japanese that "the Japanese are born Shinto and die Buddhist". The greatest Majority of Japanese are BOTH Shinto and Buddhist. Again, Buddhism and Shinto were even combined for a long period of time throughout Japanese history. Most Japanese homes have both a Buddhist and a Shinto altar / shrine. The Navy Admirals would also be both Buddhist and Shinto. Though it can be said that what Usui taught evolved over time, it is puzzling as to why this comment was made.  It seems that the Stienes also rely on H. Doi as a major source of info. Several who have sat in on Doi's workshops have suggested that what Doi presents is a lot like Western teachings and not necessarily Japanese Reiki. In other words, Doi's info should be taken very lightly and not relied on. Doi has trained extensively with Usui Shiki Ryoho masters from what I have understood.    The other thing that is kind of disturbing is that when reading that 'energy' practices in this book, the exercises say to lift your hands up in the air to make a connection with the Reiki source. This is Western ideaology. It contradicts what Usui himself said on his memorial 'Reiki can be used by anyone, because it comes from within you'. The idea that there is this 'Reiki source' omnipotent and omnipresent is more in line with Judeo-Christian thought and philosophy rather than Japanese Shinto beliefs of Animism.   When talking about Reiki the Stienes go on to say that the linage of Reiki should be traced back to Usui - who created Reiki. This, again, is not true / accurate. Reiki was alive and well in Japan before Usui's name was connected with it. There was even a book written about Reiki in the year 1919 describing 'Reiki'. Then then go on to list Reiki linages, leaving the reader the idea that these are the ONLY linages of these branches. Not true.  It is also interesting to note that palm healing was always a part of Japanese history, going back at least 2000 years. Palm healing was not, however called Reiki. It was either called Teate or Tenohira. Note that the word Ki is not present in either of these 2 Japanese words. Palm healing is different than Reiki. Usui Reiki contained palm healing, though Reiki itself is NOT palm healing.   And the list goes on and on and on.  However, it does correct a lot of misinformation out there on Reiki - that its from Tibet or outer-space - or that it is somehow related to a foreign energy concept like the Chakra system from India.     I do not agree that this book proves that there is no correct Reiki practice. On the contrary, I believe it supports the idea that like most things Japanese - Usui Reiki Ryoho is a Japanese path and a TRADITION that should be respected and handled as such. After reading the various additions, subtractions, amalgamations, combinations, degradations, subjugations, relegations, exacerbations, obliterations, and misrepresentations that Usui Reiki Ryoho has undergone since its introduction to the West since Takatas time, it only solidifies in my mind why I would want to practice the teachings of Traditional Japanese Reiki vs. some Western form of Reiki.    All in all, this is the very best book on Reiki that you can get. Just keep in mind that it is not entirely accurate - though it is more accurate than 99% of the other books out there today.   Good reading and be well on your journey.

 As an avid reader of history, specifically military history, I purchased this book based on a review in Air and Space. The reviewer's only complaint was that the book was too Japanese in its outlook. Valid complaint on the surface, however, I found that the authors' detailed examination of the battle from the Japanese perspective using voluminous original documents and other resources opened up new avenues and made me understand the Battle of Midway and its importance even more. The book is a complex read with many footnotes, but the overwhelming reason for this is that the author's are explaining to lay readers complex under-reported facts and new discoveries about military operations conducted by a foreign country in a completely different language. I found the footnotes and appendices helpful and a good read also. This will stay in my permanent library.  Purchase and savor this text.

 This play caused quite a ruckus when it first was performed in 1664 in France.  The theatre-goers thought that Moliere was undermining the very basis of religion, and in France at this time, religion and Catholicism were sacrosanct.  Instead, Moliere was making an attack on false piety and on hypocrites.  The play is a comedy, and a very funny one at that, but the points that Moliere makes in this play are obvious and clear.  He does not suffer fools gladly, and has no use for false religious piety. I think that he leaves a number of questions unaswered in this play.  For example, who was Tartuffe and was he once pious?  Is the play meant only to be a direct hit on religious heretics, or was Moliere pointing fun at all hypocrisy as displayed by politicians and world leaders?  I'll leave you to find that out for yourself.  Read the play and draw your own conclusions.  I must say that I really would like to see this play performed on the stage.

 The essence of Salinger is his ability to take a static situation and run with it.  I found the first of the two stories to be the most effective.  Don't expect Catcher in the Rye here, and the way Salinger slows down the pace, describing each character to a tee, getting the reader to concentrate on the energy of the characters, and not merely a premise, is why this book is so wonderful.  The story almost has a "slow motion" feel to it, and in my opinion, that is what makes it so genius.  Readers who quickly dismissed this book, likely don't have much patience, and are more proned to reading supermarket varieties 
 This is a down to earth book.  Stallone writes in a simple straight forward style that is very clear and easy to follow and read.  He's one of Hollywood's best writers and should go down in history as one of our great national treasures.  I'm sure philadelphia would agree.  His workout format is truly inspiring as well as all the difficulties he's had to overcome to master his own challenges and bring his body into discipline.  I really like the book and when I bought it for me, my husband picked it up and couldn't put it down.  There are tons of pictures and advice as well as behind the scenes every day life stuff he talks about here and there.  I've worked hard at discovering for myself what works and what doesn't work and this book only reaffirmed lots of the good habits and conclusions I've already been doing.  I've implemented some of his training into my own program and noticed an immediate difference, especially with working the abs.  The diet section, his recommendations on how to approach the food stuffs, is down to earth and very practical.  I already had been eating healthfully this way for some time.  When I read it his approach, I reached a conclusion that his method has been tried and tested because I went through the same ropes to learn the same things.  It doesn't take a genius and he's figured out the common sense way to make it simple and with results.  However, Stallone's indulgences for sweets is evident and he allows himself one day a week for a splurge.  I never do this and so perhaps my own diet is stricter than his!  The book is written as both an instructional book for beginners, intermediate strength building athletes and has some advanced exercises for advanced training.  He has great exercises for building up the core and working the interior back muscles along the spine and not just the cosmetic aspects of the back. These are great exercises, especially for someone like me who needs to strengthen the back and spine.  This book is also an inspirational fitness book.  I think what strikes me most about the book is the personality that bubbles out from the pages - like the essence of the man and his strength,energy, and great sense of humor - it all comes off the pages and seems to reach people on this basic level - like his Rocky character - no frills and straight from the heart.  He even goes into the pitfalls of self competition and what he learned along the way.  Love it.  The book is an easy to read book and even includes a section for women's fitness and features Stallone's beautiful wife, Jennifer.  It's a good book to add to your fitness library.  I read it and turn to it almost daily for tidbits of information to add to my workouts and health regime.  Regarding the latest stint about steroids - well that has nothing to do with the book.  The book was written several years ago and there is nothing about it that is not true in terms of fitness.  I give the book a five star rating because of its content alone.  I don't compare it to something outside of it's subject matter like steriods, which is outside of the book's content.  I rated the book by its own merit and not because I agree with or don't agree with the current news lines about steriods.  That is a topic and circumstance outside the topic of the book

 If you like quality writing, this is it! Mr. Wolfe is extremely talented at painting an entire scene with words that leave you feeling like you are there. Character, scene, and plot development all have depth. And I'll have to disagree with an earlier review that said the characters weren't believable. They were entirely "human" with all the rich exceptions that make a person who he or she is. I also disagree with the comment that the book, itself, was racist. No, the book wasn't, but some of the characters were, which was a point that Mr. Wolfe was attempting to make about them because their racism had to do with the larger story. I will most definitely read Mr. Wolfe again because of his extraordinary writing abilities. That said, I was completely disappointed with the ending, both because of specifically how he chose to end it and because of its weakness. The ending lacked the full-bodied development that Mr. Wolfe gave to the rest of the story 
 I am super impressed with this book. It is packed full of great information.  I'm reading it for a class and wish I had more time to thoroughly read it but what I have read so far is fantastic.  I have learned a lot.  
 I've read three of Adrian Slywotzky's books during the last twelve months and I'm deeply inspired by his bright ideas on the art of profitability. This book focuses on how to profit via growth.   The key chapters are those that lay out the concepts behind "hidden assets" (that can be exploited to create value in new markets) and "demand innovation" (how to explore new ways to solve customer problems via external analysis).  This is the universe of HIDDEN ASSETS that may be leveraged in a growth strategy: 1) Traditional Intellectual assets (intellectual property, competency/skills, and brand).  2) Customer relationships (reach/many, interaction/deep or frequent contact, insight/knowledge, authority/reputation).  3) Strategic real estate (unique value chain position, competitive market position, portal/gateway).  4) Networks (third-party relationships/partners, installed base/post-sale owners, user community, and deal flow/preferential access to potential transactions/M&As).  5) Information (market window, technical know-how, software and systems, by-product information).  I found many of the case stories very inspiring, although the well-explained out-of-the-box story of "Cardinal Health" stood out as the most exciting.   The book draws on Slywotzky's previous books. It pursues the eternal theme ... that the path to profitability lies in truly understanding your current and future customers.   Being a business development manager, I search for relevant tools to apply the growth ideas to my own business. The cases in the book are very good and on the website for this book - demandinnovation.com -, you'll find the core ideas in a graphical form as well as an excellent 32-page companion workbook on "Getting Started".  I also highly recommend Slywotzky's "Profit Zone" (1997/2002) and "Art of Profitability" (2002). Note that these books present the same 23 profit models, first as a standard business strategy book, then as an easy-to-read novel.   If you're interested in other strategy books on Growth, let me draw your attention to "Blue Ocean Strategy" by Kim & Mauborgne (2005), "Profitable Growth" by Charan (2004), and "Beyond the Core" by Zook (2004).

 This is definitely the best collection of their work on one CD, as other compilations that I have seen do not include one or two of their top efforts. The band has a typical 80's pop sound with a hint of rock in  numerous places, lots of synth. Lyrics are strong and production excellent.  The main tracks off the album have gripping melodies - "Big In  Japan", "Sounds Like A Melody", "Dance With Me"  and "Forever Young". The depth and reach of the sound is just  fantastic, and you will definitely be exercising the louder levels of your  audio system. The other songs definitely hold their own and grow on the  listener as time goes by. This is a definite buy, go and get it

 This is Bob Dylan's second album, but it's the one that made him known to the general public at large. He penned most of the songs on the record, including the famous, "Blowing in the Wind," a song that would live on for generations. Also included on this record is the very long and very good, "A Hard Rain Must Fall," which tells the story of a man asking his young son questions. The answers, if you listen to them, will really move you and get you to asking a lot of questions yourself. "Girl From the North Country" is a terrific song where a young and soulful Bob Dylan asks anybody traveling to the North Country if they'd remember him to a girl who lives there. I can't help it, I picture a coal miner's daughter. Even back then, Bob Dylan was a poet who could grab you and make you think with his words 
 I enjoyed this book. It is well written with good character development 
 This unit is very easy to use. It's very convenient to talk on the phone hands-free using the StreetPilot's bluetooth feature. The turn-by-turn directions make it so easy to find places I've never been before. I would recommend this product 
 Chick Fights is so much better than Brawlin Broads! I got both and the girls in BB are soo but ugly. The chick fight girls are HOT. I can't get enugh watching these HOT babes spanking each other 
 I'm a real Alexander buff and I've read over 3 dozen books about him now and am in the process of reading a dozen more. The books run the gamut from virtual worship to venomous vitriol and every point in between. Some are painfully dreary to read through with painstaking academia that are meant to one-up other scholars in the field and some are light-reading rubbish hastily put together to take advantage of the hoopla generated by the Oliver Stone film. It really says something about Alexander that he could mean so many different things to so many different people with wildly varying perspectives and opinions. This book is an oddity and a very interesting addition to the ever growing library of all things Alexandrian. For one, it sure is entertaining without resorting to cheap sensationalism or making up stories out of context. It's a real page-turner that draws you into Alexander's world.  Part narrative history and part novel-like fiction, Stylianos does a great job of presenting the "facts" while entertaining the reader with fictional "drama" like a good historical novel without bogging it down with overly flowery descriptions and words. It gets straight to the point but embellishes the events with dialogues that very well could have been shared between Alexander and the characters who surround him based on the historical facts we have about him. It reads as though you're watching the movie but with much more detail and explanations of the environment and the circumstances surrounding a particular event or a series of events.  I'm not sure where this Ptolemy "text" comes from. My thoughts are that it's educated fiction but that's not the point. The story obviously draws from various sources - both ancient and modern - but what makes this book such an interesting and entertaining read is that it's completely believable based on all the research and reading I've done on Alexander to date. It certainly isn't a scholarly history book like the works by Paul Cartledge, Robin Lane Fox, Peter Green, Frank Holt, A.B. Bosworth, Guy MacLean Rogers, J.F.C. Fuller, etc., and it isn't quite a historical novel like the great books by Mary Renault or Steven Pressfield, but it manages to inform as well as entertain like no other book about Alexander the Great I've read to date.  This isn't the first book I'd recommend to a novice of Greek history or a newcomer to the world of Alexander the Great, but I'd definitely recommend it to someone who has read a few definitive biographies and perhaps a few of the historical novels. The more background you already have about this most fascinating figure, the more you will enjoy this book and its refreshingly fast flow of the story. It's one of those books that make you savor certain passages as well as anticipate the upcoming chapters with glee. You get lots of juicy details about certain events that you wished you knew more about and Stylianos presents fictional accounts that are very, very believable and simply outright fun to read.   A good case in point is the siege of Gaza which typically gets the one-paragraph treatment in most biographies. Here it gets as much print as the siege of Tyre with a very engaging and riveting dramatization of what was another very arduous and time-consuming siege in which Alexander was very nearly killed, suffering a serious injury during battle and almost getting assassinated as well by a planted prisoner. Once again, the it's the believable dramatization based on historical facts that make such passages a joy to read and savor. Alexander may have not said the exact words described in the book, but from what we know of his character and what he actually did, you can't help but think that Alexander at least said things that were very similar in nature. I highly recommend this book to all other Alexander buffs out there 
 I started reading this book while on vacation at my parent's house in Arizona last month. I wasn't able to finish it so as soon as I got home, I found it on Amazon.com and purchased it (paperback). Within a week I received it and started reading where I had ended while in AZ. Absolutely amazing! I want to meet this woman! Being an animal advocate myself, anytime I'm able to read about people who feel as strongly as I do, I'm elated! This book is EXTREMELY well written. As an animal lover you feel her emotions (and catch yourself talking back to the book!). Even if you're not a passionate animal person, this book opens your eyes and heart to the reality of what we need to do to help animals. Animals are like babies, they rely on us for everything. Only when we neglect them do they become feral. Please check out this book then get one for all of your friends! Thank you Terri Crisp 
 In an unrelenting quest to understanding the history of the United States, one obscure name comes to mind, Thomas Paine.  Paine helped establish the meaning of democracy and the "united" in United States.  His two monumental works, COMMON SENSE AND RIGHTS OF MAN, provided the philosophical and rhetorical building blocks that the founding fathers, such as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin, et al., would emulate with the writing of the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights.  Many take for granted the origins of freedom and democracy in the United States, and as with many school history textbooks depict, Paine merely appears in a paragraph or two, and quickly disappears to historical oblivion.    Nevertheless, when one reads COMMON SENSE AND RIGHTS OF MAN:  AND OTHER ESSENTIAL WRITINGS OF THOMAS PAINE, there will be no doubt how significant his philosophical and political writings transformed the political structure of the colonies.  Although this may sound somewhat romanticized, Paine's words ignited the energy for the colonists to free themselves from the tyrannical-monarchical leadership of England's King George III.  With all the talk of Paine being a founding father, he may also be considered the father of revolution, American Revolution and French Revolution, and human rights. Without the inspiration from his friend Edmund Burke, author of REFLECTIONS ON THE REVOLUTION IN FRANCE, Paine may not have been able to write the pamphlet Rights of Man.  Indeed, his power of the written word translated to revolutionary action, and Jeffersonian ideology.    In clear and no nonsense language,  Paine's perspective of the state of the colonies are elaborately told in COMMON SENSE.  He adamantly shows his opposition toward hereditary rule and limitations imposed on individuals by George III and his vehement disdain towards aristocrats and kings.  For RIGHTS OF MAN, he proposed possible solutions toward poverty, and created a blueprint towards achieving social and political institutions through his written abstracts.  The other essential writings include the pamphlets, THE CRISIS, part one of THE AGE OF REASON, and selections of AGRARIAN JUSTICE.  These writings gives readers an idea the political and religious atmosphere in which Paine lived, and how "breaking ties" with the so-called "motherland" was necessary towards forging a free nation.  COMMON SENSE AND RIGHTS OF MAN is indeed accessible with its pocketbook size form.  After reading the book, readers may have a better understanding of what takes to build a nation.  Paine's words are lessons of history and humanity, and is definitely recommendable reading 
 I bought the game, and it was excellent. I bought the soundtrack, and it was aslo excellent. The tracks add a crisp and original edge to the game that, from what I've seen, no other soundtrack has done. If you love the game or just love new and unique fully orchestrated music, then this album is a must 
 Read, re-read and re-read.  If you've read this book more than 10 years ago, you'll be amazed at its artistry and timeliness if you read it now.     I've read most every contemporary novelist who have renown for being among the best.  While quite a few of them deserve such encomium, quite a few of them do not.  To compare style, content, artistry, - then pure enjoyment with "To Kill a Mockingbird", none truly equal the work of Harper Lee.  It certainly should be on the required reading list of every high school in this country 
 I enjoyed reading Rae Lindsay's book.  I really like her writing style. It was a light read and anyone interested in lefties should read this book! 
 Crosby wrote an excellent book that is very useful to managers, quality professional and any individual concerned about quality. The author clearly explains the meaning of quality, which is conformity to requirements. He also shows a useful way to measure quality in terms of cash and not just the usual metrics such as the number of rejects per specified number of units produced. The profits that would flow from producing quality products and services is a good measure. Crosby explains that adopting the cost effective practice of preventing errors will result in avoiding rework, scrap or servicing, which result in increased profits.  The author explains that quality processes should pervade the whole organisation, including areas like public relations or industrial relations, and not confined to customer specific areas.   The book is practical oriented with the author providing some suggestions on how to implement his philosophies in a manufacturing organisation. The book is a bit dated but this does little to diminish the quality of the author's message. The book is applicable to all organisations in any industry, although the author had a bias towards manufacturing enterprises. This is a classic book that is highly recommended. 
 This book is broken up into three parts. The first part is Adam, riding his bike, trying to get to the town that he was born and find his father so he can deliver a package that he has brought him. The second part is Adam speaking with someone and trying to remember his past. The third part is Adam in the past, and what has happened. All of these parts are intertwined together to make one very compelling novel. The story is very interesting and kept me always wanting to read more. It is unique in that it has three different parts, all about Adam and that we are learning Adam's story as he is. 	The characters were very interesting. Throughout the novel, we follow Adam Farmer through his life and his discoveries. He is a very believable character. Adam is a young teen, about 14 or so, who is lost in himself and confused. He is also very shy. Adam has lived a very normal life in a very un-normal situation. His parents are also very believable. They are typical parents, only wanting the best for their child, even though they have something to hide. The "doctor is also very believable, he continues to ask questions to try to uncover Adam's past. He also prescribes medication for Adam. The doctor seems to be evil, while Adam and his family are good. Adam is a very memorable character. He is a child trying to find his way in life and remember his past. The reader feels bad for Adam. 
 the speakers are good quality and the Amazon service is great as usual. sony has always been tops for me.  
 This beautiful book belongs in every baseball enthusiast's library, but it would be a mistake to keep it on the shelves.  Author Stephen Wong has partnered with the Smithsonian to publish the most  stunning book on baseball on the market.  It deserves to be on your coffee table not only because of its wonderful photographs but also due to the wonderfully rich way he presents the history of the game.  Wong gained remarkable access to the sport's foremost collectors, combing through hundreds of images and memorabilia items.  The payoff is tremendous for anyone with an interest in baseball or, for that matter, in American history and culture.  Readers will learn the essential facts about the game, and the fascinating tidbits, such as the origins of the curve ball.  They then get to see remarkable shots, some most unusual - from folk art statues to Don Larsen's enshrined shoes from his perfect game to the bricks of former stadiums.  In fact, this book should be placed in the Hall of Fame 
 this book is a wonderful display of the power of photography.  every image carries with it a tremendous amount of impact.  with an awe-inspiring artistic eye, nick brandt managed to display the heart and soul of each and every image he set out to capture.  these are not your average wildlife photos.  these are intimate portraits of animals you only thought you had seen photographed before.  the incomparable Jane Goodall even writes his praises.  
 This book is loaded with the most recent medical findings and is organized as a referenced book, although I read it cover to cover.  
 You got to read this one. The author did an exceptional job - this has to be one of the best sellers in terms of horror. Check it out. Another good book is The Basenji Revelation. 
 Are you interested in life beyond the Matrix? I wrote this book to explore questions of freedom and to take a serious look at the implication of the entire trilogy. You won't find an encyclopedia of the movies, but you will find a literary attempt to recreate Neo's journey into a larger world. If you want to get a taste, google the book to find the secret companion website which has additional content and more explanatory and analytic essays. No one can be told what it is.. 
 This I would have to say is a must read book for all of you out there who are denying one simple fact: Food isn't the culprit. How much you learn to use self-control and the self-esteem derived from it will govern the  direction of your path. I got tired of going backwards all the time. This  book has pointed me in the right direction. It points out that we should  respect, celebrate food. WE should treat food as we would a good friend who  we can count on. Well, I made friends with this book and I respect the  author, Hal Brickman for writing a weight-management book that I have not  seen the like of before. Instead of being preachy it's down-to-earth and  uses words that people can understand. It uses ideas that make sense and  are hard to forget, even though there is a little devil in me that  sometimes says "go back." Go back and get that instant plesure  from eating all I want when I want. But, I'm clearer about the consequences  now. The book has taught me to slow down and think, breathe, imagine, plan,  hesitate. That's all it takes to my amazement. Buying time. I see that now.  By delaying that lunge to the wrong foods, I move closer to who I really am  and how I really should look and care for my self. Wow! I'm so grateful 
 There's a revolutionary understanding of our lives and our history in this world. It's very enjoyable to read 
 "Rebecca", the book that gave Daphne du Maurier immortality, has all the features of the novel of its time. Balancing on the thin, invisible line between plain romance and deep psychological analysis, it is engrossing, for me to the point of sacrificing sleep.    The plot itself is constructed quite simply and classically, starting with the young girl - companion to the wealthy lady, falling in love and marrying the rich widower, Maxim de Winter. The young bride is the narrator of the novel and she finds itself initially incapable of understanding her husband's past (especially as she gets no direct answers) and of bearing the burden of living in Manderley, the mansion haunted by the powerful presence of his first wife, Rebecca.   In fact, the naivety and childishness of the narrator sometimes irritated me massively, she was extremely self-conscious and eager to please, so much that she could not see the obvious...Very good character, I bet this was the author's plan. But finally she undergoes the complete transformation, albeit in very dramatic circumstances, discovers the truth (a horrible secret... more than one in fact) and can be happy with her husband (this is not a spoiler, as the novel starts at this pint and is written in retrospective). Ultimately, this is a story of lack of communication which is the basis for misunderstanding, suspicions, false loyalty and the whole spectrum of emotions with which this novel if bursting.  "Rebecca" is a great classic, full of suspence, with great characters (Miss Danvers!). It is definitely worth reading even as the only book by du Maurier, to get acquainted with her style, and it is a very good novel for a long, winter evening, virtually moving the reader to the British countryside at the beginning of the twentieth century. Although the novel certainly aged, it did so gracefully, retaining all its charm 
 Thank god this book resurfaced in the 70's... had it not, a treasure would have certainly been lost 
 This novel tells the haunting story of two generations of a Wisconsin family brought together and torn apart by the lake adjacent to the family home.  Focused on four women, sisters of two generations, the novel develops around the sisters' relationship with the lake, and the tragedy that ensues when it claims one of their lives.  Much of the book is spent untangling the secrets which led to the drowning, and working out the complicated problems which arise from the family's attempts to keep these secrets.    Scwartz's story jumps back and forth across time, from past to present and back again.  This means that the story develops piece by piece, and this is what makes it something of a mystery.  I found the plot development to be one of the more satisfying parts of this book, seeing the pieces of the puzzle fall into place.  I enjoyed the developments leading up to Scwartz's telling of what actually happened the night of the tragedy.  After that point, however, I found the plot to be something of a let-down.  The conclusion seemed a bit too neat, and a bit forced.    The most enjoyable part of this book to me was the way in which Scwartz set the scene- the way in which she managed to capture the sense of a time and place.  The novel is set in the Wisconsin countryside in the first half of the twentieth century, with most of the action focusing on the last years of WWI, and the 1920s.  Scwartz offers a convincing portrait of Wisconsin farm country in the late-1910s and early 1920s.  Her descriptions are vivid, without being overstated, and her story intersects with several significant historical events, including WWI and the influenza epidemic.  Scwartz gives her readers a strong sense of connection to the seasons, the land, the lake.  I really did feel like I was part of the world about which she wrote.    Overall, I enjoyed reading this novel.  The development of the plot engaged me, and the scenery captivated me.  I was a bit disappointed by the ending, but my reading was by and large time well spent.     
 This book was excellent. I became an instant fan of Ms. Due after reading.  If you have read My Soul to Keep first then please do not compare...same author, but a different style of novel!!! I recommend all of her works!!! I met her in Philadelphia and not only is she intense but down to earth as well 
 I really enjoyed Nate and Hayes from the first time I saw it. I got this movie on laser disc back in the early 80's when I was stationed in Pearl Harbor in the Navy. There was a Bar called "Bully Hayes Place" we used to go to. I made sure I had a copy of the movie so I could always show my friends. If you like Action and Adventure this is a can't miss. I have watched it with my friends over and over and was thrilled to be able to get it on DVD 
 I read this book back in the 1980s, re-read it recently, and felt as if I were rediscovering and old friend. Dr. Forward begins with the discovery of the neutron star on earth, then moves to life on the star itself. We watch the cheela evolve as a species, from ignorant superstition to scientific genius, and wait breathlessly as they and the earthlings encounter each other. Dr. Forward, being a real scientist, lost me a few times with his technical terms, but instead of making me bored or frustrated and left feeling outside, I was just sorry I couldn't speak his language and really appreciate the true depth of the story, which I feel will hold the reader's interest regardless of their level of education. It's a fascinating story of life on another world, how it might evolve, and what might happen when humans find it. A must-read for serious sci-fi fans and amateur astronomers 
 In 1984,New Edition's second album,this one self-titled,was released. The previous year they scored with CANDY GIRL. The title track was a Top 20 hit. This album spawned two Top 20 hits,COOL IT NOW and MR. TELEPHONE MAN. The latter track was written and produced by Ray Parker Jr. who scored with GHOSTBUSTERS,from the movie of the same title,the same year. I remember in the music video for CIN,New Edition were hanging out near a basketball court checking out young females. I first saw it in late 1984. Several years ago,I heard MTM on a classic R&B station for the first time in sixteen years. I thought it was a composition by Parker since it sounds similar to his 1981 hit A WOMAN NEEDS LOVE(Just Like You Do). I checked the songwriting credits on the internet for MTM and I was correct. I love the "shoo-bee-doo wop" on MARYANN. New Edition member Bobby Brown would later go out on his own(his 1986 solo debut hit was GIRLFRIEND). He had other hits two years later,DON'T BE CRUEL(not to be confused with the song recorded by the late great Elvis Presley and later covered by Cheap Trick) and MY PREROGATIVE. In 1992,he'd take Whitney Houston to be his lawfully wedded wife. Brown and Houston are still husband and wife today despite occasional physical abuse and drug problems. Ralph Tresvant went solo briefly himself. Ronnie Bell,Michael Bivins and Ronnie DeVoe later spun themselves off as a trio called Bell Biv DeVoe. Bell Biv DeVoe debuted in 1990. Tresvant released a solo album the same year. Between 1985 and 1988,New Edition fullfilled their recording contract with MCA(3 more albums in that time frame). I also like HIDE AND SEEK,KINDA GIRLS WE LIKE,DELICIOUS,I'M LEAVING YOU AGAIN,BABY LOVE and DELICIOUS. The others are very good 
 There are two aspects for this topic. Would you like the deeper reason why a certain way works? Or would you like to have some impressions with a certain method and try to implement it? Not many books can balance these two aspects very well and Burden's book is more toward the latter. This can be observed that almost every method is with a pseudo code and many numerical examples are given (many are even in a step-by-step way).   So if one's background is from science such as math or physics, s/he probably regards this book as a failure. For engineering students, especially undergraduates, this book seems to stay at a good balance since it doesn't get too involved.  The pseudo codes are in general well written and helpful. I think it is the strength of this book. There are few books doing better in this aspect than this book. I have one impressive experience about it. Once a graduate student asked me a question and I told him Burden's book can solve his problem. He succeeded very fast and told me he even didn't know how that method works but just did programing based on the pseudo code. For education aspect, of course we don't encourage this kind of working. But for some situations, we need it.  On the other hand, this book is rather elementary than advanced. And I think it is intended for undergraduates, not graduates. This book was my textbook of numerical analysis when I was a junior. It also served as a textbook when I lectured to undergraduate students during pursuing my phd degree in engineering. I will still use it as the textbook next time whenever possible.  I should give it 4 stars or 4 and a half at most for this book. 5 stars are just out of viewpoint balance. 
 Ever since I read Martin Gardiner's book on multiple intelligences, I have been intrigued by the study of how we learn and the different types of intelligence. No one disputes that mathematical/analytical brain-power is a very different type of intelligence from the kind of bodily intelligence that makes someone a graceful gymnast or a super athlete; while there is often some cross-over between the kinds of intelligence that make for good mathematicians and good musicians, the kinds of intelligence that are brought to bear on different parts of our lives get developed in different ways.  One of the more controversial and overlooked types of intelligence is Emotional Intelligence. I do not agree with the idea that one's EQ is in some way opposite from the IQ, the standard intelligence quotient idea (which in and of itself is calculated and reliant on different criteria depending upon the test). I don't believe that Goleman ever makes such a dramatic claim as to show a precise inverse relationship between the EQ and IQ. He does show that there are different kinds of difficulties that can arise, and that a high IQ does not necessarily (or even often) translate into a high EQ.  After a brief introduction exploring the general issues of intelligence and the power of emotions, Goleman  looks at new discoveries in brain anatomy and architecture, particularly as it pertains to what happens when emotions `take over'. The second, and longest, section of the book looks at the nature of Emotional Intelligence. This is being able to understand oneself as well as others, being able to control emotions (or not), and drawing on Aristotle's phrase from the Nicomachean Ethics, being able to have the right degree of emotion at the right time for the right reason for the right duration. Goleman's third section incorporates the general ideas of Emotional Intelligence into the broader context of living, stating that one's emotional intelligence is in fact a more critical factor than pure computational intelligence at being `successful' in many important parts of life - from personal relationships to professional relationships, self-satisfaction and self-growth, emotions often hold sway over traditional `intelligence'. The fourth section examines developmental issues, leading to the final section exploring what happens when such development goes wrong.   Goleman's observation that children seem to be increasingly depressed, despondent, violent and unruly than in the past may or may not be accurate - unfortunately, such comparisons with the past often rely on shaky anecdotal evidence or studies whose parameters are different, and thus whose conclusions cannot be accurately compared. However, it certainly seems that these are true observations. Goleman warns of a coming crisis as unprepared children face an adulthood full of emotional stress and crises for which they have not developed coping skills. Goleman calls for more emphasis on emotional intelligence issues - anger management, conflict resolution, sense of self, etc. for school children to reduce violence and potential for crime.   Overall, this book presents interesting ideas. The idea of Emotional Intelligence is fairly new, and will no doubt be adapted and revised in the coming years. Goleman's task here may be less of a comprehensive overview rather than an introductory shout to the community that needs to address the issue.   
 This  book is an excellent book.Sometimes she gets on my nerves when she thinks she knows it all. I think thats cool  that all  she talks to  is kids at first.Then she start coming up with all these cures.The cure I like the most is the radish cure .The thing I  liked most was is all the kids think  they can get away with anything.The thing i dislike about it didnt have any   drama.  
 Michael Arlen takes a very novel approach to discovering his roots.  He freely admits early on that he doesn't even like Armenians, although he himself is of Armenian descent.  Arlen's father shielded him from the burdens that virtually all Armenians bare: that of the genocide/massacres of 1915.  It is not until his father's death that Arlen begins to interact with the Armenian community and ultimately takes a trip to Soviet Armenia.  He describes the country and the people in a detached manner and with a dry sense of humor.  His research of Armenian history is rather academic at first.  Ultimately he is affected by the great suffering of his people.  Arlen asks many questions that he cannot and does not answer.  His references to certain Armenian qualities as "childlike" was offensive, and his attempt to examine the Armenian race using traditional psychological analysis, determining finally that Armenians are burdened with self-hate, had its limitations.  But I do not view Passage to Ararat as a scholarly treatise.  It is instead one man's journey to the land of his ancestors in order to come to grips with who he is and whether he should be proud of that 
 The is an excellent, easy to read book that should be required reading for all high school students. I'm really surprised that this book doesn't seem to be getting more notice in the media. I'm a political junkie, subscribe to 8 political journals, and in the process read a lot of economics. My political views were more socialist when I graduated from college, but got more moderate as I kept doing my homework. When I got done reading this book, it gave me a full belief in the superiority of the capitalistic system, and I voted Republican for the first time in my life. In the book, the author goes through all of the most pertienent economic issues, comparing and contrasting the American and European Systems, and does an incredible job showing the superiority of the American one 
 I bought this book to read with my children (ages 8 and 10).  I found the book interesting, and learned a bit about King George's youth.  My children thought it wasokay, even though their father was forcing it on them.  I even caught my wife sneaking a read.  The writing style is nice and folksy, and the illustrations are charmingly naive.  The personal spin it places on the American Revolution, coupled with the emphasis on the British perspective, is a refreshing contrast to some of the more serious books I've read on revolutionary history.  All in all, a nice read 
 I chose the 1,000 or so page Wordsworth Classics paperback edition of The Life Of Johnson (ISBN 1 85326 797 x) and was very pleased I did. The book had a nice heft to it, and the print was large enough for a comfortable read. My only major beef with this edition is that Boswell's text is replete with quotations from a variety of languages including Latin, Greek, French, Italian and others, and very few of them are translated into English. Whether the editor assumed that the average modern reader is a polyglot, or was unable to provide the translations for some other reason, I feel deprived at not having had access to this portion of the book's material, particularly as the quotes are most often used to gild the lily of one of Johnson's witticisms. Nevertheless, the book rewards the diligent reader with a wealth of intellectual stimulation, and offers a fascinating look into the England of the period including: polite London society, Oxford University, and jaunts around the British and Scottish countryside. Johnson's somewhat eccentric life and personal habits are lovingly and affectionately relayed by his close friend Boswell, who somehow managed to preserve a vast amount of Johnson's conversation without the aid of a tape recorder. With everyday life as a backdrop, we see how Johnson, a self-described lazy man, managed to produce such an abundant literary legacy, not the least of which was his groundbreaking dictionary. I recommend this book highly to people with an interest in 18th century England, the literary society of the period, or who simply love a great biography 
 This book in worth reading even if you are not associated with any branding activities. Most of the examples are explained with logic (though few examples are debatable) and with great insigt.   Well written book 
 The opportunity to get Twinings Earl Grey in large containers at a very reasonable price was too good to pass up. 
 What can I say I love this movie, it has open my eyes about life in the streets and life as a whole. Its a hardcore movie, you get a message throughout the whole movie. The best part that I can say it was when DMX was going to shoot the muslim man. muslim man talked to DMX and opened his eyes about life. Thats I feel now about life..... 
 My wife and I were married in 1996.  We consider ourselves blessed to have good health, a great relationship together and our wonderful boys. I was 38 and L. was 34 when we married, a bit later than many. Oh well, we were both waiting for the "right" mate.  Our sex life is enjoyable and a big reason why is the Welcomed Consensus videos. One day we'd love to take the classes offered for some hands on workshops.   After the birth of our twin boys, and being middle aged, our quality time together decreased. The videos though, almost single handedly, really charged us up!  The ability to make L. achieve multiple orgasm night after night is really special. Seeing her so pleased is by far the biggest turn on for me. Lying in bed, knowing what is going to happen with lots of digital stimulation, gets me erect, almost throbbing.  As I touch the areas around her clitoris she naturally lubricates while anticipating that special moment when I began to stroke her clitoris and begin to bring her to climax. The longer the gentle stroking continues the more we both want to continue. "Please don't stop" is what I am thinking as she begins to come.    I had never come without stroking or intercourse. About a month ago, in a heightened sense of anticipation I ejaculated without physical stimulation! Holy cow. Coming by DOing her was an unbelievable sensation I thought only women had. The notion of thinking and dreaming about coming without physical stimulus was incredible.  The moment was this: We had been kissing and hugging. I started to play with her crotch until it got real wet. My erection was becoming intense. I continued playing with, sometimes tugging on her clit until it too was rock hard. Our verbal communication of loving and caressing comments was taking me somewhere I had only dreamed about. And then, while L. was in the ecstasy of her third orgasm that night, I came. Lying there playing with her, I shot my load.  What a night!  Just typing this is getting me aroused.  I'm going to let L. read this tonight and we will be off again to new pleasures. Without the DVDs I wouldn't have had the confidence to play so long without wanting some for myself. Kinda stingy, huh? But, orgasm is our right and getting the woman off is where it's at! When your woman comes, and comes again without intercourse its only natural to come with her.   Thanks for reading this, and happy sex! 
 I purchased this product based on other people's reviews to replace the NetGear wireless router that disconnected me every now and then, this Buffalo router has kept me connected ever since I got it 4 weeks ago and I couldn't be happier.  
 In her book on the MMO gaming world, Taylor brings an ethnographic approach to the game Everquest. Through interviews and personal experience, she gives an insight into the gaming world that portrays it for the rich, complex, social world that it is. A gamer herself, Taylor does an excellent job shining new light on the "frowned upon" gaming world. She also goes beyond the gaming world to show how things are connected through the internet and "in real life" to things within the game.  As far as this being too "basic" in covering the genre - this wasn't aimed to be a book only for advanced gamers. For those of the academic world, who have no experience whatsoever with games, the chapters provide sufficient information about the games to allow understanding. The summary/analysis is as comprehensive as it is rich. There are parts that she could have gone further and I do hope she does write a second book (although she does have articles on this topic as well).   All in all, this is an absolutely fantastic book for academics (or just interested people) who want an ethnographic approach to the gaming world that treats it not as a deviant, subersive "alternate" reality. Gamers and academics alike can appreciate it. Think Jenkins' Textual Poachers (written about the fan world) for gamers.   I sincerely hope this is the tip of the iceberg for this serious academic research into the community, social aspects of MMOs 
 I think that NBA Furious Finishes is an excellent movie.  It takes a look at some of the best dunkers and players in the NBA.  I would recommend it to anybody that is looking for an acrobatic airshow 
 This is a fantastic, and very misunderstood film. The concept of virtual reality used in this film is not new, in regards to film or literature, but the screenwriters sure did one hell of a terrific job in putting it together. Moreover, David Cronenberg, not one to shy away from his vision as a director in storytelling, did an absolutely beautiful job with this film. This film is not about special effects [as for advancing the story] but the mind game that Cronenberg uses instead to advance the film. And kudo's to him for doing this!  The virtual reality within the film between Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and Ted Pikul (Jude Law) was totally believable and without a doubt one of the best uses of virtual reality I have ever viewed. They both complimented each other in the film. The writing in this film is incredibly smart. I place this film with "Dark City" as two of the best sci-fi films ever released that never received the attention they should have. Neither one received good reviews initially, and yet both are great!  If you like smart, clever films that keep you guessing, and have surprising elements in them, then this is the film for you. I don't want to give away any spoilers, as I have met many people who have never seen this great film.   I liked the "The Matrix," [first one only] and don't like to see this film being compared with "eXistenZ" as many sci-fi fans do. Each have their own merits. This one is not a 'special-effects' kind of film, it is more cerebral. The idea of people in the game giving up their free will in order to play this virtual reality game is creepy and scary. They are all willing participants, and yet, their willingness to escape their own reality for one less promising and unreal is vitally important and addresses quite a few issues that I won't go into here. Suffice it to say, the film is great. Repeated viewings are recommended, and the ending will hopefully send you into some deep and serious thinking. Highly, highly recommended! [Stars: 5+++ 
 Don't usually write reviews, especially highly rated material, such as New Pearl Harbor by DRG, and I have little to add beyond   GET A COPY OF THIS BOOK AND READ IT.   If you disagree, that's okay. But you may very well learn something.   I did 
 Before Fulci earned his title of the "Godfather Of Gore", which enhanced(and to some, ruined) his reputation, Fulci made this very entertaining giallo film.  I'm not 100% sure, but I believe this film actually got him blacklisted or something back in the 70s.  Duckling is a story about young boys who are being murdered in a small town.  Who's doing it?  Is it the peeping tom village idiot?  The local wizard?  The witch who sticks pins in(and spits on) wax figures of the boys?  The priest?  The priest's shady mother?  The sexy Annette O'Toole lookalike with a thing for drugs and 12 year old boys?  The reporter?  Or maybe the police themselves?  You'll have to watch it to see, and Fulci does a decent job of keeping us in the dark.  Those buying this for that trademark gore we all love will be disappointed.  There are only two real scenes of violence.  One is identical to the whipping scene in the opening of The Beyond, and the other is the killer's demise which looks pretty silly, but still cool.  This film shows what talent Fulci had, and proves that he wasn't a complete hackmeister....only mostly.  I think there are quite a few critics who actually like this one.  Though low on gore, it's far from p.c.  The subject matter is unsettling enough, but there's quite a tantalizing scene that is every boy's dream come to life.  The leading lady at one point throws herself at one of the boys, but the boy's pesky mother interrupts.    Were young boys allowed to act in scenes with naked women?  I suppose they could in Italy in the early 70s.  Watch it, good flick 
 Not to take anything away from my favorite author BUT I thought the book was way too long.  The story was suspenseful and descriptive but I found myself getting lost in the superfluous background. (And this is someone who has read The Stand at least six times so it's not the length of the book that bothered me as much as the length of the storyline.)  Stephen King fans will still enjoy the book but not as much as some others such as The Cell which I thought was great 
 I picked this up at the airport looking for an interesting, easy read during a business trip.  Since I've recently become a fan of cycling I thought this would fit the bill, and it did.   Lance describes, more than anything, his point of view on life after surviving cancer.  He doesn't come across as a do-it-all superhero, but rather as someone who is driven to excel at whatever his passion is, while trying to retain his humanity and stop and smell the roses.  He talks about his work ethic and what it took for him to become a world champion cyclist.  It is helpful at times if the reader is interested in the sport, but I think he covers those topics in a way that anyone would enjoy the stories.  They are about persistence and teamwork and leadership more than the technicalities of racing. I read this book at time when I was personally trying to find some new direction, so this book hit me with the right amount of motivation to move ahead.  Carpe Diem! It's an easy read, and was well worth the time 
 I thoroughly researched shavers before I bought this one.  Consumer Reports was crazy for this model, and Amazon easily had the best deal available online.  My husband is getting a really clean shave--not easy for him--and says he loves it!  
 Microsoft Project receives a lot of unfair criticism from dilletantes that expect it to be as easy to use as Microsoft Word. When they try to use the application without knowing the "whys and wherefores", they get frustrated, and act like the poor workman in blaming their tools rather than acknowledging their own lack of skill.   Help is at hand. This book is a top-notch effort that sets out best practices to make the most effective use of Microsoft Project. The author does not tediously enumerate every last feature. Instead, he lays out a sequence of best practices, chapter by chapter in chronological order, to use the tool. End of chapter summaries and exercises allow one to gain practical familiarity with using the tool. I would rate this publication better than Microsoft's own books on Microsoft Project.   What I like is that the entire book was written by _one_ author. Thus, there is a certain consistency of opinion from chapter to chapter. This becomes obvious compared to the other popular Microsoft Project tome, which, depending upon the edition, has close to a dozen co-authors.   The author's style of writing is a little more verbose than one would expect, but it lends a certain charm and continental color to otherwise dry proceedings. However the typesetting of the book and the choice of fonts could have been better -- it reads like a printed and bound training manual.   To summarize, overlook the typesetting and buy the book. It is a great book for Microsoft Project users of all skill levels (not just for the rank beginner, but the professional as well). 
 Mr.Mango name his book as "The Turks Today". But book mainly focus on near Political history of Turkish Republic. Maybe it is better name the book as "Adventures of Turkish Democracy". His analysis are very objective and clear. Every major event has been mentioned. This book is perfect reference for between 1940 and 2000's. I like to see more chapters about his thoughts on Turkey's future. If you compare this book to "Crescent and Star", Mr.Kinzer's book is more Controversial and provocative.  
 This disc showcases some of Laurel and Hardy's funniest and best silent shorts, and I also found there was more variety in the backing music than in some of the other discs in this series.  'From Soup to Nuts' is hands-down the best and funniest one on here, their funniest silent short I've seen so far.  Part of what makes their sound shorts so funny is the fact that their voices just totally matched their personalities and physical appearance, adding to already funny situations, but in 'From Soup to Nuts' the gags and situations are so hilarious they don't even need speech to add to the hilarity.  'Two Tars' and 'The Second Hundred Years' are also hilarious and classic, very strong material.  The fourth L&H short on here, 'Slipping Wives,' features them together but not really a proper team, though they have more interaction here than in some of their other shorts where they appeared together before being officially teamed.  That one is also very strong and funny.  Of the two Stan solo shorts featured, 'Under Two Jags' (which admittedly might be a mislabeling of a different film, 'Scorching Sands') is the stronger and funnier, despite the fact that there's not a single intertitle besides the introductory one.  In my opinion the weakest one is Stan's final solo short, 'Should Tall Men Marry?'  It's well-written and well-acted enough, but just not as interesting, funny, or solid as the other five 
 This book is one of the best guides to the Tarot that I have read!   It is so much more than just a card-by-card interpretation of the deck, but it provides so much insight into the symbolism and the spiritual side of Tarot.  Everyone is right - this book is The Bible for Tarot 
 I like the format, Ilile the way it flows great job , easy to understand and to follow. 
 This a well written factual study of African civil wars. It clearly addresses the crisis without taking sides or introducing any ideological or other agendas. The chapters on Somalia, Sudan, Uganda, Mozamique and Rwanda  are outstanding. Moreover, the conclouding chapter brings in an outstanding  and fresh perspective. In short this is an excellent book 
 It's a nice little vac for the price.  Great suction power.  We had the old version with the two removable battery cells.  It didn't make sense to purchase new cells since those are almost as much as the new vacuum itself.  I have a cordless drill that they can still operate so that is where they are and the vac is in the garbage.  We're happy 
 This is a beautiful album that reaches into your heart and soul. Snatam Kaur is an angel with a heavenly voice.  It is excellent!!!! I highly recommed it as well as her other CDS 
 Levy has captured the drama and glamour of the sheer novelty of London in the early '60s and, for the most part, rendered it accessible and electric for his readers.  The backstories of Mary Quant and Tara Browne may be new to many readers, but the Beatles and fashion info is already out there in a multitude of other books.  More focus on the lesser-known personalities would have suited this book better, but overall it's a fascinating study of why the British Invasion succeeded and failed 
 This book rocks. It gives tons of background on rap and Eminem and points out instances of incredible timing so you can really appreciate it...you get many, many actual quotes from Eminem and others...the author is sympathetic, not bashing, doesn't seem to have an agenda like so many others. I totally loved this book and am a HUGE Eminem fan. I would also recommend the book Angry Blonde by Eminem himself! He's the master. I LOVE YOU EMINEM! 
 This book is not only an entertaining way to learn Chinese modern history as many of the reviewers here pointed out but also an important personal lessons of survival when we have to deal with a difficult boss for example. Borrowing the language from "7 habits of effective people," it is to focus your energy on your circle of influence and not on the circle of concern. In this book there are countless examples of people who did the latter (voiced their concern about the welfare of China as a nation and the common people) and invited misfortune upon themselves almost without exception. Dr. Li taught us that we must be aware of what we can do and never worry about what we cannot do. 
 lame deer's take on the white man's world is so truthful, poignant, and hilarious, make sure you are at liberty to laugh out loud when you pick it up. every few pages will have you smiling, chuckling, if not uproariously laughing while you put the book down, only to pause and then re-read the section for the pure delight of his frank and funny portrayl of a life as a holy man that ranges from wild and wreckless, somber and lonely, to mild and mature. but it's always funny and insightful! i highly recommend! 
 Picking up this album/dvd in passing, I did'nt know what to expect. What luck, this a very well-done set that really showcases their fine body of work. As far as the dvd is concerned, I was blown away. Some of the things done in editing are perfect, the use of studio footage layered over top of the concert footage is executed without flaw. As for the sound, this is one of the best mixes I've heard with a modern rock act yet. As far as buying this, you should buy this album for "The Fun Machine Took A **** and died" alone. I highly recommend this to anyone who has bought an album from QOTSA in the past, to someone not used to the bands eclectic rock this might further alienate them. But, at around $14 for a dvd and a album you can't really go wrong 
 There are, surprisingly, few solid collections of the Frankfurt School out there.  This is unfortunate, since often the essays produced by these thinkers are more useful to the general reader--even a general academic reader--than the longer works.  And, unfortunately, none of them are very satisfying.  All of these collections lack essential essays, and all of them include numerous throw-aways that are unimportant or unuseful.  And none of them have particularly helpful introductions for the uninitiated.    Nevertheless, this one is probably a better bet than the other two major collections, "Critical Theory: the Essential Readings" and "German 20th Century Philosophy: the Frankfurt School."  If only because it includes Adorno's "Fetish Character of Music," which the others don't. Its principal flaw is the same as the others: the mysterious absence of Walter Benjamin's "Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction."  But overall, its selections are representative and give the reader a good general overview, moreso than the competition at least. 
 Songs like Nik Kershaw's "Wouldn't it Be Good" and The Special AKA's "Nelson Mandela" make this easily the best volume in this 15 volume series.  Nik Kershaw fans beware:  An edited version of  "Wouldn't it Be Good" appears here 
 I finished this book a week ago and I still can't get it out of my head.  It was so sad and sometimes heartbreaking, but also one of the most uplifting books I've ever read.  Every character has some flaw that makes them weird or lonely, but the search to love someone and be loved is so universal, and that is what shines through the book.  
 Firstly It should be noted that this album isn't the usual collection of bittersweet, Autumnal wry Indie Rock & Alternative Pop/Rock songs that the band are usually famed(& applauded) for. That is a markedly radical one off change in direction for the band, instead choosing to focus on obscure covers songs, leaning toward Alt.Country-rock, (the country-esque "Can't forget/Griselda & Here comes my baby"), all subtly reflective & imitate. Before Stopping to include the 60's rock & roll of "Emulsified" (curiously soundly like rock & roll rocker "Monster Mash"), before heading down the indie rock that they earned their musical stripes for ("Speeding Motorcycle/The Summer/Did I tell you). Impeccably paced (The transitions from country/Americana tracks to Alternative/Indie rock is seamless), and It's nigh on impossible not to nod (or even sing) along to what's being played here, and a superbly focused diversion for Yo La Tengo. And more Distressingly a direction that band chose not to the further explore.  So, with the vast majority of fantastic Yo la tengo albums leaning more towards focused Alternative / Indie Rock, this was a beautifully realised deviation for the band 
 i am currently in psychology for the third time,(due to it had been too long between college classess) i think the book is informative and not too hard to read (if you have too! 
 Forget the album as a masterpiece, forget it as a landmark, forget the Stooges, forget Iggy Pop, forget what everybody tells you about this recording, forget yourself in desperate search of the truth and just listen to the most raw human nature ever recorded.. 
 I read my children to sleep with this book every night.  They call it their dream book since they drift off to sleep with thoughts of sand and sea in their heads.  The words draw beautiful pictures 
 I purchased this book with every intention of reading it but after almost a year I had not gotten to it.  Fortunately I was able to get the entire work in an unabridged version on audio cassette.  The subject covered was one that was hardly new to me.  However, Goodwin takes a unique and fascinating perspective that allows the reader or listener to actually feel that they are a part of history.  For those who don't have time to read, consider the audio version. It's well worth the listen 
 I absolutely loved this book!!!  I read it about three years ago, and it's still one of my favorites.  I recommend this book to everyone. This is a book that is very hard to put down once it gets going.  The characters are well developed.  Scary and  thrilling.  An awesome read!!!! 
 I was searching for SCTV when I saw a reference to Due South, a program which I had never heard of before. I read about it and it sounded like a show I would like, so I bought it. My family and I just love it! What a sweet, and hilarious, show. I'm so glad it is available on DVD so that we could see it. It's just a wonderful show with great writing and great acting - quirky, funny, tender and wry - just great. I love Canadian humor so much (Red Green, Martin Short, John Candy, et al., etc...)and this is an excellent example. My only criticism: David Marciano ("Ray Veccio") should be pictured on the DVD cover along with "the Mountie". David Marciano has a wonderful face and the greatest smile and was just terrific and essential to the show. I will buy the seasons with him in them but don't think I will try the later seasons when he was gone. The recurring "bit" with Ray Veccio and his Buick Riviera - wonderful. Love this show! Here we have another example of television when it is good, television how it can be, television how it so very rarely is. Treasure it when it happens. (Northern Exposure, St. Elsewhere, Barney Miller, Rockford Files, 3rd Rock from the Sun, Homicide: Life on the Street, Seinfeld, Dharma and Greg, and others such as these....) 
 This is not about the sexual positions of  sex but  about intimacy in the context of sex.It tells you why you are after it and  how most of the time you  have been or got programmed in Life to not get it. One is also better  off reading his other books before getting this one i.e. `Games People  Play' and `What do you say after you say hello' 
 All people that work's with people have use for  this book.You don't even have to be a counselor to have use for it.The book is easy to read and follow.It gave me a lot of new insight's and has helpt me a lot in my daily  work with humanity. Get it NOW 
 This is quite simply a fabulous book, and a very useful one too! I am an author who writes historical novels, and when I need to know what the characters I'm writing about would have been wearing in any given year from antiquity through to modern times (1930s), I turn to this book. Fortunately, it's not cluttered with text, but merely contains drawings, pure and simple and straighforward. It's the quickest, most accurate reference book I own, aside from my dictionary, of course.  My only qualm is that it doesn't contain anything about undergarments, such as bustles, knickers, petticoats, crinolines or girdles. But then, the pictures in this book are sourced from historical paintings, sculptures, mosaics, illuminated manuscripts and so forth, which probably never showed such things, as they might have been considered indecent or irrelevant. (I suppose not too many people throughout history wanted to be painted in their underwear!)  If you're a writer, an arts student, a costume designer or just someone who has an interest in the history of fashion, I would highly recommend this book to you. 
 Great book.  Backs up advice with meaningful insight.  Other books tend to be limited to "I suggest you do.." whereas Harrington gives reasons for his suggested (and others) style of play with considerations to pot odds, first to act positioning, positioning against conservative and aggressive (and super aggressive) players, stack size etc.  All of these are backed up with useful problems prompting the reader with "What do you do?".  Highly valued, can't wait to start volume II.  
 This book is short but covers the topic well. This is one of the most concise and clear books I have ever read. An excellent piece of writing. 
 'The Dinner Party' is notable - not only for its beautiful art - but also for its amazing synopsis of women in history.  If you are looking for a summary of the multitude of contributions by women, GET THE BOOK.  The art is beautiful, stiking, and magical, the text is equally compelling. Especially recommended for art history, women's studies, et 
 Fortier's book is a wonderful summary of the major theories concerning theater and performance.  He presents a familiarity with everyone from Freud and Hegel to current leading theorists.  I would recommend this book  for anyone interested in critical theory of theater, especially for  students.  Fortier's style is engaging and easy to read 
 I bought this journal for my 4th child.  It is absolutely wonderful!  It has space for everything you need and the pages are decorated in such a lovely way.  It has a place in the front for momentums and it also comes with some little frames to mount your pictures with.  It is a really nice journal and it could be used for either boy or girl.  I highly recommend this item 
 We are now in another one of those periods of revival of interest in, and appreciation of, Jane Austen. There have been at least two films, one cable one commercial, released over the past several years that as based on one of her better novels, The Pride and Prejudice. Ordinarily I have found that films made for cable are inferior to those produced for the commercial film market. Not here. The A&E production is far superior in presentation not the least of which is that it is truer to the Austen story line than the commercial film. Moreover, as an added treat, the film itself is over five hours long and therefore can get a leisurely treatment to Austen's themes of love and life among the early 18th century English `squirearcy'. Despite the length the film moves along with few dull spots.  And what of the story line? Well it seems that certain very rich young landowner, a Mr. Darcy, with just the right connections and, Miss Elizabeth Bennett, one of five daughters of a country squire who estate has been entailed away from any ability to provide for his wife and daughters are smitten with each other. However, long before the romantic tensions can be resolved both parties must endure many trials and tribulations, to speak nothing of personal misunderstandings between them, before they can snuggle down in his little mansion. On a person level this is about pride (naturally) -his- that stood for a long time in the way of unleashing his feelings is an adult way. The prejudice part comes from both parties as both are very class-conscious and committed to the, frankly, snobbish nature of the English gentry. In the end, (since we know that the couple will ride happily into the sunset) that looks at English morals, mores and manners just before the full effects of the Industrial Revolution hit that society is what drives one to watch the movie. Ms. Austen had a very good ear for picking up the language of these `gentle' people.  Damn it though, those times were tough for an independent-minded intelligent young woman with no means. Kudos to Miss Elizabeth Bennett.                   
 This film is a stunning tribute to the memory of all the victims of this tragedy, and to all the heros who contributed to our triumph of the American Spirit 
 "Without Sanctuary" is an amazing, but very upsetting, collection of lynching photographs and some of the stories that go with them. Although the images of the beaten, burned, mutilated, and hung victims are horrible enough on their own, the thing that truly disturbs me about these photographs are the spectators - men, women, and children - smiling, goofing off, and proudly posing in front of the corpses, just as if they were at a Fourth of July picnic or something. It's really frightening to think how cruel and vicious "good god-fearing citizens" behaved not so very long ago (the majority of the pictures date from the 1890's-1930's, though the most recent comes from 1960). I think this book is performing a great service by refusing to allow this country to forget its own barbarities of the not-so-distant past 
 I found this book to provide an interesting historical perspective of the people and events surrounding Jesus, the Christian movement that developed and the followers of Jesus who did not pursue the Christian way.  James Tabor discusses many issues such as:  a.	What does the historical record say of the father of Jesus b.	Matthew and Mark's differing viewpoints of Jesus c.	What was Jesus understanding about the Kingdom of God d.	What role did John the Baptizer play  e.	What light does the Q document shed on matters f.	Of what relevance is the Dead Sea community g.	How did Jesus fulfill prophecy h.	What can be said about the Passover meal i.	Pilate's and the Sanhedrin's role in Jesus death j.	The empty tomb of Jesus k.	Peter and James' roles after the death of Jesus l.	Luke's agenda and Jesus family m.	Pauline theology and its impact on Christianity's development n.	Jesus' dynasty after his death  All these issues and more, which I found intriguing, are explained from what we can determine from the earliest Christian documents and archaeological evidence.  
 The ambition of criticism, it is often said, is to obtain a balanced view of the writer's work that is criticized. But where the work in question is Winter in the Blood this is peculiary difficult, which is illustrated by the great variety of critical response that ranges from Reynolds Price's reaction that it is "a nearly flawless novel" to an unsigned review in the New Yorker which refers to the novel as "an interesting, if seriously flawed first novel." The contrast between these opposite reactions makes clear that the reading of this novel is greatly determined by our experiences with 'Indian' novels, hence with our expectations. The second, in my opinion, 'seriously flawed' reaction is perhaps based on the reviewer's 'tyranny of expectations', reinforced by the fact that Winter in the Blood is indeed confusing with regard to the way it should be approached. On the one hand you feel like falling about with laughter at the excruciatingly funny situations in the book, while on the other hand you try hard to supress that laughter out of respect for the Native's past and present, solely based on our limited view that books by Indian writers cannot be funny because their life and tragic history is not funny. Paradoxically, by being respectful, we are, in fact, disrespectful; by refraining from laughter out of respect for the Indian situation, we are at the same time, unintentionally, disrespectful because we categorize the Native works of art beforehand as serious, angry or whatever term that fits the stereotypical expectations.  Critics have approached the novel anthropologically, sociologically, psychologically, philosophically, politically, oneirocritically, and comically. Whatever the emphasis, all may hold some truth in their approach and therefore an eclectic mixture of these approaches seems to offer the best way of making sense of the novel, or as Thomas Arnold once wrote, "the way to get a great writer understood is not to raise as much discussion about his meaning as possible, but as little as possible," in other words figger it out for yourself 
 Many people are quick to criticize this man, frankly I don't really care if he has been to jail or not. This book is great, full of great tips and common sense. I found it very educational and inspiring. Lots of info on natural remedies and weight loss. I recommend it to anyone with an open mind looking for a natural way of living 
 Many critics have commented on the short, somewhat tragic life of Alexander Pushkin.  He was an outstanding poet as well as a short story writer later on.  This Dover edition of one of his most famous short story,  along with several others, is an economical and excellent way to get  yourself acquainted with one of the earlier Russian masters of literature.   The short stories are memorable for their simplicity in style and tone, yet  poignant and emotional 
 There have many excellent reviews of this movie, therefore, I would only be going over what so many have already written about this wonderful film. What I will say, however, is that this is an excellent movie. This film is a great study in psychological suspense that keeps the viewer guessing as to who the killer is. Spoiler: When the 10 travelers converging at a motel on a rainy night begin to die one by one, and all in a mysterious, and supernatural type way, you begin to wonder if this is some kind of ghost story. On the contrary, we are all in the mind of a serial killer,[Pruitt Taylor Vince] and his split personalities are beginning to merge. The only way for him to succeed in becoming whole again is to discard the make-believe world that his mind has created. Therefore, we witness the killings that are perplexing, and yet real to the mind of this killer. John Cusack gives a good performance as the limo-driver, as does Ray Liotta as the policeman/escaped convict, and of course the role of the psychiatrist [Alfred Molina] trying to prevent the scheduled execution of the aforementioned serial killer, does an excellent acting performance as well. I highly recommend this movie. It is definetly different than many, if not most of the thrillers on the market today.  
 "Magnum P.I." is probably the best idea for a TV show there ever was, and the fourth season certainly does not disappoint.  Many of the show's most rabid fans insist that the show was at its peak during the fourth season.  And this finely-done DVD includes many of the core episodes that made the show so famous.  Here are just some of them:  Episode #41:  "Bow wow ow."  Zeus and Apollo, Higgins's guard dogs, come down with sarcoptic mange and Magnum must use everything at his disposal to care for them and get them to a mysterious vet on distant Kuai.  Episode #42:  "Errrrrr."  Magnum, in a bid to test the security of the Masters's estate, sneaks through Higgins's bedroom window and is suprised to find everybody's favorite major-domo prancing about in women's undies.  Hijinks ensue.  Episode #43:  "Senor Bigote."  Magnum, in a alcoholic cloud, shaves off his famous "more manly than thou" moustache.  Zeus and Apollo don't recognize him and he is seriously mauled upon returning to the guest house.  The local animal control has the dogs put to sleep.  Hijinks ensue.  Episode #44:  "By Any Means Necessary."  T.C., the chummy helicopter pilot, joins the Black Panther party and refuses to ferry Magnum around the islands anymore.  Episode #45:  "Pedal Man."  Robin Masters gives orders that his Ferrari be repainted a hot pink, eliminating Magnum's desire to drive it around.  Henceforth the private eye must conduct his investigations by rickshaw.  (A lot of fans claim that series really took a nose-dive at this point.)  Episode #46:  "BOOM!"  A volcano long thought dormant erupts on the island.  Millions die.  Hijinks ensue.  Episode #47:  "Aloha Mainland."  Hawaii secedes from the U.S.  Civil War ensues, then hijinks 
 Most of us don't want to be packaged for sale like a used car.  If you have ever had a public relations agent, you probably know that the activity can be both unpleasant and fraught with peril.   If you haven't had a public relations agent, you are probably feeling daunted about what's involved in gaining publicity and what you will gain or lose from the experience.    If your situation fits any of those three parameters, this book is for you.   Susan Harrow does an exceptional job of combining   1) the basics of public relations  2) with detailed examples of how to do it while being yourself 3) as she also addresses common concerns.   The book also has an extensive list of resources that is worth the price of the book.  I was impressed by the book's special sensitivity to the issues of being a woman in the public relations arena.  I thought that Ms. Harrow addressed those issues with sensitivity and wisdom, down to addressing Sharon Stone's famous movie scene of recrossing her legs.    Although this book touts itself as a Woman's Guide in the subtitle, I thought the advice was helpful and pertinent to me as a man.  The text is designed to be easy to follow, which I liked.  The main text is listed in process order with clear numbers to direct your focus to each step.  There are boxes with special reminders.  You also have exercises you can use to apply the lessons from the text.    You could work with this book for months, and gain new insights from Ms. Harrow each time you open it.    To me, the most special part of the book came in the many examples of how others have created public relations materials that reflect them, rather than putting some "canned" face forward.  There's a delicious, almost-outrageous quality to some of these examples that loosened me right up in thinking about public relations.  This book has a permanent place in my working library.  I strongly urge you to get your own copy and make this material your own.        
 Love it, love it, love it!!!  Takes me back to the time I was stationed in Germany when I was in the Army.  All his greatest songs are on the CD.  I was hoping they would have pics of KC and his band back in the 70s.  Sure enough, they do.  It's a lot of fun listening to this CD.  I am so happy I bought it from Amazon and so thrilled to own it so I can listen to it over and over again!!!  Thanks, Amazon, for carrying such wonderful music that I can purchase.  Trust me, this won't be the last!!!  Jocelyn Har 
 Autobiographical and historical and cultural all rolled up in one. With the holidays coming up, these great stories and recipes of great african and african-american dishes--dishes from people and lands of color--would go perfectly with each serving of yams, blackeyed peas and rice and collards. Foods of defiance, comfort, strength. Presented by the superb Ntozake Shange. (For my two cents, all the schoolkids ought to be taught how really influential Ntozake was in black entertainment, period, not just literature. But that sounds like a discussion for another review. 
 ****1/2  Don't be surprised if you find yourself throwing things at the screen while watching "Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room," a brilliantly effective and meticulously researched documentary (based on the book by Bethany McLean and Peter Elkind) that is guaranteed to get both your dander and your adrenaline up to dangerously high levels.  Rarely does a real life event provide us with as clear and universally recognized a symbol of a larger social theme as does the fall of Enron, which, in the years since it happened, has come to stand for everything that's wrong with corporate America.  It is the classic tale of corruption and unethical behavior performed in the service of unbridled greed.  That the men responsible for the disaster took so many innocent people down with them is what makes it a tragedy.  In fact, more than one person interviewed for the film draws the parallel between the downfall of Enron and the sinking of the Titanic - an apt analogy if ever there was one, only, in this case, the captains had no intention of going down with the ship, preferring instead to ruthlessly knock over any number of helpless women and children in the desperate race to the lifeboats.   The beauty of the film is that it takes a very complex and convoluted story and makes it completely comprehensible to those of us who might otherwise get lost in the maze of arcane corporate-world details.   The movie introduces us to the key players - primarily CEOs Jeffrey Skilling and Ken Lay, and CFO Andrew Fastow - showing the step-by-step process by which they built the energy corporation virtually from scratch, raised it to the position of seventh largest company in the world, then slowly destroyed it through deceit, hubris and greed - but not, of course, before bestowing obscene multi-million dollar packages on themselves as compensation.  We see how they employed little more than smoke-and-mirror accounting schemes to pull the wool over the eyes of investors, regulatory commissions and fellow employees.  However, the film makes it clear that a large number of "reputable" banks and loan agencies must also have been complicit in the company's malfeasance for all of this to have come off so effectively.     As always, it is the "little guy" who winds up getting shafted.  Probably the greatest hair-pulling section of the film involves Enron's cold-blooded creation and manipulation of California's bogus "energy crisis" in the early 2000's, which drained billions from the state`s treasury, a situation which the newly elected President Bush, ever sympathetic to his buddies in the energy business, refused to help rectify.  Just as bad is the CEOs' callous encouragement of their own lower level employees to invest their retirement savings in the company's 401K plan that the chief executives themselves knew would soon be defunct.  With hissable villains like these around, who needs fiction?  The sole consolation is the fact that the system did work in the end, that the wrongdoers eventually overreached to such an extent that the house of cards they had built finally came tumbling down.  There's certainly a great deal of joy in seeing the creeps responsible for the catastrophe being carted off to jail in handcuffs and sweating under the public scrutiny of a congressional investigative committee.  (It should be noted that the film predates Ken Lay's death in 2006).  The movie also balances the case by highlighting some of the "heroes" in the story, primarily whistleblowers within the company and a resourceful reporter for FORTUNE magazine who was the first to hint in a public forum that Enron might just be the corporate equivalent of the emperor with no clothes.  This is more than just a mere "talking heads" documentary.  It explores the details of the story within the broader context of unbridled capitalism, de-regulation, and corporate corruption.  The movie also shows us how strangely immature the men at the head of this company were, with their frat boy antics and the daredevil activities they indulged in to erase their "nerd" image and to establish their bona fides as real "macho" men.  The fact that individuals of this caliber could spell the ruin of so many trusting people is what gives the movie's title that little ironic kick.  By all means, don't miss this film - though you might want to have a good stiff drink handy for when it's over 
 Does a very good job of going over all the CEH exam objectives in a clear and understandable way.  The test prep software is very helpful.  Whenever you get an answer wrong it gives you a reference to the section in the e-book of where the answer came from and an Internet link to look up.  This book and the Anti-Hacker toolkit does a good job of getting you ready for the test 
 I just accidentally ran across this product when looking for a replacement copy of Gardner's book on fractal music. How delighted I was to find this complete collection of Gardner's works for Scientific American on CD! The Mathematical Association of America that makes this CD apparently doesn't fully appreciate the value of Gardner's work though. Their own review on this product states "I can't think of a better present for a clever 12 year-old, bored undergraduate, restless retiree, or stay-at-home parent". To me, this is somewhat insulting to both Gardner's publications and the individual components of the potential audience that they point out. You would think by that statement that you are getting DVD sets of Bugs Bunny cartoons instead of the priceless gems contained in these publications. I bring this up just in case you run across this description too and get the wrong idea. All of the people mentioned above will enjoy this book, but not for the reasons implied.  Gardner makes math fun, but he doesn't trade depth for amusement. There is some serious math in each of his works, but even his most complex puzzles and chapters can be appreciated and enjoyed by people lacking advanced mathematics backgrounds. Besides the fun of experiencing math from the author's standpoint, there is considerable food for thought that can be the beginning of interesting programming projects, particularly in the realms of graphics and computer music. If you enjoy joining programming with mathematics as I do, Gardner's works are great idea books.   Note that Gardner has written numerous books besides those included in this CD since he left Scientific American. Some of them are on mathematics and puzzles as these works are, but he also has written quite a few essays on pseudoscience, philosophy, and other varied subjects, all using his trademark wit. You might want to check them out 
 You don't need to be a Ph.D to understand the material.  Extremely helpful if you want to improve your communicative effectiveness.  Will teach you how to "read" one's reaction when speaking to them (are they bored, doubtful, etc.) enabling you to react appropriately.  Highly recommended for job search interviews 
 This book is very well written and interesting from beginning to end. It educates the reader about both Buddhism and Judaism and has a little glossary at the back to help with the foreign terms. A new way of thinking abt religious pluralism is presented that the entire world would do well to adopt. That perhaps this pluralism is God's will and we should overcome our stereotypical notions of other religions to grow closer to God. I found the Dalai Lama's sense of humor to be very entertaining and would like to learn more about him 
 This is one more of Konstantinos fully comprehensible books. The beginner on ceremonial magick will find all he needs to know in order to begin summoning spirits, both on the astral and the physical plane. One of the things I didnt like is that the author avoids giving information on Invocation, considering it to be dangerous. A good choice for any ceremonial magician. 
 This one of the more righteous books in the author's oeuvre and that is saying something!  The subject matter is closely akin to a course I took in Freshman year however it excludes manifolds and operatoins on them.  In this respect, the book is not as good as some others out there for an integrated view that even a frosh can grasp.  However, overlooking this shortcoming, the text is definitely righteous, being one of the few out there with this integrated approach and being a classic of sorts 
 This novel is actually one of Crichton's better creations. Crichton tries to write the events of the epic poem Beowulf in a believeable manner. And for a man who has made the eventual rise of dinosaurs believable to we skeptics (no tropical savanna locked in glacial ice necessary), he pulls this stunt off as well. He presents the information from the perspective of Ibn Fadlan, an emmissary from Babylon. With footnotes and such (and the fact that Ibn Fadlan was a real travel historian), the book is confusing until you realize that almost all of it is entirely made up.   It is a fascinating view of the Norsemen and times. So what makes this novel science fiction rather than historical fiction? Crichton's  basis for "Grendel." I won't ruin the surprise, but, again, its highly plausible and entertaining. Posits some possible and believable origins for the Beowulf epic 
 drucker understands the politico-economic realities that drive us all nuts, but he measures it up with magnanimity. the knowledge society--for a knowledge worker his description can actually be somewhat humbling. no more comparing yourself to the laborers as if you've risen above. you depend on others for your living and various forces work against you. i love the way drucker shrugs off government stupidity. he sees through all the hype and hubris, but neither complains nor lectures. ok, sometimes he's a bit dry or bombastic. the originator of the business book style, so cut him some slack 
 MGM's film of KISS ME KATE was an exception for them.  They only deleted two numbers, but used one of those in background scoring. To make up for it, they interpolated a number from another Porter show, FROM THIS MOMENT ON.   MGM's usual method was to select no more than ten songs from a musical and fit it into a 110 minute running time. The performances here are all exceptional, the orchestrations are bright and vivacious - a vast improvement over the originals, and the sound is excellent.  The CD has filled out the time allotted by using outtakes and scene underscorings.  An impressive piece of film musical history and the best recording of the score 
 To the person who said "save your money and buy a Sisters of Mercy cd instead," I just have to shake my head.  Come on now, are you serious?  I really love Paralysed Age, they have a very dark, passionate sound that's unlike any other band out there.  I also love how their music is inspired by the stories of Edgar Allan Poe, evidenced by their songs "Berenice" and "Morella's Sleep."  Paralysed Age are both Romantic and Gothic, and I really miss the Romantic side of goth, which, thanks to these talented Germans, continues to live on.  One of the best songs on here, besides "Morella's Sleep," includes "Nocturne," and the very moody, dark, and romantic "Tears Are Always The End."  Perhaps this sounds biased, but Germans have a long history of Romanticism in their cultural background, and Paralysed Age embodies this Dark Romanticism, set to modern "gothic" music, to perfection 
 This is an absolutely indespensible book for those of us who are really into rock and roll. The chapters on Creation, Love, Hampton Grease Band and a few others make this a necessary purchase. I do agree with some pundits  who note that there are some artists included who are hardly  `unknown'...and apparently there are no Canadian `unknown legends'...but  those are very minor quibbles. Highly recommended 
 This is a very practical book with several subjects on gunsmithing pistols and revolvers. It is part of a series of 3 books on the gunsmithing subject from patrick sweeney. I suggest you get them all. The 11-9 attacks have left a great impact on information available on the internet, and soon they will be going for the books so get them now you still can 
 A phenomenal description of the basics in physics and science. Hawkings new version is a tell all for Science beginners such as myself. After years of not understanding or not putting effort into understanding science I now have an excellent overview of why and how we exist. Definitely a great read 
 I enjoyed reading Rae Lindsay's book.  I really like her writing style. It was a light read and anyone interested in lefties should read this book! 
 This is definately my favorite book. It is light, hilarious and such a joy to read.  I tried to put off finishing it, trying to extend my pure delight in reading it, but I couldnt keep myself away, so I finished it rather quickly. However, I still longed for more and began to read it agian. The story is true, well written and fun.  The adventures Cornellia and Emily have during their first trip to Europe will literally make you laugh until you cry.  I wished I could be one of the girls, along for their trip, until I realized I was there as well, enjoying it as much as they were. Cornelia and Emily are the perfect companions for such a trip, and it was so kind of them to share it with us.    This is one of those books that become dear friends, and anyone who has not yet read it must do so now, or else they will miss out on the greatest trip of their lives 
 Holly Brook's CD is wonderful. She has a tremendous voice, great lyrics, and a great sound range (meaning that her sound is somewhat eclectic). She reminds me just a little of Jonatha Brooke -- and if you're not familiar with her music, get it 
 I hated to see this series cancelled. It was great, different from all the other shows out there. Thankfully it is out on dvd, with episodes that were not aired on t.v. I like to think of the 12 episodes a a mini seroes of sorts. Although it does leave the watcher wanting more, it sort of ties itself up nicely 
 Mrs.Hildreth did an excellent job on her first novel. Savannah from Savannah captured me from the beginning and held me to the end. I especially enjoyed the way she included names and places familar to us. I have been a huge fan of Jonathan Pierce's for years so I was thrilled each time his name came up. I have never been to Savannah, GA  so I learned a lot about the city. Southern women on the other hand, I do know about and this book captures the truth about us... we can be fisty....If only I had a little bit of their grace. The previous reviewer mentioned not reading the end of the book, yet predicted how it ended. How can that be if they didn't finish the book?  Read it to the end and you will be glad you did. Then grab Savannah Comes Undone for some more fun with Savannah from Savannah. You will be surprised what other things you learn about yourself on the journey. She and "Vicky" are true southern ladies:- 
 Beautiful scent, not too strong and long lasting. I am complimented on it constantly. Highly recommend 
 My first Catherine Wheel disc was "Happy Days", and while I do like that album, I picked this up because I was craving more of the shoegazer type sound. For the most part this is what I wanted. The infamous "Black Metallic" was the initial highlight, but after more listens I like most everything. "Indigo Is Blue" and "She's My Friend" are both wonderful, and I love "Tumbledown" and "Bill And Ben". However my current favorite track is easily "Flower To Hide", possibly because it reminds me alot of a good Lush song. Overall I hesitate to call it the masterpiece some do, but it is damn good. Now if they could just drop a "Best Of" album 
 Very good product, nice case to move around with. I would have given a 5 star rating but the volume slide control only lowers the volume and doesn't totaly turn down the sound in case you need to hear something around you going on, but most others don't even have that. The sound is great. I would recommend them and the price is good 
 I recently re-read ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA prior to attending The Colorado Shakespeare Festival's performance of the ambitious play under the summer stars here in Boulder. Drawn from Sir Thomas North's 1579 English version of Plutarch's Lives, William Shakespeare (1552-1616) produced this romantic tragedy late in his career, around 1607, and published it in the First Folio in 1623. It tells the story of a doomed romance between two charismatic lovers, Roman military leader, Marc Antony, and the captivating Queen of Egypt (and former mistress of Julius Caesar), Cleopatra. When his wife, Fulvia unexpectedly dies, Antony is summoned from Egypt to Rome to mend a political rift with Octavius by marrying his recently widowed sister, Octavia. Of course, this news enrages passionate Cleopatra. She vents her anger on the messenger, but is quick to realize that Octavia is no real rival to her when it comes to beauty. However, Antony soon follows his heart back to Cleopatra's arms, abandoning his new wife in Athens. This leads to war, when Octavius declares war on Egypt. After Octavius eventually defeats Antony at Alexandria, Cleopatra sends a false report of her suicide, which prompts Antony to wound himself mortally. Antony dies in his lover's arms, and rather than submit to Roman rule under the new Caesar (Octavius), the heart-broken Cleopatra asks to have a poisonous snake delivered to her in a basket of figs. In the end, ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA is as much about new sparks re-igniting the flames of love as new political forces supplanting old political regimes. It is a play that reminds me that it is perhaps better to re-read and understand Shakespeare than to devour one bestseller after the next.     G. Merritt  
 i don't want to write an over analyzed review of this soundtrack But what i do want to say is if you're looking to hear the same great music that you heard in the movie& music that made you look this CD up in the first place...you've got it here! you will be able to draw visuals of the movie while listening to it. from Brad Pitt's bar lounge scene to the ending scene in front of the fountain in Vegas...don't over analyze this CD...it's fun and contains all the great tunes from the movie!!! if you're a fan of the Ocean's movies...but this CD!! 
 A good friend told me that this was the best book she had read in years!  I am in total agreement and I will be urging fellow readers to savour the delights of Midnight at the Dragon Cafe with the same fervour.  Judy Fong Bates's first novel allows one to not only explore the world of the Chinese/Canadian restaurant/greasy spoons that were in every community across Canada, but also discover the loneliness, passions, joys and heartache that were experienced by those who ran the restaurants. The story of young Su-Jen and her family striving for a better life in Canada is a beautifully haunting tale told by a master storyteller.  I couldn't recommend it more highly 
 Like a master weaver, D.G. White threads his way through an enormous amount of literature on alchemy, hatha yoga and tantra in medieval India.   Written with wit, erudition, and non-sectarian distance from (if evident  sympathy for) his subject, this work is indispensible for anyone interested  in hatha yoga, alchemy, ayurveda or Tantra.  Be aware that this is a  scholarly work, not a "how-to" users guide-but if only other  scholars wrote with such wit and passion!  Anyone who still believes that  Tantra is about "sacred sexuality" with a loving partner will be  cured by reading about the ritual consumption of semen and menstrual blood  in historical Tantric cults, including Abhinavagupta's Trika (pp. 137-139).   As the siddhi from this bitter rasayana, one will come to recognize the  idealized beautiful bodies adorning the covers of contemporary yoga  journals, as descendants of the Siddha alchemical quest for bodily  immortality:  Hatha yoga is tantric alchemy.  The writing can be dense at  points-especially the occasionaly tedious chapter on "Tantic and  Siddha Alchemical Literature".  Otherwise, it's a fascinating read,  covering everything from the 9 historical Naths to cosmological homologies  between geography, bandhas asanas and other aspects of the subtle body in  hatha yoga, and various alchemical and Ayurvedic substances and practices.   And don't be put off by the size of the book: its 596 pages include fully  178 pages of scholarly notes and another 76 pages of references and index,  leaving a mere 352 pages of incredibly fascinating reading.  One can only  hope that the author, perhaps when older and less bound by scholarly  demands-a sannyasin?-might expand upon his fascinating personal experiences  seeking alchemists in contemporary Nepal.  May his researchs long  continue...!   [Jjely@Bigfoot.com 
 ..without jessica alba.let's imagine the same film as "the deep" with jacqueline Bisset...a real sexy looking woman not a " teenager chica lookalike"with very poor acting..It seems the same director had a better choice in "blue crush". The rest is absolutly great and represents a great moment of adventures. buy i 
 I read several reviews about beginning cartooning books for my 7-year-old son and ended up purchasing this book and he loves it. I would recommend this book for any child who has an interest in cartooning 
 Unlikely to actually happen, the event which begins this book still leads to an very interesting look into the way that a number of people are affected for years by a very quick and unplanned decision.  Everyone in this book is multi-dimensional and likeable because you grow to feel like you know what motivates them.  The protrayal of the growing up years for a person with Down's Syndrome is very well done--one sees the strengths as well as the limitations.  I thought some of the resolutions of the years of keeping a secret were a bit simplistic and convenient but other than that, I enjoyed this book a lot.  Well worth reading 
 Having grown up in Africa i learned to read in bulgarian when i moved bacl home in garde 6.This is the first time we studdy the book in school.I had barely learned now to read and i found it honestly boreing.The second time we studdied the book was at the end of hightschool and I absolutely fell in love with the book.Its an amazing peace of literature.Its a source for pride for my coutry.I bought it for my bf(who is canadian) and he was really impressed by it.. 
  I'm amazed at how diverse a writer Michael Crichton is. I really liked the concept of this book.   Man builds a spaceship in the future, to leap across space and gather data. It returns back to earth in the past due to an error.    The spaceship not only creates a paradox, it also brings something back from its distant journey. Great story. 
 Just lift the cover to this lovely book and the endpaper has a quote from George Orwell's 1946 book 'Politics and the English Language' What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? Could I have put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidably ugly? Although he was referring to writing I feel these thoughts could easily apply to publication designers and Derek Birdsall's book is a fine visual example of putting them into practice.  I thought the clever thing about the book was the way it explains design by using examples of Birdsall's work, so you get to see plenty of his spreads and their presentation is the design explanation.  The two chapters, 'The process of book design' and 'Book design in practice' covers a whole range of creative solutions.  Throughout he offers thoughts and practical observations with the second chapter devoted to many spreads from books and here I found perhaps the most fascinating section, his re-design of 'Common Worship, Services and Prayers for the Church of England'.  Surely the ultimate creative (and intellectual) challenge, 860 pages, type only and two colors.  As a publication designer I've always maintained that the most rewarding   jobs are the simplest in appearance, airline timetables or tax forms for instance, where the creative resources are limited yet the information conveyed needs to be totally unambiguous.  Birdsall's design solution to 'Common Worship' looks so right that you are not aware of the design and that is just as it should be.  The back of the book has sample text settings (in foreign languages, too) and some very hands-on information about grids for books.   'Notes on book' design is beautifully produced and printed and a first-class review of a leading book designer's work. I think it looks so good I've added it to my Listmania, 'My favorite well-designed books' list.  ***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover. 
 While there are a number of books with marvellous content about the theory of communities of practice, this is the one that I go back to over and over again for practical, step-by-step guidance.  I have used and recommended this book often.  It is the manual I employed when I created my first formal community of practice in early 2004 - and that community is still going strong and growing, even though I am no longer working with that organization 
 	As adorable as it is, it's hard to report on it.  Merton here captures nearly 150 snippets of life in the desert, stories from the early church hermits.  It is entirely narrative, ranging from sentence-long to page-long vignettes about the lives of those who sought to know on the Lord.  At first I though I would list the numbers of all the stories that I found significant or inspirational, but soon the list became so long that it was just a senseless string.  My copy is now very dog-eared.  	Given that, like the narratives of the Bible, there is a clear intention of teaching you something without a clear summary of what was taught, perhaps the best summary is a highlight of the themes that stand out. Humility seems to be the key virtue of the desert.  Removing one's self from the world and society is a way of preventing one's self from being distracted from vanity.  All of the promises of earthly life draw one into considerations of personal gain rather than into an honest assessment of one's place before God.  Even within the monastery, monks should avoid bragging about themselves or their sacrifices.  	Secondarily, but not independently, is a flight from money.  The monk is to give away his last two pence so as to be free from worry, savings, and distraction.  They live on little food, mostly bread.  	Lack of judgment of others is a key value.  Repeatedly the stories that Merton has collected warn us that we have no basis on which to evaluate others.  Beautifully, the stories lead us to evaluate ourselves without pointing fingers our way.  Instead, the monk must excel in forgiveness.  	It's not without humorous moments, though subtle.  When a monk declares (proudly) that he does not need to work because he is so dedicated to prayer and study of God, the other monks don't call him down at dinner time.  	As far as pragmatic application to my ministry, it is rare that I hear the call to humility and self-surrender.  As I carry these stories around, they will shape the way I react to others.  	I love this book 
 IT IS A PITY THIS DVD WAS NOT PRODUCED WITH DTS EFFECT AS I HAVE A LASER DISC 10 YEARS AGO WHICH BROUGHT ME EXCITEMENT THROUGH STEREO SURROUND.  IN FACT ALL THE CASTS UNDER THE DIRECTORSHIP BY PHIL JOANOU WERE STUNNING.   NO DOUBT ALEC BALDWIN HAS BEEN PERFORMING EXCELLENT IN ALL ASPECTS SINCE " RED OCTOBER "   HE IS ONE OF THE GREATEST ACTORS IN THIS CENTURY NO MATTER WHAT CRITICS SAID 
 As a long-term quality assurance professional, I was pleased to find in Fusion Management a book that does a good job of describing the chronological progression of, and linkages between, the various quality assurance paradigms and programs, e.g., Reengineering, Lean, ISO 9000, TQM, Six Sigma, etc.      Dr. Marash describes the components of the programs and evaluates and recommends specific elements of past programs for incorporation into current quality program thinking.   After a good review of quality history, Dr. Marash offers a compilation of the better elements of the better quality programs and describes how they can be synergistically integrated.    He concludes with a step-by-step description of how to perform Fusion Management in your own company by identifying, selecting and integrating the "best of the best" in quality programs.   This is a solid and well-presented book chocked full of quality information 
 What a lucid and lovely book Marilyn Johnson has written. Spiritually, I'm an agnostic, so I read Johnson's first chapter -- a riff on karma -- with vague annoyance. By the time I had finished her sixth chapter, "Ordinary Joe," it was everything I could do to keep from crying. Johnson makes it very hard not to get swept up in her prose and her passion. On one level, Johnson has merely written a diligent and textured account of the lives of working journalists as reflected by this one particular tribe of obituary writers -- their motives, traditions, methods, insecurities, biases, sentimentalities, penances and triumphs. This alone is quite valuable. But Johnson aims even bigger and she hits her mark. How does one measure the value of a life? What does it mean to do this, for a living, on deadline?  One of my favorite writers is The New Yorker's Lawrence Weschler. Weschler has an interesting way of describing his own stories. "At first the piece may not seem to be about anything more important than the sheer fizz and pleasure of story-telling," he says. "Later on it may reveal itself, from the side, as being about the most important thing in the world." It's the same with Johnson's book: an apparently odd and eccentric topic has blown up to the size of the universe 
 I'm not much for the Fantasy genre, but I'm a diehard fan of Lois' Miles Vorkosigan 'Space Opera' series. Therefore, it took me a while to get to reading *Curse of Chalion*.  Bujold's first foray into fantasy, *The Spirit Ring* was a decent initial effort into the genre for Lois, but it suffered from its medieval setting--it wasn't fantastic enough.  *Curse of Chalion* is first-rate, for several reasons.  The author creates an interesting new world with a theology based on five gods.  Bujold goes beyond giving the gods names and purposes, but forms customs and rituals that are different, interesting, and believable.  Political intrigue, another Bujold writing strength, comes from without and within.   Cazaril, the protagonist goes through a rags-to-spiritual riches ordeal to help save the Royacy of Chalion.  If you are looking for Miles Vorkosigan here, you'll be only slightly disappointed, because Cazaril will give you an appetite for a different kind of hero.  I, myself found Cazaril a bit humble and drab at first.   But he is a noble and honest character, with a strong sense of duty, who grows more brave and admirable as you turn the pages.    Some critics said the dialogue is not up to Bujold's Vor series standards, but that's because we're used to Miles Vorkosigan's witty repartee.  Cazaril may be as courageous as Miles, but is more contemplative and not quite as glib.  Bujold's characters are seldom flat and lifeless, except perhaps for the villains.  In *COC* she does not falter. Her characters are likable, real, and fully-formed as always.   Cazaril is courageous and noble.  Royesse Iselle is a new member of Bujold's pantheon of strong and independent female characters.    *COC* is worth pursuing for its own merits, if not to warm you up for its superlative 'sequel', *Paladin of Souls 
 Any child with a sensitivity to animals would find the violence in this 1955 groundbreaking British animated feature very disturbing; many of the farm animals suffer terrible cruelty at the hands of both Farmer Jones and the pigs that succeed him, so parents should use care and discernment since sometimes this film is represented as a "cartoon".  The script is based on George Orwell's "Animal Farm" and retains much of its brilliance, and is narrated by Gordon Heath, with character actor Maurice Denham speaking all the animal parts.  Orwell wrote "Animal Farm" with the Stalinist Soviet Union in mind, but the tale could apply to any totalitarian regime, many which start with the socialistic "one for all-all for one" idealism and propaganda. The animation is fairly simple compared to what one is used to today, but the images are powerful, and very moving. The plight of Boxer the horse and his devoted friend Benjamin the donkey is wrenching, and beautifully drawn. The sound effects are also excellent, as well as the score by Matyas Siber, which has some songs that imitate the Soviet military style, with one of them cleverly vocalized by animal sounds.   This film is now in public domain, and there are some DVDs issued at a rock bottom price, which don't include the extras; I have one that has a fairly good transfer, with an adequate (considering the price) color reproduction of its Technicolor hues.  Directed by Jay Batchelder and John Halas, this one is a classic, but too dark and upsetting for young children. Total running time is 73 minutes. 
 I've lost count how many times I've read this book, I loved it that much. At first reading of the Harry Potter books I was intrugied, but still couldn't quite understand the crazed obession I was witnessing around me. But that all changed the moment I open this book. I was gripped from the first mention of the elusive Sirius Black and rarley put it down from then on. This book was so much darker than the others...Harry's fLair for his childish misadventures were long gone, he was faced now with true danger, and the true darkness of the story began to set in.   The characters gain much more depth, and new wonderful one are introduced. Sirius Black quickly become my favorite literary character of all time. Each time I read this book I am moved to chills and tears 
 Schonberger opened the door to Japanese manufacturing techniques almost twenty years ago.  Now, he looks at the primary indicator of mfg. performance - inventories - and proves how our early Just-in-time and Lean improvements gave way to bad practices and inventory growth.  Using his data base of several hundred companies, he shows which ones fell down, which ones gained ground, and what needs fixing.  An important piece for a confused and painful time in industry 
 Enjoyed it.  Am a fan of Mrs. M/Pewter/Tucker etc. and crew.  It was a good read 
 Melissa Fay Greene leads her readers on the achingly beautiful journey of a woman who finds herself when all is lost.  She seamlessly weaves painful, ugly facts with heart wrenching hope.  With a writing style allows you to imagine this story is being whispered in your ear, this tale will haunt you.   
 Many recepies from this book have become family favourites. Try the roasted salmon or the chicken with red wine vinegar. Both are beautiful 
 Amazing.  Absolutly amazing.  Vince young baby! 
 Turtle Island is probably Gary Snyder's best known book - an award winning  book.  The "museum piece" teaser in the review summary refers to  the short essay at the end of the book arguing cogently for a reduction in  population, a more communal life style, etc. - a piece well written in its  time but one that has portions which need rewriting in light of the  increased opportunities for recycling etc.  The poetry, however, does stand  the test of time.  Snyder's poetry reflects the directness of Zen poetry -  his nature is real nature not nature conjured up for imagery or  "concreteness".  His knowledge of mythological symbols -  including Turtle Island - is deep; his is not a superficial borrowing.   Gary Snyder would be on my short list of "most know" poets and  Turtle Island is a good place start becoming familiar with his work 
 By my Green Candle !!  Jarry is very difficult to translate from the French, so be sure to read and compare various translations to really get the feel, if you don't read French. Well worth the effort, and this volume is a fine place to start 
 From 1831 to 1836 Charles Darwin, then a young man in his twenties, was  the official naturalist on the Royal Navy ship HMS Beagle. The Beagle spent  five years completing a survey of the coasts of South America and making a  series of longitude measurements around the world.  This proved to be one  of the most important scientific voyages of the 19th century, for it  was  on this voyage that Darwin made the observations that lead, twenty years  later, to his formulating the theory of evolution by means of natural  selection. This book is Darwin's account of his observations on this  voyage. Darwin was a master of detailed observation, and he describes the  things he observed -- the plants, animals, geology, and people -- in loving  detail. His accounts are always lively and full of interest. Darwin was  also a master of inductive reasoning,  and there are several superb  examples of this in this book. Perhaps the finest is Darwin's induction of  the cause of the formation of the coral atolls that dot the South Pacific  and the Indian Ocean (his theory was proved correct in the 20th century).  Indeed, much of the value of this book for the modern reader lies in the  many examples it contains of scientific, inductive thought; a powerful  method of reasoning that is as neglected today as it was in Darwin's time 
 "The Times They Are A-Changing" the title song of the album is a song that will have you questioning your values, questioning your complacency. "The Ballad of Hollis Brown" and "The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll" will just plain make you mad. "North Country Blues" will make you weep for the coal minors and iron workers and those less fortunate. And "With God on Our Side" A song that Bob Dylan used to perform with Joan Baez a lot a long time ago will make you think. Every word in these songs is significant, every word important. This is another of those Bob Dylan records everybody should own. It should be like a rule 
 I thought this book would be boring because I am not generally interested in archetecture, but it wasn't.  I found myself being absorbed and actually learning about a topic that I didn't know much about.  I highly recommend this book and will share it with my students.  
 The now 13-year old criminal mastermind, Artemis Fowl, is up to new tricks, and more terrific adventures. Too short but a good read 
  Carla works for a property developer's where she excels in being unattractive, unappreciated and desperate. She is also deaf.   Her boss offers to hire in somebody to alleviate her heavy workload so she uses the opportunity to secure herself some male company. Help arrives in the form of Paul, a tattooed hoodlum fresh out of prison and clearly unsuited to the mannered routine of an office environment.   An implicit sexual tension develops between the two of them and Carla is determined to keep him on despite his reluctance to embrace the working week. When Carla is edged out of an important contract she was negotiating by a slimy colleague she exploits Paul's criminality by having him steal the contract back. The colleague quickly realises that she's behind the robbery, but when he confronts her, Paul's readiness to punch people in the face comes in handy too - but this thuggery comes at a price.    Paul is given a `going over' by some mob acquaintances as a reminder about an unpaid debt. He formulates a plan which utilises Carla's unique lip reading abilities to rip-off a gang of violent bank robbers. It's now Carla's turn to enter a frightening new world.  The fourth feature from director Jacques Audiard, `READ MY LIPS' begins as a thoroughly engaging romantic drama between two marginalised losers only to shift gears halfway through into an edgy thriller where their symbiotic shortcomings turn them into winners. The leads are excellent; effortlessly convincing us that this odd couple could really connect. Carla's first meeting with Paul is an enjoyable farce in which she attempts to circumnavigate his surly reticence and jailbird manners only to discover that he was, until very recently, a jailbird. Emmanuelle Devos, who plays Carla, has that almost exclusive ability to go from dowdy to gorgeous and back again within a frame. Vincent Cassel plays Paul as a cornered dog who only really seems at home when he's receiving a beating or concocting the rip-off that is likely to get him killed.  Like many French films, `READ MY LIPS' appears, at first, to be about nothing in particular until you scratch beneath the surface and find that it's probably about everything. The only bum note is a subplot concerning the missing wife of Paul's parole officer; a device that seems contrived only to help steer the main thrust of the story into a neat little feelgood cul-de-sac.   It was the French `New Wave' of the 60's that first introduced the concept of `genre' to film making and I've always felt that any medium is somewhat compromised when you have to use a system of labels to help define it; so it's always a pleasure to discover a film that seems to transcend genre, or better still, defy it.  
 Now I can chop or shred anything for my salads!  Great product, I recommend it 
 I like this workout routine, it is not too difficult and has plenty of variety.  The another great feature is the host.  She is welcoming and very encouraging -- "You can do this, you are strong".  :-)  It really helps me get through the routines.  A 
 I'm going to be an intern in IBM starting June and I was told to read this book as an introduction to what Gerstner did with IBM.  Quite honestly, all I knew of Gerstner was the simple fact that he turned around an ailing IBM and made it into the company it is today. This book certainly gave me more insight into the workings of the company and the man who changed the way it worked.  What struck me most is that I felt like I was learning to hold on to the reigns of IBM as Gerstner described he did.  He not only mentioned that he was unfamiliar with the technology coming in as the CEO, but also the large diaspora of products and services it touched.  It felt like both he and I were learning about IBM in that regard, which is something I liked.  As a first time reader, I appreciated the fact that I wasn't lost in the daily business jargon and it made me want to read more.    Now like a lot of reviewers have mentioned, it's a self congratulatory work, and he makes no qualms about it.  But why should he be modest? He doesn't discredit others when the names need to be mentioned, then why should he leave his name out? After saving a nearly dying 'national treasure' from a never returning point, I think he deserves it all.  He also mentions how he had to fire over 130 thousand people and lay down the law when it came to enforcing his way.  He didn't hide the fact that he was stern, ruthless, and straightforward with his methods, because they were ultimately methods that worked in a big big manner.  Obviously, this is a one sided account of the IBM story of the 90s.  But it is a good one-sided story.  At the end of the day, the story ends happily, and that's what counts 
 Sepultura were one of the most influential discoveries for me as a budding metal player and fan in the late '80s. "Arise" was, and still is, for me, a timeless and progressive metal classic, and my most lasting influence in the death metal style. After losing singer Max Cavalera to his project Soulfly, Sepultura seemed to drift a bit, album after album seemed uninspired and uninteresting to me....  Then in 2006, the avant-garde, intellectual and political "Dante XXI" comes along. This is exactly what this band needed to reinvigorate their sound, and it is one of the best and most artistic metal releases this year. A loose storyline juxtaposes modern society alongside Dante's literary legacy, and everything from the eerie soundscapes insterspersed between songs to the surreal and graphic comic-inspired artwork really works together to propel this release to epic, cinematic conceptual  heights. Heavy and impassioned playing and absolutely feral singing from vocalist Derrick Green also put this one over the top. A fine job from a very influential band for me, and a huge step in the right direction. I am now looking forward to the next Sepultura album, which is something I haven't said in a long time....nice job, guys 
 I own over 500 cds i recently went through my collection with a could couple friends, they wanted to know what I thought were the 10 best. This was in my top 10 this is a beatuiful and amazing album, Howie's latest release was good but didn't come close to being as amazing as Australia 
 FLESH AND THE DEVIL A Novel By Kola Boof/Reviewed by Patrick Wolmar (*****) FIVE STARS  [...] The story begins as the planet earth is being created by a war between the Sea and the Sky and in order to create land, so that they can "touch"--the Sky and Sea throw one of the two moons down to earth and out of that comes Africa and our eternal lovers, Shango Ogun and Princess Ife Ife.  The author brilliantly weaves their journey through thousands of years of passionate love and tragic circumstances as they battle to be together and to overcome the forces of a curse that the moon has put on mankind.  What I loved about the story was that the Moon was such a believable villain (raping Namibia and making her pregnant with the first WHITE baby).  The twists and turns of the African portion of the novel, the first half, were my favorite because Boof writes so beautifully and poetically about life, love and tragedy in Africa.  She also sets up this historical novel's powerful storyline by showing you exactly what led to "slavery" and how the Africans both fought against it and sold out to it.  Kofi Hoodi (a King) and King Katanga (who opposes slavery) are brilliantly etched portraits that set the stage for Queen Ambi (keeper of the bees) to camp it up and be a symbol of black women's strength, beauty and earthiness.  I L-O-V-E-ed me some Queen Ambi, especially when she led her people into battle against the whites.  The sad part that was hard to get through was the slavery scenes when the Europeans tricked the coastal Africans and took over their lands.  This had some gut-wrenching scenes that made me cry, especially the enslavement of Mother Iyanla and her grandson.  Skip to 1993  The book picks up as all the Africans from the first half are now African Americans, mostly living in Washington, D.C.  The ill fated African lovers, Shane and RooAmber, who were both jet black chocolate in the first half---are now light brite yellow and struggling with racial identity.  Both are married to white people (although a secret later on reveals that one of them aint so white as we thought).  The writing in this portion becomes slicker and more commercial or let me put it this way---reading the first half of the novel was like reading Gloria Naylor or Toni Morrison, but the second half is like reading Terry McMillan AT HER VERY BEST.  Shane's white wife Rosaria is especially off the hook.  A superior, colorstruck "Puerto Rican" CAUCASIAN (OK???), but Kola Boof is such a good writer that she still makes you feel and care about Rosaria, because some major tragedy strikes and she can't stand losing her husband to a black woman (RooAmber, who turns his world upside down, even though she tried to resist cheating on her White husband).  The second half sounds like a soap opera, but it's not.  The social issues that Boof raises and the powerful way inwhich her characters come to grips with love, heritage and responsibility is rich enough--but when SULA JONES'S character takes off at the end and presents a vision of the future for black people and black love, the book becomes pure masterpiece IMO.  I loved it.  It's the kind of book that makes you believe in love again, it makes you proud to be black, and for those of us who are "GAY", there's even a strong gay presence in the book, both in ancient Africa and in the present, culminating at the end with a "gay wedding".  THAT groundbreaking fact is why I gave Miss Kola the whole five stars, because she definitely takes risks with this story and when it comes to a passionate, hot, sexy BLACK love story---she delivers big time.    I got nothing but praise for this book.  It's totally unpredictable and totally beautiful.      
 While I love fantasy and science-fiction, I am very hard to please.  I spend hours looking through books looking for something that hooks me and when I find an author I like I try and read everything they've written.  Patrick Rothfuss is now on my must-read list.    I picked it up because Tad Williams' sang its praise and after reading the book I cam here to Amazon and found Robin Hobb's positive comments.  If you love their books as I do, you'll be happy to know they are sincere.  The book is worthy of their praise. 
 Superb documentary about a German minister who stood up publically against Hitler.  Bonhoeffer taught that following Christ's call was not cheap or easy but ultimately rewarding.   The film shows the real power and charisma of Hitler to great effect.   Bonhoeffer recognized Hitler for the evil he was and didn't hesitate to speak openly against him when it was dangerous to do so.  What was most interesting to me is how Bonhoeffer went from a committed non-violent teacher of the Gospel to joining the conspirators who tried to assasinate Hitler in order to spare Germany and her people.     A fascinating slice of history and spirituality.   If more demoninations had preachers and teachers like Bonhoeffer, Christianity wouldn't have the sorry reputation it has today.     
 There are bonds a human forms with his/her pet that can't be broken no matter what. Mr. Katz even mentions such a bond that comes from experiences and such. This book is helping me through an extremely difficult time in my life and the life of my pets. I can't think of a better read that may explain the friendship, at least the one I have with my Chow. I too laughed and cried while reading this book, I'd say it's a must read for all pet owners/lovers!! 
 This is a great color reference for interior designers, or aspiring designers. It is a great visual reference, offers very good detail and I use it often for reference when putting together story boards and offering ideas to clients 
 WOW... This book has been on my "Must Read" list for years, and, prompted by a trip to Italy, I finally read it.  It's such an incredible story!  What an amazing life this talented artist lived!  While I realize that the conversations and inner thoughts of Michelangelo are ficionalized, I know that Stone did so many painstaking years of research that essentially the story is true, and this allows the spirit of the artist to come alive.      I wish I had read the book before my trip to Italy, so as to gain some history of the time period and personal inspiration of Michelangelo before seeing his magnificent works of art.  That being said, I am so glad at having read the book during and after my trip, because it allowed me to reflect and ponder and "live in Michelangelo's head" for a while!!  I will definitely read it again before I go to Italy in the future.  I highly recommend this novel for anyone visiting Italy, interested in art, or just wanting to read a fascinating story!    Enjoy! 
 There is a witches riddle on this cd that I had heard during a Halloween Dance Music DJ Set years ago and I have been looking for it ever since. I accidently stumbled across it this year just in time for Halloween. I am a DJ and this is a great cd to get some quality halloween samples for your HALLOWEEN Sets. It has a variety of different sayings and noise effects that you can incorporate into Halloween DJ SETS for all to enjoy. although there are many used copies available here on AMAZON, don't expect to find this baby in your local record store. Nobody has itin stock. Online is your only option. But don't worry....you could get lucky!! Finally, I found what I have been looking for every Halloween. This is a GREAT CD!! 
 I took my salesmen to lunch the other day in my mini-van and I was playing this in my car.  It was absolutely infectious everyone was singing along and scattiing to the songs. Even those that didn't know the words or had heard of miss Smith.                                                    . For me Keely breaks the mythical fourth wall. Kudos!  Miss. Smith can really Swing, Swing, Swing 
 This book can be read at many levels -- used for a course or read as needed. You can answer questions like: How is unfair discrimination measured? Why do jobs that employ women pay less than those that employ men  even if the requirements are similar. Go beyond romantic love to answer  questions about whether marriage makes sense. Does welfare make peole work  less? These two academics represent mainstream, what is called  "institutional labor econmics."  Anyone interested in the labor  market, gender equity, international comparisons on how women are doing  will find this book accessible. You do not have to have formal education in  economics 
 I have read all the the comic books regarding Hero from Tony Wong and I have to say that if anyone liked the comic version of this story then you will love this movie...it delivers 
 This is a great story very well written.  A must read for all women who dare to dream or dream about taking a risk.  I also think this should be required reading for all upper middle school and/or high school students - it will help them understand that all goals are possible but not always easy to obtain 
 The CEV is an extremely good translation in contemporarly English that ranks with the very best ever done (while not a Greek scholar, I know enough to tell for myself that it is very faithful to the Greek text). It's simple, clear and direct language that avoids traditonal religious vocabulary makes it an excellent choice for children and adults, particularly those who were not raised in a church. I bought this large print edition for my kids. Whether I'm reading to them or them to me, it's nice to get through an entire passage without having to constantly re-translate "church English" terms. While it's a hefty volume in this edition, the larger print makes it easier for little readers to cope with -- not to mention those of us older folk with imperfect eyesight 
 I really loved this film.  I'm a sucker for B-style sci-fi films and am a regular with SciFi Channel flicks like this.  Plus, James Spader rocks!  While the plot is thin at times, it's a great piece of sci-fi with some good special effects and a neat loner main character.  A definite watcher 
 Over the last year I became a Mercedes enthusiast, buying four older Benz.  This book was a godsend to me.  It has already paid for itself in guiding me through simple repairs that would have been rather expensive had I gone to a shop or, heaven forbid, a MB dealer.  The book is essentially a compilation of how-to and informative articles from Star Magazine.  All classes are covered with emphasis on the more classic and popular classes, i.e. the older 190's, the diesels, and all the SL's.  The book is divided into various segments, such as chassis, engines, accessories.  There are more finite divisions within each category.  The downside is you have to scan the first page of each section to find your model, as all models are covered within each segment.  The book is well illustrated and very thorough.  You can learn about simple maintenance or you can be guided through an engine rebuild.  If you're serious about being on top of maintenance and repair of your Benz, or just plain curious about German engineering, this book will serve you well.  
 opposites such as sobriety/addiction, good/evil, etc.  And what a deeply touching book Susan Cheever has written here, so loving and affectionate, so eloquent -- the very reasons to be suspect by our sober fellow citizens still awaiting the untarnished messiah who will deliver us from this vale of tears!  Of course Bill Wilson was no saint!  And JFK and MLK were promiscuous, the list goes on and on.  Lincoln was a depressive, now he was even gay!  I appreciate so much about the book; simply as a wonderfully detailed history of places, of ideas, of spiritual searching.  Ms. Cheever covers a lot of territory!  And I do think she is fair -- fair to the unwillingly famous man, fair to his loved ones, fair to fellow AA members.  Read this book and expand your heart 
 This is one of my favorite albums of all time!! Scarface first solo album with no guest appearances (how many mc's can say that??). If you think you know hardcore hip-hop and u don't own this album.....WHERE HAVE U BEEN!!!   The beats are so dark and hard that it would bury the average "gangsta rapper" trying to flow over them. But put that boy Brad (Scarface) up to the task and he tames them. Every song (yes i mean every) is a must listen. There are no interludes or shout out trks on here to be found. This is not just mindless "gangsta rap" this is Harcore Hip-hop at its finest..Hotep! 
 Well written and easy to read.  The book fills in the gaps leading to retirement and allows one to make up for lost time in looking at things that need to be considered for retirement 
 While a smaller, almost novella sized novel about characters familiar to  those in Tyler's audience, it is simply amazing how this book, written in  her early 20's, still manages to captivate and amuse.  The prone,  home-bound brother is a truly original creation.  I came to this after  finishing most of this author's earlier work and was worried I would find  her early novels reflecting what one would expect to hear from a first  time, very young novelist in the sixties.  But the book is timeless and her  style already cemented.  Slower paced, but a fine read 
 I have just finished reading Mahatma Gandhi's "An Autobiography: The Story of My Experiments with Truth."  Of the 10,000 books I have read, Gandhi's autobiography is, quite simply, the most uplifting book I have ever read (excluding scriptures and 'holy' books).    What impressed me the most was Gandhi's extreme clear-mindedness. He was a master of prioritizing; he almost always did the most important task first.  Although he took exception with a few specific applications of "The Law," he was devoted to the general principles of British law. Gandhi was non-judgmental.  He understood the other side and continued to see the opposition as people.  Always on the path of self-improvement, Gandhi was committed to principle.  He virtually always "walked his talk." His personal discipline and integrity were matched only by his desire to serve and his commitment to non-violence and to Truth itself.  The inner development of Mahatma Gandhi's life is wonderfully educational. The book clearly shows what one man can accomplish through will -- coupled with integrity.  
 I cannot say enough good things about this book.  Go is a beautiful game with the depth of chess, but the openings are a little more abstract than chess.  Chess players usually love Go and Go players usually love chess.  This however is one of the best primers to a complex strategy game that I've ever seen.  My copy is battered and worn, because when I meet someone new to the game I loan them my copy to get them started.  The book itself is small, allowing the user to read it and focus on understanding what was taught.  If you are interested in learning more about this game or teaching a friend, I cannot recommend this book more.  If you like this book, then I would highly recommend the next book be: "The Second Book of Go".  These two books will get you well on your way into the wonderful game of Go 
 I love the Anna Pigeon books and have read several, and I know that our Anna eventually finds herself in terrifying danger in every one. (Sometimes I feel that Barr is too cruel to her main character.) But this one started out grim and scary, with no sign of ever becoming less so. The firestorm itself was riveting, but the descriptions of blackened skin, etc., were too much for me. I hated to bail out, because I was already engrossed in the story, but it was giving me nightmares. The occasional cutaways to Stanton's point of view, while offering a break from the tension and horror of the post-firestorm setting, did not allow enough breathing room.  I give it 4 stars because the main reason I didn't finish it is that I am a wimp. However, I do think the story could have been equally interesting without being so (in my mind, unnecessarily) dark 
 I would highly recommend this book to any parent of a boy.  I know that this is a broad, sweeping statement, and that not all parents will face the challenges, which this book highlights, however, I was relieved to discover in reading this book that I am not alone.  I was heartbroken, when at three, my son was transitioned into a class of four and five-year-old children without any of his peers.  There, a Pre-K teacher, told him that he was `stupid' and `didn't listen' because he could not sit still or write his letters, and that he had ADD.  Her dissatisfaction with him eventually escalated until she physically hit my son.  He was traumatized by this incident.  I subsequently removed him from this school.  However, when I saw the news program featuring the Michael Gurian Institute and this book, I tried to get it from Barnes & Nobles and Borders only to discover it was sold out.  I then ordered it from Amazon and have not been able to put it down.  It has given me the tools to mitigate successfully potential negative interactions with his current teachers and caregivers, and to build bridges that celebrate his uniqueness as a young boy entering the educational arena.  A Must Have! 
 This is a brilliant, deeply thoughtful, open-hearted book, one of the ten or twelve most important studies we have so far of the culture of the United States.  Those who take the time and make the effort to read it carefully will learn a lot not only about American history and society, but also about their own private thoughts and fantasies and the background assumptions of their everyday lives.  The dismal state of American education is the main thing you can learn about in most of these reviews.  This book has limitations.  The most obvious: it's about white/Anglo middleclass Americans.  But the only sensible response to the book is still gratitude.  If you haven't read it, read it. 
 This book is a must read for legal marketers, attorneys and those who provide marketing consulting services for law firms. If you take the time to not only read the book but also, seriously think about what the author is saying, and then incorporate those ideas into your the culture of your practice or the firm's practice, you will be rewarded.   Dahut's book is definitely not typical of the books one finds in the legal marketing area that tell you how and what to do. Rather he presents a powerful case that attorneys and law firms need to become client centered and to do so by changing their way of thinking to the perspective of the client. Further, Dahut believes that "... most of marketing is about providing superior service within the context of the client's specific needs and wants."  Attorneys and law firms need to become client centered and provide service that meets the client's needs. So, go buy a copy - read it -- then go implement it. 
 As I have come to expect from a major DK publication, we get a very handsomely illustrated book at a good price. This book immediately makes one think of its "predecessor", if you will: the "Larousse Encyclopedia of the Animal World". I thought this new DK book would be a kind of updated replacement, but it turns out, no way! As another reviewer noted, this DK book is way lopsided in that it seems to be "starring" the mammals, and the further you get from that form, the less coverage. The Larousse book and this one are about equal in size, but the coverage is about opposite: the Larousse book devotes 270 pages to invertebrates, which in this DK book get a measly 76 pages! The Larousse book has a bigger section on fish too, and then it gets into smaller sections with the rest of the chordata. Anyway. I'm glad I have both books, to get some balance. If you want to find a brief profile on a particular beast (especially mammalian), this DK book is better. The Larousse book has more discussion (with photos & illustrations), not so much individual coverage. 
 This is a fantastic book on dynamics.  It takes the intuitive path to understanding dynamical systems and skips the formally ladden historical precedent.  I've enjoyed every word I've read and can honestly say that it has improved my intuitions for dynamical systems ten-fold 
 This book is essential if you are considering a career in any aspect of the music business. For example, If you started out with a home studio and want to branch out further, then this is the book for you. If you are a songwriter with a bunch of songs laying around but don't know what to do with them, this book is for you. It is one of the best 20 bucks I have since I began in the music business 
 I was a huge fan of Joy Division and Public Image Limited in that time, and still love them. That said. I am a New Order fan. I was of the few in San Francisco that saw them at the I-Beam on the first sans Ian tour. They were touching. That said. Strip them of their history and take this album as it is for the time it was released and even today, and still it holds as a very good set of songs about stretching across a blackened musical landscape of minor chords and sketchy guitar with guilt ridden vocals and the occasional dance-trippy melodies. Movement is a musical statement. It shows the now and the where to go of the later masterpiece, Power, Corruption And Lies. Movement is a gloomy record, but that's ok, the dark wave really did rejoice in it's melancholy and of course in it's layered sounds. Put this album next to PIL Metal BOX and Echo and the Bunneymens Heaven Up Here and you have a couple of dreamy hours into the netherlands of what was to become of Manchester and American Brit rock idolators. Great stuff, and a wonderful clarion call to what was to become the makings of the greatest dance single of all time from the darkness of Dreams Never End:  Blue Monday. After the regrettabel suicide of  Ian Curtis, who I hope has found some new incarntion better fitted to his damaged soul, New Order lifted spirits rathers than dampened them. 
 Do read this book and learn about which adoption practice is for you and what to expect about your child's emotions from infant to teen and how to handle th em.  Gisela Gasper Fitzgerald, author of ADOPTION: An Open, Semi-Open or Closed Practice?  
 this scale is great for the price..I recently bought one at Kmart that I just threw away......nice how it fits in to the dish and easy to store...perfect for weight watcher 
 Isn't it remarkable how a people subjected to so much hate-the Children of Israel-can come up with something that is pure love  Only the People of Israel could do this. Shaday brings out the fantastic Middle East flavour , mainly with lyrics in English , and in a way that all lovers of good music can appreciate. This is real bliss and a real classic , that all lovers of good music should have in their collection.  It shows such humanity and beauty 
 I'm so glad I bought this book. It is one of those I take down regularly. The author thoroughly understands monotype in many mediums. A previous reviewer mentioned how well the toxicity issue was dealt with. Lots of good color illustration. 
 Although this book is focused on Windows and most of my (current) programming focuses on that, I usually end up referring to two UNIX books instead ("UNIX Network Programming" and "Advanced Programming for the UNIX Environment"). Those books have nearly identical syntax, but do a better job of explaining things. For Windows, there are some peculiarities (i.e., shortfalls) that you need to be aware of, so you really should own all three books, as I do. The amount of time that you save will be well worth it 
 Great tool for eating out - gives you the big picture and helps you make better eating out choices 
 I first bought this book in about 1975 (yes 1975) a corgi paperback edition, I learnt to play golf from it, and still refer back to it when I have a problem. I have never had a lesson, just the book and Bens advice, it cost me a $1.10 then,(in  Australia) THE BEST MONEY Ive ever spent. To anybody starting or have a problem, do yourself a favour,buy it.100% R.Gosling 
 The illstrations, while vivid, are a bit obtuse and difficult to discern.  The prose doesn't flow.  The book simply can't stand alone the way the "counting Book" and Miss Spider's Mom, do.    If your child is hooked on Miss Spider, then this will be a fun addition to your collection, but it shouldn't be your first choice 
 James Cone put forth Black Theology and Black Power as an explanation of the change required for black men to survive in this society. Cone defines black power as, "complete emancipation of black people by whatever means black people deem necessary."  This emancipation call means, "black people no longer see themselves as without human dignity but as men."   Cone explains that black people see themselves without human dignity because white society has objectified them. As an object they are not relational beings, but objects of exploit for the privilege and the empowerment of whites. For Cone this went back to the beginning of the African experience in America. The suffering of the black experience was real, and "black people cannot live according to what ought to be, but according to what is."   This book is without the luxury of time to come to grips with black meaning in a society which incessantly indoctrinated him with a message that he was less then human, less then whole. Cone did not have the luxury of education in the seminary in theologies other then those made by white men talking to other white men as the church made even Augustine and Jesus white in his time. He did not write in a vacuum and neither can his book be read in a vacuum.   It is an essential book for understanding Black Liberation 
 `David Burke's New American Classics' by, of course, David Burke with co-author, culinary pen for hire, Judith Choate is a great foodie cookbook and if you appreciate good food and cookbooks, stop reading this now and scroll up and order yourself a copy instead of wasting any more time reading my thoughts on this truly worthy cookbook!  I can generally recognize very good and very bad cookbooks after about two or three minutes of reading the table of contents and the introduction. I could tell this book was worthy of consideration even before I opened it, based on an appearance by Burke to promote the book on the Today show a few days ago. Being an inveterate watcher of both talk show food segments and Food Network shows, I have become jaded to most conventional rehashes of typical dishes where the segments are little more than shuffling swapouts. Due to the fact that lamb is one of my very favorite things to eat, Burke got my attention in that his segment was a new take on doing filleted leg of lamb. Having just done a leg of lamb for Easter with less than spectacular success, I was quite willing to listen to new ideas, and Burke hit the nail on the head. His solution is to easily fillet the rolled leg of lamb meat into its easily identified component muscles, saute the seasoned pieces almost as if you were doing a beef fillet, then pan-roasting the seared pieces to the correct temperature, requiring not much more than 10 minutes. I was hooked. Then I opened the book, and found the whole book to be chocked full of such ideas.  Burke's first attraction was the fact that his Table of Contents listed every major recipe rather than simply the usual tired chapter headings. This Table fully revealed his strategy of offering three variations on 39 classic American recipes.  The first recipe of the trio is a traditional dish, although not necessarily simple or easy dishes and not necessarily the most familiar traditional fare. It is more likely that the traditional recipe will be a tradition of great American restaurants than great American home cooking, although there are exceptions.  The second recipe of each trio is a contemporary take on approximately the same ingredients. The contemporary dish is always different enough from the classic that it is worth having and making both recipes without risking a boring `oh, that again' from your family or even yourself. Most contemporary dishes are also `restaurant grade' and not necessarily original to Chef Burke, but most are well within the capabilities of an experienced home cook.  The third recipe concept alone is worth the price of the book, in that it gives a recipe for remaking the leftovers from one of the two earlier recipes into an entirely new dish. The recipes for the leftover French toast and pancakes alone may be worth the price of the book, as I constantly find myself making a standard recipe for either and am left with about twice as much as I can serve at the time.  Speaking of pancakes and French toast, any good cookbook which covers breakfast almost automatically wins my heart, as breakfast is easily the most widely neglected meal in cookbooks, especially for those of us among the retired 60 Somethings who need to stay away from high salt and empty calorie dishes so common in breakfast fare. Our advantage is that we have the time to take an hour in the morning or some time the night before to do up oatmeal right.  All of this would be for naught if the recipes were not good, and I am certain that these recipes are more than good. My first clue was when I spotted Chef Burke's cooking times for potatoes. One of my biggest complaints about so many recipes is that their cooking times for potatoes, especially for fried potatoes or potatoes au gratin are too short. I see no such problems here. And, while the cooking instructions may be just a bit advanced for the total novice, there is no absence of careful detail to cover unfamiliar procedures. I am so impressed by the care with which the recipes are written that I will even sign on for some of the especially fussy techniques such as storing poached eggs in a warm water bath of a very specific temperature.  One of my surest signs of an important cookbook is that regardless of what page I open, I find interesting recipes, comments, tips, and impressions on ingredients. The section of tuna recipes is a case in point where the classic recipe is a tuna steak cooked all the way through, as it was always done before `nouvelle cuisine' got their mitts on the fish. The issue Burke points out is that while this is a very nice way to cook tuna, one must guard against drying out the flesh, almost as one must cook pork chops carefully to avoid creating shoe leather with dried meat. Thus, Burke supplies the appropriate sauce to keep your rather expensive fishy fare succulent.  Speaking of sauces, one of the very few ways in which I could think to improve this book would be to give a special index of supplementary recipes of sauces, condiments, and side dishes provided in each of the 39 main recipes.  This is a rare book composed primarily of recipes where I feel constrained by only being able to assign five stars, as it is better than many books to which I have already given five stars. This is a truly great foodie book in that there is a real risk that if a non-foodie reads it, they will turn into a foodie, the material is that alluring. This book is most like the two great collaborations between Mark Bittman and Jean-George Vongerichten and the collaboration between Patricia Wells and Joel Robuchon, except that it is better than both for the average cook! 
 The book Isaac Newton by Cathleen krull is an interesting biography, but I wouldn't read wouldn't recommend it to people who aren't interested in math or science. This book made me wonder and drift off sometimes. This book also made me keep on reading to get to the next chapter, because all the chapters have a different subject like alchemy, calculus, of astronomy. The book also had a great style of writing, she explained each subject very thoroughly. Over this entire book was a great biography, and I would recommend it to certain people who I think would enjoy it 
 This was very well done.  Kept a good pace, kept me captivated.  Very entertaining story with some humor.    I did find it hard to follow the dialog with the various dialects of the characters, so I wanted to use subtitle.  Alas!  Subtitles are not enabled on DVDs in this series (BBC white covers).  I switched from viewing the DVD via the component connection to viewing via the coax "VCR" connection.  That allowed me to take advantage of the television's closed captioning capabilities.  However, I had to sacrifice picture quality 
 This novel grips you from the beginning to the end. I could hardly put it down once I started reading it. The interplay with certain real political events and situations that happened or are happening in Nigeria makes a Nigerian reader particularly love it.  I think it is a splendid debut for the author. At the beginning with the words "things started falling apart..." you will think you're reading about another Okonkwo. And to some extent Eugene and Okonkwo of Chinua Achebe's "Things Fall Apart" share striking similarities. Okonkwo was fanatical about native traditions and blindly killed the boy who called him 'father' in order to uphold tradition and ultimately met a tragic end. Eugene is fanatical about his catholic traditions and this leads to his tragic end.  Chimamanda relates to the fact that Chinua Achebe is a true role model for African young writers. I recommend this book to African and non-African readers 
 We speak Cantonese at home but Mandarin is really more useful for the future so I am starting my children on learning Mandarin (as well as learning it myself).   The whole family watches this DVD and we all enjoy it.  The words and phrases taught are basic but useful - hello, introducing yourself to others, thanks, relatives, colors, numbers, and objects.   The actors speak slowly enough so we can follow but with a natural rhythm.  The songs and animation make the lessons more interesting for the children.   I definitely recommend for both children and adults who are learning Mandarin. 
 As a long-time reader of spy novels, I will simply say this is the best, most literate, intricate, gripping, and yet emotionally moving I have ever read. A memorable read, luminous characters, international intrigue at its best. If it is true that the story is not based on actual events, as the author claims, I must say that McCarry has a brilliant gift for  plotting and quite an imagination. I was so engrossed with the characters that I felt like I knew them, that I was there as it happened. Anyway, it stuns me that this never became a best seller. This may be his best, as some say, but I am going to try the other novels. See you -- I'm going into deep cover with top Ameddican spy Paul Christopher.. 
 Peterson does a good job of covering many mathemaical concpts in a well-paced narrative. This is an enjoyable book to read, even for those who don't like math. The author wisely steers clear of lenghthy equations and problems, and takes the time to lead the reader through the concepts in a way that doesn't require a background in math. Anyone with an inquisitive mind would appreciate this book 
 All I can say is WOW!  I watched the movie "The Secret" 48 Hours ago, and now have found Esther and Jerry Hicks in that same time period.  If you are earnestly seeking a better Life, you will find it.  "Birds of a Feather Flock Together"  I am just blown away with my Transformation in the past 2 days.  I went to Barnes and Nobles last night about this time.  We couldn't find any of Esther and Jerry's Books.  I just began walking around, believing some how, some way this book would find me.  Well the Employee at Barnes and Nobles tracked me down, and guided me to another section.  We still couldn't find any of their books.  The Employee walked away and I thought I would never see him again.  Well, as I started to walk away the third time, he came walking towards me with asserment, and handed me the Book "The Law of Attraction"  Never in my Life at Barnes and Nobles had I met a Employee who was so PERSISTENT on finding me a Book.  Then I began asking??  Was this myself, the employee at Barnes and Nobles, or the Principles of the Law of Attraction?  They say when the Student is ready, the Teacher will come.  Well it's 10:35 P.M. almost 24 Hours later and I have read all 194 pages of this Book.  I truly have found what I am looking for in this amazing Book.  In life there are Laws, Laws of Gravity, Laws of our Government, Laws of Prosperity, Wealth, Health,etc.  If you want to play the Game of Life, you must know the Universal Laws.  It starts with getting a foundation within the Laws of Attraction.  When you think your life sucks, your work is awful, your relationships are just horrible, guess what you will attract?? Those exact things.  Your life is a magnet, what you think about you will attract, it's a Law.  When you think about Health,Wealth,Prosperity, Great Relationships, you will attract those things.  Your Life's make up is within you, you dictate how it will be played, not your surroundings.  Get your mind right and start today. Read this amazing Book!.  I had no idea who the Hick's where 48 Hours ago, but by reading this Book my life has been transformed overnight.  I will never be the same person again, and the same goes for you.  Think outside the Box, and if you earnestly want change, start by buying this book today! 
 This book showed me how to simply turn my negative thoughts into positive thoughts.  I have read many books on the subject of positive thinking and books of healing.  Mr Peale focused on the Love of our God and His Son,  Jesus Christ.  I have referred to this book so often that it has literally  fallen apart at its seams.  I will get another copy as I really do believe  in what Mr. Peale is saying to be the complete truth.  This  book is a must  read for anyone suffering from anything in life, so that means everyone  should read this excellent book.  I am almost fifty years old and I have  encountered some great problems in  life and this book shows me how to face  them. Mr Peale refers to Biblical passages throughout the  book all of  which are authentic, for I have checked.  This book is certainly one of the  best pieces of self-help literature that one could be fortunate to find.   Read it, you'll be glad you did. Patty Harma 
 Time alters all things.  The resultant changes can be decay, or tedium/passe, or at the opposite end of the spectrum the changes can be enhancing as a patina on fine wood.  Andrei Makine's DREAMS OF MY RUSSIAN SUMMERS has happily acquired a literary patina that makes this brief but crystalline memoir of childhood even more of a joy to read after a few years on the shelf.  Makine has the rare ability to weave wholly credible stories with unforgetable characters while at the same time measuring his prose like poetry.  We are to suppose this is an autobiography, but it is far more than the journey of a nascent writer becoming a man.  This is the essence of the Russian mind embellished by the great fortune of having early exposure to the beauty of France by means of recalling summers with Charlotte, a French born grandmother who nourishes the imagination and history of the writer to the point of delirium.  All that has happened to and in Russia from the time of the Tsars to the present is presented in such a way that the grisly realities are always balanced by the homage to love of fatherland.  Makine is a stunning writer and is still adding to our contemporary literature in ways that secure him a place among the geniuses of the word.  Read and indulge your mind and your senses 
 I've occasionally used this collection as required reading for troubled and directionless young adult males.  "The Race at Dawn" provides an excellent starting place for a discussion for the need to complete their education. The review from 1999 by "A READER" comments about "The Bear" being incomplete; all five sections are printed in the version collected in "Go Down Moses. 
 I've been a product manager for several years. This book gave me a great foundation for my work when I was getting started.  
 This is the best magazine for the busy kids to keep them busy. I was really impressed with the easy of the crafts and the details in the instructions. I love this magazine 
 I purchased this for my sister. She loves the gown and when I saw her wearing the gown she looked really pretty. Great quality and beautiful gown. This gown would have cost twice as much at a retail store in the mall. Thanks for the good deal. Susan

 Ms. Bailey's reading group recommends this book to anyone who likes horses or to people who live on a farm.  Even though this book is an older book we still enjoyed it.  We liked the dialect that Henry used for Grandpa Beebe.  We thought it was neat to read about a true story.  We think you should give this book a try 
 A chronicle of the horrors of the 19th century, a time when filth, disease, crime, and overcrowding was rampant in American urban areas. Thought provoking and filled with many lovely morbid illustrations. If you need to be reassured that things really weren't better "before," look no further 
   I am 22 years old(5'2) and I have been carring weight from my 4 year old son for 3 years .Last year I lost 16 pounds buy walking every day for an hour and stoped eating after 7:00 pm .I am not over weight ( I was 125)now I am 109 and don't really want to loss any more weight but just tone up my body . I came across Callanetics while searching for ways to get fit for summer.I read so many  great reviews that I had to try it. The exercises are great I have only done the exercises  3 hours .The first 2 hours I really had a had time geting my hip to roll for the hip and butt exercises ,but by the 3 hour I got it and I really felt worked out and my butt and hip were sore along with the rest of my body so I know now that I am doing them right .So it you can't get it right away just keep trying . I am going to start doing them 3 to 5 days a week along with walking from walk away the pounds for the next 2 months to get ready for summer . I will post again at the end of the 2 months to brag about how fit I am thanks to Callanetics ! Just try it you will love it and good luck ! 
 It is very rear to see a movie that stands up to it's literary origins. And almost never a movie is better than the book, save "The Godfather" and a few others. This movie does not surpass Follet's masterpiece but it is it's equal.    Richard  Marquand direction is impeccable and tight, the recreation of the WWII era is top notch. Even the complicated love story blends within the other elements and does not distract but adds to the overall viewing pleasure.  Kate Nelligan and Christopher Cazenove have never been better; and what to say about Donald Sutherland, he was born to play "The Needle".  I would read he book first and then,  do yourself a favor and watch this. WWII thrillers don't come much better than this movie. 
 This is the third book I have read by Grisham, and so far I have really enjoyed each one. Grisham really knows how to write a good legal thriller. This book does not have any courtroom/court-case scenes, which I really enjoy, but it still kept my attention very well. Grisham gives you just enough "inside details" to keep you guessing without actually telling you the answer. For example: at one point, the clues seemed to point to Fletcher Coal being involved in the killings, but that was way off the mark in the end. This characteristic of Grisham's writings makes for a very enjoyable read. One of my few complaints about this book is the sudden romance between Gray and Darby. They had hardly even met before they seemed to become attracted, then it VERY quickly blossomed into an open show of affection, even though at the same time, Darby was supposedly mourning for Thomas. Even so, that is probably the main thing that seems wrong about this book, and it does not detract from the overall quality very much at all.  Overall, this is a very captivating, page-turner book that really holds your attention. I highly recommend it, as well as Grisham's other books. So far, I have found Grisham to be an awesome writer of legal thrillers. I promise that you will not be disappointed. Read and enjoy 
 I read the book and it is great.  I couldn't agree more with Rebecca De Vaney.  I have tried many diets but this is one that is more of a lifestyle change.  It makes sense and it's sensible.  Without question I would recommend this to anyone wanting to truly shed a few pounds (like I need to) or anyone wanting to maintain their weight.  
 Has there ever been a time when you tried to help someone by doing something you know is wrong? Handbook For Boys is about a boy named Jimmy who sells drugs to help his mother get on her own two feet. Later Jimmy is cought and has to go to court. Jimmy's mother doesn't have the money to bail him oht of jail so Jimmy is out of luck when Duke, who is the owner of a barber shop, walks in and says, "I will keep him for his time in jail to help me fix and clean up my shop." Jimmy's mother is okay with the deal and so is Jimmy. If Jimmy doesn't cooperate he will be in jail for a long time. Will Jimmy cooperate or will he give up and go to jail? I would recommend this book to anyone who tries to to help out by doing the wrong things.  I liked this book because my friend went to jail and had a chance to help a woman keep her house in shape. I recommend this book for those who try to do something for someone by doing something wrong.   Tarrel Desplains I 
 William Carlos Williams' "Imaginations" collects five complete works of the great american poet. As excursions into experimental literature these five examples cannot be beat. The compelling and lucid  examinations of the working imagination by one of the best acrobats of the  imagination. All originally published in small editions and finally  available again as they were before being hacked up into selected works and  anthologies. "Spring and All" contains many of William's  best-loved poems as they appeared with the original experimental prose that  was in itself a manifesto of imagination. "The Descent of Winter"  is poetry, fiction, criticism and personal journal all in one and is  exquisitely beautiful and deeply insightful as a portrait of an unusually  gifted artist and man 
 Lee Stroble finally writes a book that one would think accurately and credibly supports the claims made by Christians about their savior, Jesus Christ.  Yet, there are a number of atheists reviewing this book saying that it is one sided because all 12 people Lee interviewed were Christians and that Lee is a Christian.  It seems to me that they are looking for a non-Christian to say something like:  "I've discovered that what the Christians are saying about their faith is true.  I've found that this Jesus really was the Son of God.  I found that if you don't accept him as your Savior, you go to hell for eternity." ...and when asked if they will remain a non-Christian respond with "Oh heck yeh.  It's all true, but I don't want any of it."    It would be like me encouraging everyone to follow the Minnesota Vikings football team (everyone who knows me knows I loath the Vikings).  It just doesn't make sense.  If you've read this book and still choose to disagree, why bother leaving a review that insults the author.  If I read a book supporting the ALCU and found that I disagreed with it (which would be expected) and then write a review about why I didn't like it,  it would be a waste of people's time (including my own).    So on that final note, if you have an open heart and want facts, read this book.  It will give you factual eveidence that will help you make the decision to determine if Christianity is true, to find that one think that has been eluding you your whole life (just like Lee Stroble), read this book.  But if you don't have that open heart and are just looking to support your close minded, hardened heart, don't read this book, and if you do, don't review it.  Great job Lee 
 	Jaheim shows the world that being ghetto isn't always a bad thing.  In fact, he makes ghetto look and sound damn good!  "Still Ghetto" is Jaheim's sophomore album.  He is a prime example that everyone's sophomore album can be just as good as the debut.  The album's tracklisting is all around great, from the order of the songs to the lyrics and instruments.   	"Still Ghetto" is about love and relationships for the most part.  Jaheim seduces and croons his female listeners practically the entire album.  "Put that Woman First" is the mid-tempo track that was released and went on to be a hit for 2003.  Jaheim explains that if a man does not make a woman feel that she is at the top of his list, she may leave him for another man who will.  A lot of women and even men like this song.  Jaheim showcases his seduction skills on the song "Special Day".  In this song Jaheim tells his woman it is her day and asks her what she would like to do.  It is a slow song with a beautiful message and melody.  "Everywhere I Am is Jaheim's dedication to his late mother, Julie.  In the song he lets his mom know that whatever he does, he feels her presence, even in the biggest events of his life.  This song is truly heartfelt to anyone has either lost their mother or has a close bond with her.  Another favorite on "Still Ghetto" is Jaheim's duet with Mary J. Blige called "Beauty and a Thug"  This song is about a man and a woman from different walks of life who attract each other. This is a lovely song.   	"Still Ghetto" is one of those CD's that anyone who gives it a complete listen is sure to love.  Jaheim takes being ghetto to a whole new level!  HE'S STILL GHETTO BABY!  Mikeisha's Top 5 1. Special Day 2. Me and my B**ch 3. Beauty and a Thug 4. Everywhere I am 5. Long as I Live  
    I approached this novel after relishing Tsukeyama's "Women of the Silk" and "The Samurai Garden".  After two such masterpieces, I was half-expecting a waning ability to keep fresh story ideas and a slip into banal immigrant themes. As with her other works, I found strikingly-moving interactions between characters and a fluidity which draws one into the scenic location changes of the individuals in the story.     One of Tsukeyama's talents lies in her subtle ability to introduce character traits through tight dialogue and her resistance to pepper the discourses with Asian-sounding metaphors and references.  By using the latter sparsely, she paints a more realistic San Francisco, Macao, and Hong Kong, three cities seeking modernity against the pull of traditionalism and sentimentality. I enjoy her choice of time and places, depicting a family's progression over a period which spans several decades beginning with WWII-the most volatile and growth-inspired decades of the Pacific Rim.    Through each of her tales, I imagine Tsukeyama talking to procurement agents with negotiations on upcoming screen adaptations. If not done yet, perhaps she might convince an Asian production company to supervise such films, for they call for more subtle and engaging cinematography than is generally found in blockbuster films.    I can imagine how the story might read if translated into Chinese for an Asian readership.  With her formulas and style, Tsukeyama shall continue to breathe beauty into her character-driven stories. Although I read it alone over a Chinese dinner at a restaurant on San Bruno Avenue, it beckons to be shared with another as a corn-cob-piped storyteller might. Try reading this book aloud to a friend, even in English--you will understand what I mean.     I highly recommend this book. 
 I read this book with my book group, and we all LOVED it.  It's SO funny and SO smart.  I've always thought of myself as a spiritual person, even though I've never been much of a church-goer.  I read a lot of spirituality books,  but they're always by women my mother's age.  While these writers have good intentions, their spiritual insights aren't very relevant to my life.  Finally, here is a book that speaks to me and women like me -- smart, stylish, creative women in their 20s and 30s who are pursuing careers, looking for Mr. Right (or Mr. Right Now), and relishing close friendships with other fabulous women.  With a Ph.D. in spirituality and a dangerously funny sense of humor, Donna Freitas is able to incorporate wisdom from a variety of spiritual traditions, and even feminist scholarship, to talk about how young women's lives today are already deeply spiritual.  She redeems (to use a spiritual term) everything from our shoe obsessions and chocolate obsessions, and she shows how our lives already have sacred rituals -- like evenings of food, wine, and conversation with our best friends.  After reading this book, I have a new understanding of how to nurture my spirituality (and not feel guilty about drooling over the latest Jimmy Choos! 
 After reading all of these reviews, I was couldn't wait to read Trust. And I was pleasantly suprised to find that the book surpassed my already high expectations. Epping delivers a fast-paced plot that grabs you in the first chapter and just does not let go until the last page. I generally like thrillers and think of myself as a connaisseur of sorts. Trust has all the makings of a great thriller, as well as some creative twists you will not believe, I remember at one point I turned the page and I literally had to catch my breath. Read this book, I highly recommend it 
 when one COULD take the law into his own hands... but going overboard of-course COULD get the attention of even the President of The United States...  This movie many argue is not 100% historically correct, but what movie is?  This movie however, does portray real people, and real events that actually took place.  It's great entertainment, even if you don't pay much attention to it.  But if you do pay attention you follow a fantastic story that actually took place, one of the largest man-hunts of the most sought-after gunslingers of all time.  It may cause you to go and research the facts yourself, which you will find are mostly arguable... even the way Billy The Kid died, or IF he even was killed by Pat Garret or not... hence, the second movie Young Guns II 
 I have read most of Jodi Picoult's books. This wasn't my favorite one of hers, nothing was as good as The Pact! But, I did really enjoy reading Second Glance. They way Picoult develops her characters makes you want to keep reading more and more about them. This was a very good read 
 Marjorie Garber's "Shakespeare After All" is first-rate scholarship on Shakespeare's plays.  It is a 'must have' for anyone interested in Shakespeare's works - whether the person has a casual interest or a scholarly background.  The information is conveyed in an accessible style.  I have purchased a number of copies and given this work as gifts to friends.  One should pick it up and read it  before seeing any performance of the plays.  Kudos, Ms. Garber!  EXCEPTIONAL WORK ...

 They do seem to run about a half size big. Also, they seem a bit narrow in the toe area. Otherwise, they are cute and comfy once you break them in 
 I have yet to read anything by her that I haven't learned from --or-- been inspired by.  I resonate to her and her soulful wisdom. I recommend Sylvia to  anyone searching for answers. Very good resource books to have in ones own personal library 
 This book has no doubt been the best book I've ever read.  I credit this book with saving my marriage.  My husband and I had filed for divorce (all we had to do was sign the bottom line) and decided to give it one last chance.  My mother sent us to a marriage conference featuring Dr. Chapman and his book.  After the conference, I just had to buy the book and I read it through almost non-stop.  The principles found in this book are not just applicable to marriage but carry over into every other relationship in your life.  Awesome!  
 Hot Hot Heat's Make up the Breakdown is a follow-up of Knock Knock Knock. Personally, if you're a big Hot Hot Heat fan, this will be one of your most favorite albums. Each and every song is unique and has catchy beats that will make you want to dance. The first song Naked in the City Again is great.  The second song, No, Not Now, is a popular tune that you can't help but start movin'. Get in or Get out has some of the most rad keyboarding parts. Bandages, one of the biggest hits on the album is sort of what boosted Hot Hot Heat's career and just this one song will make the album worth purchasing. Oh Goddamnit is such an amazing song, with very fun lyrics so you're bound to sing along. The next song Aveda keeps many of us wondering: Ex-Girlfriend or Hair Product? Either way you'll like you'll still enjoy this song. This Town, many believe was written about some crazy fans, you listen and decide for yourself. Talk to Me, Dance with Me was also a very big hit that got fans into Hot Hot Heat. This song makes me dance, sing, and every other thing you can do to your favorite song. On Save us S.O.S. you will love how deep the lead singer, Steve Bays' voice sounds, your heart will melt. Although very different from Hot Hot Heat's normal songs, In Cairo, is also a great song and adds a fabulous ending to Make up the Breakdown. This cd will be in your stereo for hours on end. The songs are addicting so this album is definately worth it's money.  
 The second (or first, I forget which) anthology of PBS and I loved it. I have the strip about women and shoes posted on the fridge so my wife can see it every day. It hasn't stopped her from buying shoes but it makes me laugh every morning 
 The timbre of this guy's voice (and I say guy because he is only 22)sinks deep into your soul and makes you want to sing....with the exception of some lyrics that show his youth (You Give Me Something...which is the first single here, but really not the best on the album.)- this album rocks in more ways than one. I'm personally much more fond of Undiscovered and One Last Chance...though I hate to use the cliche' this guy is blue-eyed soul to a tee 
  Andy Griffith is Lonesome Rhodes, a big-mouth hillbilly from Arkansas, who gradually turns into a megalomaniac through the power of TV. Griffith (his debut Hollywood role after a huge success on Broadway in NO TIME FOR SERGEANTS) is frightening in this power-crazed role, but not nearly as scary as he could have been: he is just SO loud, SO backwoodsy that it's hard to imagine anyone taking him seriously (though it's happened before, hasn't it). Once Griffith leaves the countryside for NYC his role condenses to a one-dimensional personality - with a huge set of lungs. The message during this "Golden Age" of television is that TV may become a power tool for a demigod, with a complacent couch-potato audience sucking it right up. Silly, right? The cast is good as is the Budd Schulberg script. Directed by Elia Kazan in his usual and effective sock-'em-in-the-jaw style. 
 I LOVED this book and have given it to many as a baby gift or just because gift. It really helped me see that I was over achieving in the household and my husband was underachieving. After we both read this book, we had a heart to heart that was much lighter and productive than the vent session I'd rehearsed for weeks prior. It really helped me lighten up and helped my husband see he needed to step up to the plate. Highly recommend 
 THIS MOVIE WAS ONE OF MY FAVOURITES FROM AN EARLY AGE, ALSO DUE TO THE WONDERFUL SCORE BY ALFRED NEWMAN THAT MATCHES THE STORY, THE GREAT PERFORMANCES OF THE ACTORS AND GREAT DIRECTIONS OF MANY A GREAT DIRECTOR. THE MUSIC IS ARRANGED AND PLAYED MASTERFULLY. 
 This book is an introduction and reference for people who want to grow plants from seeds.  The book is organized into 5 main sections: starting seeds indoors, preparing outdoor beds to receive transplants or seeds, detailed instructions for growing individual vegetables from seed, saving seeds, and record keeping and exchanging seeds.  Bubel integrates the results of scientific studies and her own growing experience in her advice to novice gardeners. In striving for completeness, she even includes a chapter with folk wisdom about planting, noting which moon phases are thought to be best for planting and which are not. The book is amply illustrated with black-and-white photographs and drawings.  End material includes a glossary, a bibliography, a list of suggested readings, lists of seed and equipment suppliers, and an index.  Although the book is written for people with very limited gardening experience, it is so full of information that even experienced gardeners are bound to learn something through reading it.  Bubel's approach to gardening very much follows organic practices. The section on individual vegetables is a very valuable reference, with its details on when to plant, when to fertilize and how much to use of what, and when and where to transplant in the garden.  Interspersed with the text are charts summarizing information such as germination rates for different vegetable seeds at different soil temperatures, or viability of vegetable seeds over varying storage times. The sections on preparing the soil for planting or transplanting and on saving seeds at the end of the season round out the book quite well, making this an excellent general gardening book, and not just a book about starting seeds 
 Every day we have an opportunity to choose our attitude and focus our intentions in the present moment. Because of this choice, our own personal lives and all that we see in this world originate within the mind...Changing our perception of worldly experiences is he only way to separate the concept of failure from our vocabulary and substitute a language of success and learning. ~Charlene M. Proctor  Charlene M. Proctor has created a tiny book with a lot of powerful affirmations. The main topics include:   Insight Balance Resiliency Your Authentic Self Abundance Corporate Soul/Work The Goddess in You  Within this beautiful little book you will find solutions for everything from boredom and loneliness to facing destructive patterns in your life. You can find affirmations to manage the daily complexity of your life or create an entire new future by finding out who you truly are and stepping into a new environment.   Example of affirmation: "Repeating Same Patterns"  I keep experiencing the same events in my life because I have not learned a lesson at the deep level of the soul. I am committed to changing my behavior, attitude, and negative belief systems. I learn from past mistakes. Life is a self-educational process and I am a perceptive individual. I watch others as they model what I need to learn . I love all my talents as well as my imperfections because that is what makes me the beloved person I am.   Most of the affirmations encourage you to look at life in a more positive way and encourage a change in your thinking patterns so you can eventually start to move out of negative patterns of behavior.   Lots of the affirmations solve life problems like a crying baby, unemployment, exercise hurdles, lost pets, regrets, insomnia and taking care of aging parents.   As you look through this book you will realize how much you have survived in your short time on this earth and that alone can be empowering.   Probably the most useful way to use this book is to buy two books. One to keep on your bookshelf for when you want to look up topics and one for cutting out affirmations and posting them around in places where you can read them daily. This book would be perfect as a set of cards. I hope the author will consider that option in the near future. You can make your own cards or laminate various topics. I think some of these affirmations can change your life. It can take years to start thinking differently and sometimes life can be a slow walk out of disempowering situations all while you have your eyes on heaven.   If you are looking forward to a more peaceful and positive lifestyle, then this book can help you achieve those dreams. Sometimes it is about taking control of your life, but sometimes it is just letting go of the past.   ~TheRebeccaReview.com   
 This product works great, they recharge fast, are just warm to the touch not hot, and have extremely long battery life. Battery charger works great and has nice car charger adapter 
 Buck-Morss is very likely the most insightful and best informed scholar writing on Benjamin (or Adorno) in English today. If there are typos, misspellings, etc., they are more a sign of the declining standards in editing, even at university presses, than any reflection on Buck-Morss' scholarship. She knows the primary and secondary literature and has clearly spent much time with Benjamin's papers and in various archives. Morevoer, having written the best book I know on the philosophical relationship between Adorno and Benjamin, she is clearly well placed to provide insightful analysis the latter's unfinished masterwork. Since the Passagen-Werk is recently available in English ("The Arcades Project," Harvard Belknap Press: 1999), one can judge for oneself the worth of Buck-Morss' reading 
 For anyone living under a musical rock, Jane Monheit is a superb, classically trained, jazz vocalist, who is among a new breed of performers (Diana Krall, Peter Cincotti, Michael Bubble) who are breathing new life into the standards of the 'Great American Song Book'. It seems the folks at her recording label, Sony Classical, have developed a winning formula for marketing this young women with the big voice.  First, they release one of her exquisite jazz CDs and then shortly after they follow it up with a DVD that has a live performance, that features a set list of the CD's songs. This was done in the past her 2002 release "Into the Sun" ,which was later followed by the DVD release "Live From the Rainbow Room". Now, the formula is followed once again with the wonderful DVD release, "Taking a Chance on Love". This is Jane Monheit, in-concert at the Brecon International Jazz Festival performing songs from her CD of the same name. Most of the songs have been culled from the great old MGM/RKO musicals from the days of yesteryear. She features the works of songwriters such as Cole Porter, George Gershwin, Oscar Hammerstein and Jerome Kern. The stage setting is marvelous. There are silky drapes and dramatic colored lighting (though I could do without the giant neon, JM sign). It feels like we have stepped back in time to either old style, Vegas or a classic, splashy, tecnicolored MGM musical. Jane comes to the stage and with, that beautiful, muscular yet velvety voice, opens with the Waller standard, "Honey Suckle Rose". The song is fast and free in tempo. It is immediately evident, that this vocalist has picked musicians, who are just as talented and superb as she is. In other words, these guys can really cook together! They make up a small band, that includes brilliant pianist & arranger Michael Kanan, bassist Orlando Fleming, drummer Rick Montalbano and guitarist, Miles Okazaki. The set flows light and easily from Cole Porter's humorous and slightly naughty, "Why Can't You Behave" to the serene and emotional reading of "Dancing in the Dark". Other wonderful readings from Monheit include the lovely "Showboat" tune, "Bill" and the Porter standard "In the Still of the Night". I particularly was most moved by her version of Gershwin's "Embraceable You". She is join only by special guest Dori Caymi on acoustic guitar. The duet of these two talented people, breathes new life into the song and is just simply beautiful. Monheit has a light and bubbley personality, that seems to just light up the stage. She seems truely interested in getting across to her audience, how much she loves this music. Monheit has also improved her stage presence since the last DVD. Gone are most of the large physical mannerisms and the heavy make-up, that was a bit distacting to her performance. The DVD itself is first rate! Both the picture & sound are crystal clear. If I were an audio/video manufacturer or retailer, this is the CD I would want to use to demo my equipment with. It's that beautiful! If I have any problems with this release its, that the performance is just to darn short! Fifty-five minutes (the box claims sixty) is just not enough time! Your just groovn' along with this band and suddenly it ends, leaving you wanting more! The show ends with a very fast paced, somewhat rushed version of Jobim's "Waters of March" (the only song not found on the companion CD). But I can't complain too much. After viewing such a talented vocalist, performing with a top notch  band, all I can say is... buy this DVD! Highly recommended! 
 GOOD ALBUM COMMING CLOSE TO THE SECOND ONE RESURECTION...CLOSE,BUT MAYBE NOT CLOSE TO SOME. I LIKE THIS ALBUM OUT OFF ALL THE ONE'S HE MADE 
 I loved this book ... am scratching my head at the some of the negative comments.  Some of the most clever, thought-provoking gems are hidden in the middle section that one reviewer considered "rambling" ... I think a more careful read would elicit a different response.  Coelho is known for his layered prose, and this is no exception.  Given the times in which we live, the struggle between good and evil resonates heartily with those of us who so desperately ask "why?".  Although this book does not definitively answer that question, its hidden wisdom is thought-provoking and genuine.  I heartily recommend it 
 This book is as much about understanding "how and why all of us have the ability to draw but can't" as it is about teaching anyone to draw. If you are an older begginer this is a must, not only it teaches you how to tap into your natural drawing ability but it tells you why you STOPPED drawing. I always understand things better when I know why it happens or doesn't happen So if you ALSO want to feed your INTELLECT as much as your artistic talent get THIS book. If you just want mindless excercises and learn to draw by practice then get "Complete Idiot's guide to drawing," (no pun intended) by Lauren Jarrett, Lisa Lenard. The Idiot's guide pretty much copies concepts and methods THIS book puts forwared but without the detailed explanation and science behind it, specially if you are young and/or don't want to read too much. The method is the same and it WORKS 
 Fran Caffey Sandin has done a wonderful job of putting together very important short pieces to address the things that plague Christians and non-Christians alike, and each different piece gives hope in the Lord for each different difficult scenario.  After reading I sent the book on to a young man who is a family friend.  His brother just committed suicide and this will help him to know that others have had to deal with the same issues he is with regards to his loss.    Way to go Fran et al! 
 Perhaps the quintessential Towner solo guitar album - though fans of Ana and Solo Concert may disagree - this features some of the most virtuosic playing and heartfelt music of his career.  It has revealed surprises and new delights with repeated listening. More varied in spirit and dynamic than the others, with dazzling finger style runs and unique, heartfelt melodies and voicings, age has been more than kind to this artist - without losing what has been essentially his voice, he has grown and even developed in mastery of the instument. And for those who refer to this as "cerebral" music - I must say this is precisely the opposite - aesthetic, felt to the sublest nuance and requiring thought FROM the LISTENER to hear how he has, in his own words, brought the whole piano trio to the guitar - perhaps the least cerebral, though most inward and inviting, solo instrumental work crossing genres one is likely to find. A gem 
 This is the standard U.S. version.  It lacks any of the bonus tracks, but is still a great introduction to a fantastic new band.  Although known as Johnny Borrell's band, Razorlight lays down an incredible screaming raw wall of sound with a constantly surprising thread of brilliant chords and subtle themes intertwined to make you smile at all the right places.  Sometimes it's a new song, sometimes it's a pause or phrase, always it's a brilliant layering of song, lyric, and sound.  These guys formed in 02 and have paid dues on the London scene with all the famous names.  It shows in every track.  They are more than ready and this album is it.  Johnny Borrell is nothing less than spectacular and bandmembers Bjrn gren, Christian Smith-Pancorvo, and Carl Dalemo make it all work.  Andy Burrows has now replaced Christian Smith-Pancorvo on drums.  For a great run start the album with In The City/To The Sea/Fall, Fall, Fall - this is one of the best sequential runs ever recorded.  Personally I think they sound like Razorlight, but if I was into categorizing everything by the obvious influences I would say something like:  A male version of Patti Smith forgetting the lyrics to Gloria as he is invaded by the ghost of Lou Reed while being backed by John Cage and Velvet Underground.  The unexpected transition into To The Sea evolves into a Kings-Of-Leon Talihina Sky-ish piece that drops like an unexpected waterfall into the lilting acoustics of Fall, Fall Fall.  It certainly isn't Dylan (some reviewers seem to think any significant lyric sounds like dear old Bob).  Everybody justifiably raves about Rock `n' roll Lies/Eyes and Leave Me Alone but this is one of those extremely rare albums that holds together very well with each track becoming part of the cuts before and after.  It's almost a shame to talk about any single song when they all fit together so perfectly.  As with most bands these days, there is a plethora of extra and bonus tracks on CD Singles, EPs, Albums, DVDs, Import, Export, Japanese, U.S., U.K. and other versions.  To help you though the chaos, here is a current list of the Razorlight track releases that are not on the standard CD Album releases:  	Action! 	Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah 	Here It Comes 	Spirit 	Yes, You Should Know 	When He Was Twenty 	Heartbreak Soup 	Just Can't Explain 	Fairy Tale Of New York 	For Georgia 	Bright Lights 	Dean Take Your Time 	Losing Your Mind 	Get It And Go 		(hardest to find - only on import with bonus & import with bonus DVD albums) 	Hang By, Hang By 	Control! 	Dagger In Your Heart 	Believe In Me 	Anabelle Says 	Hey Ya! 	Somewhere Else 	Keep The Right Profile  There are some additional live, remix, and video tracks in addition to the songs listed above 
 I am not one to read self-help type of books, but upon special recommendation I read this one.  I am SO GLAD I did.  Joy and Gary have hit upon the very nerve of all realationships, giving us invaluable tools to  improve damaging relationships, and enrich good ones.  As I have applied  the six principles discussed in the book there has been greater wisdom and  joy in my home, and more peace in my own mind.  My goal now is to keep  these steps in practice, and by example teach them to my children thus  helping them enjoy thier lives all the more.  Contention disappears, and  stress lessens when these steps are applied.  There isn't a person alive  who couldn't use the great benefits of this book 
 Fourth graders find this book amazing when beginning a unit on the solar system.  It helps them put the size of the Earth in perspective compared to the sun and other planets.  I use an accompanying sheet that asks the children to number all of the objects from the book (a whale, the sun, etc..)in order according to size.  Then they check their answers as I read the book aloud.  It's a wonderful way to open the unit!  Definitely get this book and try it! 
 Diop has written a powerful book placing the African civilizations of what is commonly called "Ancient Egypt" at the begining of world history ,where it rightly belong. The French trained scholar used  modern linquistics to put to rest, once and for all, the the pure assertion on the part of Western Egyptologist that the language spoken by the ancient Egyptians was a  semitic language related to Hebrew and Arabic. Diop demonstrates conclusively that the language of ancient Egypt was a Black African language related genetically at many levels of the gramatical structure to the languages spoken by peope of Black Africa today! No competent linguist can demostrate that the  ancient Egyptian language is  genetically related to the so-called "Oriental Languages" or semitic family of languages. It can not be done. Dr. Theophile Obenga, a Congolese scholar who worked closely with Dr. Diop, demolished the unscientific work of  Dr. Greenberg. Greenberg placed the language of the ancient Egyptians in the semitic group or family of languages with Hebrew, Arabic, etc. Evidently Greenberg had no broad- first hand knowlege of any African language. Judging from his work, it appears doubtful if Greenberg ever seriously studied African languages. Nowdays Greenberg's work is clearly more dogma than science. Diop points out that the ancient Egyptians said that they(the ancient Egyptians)came from the South at the place in the heart of Africa where the mighty Nile river has its source. This would be in the Great Lakes region. And that Egypt was all the land watered by the Nile.  The ancient Egyptians buried their dead facing the South. To them the South was the "Holy Land", Ta Marry. The worldview of the ancient Egyptians, their cosmology and religion is African. Every element of Egyptian religion has its counterparts in the African religions of today. The concept of the KA and the Ba are found thoughout black Africa today. Christianity, Judaism and Islam grew out of the rich religious and ethical teachings of these ancient African thinkers. Oh, I could go on and on.....with for example the African origin of philosophy. Thales who was said to be the first Greek philosopher, went to Egypt and studied UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE EGYPTIAN PRIEST....even the word "philosophy" is not of Greek or even of IndoEuropean origin. Etymologically, the word is from the ancient African language spoken by the early black Africans commonly called "ancient Egyptians". For too long now, the European world has sought to take Egypt out of Africa. Later the attempt was to take Africans out of Egypt!  The European/American intellectual dogma has been dealt a tremendous blow by the work of Diop. After all the lies, distortions and slander of Mother Africa, the Truth, like RA, will emerge out of the foggy darkness of this long, cold and horrible night, to light, warm and rejuvenate the world again- healing and strengthening the wounded hearts. Read the book-you'll see!! Don Peyton  
     I found this book through an excellent dashboard [..]. This book proved to be invaluable to my creation of our company's dashboard. I had never created a dashboard before and was able to because of the easy to understand lay out of the book. This book covers different types of dashboards, how to get your data and of couse the creation of a dashboard.  This is a great book for the begginer or the seasoned veteran. I would reccomend this book to anyone who wants to create and implement a dashboard. 
    David McCullough once again demonstrates his ability to research carefully and write clearly with an exceptional balance between careful forshadowing and suspenseful piling of details to reveal the causes and the extent of the disaster.  By alternating between individual details and the larger events of the flood, McCullough highlights both the personal suffering and loss and the tremendous destructive power and ravages of the flood to the whole area.  
 If you love dogs, you'll love this book.  It is so interesting to get to read about his life with so many dogs that entered his life.  He can be very comical through the book and he can make you cry too.  His writing makes you feel that you were there with him when the stories happened.  It is unfortunate that James is no longer with us here on Earth.  God rest his soul 
 This is my 2nd favorite banjo CD behind Earl's 'Foggy Mountain Banjo'. This cd is part of the reason bluegrass saw a huge increase in popularity during the 1970's, and Weissberg's music is just as inspiring today as it was then. All songs are performed 3 finger Style and there are no lyrics on this CD. As a banjo player, this CD introduced me to some banjo classics and inspired me to learn "Pony Express", "Eight More Miles To Louisville" and "Buffalo Gals" among others. If you play or just love banjo, you owe this one to yourself 
   This movie had a better story than I expected, the action was pretty good, and of course, Jessica... 
 Lehane strikes gold once again with this kenzie/gennaro adventure. although, the reader must have realized by now that his titles don't really have anything to do with the plot (except, gone, baby, gone, mystic river and shutter island), one can't deny the fact that Lehane is one of the very best there is 
 I used to have this album when I was about 12 I am 37 now, I am so glad that I found it on Amazon, I have been trying to find it, since I lost my LP in the 80's, it reminds me alot of my brother & me, listening to "Boats againist the current" when I used to sing along with it. Thank you Amazon for having this album, can't wait to get it in the mail! Kelly kdean1988@yahoo.co 
 Pinker presents the argument for generative grammar clearly, yet not in any sort of layman's fashion.  He makes you aware of the infinite things you never knew you knew about the English language.  You leave this book feeling smart and inquisitive, not to mention with a heartfelt admiration for the author 
 After watching this movie I found it to be just an average Vampire movie. But being the huge Alyssa Milano fan that some of us are I gave it 5 stars. She has to be one of the most beautiful and sexy women on this planet 
 We've had this book for going on 2 years. It's a cute book and teaches children such valuable social skills as manners. if only all parents took such an interest in their children's manners. My son now manages to say excuse me when he burps. Reading and children... can it get any more memorable? 
 This book tends towards the polemical, without pretending to be a thorough, scholarly work. Enough references are provided however that anyone with the desire to do so could check out the particulars behind the thesis. This thesis was to this reviewer new and surprising; that Marxist thinking lies in a doctrinaire way behind a great deal of activity which I had previously considered merely vaguely leftish; that opposition, for example, to the US efforts in Iraq is highly organized with a simply subversive goal - that the US needs to be dismantled as a prelude to a Marxist world peace or utopia, an idea the writer frequently presents. Horowitz is particularly damning about certain celebrities, notably Chomsky. He does discriminate between extreme and moderate leftist views, as he terms them, but not sufficiently sharply to be altogether clear to the unwary reader, and although this does not help it does not change the central thesis, which the book prompts me to wish to investigate further.The book is not without humour, displays some verbal adroitness, and bears re-reading 
 Thanks to Robin Williams (The Non-Designer's Design Book) for her bibliography, which recommended that I carefully considered Editing by Design, among others. This book proved to be everything I hoped for. A serious value at a great price! I also purchased Allen Hurlberts book "the grid" for which I forked over an outlandish $60.00. This price does not reflect the real value in constrast to White's book. Although I expected more, Hulbert's book is grid specific by intent, that is why I purhcased it. However, I just don't see $60.00 value when I also compare it to Kimberly Elam's "Grid Systems" which for $11.53 outshines Hurlberts. Editing by Design offers full spectrum coverage for design. It's a cool book. Reading it takes me back to class where I get to sit at the feet of a master.  Buy this book, you will not be dissapointed! With this one you definately get what you pay for and much, much more.   Deepak Chopra is right! "The eye refuses to see what the mind does not know. 
 "A High Wind in Jamaica" is quite possibly the best book about children written in 20th century.  It's two successors being William Golding's "Lord of the Flies," and J.D. Salinger's "The Catcher in the Rye."  Richard Hughes' uncanny ability to lay bare the mind of a child offers continuous, piercing insights unclouded by judgement or sentimentality.  His prose evokes the strange, often bewildering perception of the innocent, with an objective, childlike point of view. Be forwarned though this novel is not for those who would dislike spending a day in the mind of young children.  Those, however, interested in child psychology or just facinated by the nature of the young will enjoy this rare gem of a book 
 This is one very nice piece of device for your computer, especially if you are only looking for something to record instrumental guitar tracks in your computer. Given that you have the necessary software to record and create backing tracks in your computer, this is definitely a great substitute to buying a whole expensive rig and having tolerant neighbors and family members at home.  This may not sound like the real amplifiers and effects it emulates, like everybody is complaining about, but you could definitely get great tones from it. You choose from a variety of amplifier head and cabinet combinations, plus a pretty wide variety of stomp boxes and effects.  All of these in front of your monitor and can be manipulated by clicking and dragging.  It is also educational for those with little or no experience in tweaking amps and effects parameters as well as mic choice and placement.  I did not sign up for Guitar Port Online, because of the bad reviews it had, but that is not what I paid this gadget for.  Overall, a very awesome piece of equipment, I just wish there was a way to plug a floorboard with this thing, to control the volume, wah as well as other effects 
 I make soaps, professionally, since about 19 years and tried a lot so far. I am curious and love to experiment. I use this book now to teach my new employees a thing or two about soap an to take the fear.   I particulary liked the part with "shortening the curing time" I did try it before, but it did not work out as wished. Thanks to this book I found my mistake, tried it and oh wonder: it works! Ok, for the size batches we make - about 800 lbs at a shot - the temperatues, etc, had to be changed, but the basics are still the same.  So if your have a small business, larger business, do it as a hobby or are just getting started, the bottom line is: Buy this book, it is worth every single cent and does not contain the usual nonsense other authors write.  Just keep one thing in mind when using the by Watson referred Soapmakers Guide from S. Miller-C.: those recipes are for KOH not NaOH! Kathy Miller's website can give you the conversions (her site is in the references/ resources of A.L. Watson's book)  So good luck and lots of fun making soap! S.

 I was only 5 when the Wall fell, and the Soviet Union began to collapse.  I could not relate to the Cold War on the level to which my parent's generation can.  I sought out this book for the purpose of building a foundation of my understanding of the events that took place in the Cold War with reference to Germany.  This book effectively served my needs.  It was well organized and presented research and arguments relevant to the german question formulated by Smyser.  While my background with the subject matter is rather limited, I can assure you that a person who wishes to use this book for the purpose that I used it will be pleasantly suprised 
 Doris Kearns Goodwin took a break from national history to get personal in this 1997 memoir of her experiences growing up a Long Island girl in the 1940s and 1950s rooting for the hard-luck Brooklyn Dodgers. Like Bob and Ray used to say, her loss is your gain.  I admit approaching this book with some trepidation. Clearly the book was inspired by Goodwin's participation as one of many talking pinheads on Ken Burns' self-important 1994 TV documentary "Baseball." On that show, where various hoi pollois traded their mortarboards for Yankee caps and extolled the Wagnerian ideal of a Whitey Ford fastball, Goodwin was a frequent, annoying presence, obviously trotted in to water down the testosterone as if George Will wasn't enough to accomplish that.  And for the first hundred pages of this not-big book, I felt justified in my prejudices, as Goodwin fills her pages with pat descriptions of suburban life loosely connected to a baseball team she writes about her enthusiasm for without any evident enthusiasm.  But once the book got going, my opinion changed. That happened when little Catholic Doris enters a confessional before her first Holy Communion. With wholesome piety, she tells the priest her darkest, most sinful secret: A wish that Yankee pitcher Allie Reynolds would break his arm.  That's not all. "I wished that Enos Slaughter of the Cards would break his ankle, that Phil Rizzuto of the Yanks would fracture a rib, and that Alvin Dark of the Giants would hurt his knee."  The priest is put out, not at her fantasies of carnage but because he's a Dodgers fan, too: "I believe they will win the World Series someday fairly and squarely," he tells her. "You don't need to wish harm on others to make it happen."  But it's easy to imagine Doris thinking otherwise, especially after Bobby Thomson slams a Ralph Branca fastball along with the Dodgers' hopes for making the Series in 1951. As Goodwin writes about that and later seasons, her account takes on a riveting poignancy that reminds one why Goodwin's books are so celebrated in the first place, not for her originality as a historian but for her synthesizing skill as a writer.  She even gets the chance to see her heroes close up, and unlike the baseball stars of today, they don't disappoint. Gil Hodges accepts her gift of a St. Christopher medal to help him out of a batting slump with gentle affection. Jackie Robinson signs her autograph book with a bit of hard-earned wisdom: "Keep your smile a long, long while."  No, the book's not perfect. It starts slow, and her attempts to tie her childhood in with big stories of the day like the Army-McCarthy hearings and the integration standoff in Little Rock feel like strained, politically correct cocktail chatter rather than a real accounting of a young life amid confusing times.  But most of the way through, you get a really sweet and sharp picture of what it was like to care about baseball when it was worth caring about. Goodwin has a gift for making history live again in the pages of her books, and like Ebbets Field, presents her readers here with a real diamond in the rough 
 This whole book has made such a difference to me, who has been wearing no jeans, only long flowy (comfortable) dresses for the last 5 years, but after reading, felt inspired to take a baby step towards changing my look by getting some low rise jeans after Sam pointed out some of their virtues.  I thought I could be a bit "past it" but anyway, I went out and got three great pairs.  They all looked so great I couldn't decide which to buy.  The first night I went out to a christmas do at my old work and everyone came up to me telling me that they didn't recognise me, I looked great, must have a new man etc etc.  The old boss told me a few days later, how many nice things people were saying about me.  I am sure the jeans made me look like my legs were longer, hips slimmer, waist curvier.  My daughter complimented me, telling me I look like a model now.  And they are so comfortable, not like the jeans of my youth, which felt like cardboard after washing, and which, to zip up, one had to lie flat on ones back and breath in.  Now, when I wear any of those three pairs of jeans, I look just right.  That is just one way this fantastic book has helped.  Taking advice from this book has made me look and feel youthful again.  Who'd a thought.   As for the book design, it is gorgeous.  The spacing and fonts used throughout are great, the way the chapters are divided, the practical tips and the "Sam says" asides all combine to make this work a delight to read.  The hunky author is on the cover, and the way he writes is so friendly and down to earth, yet honest, you just feel he would be a very, very cool friend to have.    Love this book.  If you go to my profile page you will see the kind of books I give a 5 star rating to.  Looking forward to Sam's next book now 
 A nice little introduction to the dark side of swinging 60's London.Rent boys,old lags on bombers,ska loving skins and (...)jewish gangsters, these are a few of the interesting characters we meet in this well written ode to a special time in the Citys criminal history.The second book in Arnotts trilogy flings us around the night clubs,seedy east end drinking dens and aristocratic country estate parties of merry old England following the murder investigation of a rent boy,dodging a bent cop and trying to make some cash at good old fashioned gangsterism.At the same time the author details the changes in english youth culture during that period in a very enjoyable way.Well worth the 5 bob 
 This book bescribes Moses being protected by a u.f.o when the Red sea is seperated and the burning bush might have been extaterrestrial influenced. This book is filled with close encounters in the Bible that might have been aliens. This book is worth a read 
 My family and I have been fans of Tyler Perry since seeing our first Madea video borrowed from a friend several years ago. When I saw this set, I had to have it. He speaks the language of families and has much better subject matter and language in his productions than many my family could see elsewhere. We are making plans to see his latest production "What's Done In The Dark" live, and know it will be worth it. Get this set for your DVD library - you won't regret it 
 My daughter does not enjoy reading.  However, when she discovered the Junie B. Jones series, she loves them & reads them over & over.  Her favorite is the Beauty Shop Guy & this one.  They are funny, & enjoyable.  However, I will caution that if a child is influenced easily they may not be the best.  Junie B. Jones is a lot like Nick's Rugrats--they are always into mischeif, and don't behave the best.  She also talks in 3rd person and doesn't have the best grammar.  With that said, if taken appropriately as entertainment, they are very funny, you never know what she's going to do next.  We love them, but I know a few who do not appreciate them 
 This is just a wonderful sequel to Anne of Green Gables.  It deals with Anne's life after returning to Avonlea to teach and before she goes off to college.  Seeing Anne begin to come into adulthood is exciting and yet a little sad.  It is exciting to see her deal with the new challenges from being a school teacher and inspiring her students to starting the Avonlea Village Improvement Society (to which there is some resistance from the Avonlea elders at first).  Anne is still of course a kindred spirit, but it seems that she is mellowing as she matures (which was is just a touch sad, but as Mr. Henderson says, all things must change).  For anyone who liked the first book, this is sure to not disappoint 
 "Faith and Rationality" is not a layperson's book (what did you expect!).  This is the introduction to the whole notion of "reformed epistemology."  The essays are composed by Alston, Mavrodes, Wolsterstorff, Plantinga, Marsden, and D. Holwerda.  The theme of the book begins with the rejection of "classical foundationalism," which is later supplemented by an agument for God's existence (God's existence is properly basic).  I was very surprised and intrigued by D. Holwerda's essay.  His eerie essay critiques Wolfhart Pannenburg's theology and thought on the Resurrection of Christ.  Good book before reading Alvin Plantinga's Warrant series 
 This is the essence of object oriented analysis, encompassing all aspects of the topic.  I wholeheartedly recommend it to programmers of all levels 
 What a fascinating journey through a bizarre and brilliant mind! I had always wanted to learn more about Philip K. Dick, but had been turned off by other articles and books that had drained the life from Dick's story with overly dry and pedantic prose. In contrast, Carrere offers psychological insight and philosophical speculation  that can only be described as "Phildickian." As one who had read all of Dick's better-known works, Carrere seems to have reanimated Dick's spirit in this compelling, partially novelized tale. What the reader sacrifices in footnotes and verifiable fact is more than made up for by the sheer human interest of the story.   
 I've gotten many compliments on these shoes!  I love how they look, they are made of a soft material so they are comfortable, but still cause sore feet after shopping all day in them.  But that's the cost of looking cute 
 Loads of information, with good illustrations.  Would be a must have if you are in Iraq.  Everyone would have a better understanding of improvised munitions if they would read this book, that includes the press 
 This album is very strange. Upbeat guitar back grounds provide a nice frame for the easy flowing lyrics. Very positive and uplifting album, there are a few week moments though. It's basically a pop album 
 This book has a wide range of scenes - for 2 men, 2 woman, one man, one  woman.  Great scenes from old classics - The Lion in Winter, The Children's  Hour, etc. If you don't want to do the same old scenes, this book is great.  It's not a how-to, just the scenes. Schulman & Mekler are great anyway.  They have other good compilations 
 Gillette died a horrendous death in the Hinda Kush.  He left behind this book and one on a circumnavigation of Everest.  This was the best book for nordic skiing up till about 1990, when the current telemark equipment evolution took the sport out of its nordic context  into the realm of pure alpine skiing.  For those who still are  nostalgic for skiing on skinny skis, this book is still the best.  For  another classic, see Steve Barnett's Cross Country Downhill.  For the latest on telemark skiing, read Paul Parker's book on Freeheel Skiing 
 In Philadelphia, over the past summer, I happened to be in a used book store perusing the shelves for a good read.  Being a student of writing, I thought after a short time, that I should look for some works by my  professors at school.  The first author I looked for was Helena Maria  Viramontes, because the way she talks about writing is better than a lot of  the stuff authors publish.  She always talks in class about her novel,  Under the Feet of Jesus, or her new work.  All they had was a collection of  short stories that I didn't remember ever having heard her talk about,  called The Moths and Other Stories.  I picked it up, bought it, and by the  end of the day had finished reading it.  What a great collection of stories  it is.  It's so enjoyable to read that you finish it before you would like  to.  I have told professor Viramontes about my finding it, and she said  that she rarely thought of the collection anymore, but that she was very  happy with some of the stories it contained.  I was very happy with the  whole book.  I think you will be too

 Anyone who has dieted knows diets don't work. They don't work because diets consist of temporary changes to one's typical dietary habits. This inevitably results in temporary weight loss because as soon as you reach your weight loss goals and start letting some of those former eating habits creep back into your life, guess what? You start to gain back all the weight you lost.  By intentionally marketing diets as a quick fix, commercial diet plans have been designed to keep you stuck in this vicious cycle of yo-yo dieting that keeps you coming back to them again and again. A few commercial diet marketers realized that consumers were beginning to catch on to this little scam, so now they have "maintenance" phases that promise to help you keep that weight off for life. There's just one catch: these maintenance phases are designed to turn you into a life long consumer of their endless supply of prepackaged, processed foods designed to "help" you keep that weight off.   This is the sort of "help" I expect from a crack dealer, not from someone promising to improve my life.   The Okinawa Diet Plan is not about any of that. This book is all about giving you the tools to learn how to eat and live in a way that will keep you lean and healthy for life. And that lean, healthy life is likely to be a very long one because the Okinawa Diet Plan is based on evidence taken from studying the longest-lived people on the planet.   It seems most commercial diets are built on a business plan rather than on research. Not so with The Okinawa Diet Plan. The Okinawa Diet Plan grew out of nearly 30 years of solid research from an international team of highly respected doctors and scientists. How many commercial diets can say that?   The ongoing Okinawa Centenarian Study, from which this diet plan is derived, is the most extensive and respected study of its kind. It has produced and enormous amount of research, showing how Okinawans manage to stay naturally lean, fit and healthy up until their final years (often exceeding 100). Like the cover of the paperback edition of this book says, this is "the only diet with 100 years of living proof."  This is not hype. I've seen people attempt to discredit this book in reviews here; but if you look closely at these smear tactics, they invariably turn out to contain spurious and misleading charges from individuals with questionable reputations who are often aggressively promoting their own books and agendas that the evidence uncovered by the authors of The Okinawa Diet Plan tends to disprove.   Yes, I am obviously a big fan. I have struggled with my weight all of my life and have been waiting for a long time for a book like this to show up, so it ticks me off when people slam this book by spreading lies.   Thanks to The Okinawa Diet Plan I am continuing to shed pounds at a healthy, steady pace: I've lost 43 pounds since adopting the recommendations in this wonderful book. I am now more fit, healthy and have more energy than ever before in my life. I have now learned to put my health first and I no longer strive to look like the anorexic models and body builders that commercial diets use to sell their products. I look great, I feel great and I'm well on my way to outliving any bodybuilder or model.   If you still think that the Okinawa Diet Plan is just like any other diet, do what I did: give this book to your doctor to read and then ask him or her if this is a diet plan worth following. My doctor is now huge fan and tireless supporter of this book.   So say sayonara to South Beach and adios to Atkins -- I've tried most of them and this is simply the best diet book on the market, period 
 This book is a must have for aspiring comics and comedy lovers alike.  Brown's book is a tool that inspires as well as guides those interested in the art of joke writing.  The book includes a wide range of talent from legendary comics like Bill Cosby to the up and coming comedic stars of tomorrow. If nothing else the book allows the reader the opportunity to learn what makes these neurotic people tick 
 i completely love this whole album. what's great about it is that you can never get any of these songs confused with another on the CD, each song has something different and special about it. "bandages" and "this town" are great songs. as well as everything else on the cd. but those are just my favorites. it's definately worth owning 
 As a lover of historical fiction this is one of the best that I have read. The plot,characters,action are superb and the pace of the novel is great.This is a true page turner that cant be put down. I have started to read Pressfields"Tides of War" and hope that it will be more of the same 
 The recipes in this cookbook are delicious.  I use it again and again and have created some of my most memorable meals.  The recipes are well written, easy to follow and the results are the best.  One of my favorite  cookbooks 
 New York Times best selling author Robin Cook creates yet another frightening novel to add to his arsenal.  His novel Vector opens a window into the life of three terrorists who plan to contaminate New York City with anthrax..  Yuri, a Russian chemical engineer whom is contracted by two neo Nazi leaders who ask him to create a large amount of anthrax powder.  The tow men plan to release the powder in a federal building on a windy day so that the poison will blow over Central Park..  In order to determine the potency of his anthrax, Yuri poisons a Jewish rug dealer.  Its not until Medical Examiner Jack Stapleton is given an intriguing case of  undetermined death.  The corpse belonged to a Jewish man named Jason Papris.  Determining the cause of death for Jason Papris will reveal a case of anthrax poisoning and be the first step in foiling the terrorist's plot. Vector is a race against time on both ends of the hero/villain spectrum.  The terrorists race to finish making the anthrax powder before their plans become apparent to authorities and Jack Stapleton races to discover the cause of death of the Jewish rug dealer.  Vector is a great addition to Robin Cook's collection of medical thrillers.  If you like this book, also try these titles by Robin Cook: Shock, Abduction, Fever, Godplayer, Toxin, Invasion, Chromosome 6, Contagion, Acceptable Risk, Fatal Cure, Terminal, Blindsight, Vital Signs, Harmful Intent, Mutation, Mortal Fear, Outbreak, Mindbend, Brain, Sphinx, Coma, and The Year of the Intern. 	 
 This book, containing plenty of cases in accordance with each topic in every chapter, gives readers hand-on perception on how the theory exists within the business world. I especially love chapter 8:"Channel Power", which specifies 5 powers a manufacturer or distributor may owns and how to deploy them properly in different situation or period. While you read, the book keeps you thinking about your own business and desiring to apply these breakthrough knowledge tomorrow, great 
 I found Alice in Genderland to be absolutely riveting and immensely readable. Alice's account of her journey from curious pre-pubescent boy to her `coming of age' is told with total clarity and openness.  Alice in Genderland is at times painful, sometimes amusing and sometimes highly erotic, but always rewarding. Ultimately, the journey was fulfilling, certainly for this reader. Alice's professionalism and intelligence shine throughout this book, which manages to interleave it's narrative with a historical perspective and an analytical viewpoint. A word of warning however. If you are having relationship problems, or if like me,  you are of the older generation of TG person, be prepared for a cathartic experience and read Alice in Genderland in a quiet room with subdued lighting and a good glass of wine. Preferably with a ready supply of  dark chocolate. You may just end up in floods of tears. How I wish it had been around when I was a young student. I commend Alice and Richard's wife, to whom Alice in Genderland is dedicated. 
 In the early Seventies Tommy Bolin was the ultimate Rock Star/Guitarist. As an artist his skills were right up there with the greats. His star burned very brightly and was extinguished way to early. Born in Sioux City, Iowa, U.S.A. Dropping out of school at the age of sixteen (There was far too much talent contained in that body to be trussed up in the education system). He moved to Denver where he at first joined a band called American Standard, before quickly being enticed away to form the freeform jazz/rock band Zephyr, who released two albums of psychedelic tinged music with Tommy Bolin playing some very impressive guitar. Leaving Zephyr behind in 1971 Tommy Bolin joined Energy who although they did not have a record contract as such soon built up a huge reputation on the live circuit. During this time Tommy Bolin did the sessions for the Billy Cobham album Spectrum, as soon as this album was released in 1973 the world of rock music could no longer ignore this precocious talent. Tommy Bolin then left Energy to replace Joe Walsh in the James Gang now although this was a huge rung up the ladder of fame and glory, it was still an unexpected move as the James Gang were really just a straight ahead rock 'n' roll band, a very good rock 'n' roll band, but really Tommy Bolin's talents were a little under used in this situation. Must of been great fun though, as in the James Gang used lots of pyrotechnics, dry ice, and a lot of lighting, with the stage show requiring a lot of running around and throwing shapes. Whilst with the James Gang Tommy Bolin appeared on two albums 'Bang' (1973) and Miami (1974) with Tommy Bolin having a hand in writing most of the songs, and jolly fine albums they are too. After the James Gang Tommy Bolin did some session work, and then when Ritchie Blackmore left Deep Purple, Tommy Bolin at the tender age of 23 was invited to join as his replacement. Deep Purple at the time were still one of the biggest names in Rock 'n' Roll. At the same time Tommy Bolin had been offered a solo recording contract, and such was the ability and confidence of the man that he decided to accept both offers. So whilst recording his upcoming solo album Teaser which was released in November 1975, Tommy Bolin was also rehearsing with Deep Purple, and recording with them a new album 'Come Taste the Band 'released in October of 1975. Tommy Bolin wrote all the songs on his solo album, and had a hand in writing most of the songs on the Deep Purple album. Teaser is a fantastic album that played today stands the test of time, it is definitely a rock album, but not the same sort of heavy rock played by Deep Purple. The Deep Purple album is also a good album but not the sort of album that you would expect from Deep Purple (Far better though than their terrible previous album the contemptible 'Stormbringer'). The trouble was that the mark four Deep Purple, had divided into warring factions The two original members, drummer Ian Paice, and keyboard player, Jon Lord  were still into playing hard rock and dare I say it, were a little older, (This is all irrelevant really as the band were all still all in their twenties). David Coverdale who had been scooped from obscurity two year before, but was essentially a blues singer, Glenn Hughes on bass and vocals had come from funk rock band 'Trapeze' and was determinedly pushing Deep Purple in a funky direction as well as harboring hopes of becoming lead vocalist too. When you drop the young talented Tommy Bolin into this mix, it is time to light the blue touch paper and stand back. With the albums waiting for release Deep Purple embarked on a massive world tour encompassing, Hawaii, New Zealand, Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, America, and finally Europe. The set list comprised of Deep Purple standards with a couple of new songs thrown in, and even for a time some of Tommy Bolin's solo efforts. But everywhere they went all people wanted to talk about was what had happened to the previous guitar player, putting the young Tommy Bolin under enormous pressure. Deep Purple though still had great drawing power and were therefore in a position to take advantage of all the excesses of the rock 'n' roll life style. Tommy Bolin was a party animal and what is a party animal supposed to do under those conditions. Party! By the time the band got to Japan they realized they had a serious problem with their new guitarist. The gigs in Japan were a disaster, and although things were straightened out for the American leg of the tour, the evil ways were back by the time the band came to play Britain, where during Tommy Bolin's solo spot at Wembley the poor guy just froze. As soon as the tour was over the band broke up and for eight years there was no Deep Purple, until the mark 2 line up got back together again.  Meanwhile Tommy Bolin got a new Tommy Bolin Band back together again recorded another fabulous album 'Private Eyes' and went back on the road again. But unfortunately the dye had been cast and on 4th December of that year Tommy Bolin passed away after a gig in Miami Florida. He was only 25. Thirty year later his music still lives on, in 1989 there was a marvelous double CD box set called 'The Ultimate' released with tracks from all over his career. Such was the brilliance of the man that there have been regular releases from the archives over the years all of them worthy of your attention. In 2005 we were given this collection 'Whips and Roses'. The music is stunning. Tommy Bolin's singing and guitar playing is simply jaw droppingly good. The album opens with a rockin' version of 'Teaser' which fairly rocks out of your speakers whilst retaining that trademark Bolin funky backbeat. A lot of the other songs are works in progress for the Teaser album, this does not mean that they are inferior versions in fact I think every song on this album is absolutely at it's zenith, and the title of the songs is irrelevant. Second track on the album is 'Fandango' which was called 'Crazed Fandango' when the studio version was released. 'Cookoo' is a jam based on the Tommy Bolin classic 'Homeward Strut', but boy what a jam. The version of 'Wild Dogs on this album is the best I have ever heard, and is worth the price of the album alone. Starting with it's downbeat vocals of a drifter on the road, before Tommy makes the six strings howl as the song builds to a shattering climax. Why this song has not been covered by other bands I do not know, but somebody like Bon Jovi could do a cracking version. There is also Jeff Cooks beautiful ballad Dreamer here. Tommy Bolin must have burnt his fingers his playing is so fast on 'Marching Powder'. You can almost hear the sweat running down the fret board. The fifteen minutes of Flyin' Fingers speaks for itself. The album finishes with two jam work out's with Tommy Bolin letting the music carry him away. 'Just Don't Fall Down' clocks in at nearly eleven exciting minutes, the aptly titled 'Blowin' Your Cookies' was recorded the night before Tommy Bolin passed away, when Tommy got up and played with the house band at his hotel in Miami. It is a twelve minute drop into what was obviously a longer jam, but the guitar work is staggeringly good. There is no information on who played what on what track as most of these recordings have been taken from unmarked boxes, but whoever they were they were very good. The album comes with a fine booklet with some informed liner notes by Simon Robinson. The production was handled by Greg Hampton in association with Tommy Bolin's brother John. The work they have done should be applauded, a second volume of 'Whips and Roses' is promised for early 2007, I personally will look forward to that.  Mott the Dog. 
 I bought this book to learn about dining table construction. The instructions are clear and concise and includes ALL the steps required to make 9 tables.  Kim Carleton Graves is obviously a very good teacher and it really comes across in this book. I found this book a great learning aid and I'm sure I will refer to it time and time again. Please publish a book on chairs. 
 This book picks up where the author's Anxiety and Phobia Workbook left off.  The affirmations in the back alone are worth the price of the book, which presents a wide variety of ideas for living a more peaceful and satisfying life. The author is obviously a highly sensitive and caring therapist with a deep understanding of these problems.  Highly recommended 
 This book, published in 1996, still has plenty of good information for the person who wants to build a family web site. Most of the technical information is probably old-hat to most people who navigate the web today, but the ideas for a family site are what make the book so valuable. It gives the reader some good ideas about content, such as a family newsletter, guest book, recipes, family tree, and a whole lot more. Getting the visitor's attention - and keeping it - will be key, so it's important to think about how to keep the site lively and interesting.  A worthwhile start 
 Although it started out a bit slow, this book has become one of my all time favorites! So true to life, it takes you to the Middle Ages, enthralls you. The main characters are some of my favorite from any book. Make no mistake; this is truly a love story, but not for those who just want fluff.I have always found novels that went into depth regarding many of the main characters to be the best.I felt I knew Joanna & Llewlyn:I cried several times over their story.If you loved Madeline Hunter's "Protector", yet want something more, this is the book for you. Can't wait to order Ms Penman's other books 
 Even though I am a Hillerman fan, my expectations were loweredfor this book. I'm mainly interested in his Navajo mysteries. However,I found this book to be well-written and compelling. Definitely worththe read, even though it isn't Hillerman's best 
 It is truly inspirational to read about a businessman succeeding by being perfectly moral.  Ray Kroc continuously focused on delivering positives instead of negatives.  He was way ahead of his time, realizing the power of the entrepreneurial spirit and how to harness that in a large corporation 
 Through tracing the simplification of American speech and music over the last century (in some cases, longer), McWhorter demonstrates the loss of complexity, and with it, a love for the English (American) language.  Showing his own ambivalence about, or possibly seduction by, this simplification, McWhorter shows how this continued degradation is stripping our public discourse of the very richness and precision we most need in these complex times, though he doesn't hammer this point home.  (Note: This book makes much more sense if one realizes that good writing is thought on paper.)  McWhorter subtly implies, though never states, that the American public's desire for the 'real,' the 'honest' and the simple, is, perhaps, a mistake.  Very well written (with a few editing mistakes!), I give it 4 stars, as it doesn't provide any ideas for changing the situation.  Having said that, I am making efforts to improve my own writing and speaking as a result of this book 
 This is the 7th or 8th of Smiths wonderful story books I have read. What I enjoyed about 44 Scotland Street, as always, was the richness of character, the foibles, fears and strengths of these multiple and varying people who you feel you know on first aquaintance. The psychiatrist and overbearing mother take therapy to a whole new and perverse level! The narcissistic adonis, the bewildered young lady on a gap, the indecissive gallery manager are just a few of the treats in store. The ending of the book does not tie everything together in a neat package but you have enough at this point to do your own closure on the main actors of the book. A fun read 
 This film was a real winner. Again, had that "Grind house" feel type movie and sure enough, you can see why this movie tried to cash in on the "Dawn of the Dead"(old version) buzz of the 70s...very cool zombie flick and the best i've seen in some time. Highly Recommended 
 Blood on the Tracks is my favorite Dylan record, so I was learnign more about its creation. The book is pretty good in giving the rundown on the NYC and Minneapolis recording sessions. The only weak point is Gill's analysis of the songs, critiques that pale in comparison to those of other writers whom he quotes. That aside, the book gives Dylan his due as a rock genius without smacking of hero worship 
 Delightful, low-key, descriptively lean account of England circa the 1330s through the eyes of a handicapped boy. Not the action adventure some readers seem to be expecting, but a non-revisionist slice of life, Middle Ages style. Younger readers will need to be good readers, and patient ones, to reap these rewards. (In fact, that's what this book is about!)   De Angeli's short Newbery winner follows Robin, ten year old son of a nobleman fighting in Edward III's "Scottish wars" and one of the Queen's ladies-in-waiting. Robin's London caregivers are wiped out by the plague, so the care of his delicate health (he has recently been stricken lame) falls to a benevolent monk named Brother Luke. The good brother quietly applies himself to strengthening Robin in both body and mind, emphasizing that perseverance and patience will always result in finding "a door in the wall," a way beyond present obstacles. Robin's lessons include wood carving, reading, writing, singing and playing music, swimming, and walking with crutches.   There is no insistent plot to jerk the story forward and no loud, overstated characters to interfere with Robin's quiet development. Robin shares some mild adventures on the road in the company of Luke and a minstrel named John Go-in-the-wynd before all his newfound resourcefulness and skill are called upon in defense of a local castle. 	 Nice, pleasant, quick. Unapologetic about the era's Christian culture and the benevolence of its priests, so probably not very popular among trendy Newbery spokespeople these days. But De Angeli's message of gentle, humble perseverance is actually inspiring. 
 Dominique was fantistic In Intern, I love her in that one, She is one of the best actresses i know. If i had her address or e-mail address i'd let her know how much i love her movie's and her. Ric 
 I am flattered that an inerrantist Christian reviewer, named "The Professor," has declared my book a "must read" for "all pastors." (Shouldn't the rest of the folks in Christian churchs read it as well, perhaps as part of a church-wide apologetics seminar? *smile*)   On the other hand I was surprised to read the Professor's admission that "over 90%" of his family has "left the church." Perhaps he read my book to try and understand why? He blames the poor intellectual level of Sunday School classes and the "indoctrination" of government schools for many leaving Christianity (and perhaps also blames such institutions for not teaching that the long gone original copies of the Bible's book were perfect, as if merely stating such an unproven hypothesis by itself would be effective). Perhaps the Professor misses the fact that simply being in an atmosphere of people who all have different views, and noticing that people of completely differeing beliefs may yet share many of the same virtues as oneself, is enough to make one think in more "liberal" terms toward those who don't believe exactly as you do?   In the rest of his review the professor rails against Darwinism, agnosticism, atheism, and nominal/cultural Christians, basically, anyone who isn't an inerrantist Christian like himself. He apparently was unable to discover the sleightest common ground or shared understanding between himself and any other person whose testimony is in the book, even though it contains a diversity of testimonies, including those who merely grew more moderate in their Evangelical Christian beliefs. Perhaps that explains why 90% of his family has, as he sees it, "left the fold." 
 This book is of tremedous value to the individual ready to take resposibility for themselves at a higher level. It may also help open a reader to a greater awareness of their part/responsibility in relationships of all kinds 
  I first saw "Wild Strawberries" many years ago at one of the special screenings in the small theater in Moscow. It was the first Bergman's film I ever saw. This picture is amazing in its emotional impact and in my opinion is one of Bergman's most optimistic, profound, and warm films.  "Wild Strawberries" provides sincere, intelligent, and emotional contemplations of life's disappointment, regrets, and losses. The main character, seventy-eight-year-old Professor Isak Borg is forced to see his life in a true and painful light, but he also would learn that there is hope.  Sparkling cinematography by Gunnar Fisher and superb acting of Bergman's regulars - Ingrid Thulin, Bibi Anderson, Gunnar Bjornstrand, Max von Sydow and especially, the great silent film director, Victor Sjostrom as Professor Borg add to many delights of "Wild Strawberries" which also include Bergman's writing/directing with his famous mixing of conscious and unconscious, dreams and reality, the past and the present in the same scene.  That was something else I realized while watching "Wild Strawberries" - how close Bergman and another favorite director of mine, Andrei Tarkovsky were. I knew that Tarkovsky had called himself Bergman's student, and both of them had great respect for each other's work and talent, but it was during that first watching of "Wild Strawberries", I knew where Tarkovsky looked when he was creating his own masterpiece, "Zerkalo" or "The Mirror" (1975)   
 I mean that.  Seriously.  Not in a "Dostoevsky short story collection on the beach just to be uber-literate" kind of way.  In an "every day, a little bit more of a precious time slips away - already sad about Fall" kind of way.  Each exquisite word of this book brings comfort and pain, as relevant today as it must have been forty years ago.  Some things are gone forever.  New Orleans will never be what it was.  And it's hard to think of stock brokering as sedate in a post-nine-to-five global economy.  But where we've come since that time is precisely what makes this book so important today.  We are so tired AND so overstimulated that mere movies lack the magic necessary to lift the malaise.  Cultural crises can't even do it, not now that our own towers have fallen.  And some of us are mired in it, waking fitfully to vote, or write letters to the editor, or visit an elder.  This book lifts those scales a bit, like a breeze on a beach umbrella.  And it will stay with you, like the memory of that breeze on your cheek.  I know this.  I bought and read The Moviegoer first in 1983.  I gave it away after a couple of years.  I ordered a new copy today, because it's a humid day that smells of honeysuckle, and I cannot get this book out of my head 
 On page 72 Ryrie tells us, "One ancient Indian technique, Kaya Kalpa, stops, or even reverses, the ageing proces through fasting and drinking healthy water to facilitate the physical cleansing that supports the subtle meditation practices."  Water molecules vibrate with energy - drink healthy water and enjoy a healthy body.     We also learn that since the dawn of humans, there have always been water cults, and that baptism was a ritual practiced long ago by certain Egyptians, and is rooted in Shinto, Confucian, Christian, and Hindu water customs.      As author of "The Holy Order of Water," I found this book to be a much needed addition to our awakening interest in water for our health and, as a way of life 
 This soundtrack is one of the best I have.  It's also one of Hans Zimmer's best by far.  The song from the movie trailer that was mentioned is called "Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad" and is supposedly by Moby.  It isn't on the soundtrack, which is a bummer because after seeing the trailer so many times I associate that song with the movie, but it is worth hunting down because of this 
 I read Skellig a little while back and even today I couldnt stop thinking about how well thought out a book it was. It is an easy to read book that you'll likely finish in a day. David Almond did a fantastic job at bringing the story of Michael, Mina, and of course Skellig to life on the pages. Excellent book for kids as well, 5 stars 
 The name of the book is the name of the major character and it is his occupation.  This is a short book (take it with you if your flight is not a real long one, I finished this book in a few hours), but it is excellent (gritty, grimy) crime fiction. If you are looking for noir in a modern book, look no further. 
 Loved the videos, have been sezrching for Koyannisquatsi for quite a long time.  Was delighted I could get the 2 pack 
 Easy to understand with not a tremendous amount of complicated math to dicipher.  Just what the doctor ordered 
 Book #24 in the In Death Series. In this book we have the death of Dr. Icove.  Eve suspects a professional due to the efficient way he was killed.  Security disks show his last appointment of the day a beautiful woman entering and leaving his office.  As Eve thinks his record is too clean she suspect his son another Dr., knows more than he is saying... But then he ends up dead in the same precise manner.  This is a tale of Doctors playing God. Eve butts heads with Mira in this book and it is a little annoying.  But other than that this book is excellent and the plot so different 
 Rick Voit, Ph.D. Co-author: Hypnosis in Clinical Practice: Steps for Mastering Hypnotherapy. (Routledge)  	Trancework is a wonderful achievement in presenting a thorough conceptual framework and understanding of trance states, hypnotic communication and the rationale for technique. Through its clear language, thorough review of research, and the introduction of powerful and novel teaching formats, Yapko carefully carries the reader from this well-established framework into very practical applications for psychotherapy. Its progressive building of concepts and logical applications results in a comprehensive discussion of how hypnosis and hypnotic language serve as natural extensions of the therapeutic process to basic skills and clear-cut guidelines for the integration of hypnosis into practice. 	This book certainly provides the reader with many practical ideas for hypnotic language, induction procedures and clinical treatment planning. Yet, this reviewer believes the book's strength lies in how effectively it lays the groundwork for why these methods make sense. His sections on the concepts behind trance and hypnosis, human suggestibility and responsiveness, brain function, and various contexts in which hypnosis is practiced give the reader a depth of understanding that fully restore this meaning to an extent that few other texts achieve.  	This is a book with few if any weaknesses. If anything, it may have attempted to do too much and yet, should any of its elements be removed, it would not be the complete work that it is. Yapko's thorough examination of the myths surrounding hypnosis and how they reflect misinterpretations of the process involved serve to illuminate the alternative truths involved. He most effectively dispels myths about hypnosis by examining ways in which responsiveness and suggestibility create the potentials through which we induce trance. This assignment of responsibility and further discussion of normal hypnotic phenomena allow the reader to grasp the purpose of techniques as means of utilizing, not manufacturing, trance behavior. In short, it successfully replaces the mindset of "doing hypnosis" with one of "being hypnotic."  	Unlike many other introductory books, Trancework carefully and clearly examines those conditions and characteristics in people and in the therapeutic setting that lay the groundwork for hypnotic communication. I would recommend this book for students of hypnosis at any level of training. For the serious beginner, there is probably no more comprehensive and user-friendly text available. It has been my experience that many professionals who have completed advanced levels of training have not gained a comprehension of the hypnotic process sufficient to comfortably apply their skill with any range or effectiveness. In Trancework, these readers will discover an opportunity to expand their knowledge base while increasing the breadth of their hypnosis skills. Because of its clarity and scope, this book would be of great interest to someone seriously curious about hypnosis.   	 	     
 'Kabul' opens at the end of what the New York Times has called the Golden Age of Afghanistan, when Kabul was a sophisticated international capital with a co-ed university drawing faculty from around the world. It follows one prominent half-American family caught up in events from the end of the monarchy until the Soviet invasion, which set the stage for 22 years of war and international abandonment, and ultimately the rise of the Taliban. This portrait of Afghanistan's not-too-distant past explores the tensions that came to polarize the country 
 The premise in this tightly wrought thriller directed by the very accomplished Sydney Pollack is that Zuwanie (Earl Cameron) the old dictator (once "freedom fighter") of an African nation called "Matobo" is coming to New York to make a speech in front of the General Assembly of the United Nations.  Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), an interpreter at the UN, overhears part of a conversation after-hours that leads her to believe that there will be an assassination attempt on the leader's life.  She tells security.  Federal agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) is called in to investigate and help prevent an assassination.  Keller quickly discovers that Silvia is from Matobo where her parents were murdered by some of Zuwanie's henchmen and where she was subsequently involved in some political/paramilitary activities.  Two questions that Keller must answer are, does she have some sort of motive to lie and how is she involved?  The problem with the film (aside from some of the usual improbabilities and contortions found in Hollywood thrillers--and to be honest there weren't that many in this one) is the ending.  Without giving anything away, the probability of Zumanie being left alone after what had happened is something like zero.  But the real problem is what happens between Tobin and Silvia at the end.  They are both very available and after they have had the opportunity to bond under very difficult circumstances, can you guess how their relationship is resolved?  I understand there was an alternative ending.  Maybe Pollack should have employed it.  Pollack's films going back several decades are characterized by diversity of subject matter, excellent scripts, and star power.  Four of his best are They Shoot Horses Don't They? (1969) (depression ear dance marathon drama starring Jane Fonda); Tootsie (1982) (romantic comedy starring Dustin Hoffman); Out of Africa (1985) (adapted from the famous book by Karen Blixen under her pen name "Isak Dinesen," starring Meryl Streep and Robert Redford); and Sabrina (1995) (splendid remake of the Audrey Hepburn film this time starring Julie Ormond and Harrison Ford).  But he tends to like action/adventure as much as comedy or drama.  He is one of filmdom's most versatile directors, and this film, while not his best, is very representative of his work.  But what carries the film is the charisma of the stars, Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman, especially Kidman who seems the very impersonation of what an interpreter at the UN might be.  She manages to be delicate but tough, thoroughly professional and beautiful.  I have seen her in seven or eight films and can say that she is as talented as any actress currently working.  In her ability to concentrate and to completely immerse herself in a role she is comparable to Meryl Streep.  Some early films of hers that display her youthful vitality and the natural sophistication and nuanced manner of her style are Dead Calm (1989), Flirting (1991), and To Die For (1995).  By the way, "Matobo" is not an actual nation but is the name of a national park in Zimbabwe and as far as I can tell "Ku" is not an actual language.  (I have no idea what they were speaking.)  Bottom line: Can a film directed by Sydney Pollack starring Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn be anything but worth seeing? 
 This was a great find for $5.29 w/ free shipping. A clasic GI Joe, pretty much the same scale, good for boys who want to play with their sister, but not with effeminate Ken 
 There's a lot of useful information in this book, and it may be the only place to get all of that knowledge in a single volume.  You'll need some reading stamina, because it's long and parts of it are uninteresting.  Hall's facts are wrong in a couple of places (just a few examples: his chapter on Islam is pretty much worthless, and since when was Thor's hammer made of ram's horns?) and he seems to have an axe to grind, in terms of linking Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism to Pythagoreanism, Alchemy, etc etc to the shadowy Illuminati pulling the strings behind the formation of the United States and its model of government.  America supposedly has some sort of Mystical Destiny that was predetermined by a group of Immortal Magi, the true initiates of the Elysian and Hermetic mysteries, and so on.  Please .. tone down the crazy just a bit, Mr. Hall! You'll have to read with a slightly critical eye to pick out which parts of this book are useful to you and which parts are not, but overall it is definitely worth the effort.  I was introduced to a lot of new ideas.  One of the benefits of mysticism is the new perspective it can give you, a new way of perceiving the same old things you've been looking at all your life.  There are profound secrets everywhere which will reveal themselves to the one who makes the EFFORT to discover them. As far as this book being "evil," it just plain isn't.  It may pose a challenge to the dogmatic status-quo of the current dominant religion (which incidentally, is failing to meet the needs of modern civilization) ... but that religion itself was regarded as a threatening evil 2000 years ago when it encroached on the very Mysteries which Hall elucidates in this book.  The only "evil" being perpetrated is by those who would - for their own selfish reasons - keep humanity in spiritual darkness.  So there 
 I never saw this on HBO so I can't compare the DVD to that as some other reviewers have done. All I can say is that even my husband who is not a baseball fan was touched! Technically amazing, I'm sure lots of this old footage had to be cleaned up for acceptable production quality . How did they dig up all this great footage? The prose/poetry voiceovers are pivotal to create that misty sweet nostalgia for the old game. A little too heavy on the Yanks, even though, yes, they did dominate during this time period. Bonus is additional voiceover interviews from stars such as Enos Slaughter discussing opponents, teammates, the hometown crowd, travel. Wonderful footage of the Gashouse Gang and early immortals such as Ty Cobb and Cy Young 
 This book is a very interesting book to learn the main statistical approach of data mining. It's clear and full of examples. If you go a Stanford data mining website you will find all the courses and exercises linked to the book. An important book to have in your own data mining library.  
 I purchased this book for my niece who is 4.  She is affraid of going to the doctors.  Well, she LOVES dinos. and this book really helped her get over her fears of going.  Now, when she goes she takes her book with her 
 This book is such a gem. It's packed with uplifting, easy-to-read essays and also (my favorite) activities to put Julie's Live in the Moment principles into play. The book is like a visit with your absolute favorite person, the one who brings out the best in yourself...who's wise, wry and snappy and who leaves you feeling bolstered to go and really savor life. I've put several of the principles of the  book into play -- and as a someone who has a penchant for worry and backwards-thinking, I am living more "in the moment" than I did before I read this book. I plan to buy several to give as gifts. They would be perfect for anyone who wants a little more fun, a little more joy and a little more magic in their life...well, that's just about everybody, isn't it?!? Highly recommended 
 Excellent introduction to the Hawaiian Islands.  Spectacular photography and interesting narrative.  As a former resident of Hawaii, I feel this video gives a great look at the islands and makes me want to return very soon.  
 When I think about it, it scares me that James Herriot almost never got published. It was through a small bit of luck/fate/intuition, whatever you want to call it, that his writing was made into a book.   He has since become the most well know vet in the world (although he is now dead), and his writing has entertained people all over the world. This book, published quite a bit later than his other ones, caps off the series. Another fun 350-or-so pages of writing that will make you both sad and happy at the same time.   I highly recommend this book as well as the others in the series. 
 By my having the last name of the author, i could be bias, but i hope i'm not. I have both of Steves' books and i feel like i have discovered a gem. Steve wrotes from, his own experiences of life. He tells in his first book  about all the times he was fired from his job. He also tells about some of  these failures in this book. He also tells about another Stephen who was  his class mate in high school. That Stephen is the famous director  (Spielberg). He tells how both of them were average students in school, but  that both of them have been able to  achieve great success. He insists that  success is for everyone. It's waiting for you and me. I think we ought to  go for it. I would like to strongly recommend this book. It will make a  difference in your life 
 Lovelock's adventure into the theory of Gaia is an interesting experience that is worth the read.  I found his ideas to be well constructed and factually backed up.  It definently helps in providing a new way of looking at not only the earth, but also science in general.  The only drawback was that sometimes he seemed to be more concerned with trying to denounce his critics than actually providing interesting and constructive opinions 
 I really appreciated the layout of this book by topic (i.e. Where to Stay, Sightseeing, Eat-Drink-Shop, Arts & Entertainment, etc.).  Although this may make it a better bet for those planning ahead well in advance instead of dropping into Denmark, it is a perfect companion to Denmark (DK Eyewitness Travel Guides), which is laid out mainly by region 
 Here in one volume you will have 26 stories in excellent English translations which preserve the aesthetic simplicity of the original Spanish...it would be impossible to give a commment on all the great stories here. The reader will have glimpses of Macondo here and there. the  stories I enjoyed the most were in the third section of this book. "A  Very Old Man with enormous wings", "the Handsomest Drowned Man In  the World" and "...Erendira...." All bear Marquez's  signature simple style, with the elements of magical realism...it is a  collection to enjoy time and time again.. 
 A good mixture of browsability and serious reading. For the storyteller this book is a godsend - several variants of each story compiled for easy comparison, with an authoritative commentary for background research. And the variants are often not obvious or well-known, so giving real discoveries and delights. The scholarly essays cover a fair range of subjects, but for those just interested in the stories there is plenty in the rest of the book to satisfy. If this book interests you, try 'The Classic Fairy Tales', by Iona and Peter Opie - same title, similar approach, except that variants are only discussed rather than given in full 
 I really enjoyed this book because after I read it I became very familiar with African Grey's and now i feel very comfortable around it.  I would recommend this book to anyone buying an African Grey for the first time 
 Until recently, this wasn't one of my favorites - don't know why!  My husband bought it for me when we found out my daughter's HS choir was going to do the musical.  I watched it numerous times both on my 'puter and the TV to get costume ideas (really helped with the middy blouses that the "pick-a-little" ladies wear for practice) and help with other parts of the production.  Love Shirley Jones as Marian and Robert Preston IS the Music Man!  Mrs. Shinn is just too funny for words!!!  If you want a feel-good musical, get it!  The music and orchestration are great and the dancing is wonderful 
 thses guys rock, and the vocals are 2nd to..well maybe dio ,well worth the price of addmission 
 This is an absolutely wonderful book of essays about growing up, making a career, and being black in the US in the 1950-60s.  Just the chapter on his step-father - an angry, brilliant, difficult man - is worth the price of admission.  Beyond the black experience, everyone who has fought with a tough dad will empathise with Baldwin.  Then there is a piece on living in France as a young writer, again it is unbelievably dense, funny, and moving, a true masterpiece of the genre of autobiographical essays.  His style is so cool and clear, so icily brilliant, that any aspiring writer can study the style, as did I.    This book, in my opinion, has Baldwin's best work in it, of a quality that earns him a place in the literary canon.  The essays really are far far better than any of his novels, in my opinion.  While some of them are less than excellent journalistic pieces (A Fly in the Buttermilk about school integration), the best ones are, well, the best.    Warmly recommended 
 "Empyrean Isles" is a great collection of mid-60's hard bop jazz.  It is one of my favorite albums in all of jazz history; it has wonderfully evocative tunes like "One Finger Snap" and "Ololoqui Valley" that paint pictures in your mind.  "The Egg" is an interesting, if not totally rewarding experiment and "Cantaloupe Island" is another stand-out track.  One of Herbie's best, don't miss it.  Essential 
 This book makes plausible claims that some bonobos have learned to handle language in a way that is approximately as sophisticated as that of a two year old human. But their anecdotal evidence is somewhat hard to evaluate, and they didn't quite convince me that they were careful enough to rule out the possibility that their biases caused them to overestimate the sophistication of Kanzi's understanding. The book is a bit long-winded about research that Savage-Rumbaugh did before working with Kanzi, and I was a bit disappointed that the book didn't provide more of the anecdote about Kanzi that made the book worth reading. But those anecdotes convinced me that much more is going on than some authors such as Pinker had led me to believe. I still hope for better evidence that will help clarify how much bonobos can understand. But that will be hard, and I don't know how it should be done 
 The begining of the book is a bit slow, when the author is introducing the characters, but once that is done hang on to your seat.  This is a very exciting story line.  I definatly recommend this book to those that like a book you cant put down 
 We got this last year when our younger son was 1, and he has yet not lost interest in it now as a 2 year old.  He plays with it almost daily.  There is a "hidden" hole in the inside of the tree house and the figures slide out the front door.  My older son and I always "hide" his Weebles there and he can't wait to see "who" is hiding from him.  A GREAT toy to show cause and effect for busy toddlers 
 This story really doesn't have a big moral point.  But it does show the difference between how a child, adolescent and an adult handle a situation.  The first goat who is the child wants the grass like he wants candy and he'll even sacrifice his brother to get just like a child in the real life would do.  The second goat who is the adolescent is bigger but steal doesn't know how to deal with issues and still does the same thing he would have done if he was a child.  The third goat who is the adult knows how to deal with problems he faces them and he's not afraid of them.  Overall this story is good story and does have point if you search for it 
 Hofstadter's book surveys American history regarding a rather pernicious tendency--specifically, that especially in turbulent times, an anti-intellectual consensus has carried the day in this country.  Do I need to connect the dots?  This book is more relevant today than when it was first published; the newest chapter continues to be written thanks to our incumbent's "mandate" (which for him means receiving the majority vote this time) on 11/2/04 
 I recommended this book to another artist interested in working with the book form and when I came to amazon.com to send a direct link I couldn't believe there is only one review for this book.  This is a classic in thinking conceptually about the structure and sequencing of a book, as well as thinking conceptually about what a "book" is as an artifact and an artform.  Although the text is a little intuitive for linear readers at times, anyone who wants to explore the book as an artform must take a look at Keith Smith's work 
 The book Autobiography of My Dead Brother, by Walter Dean Myers, tells the interesting and moving tale of one boy's struggle to live and learn in the harsh city he lives in. The story takes place in a small city called Amsterdam, where poverty stricken families live in small apartments across town. Amsterdam is full of shootings, drug abuse, and violence; Jesse works on writing and illustrating the story of his best friend Rise. From childhood to teenage years, his illustrations and stories capture the essence of life in the ghetto. But as Rise fades away from his friends and gets into trouble with gangs and drug dealing, the story turns for the worse.   When Jesse asks Rise about his new life he responds: "This is about real life, not about no dreams and stories. Real life, man. You can close your eyes and think about what you want to happen and what you want to see. But when you open your eyes, it's still the same old streets and the same old hurts."  	I really enjoyed this book. I found it depressing, but meaningful. I learned more about how lucky we are not to take things for granted in our lives and society. If I could change one thing about this story, I would make it shorter because parts of it can be dull. I'd also change the ending which leaves the reader wondering what's next. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys dramatic fiction and is a fan of Walter Dean Myer's first-person writing style I'd also recommend reading some of his other books such as Slam and Fallen Angels.  
 Really good and heartfelt exposition on Romans.  Can be going due to the old translation, but worth the effort 
 This is a cute story, just like the cartoons and books we had growing up. My 3 year old loves the game where you invent your own candies. About the system: It's perfect. Like the story videos we used to have where the words light up at the bottom of the screen as the narrator reads them, except the pictures (true to original artwork) are totally animated AND there's interactive games and questions about the story. The guy is right about them not working with computers. The controller is basically a special remote control for the DVD player. It does work fine with small portable DVD players that have remotes, like the ones for car trips. My daughter recieved her own TV with DVD from her grandfather for Christmas. I did not approve of her watching TV all the time in her room, so I decided she could only play the Read with Me DVD's. She loves them and plays almost daily. The controller is very kid friendly. At 3 1/2 my daughter can use it all by herself 
 -- by that I mean, our 'book of books.' I first read this in college: assigned reading for a course. For once a chore turned into a joy from the first page to the last. I was already an avid reader of plays from Aeschylus to Pinter (and especially O'Neill), and I had read the four Thomas Wolfe novels in high school, so length was not an issue. But how strange and wonderful to plunge into a book that seemed to be novel, epic, tragic poem, divine comedy, and moral philosphy all in one.   Melville was a century before his time. I am surprised that Hawthorne wasn't able to do more for him. I wonder if Linclon ever read it; I have not found any evidence that he had, since he was fond of quating favorite passages of what he had read. I have read this great book three times over the past 40 years, and I still have and treasure the Modern Library Giant with the Grant Wood drawings that now seem so much a part of this greatest fishing story ever told. When all is said and done, it is a story about the one that got away. 
 There is nothing that can be said about William Shakespeare that has not been said already; and very few of them are disputable. It feels good having all his works: those Comedies, Tragedies, Histories, and Poetries in one convenient volume. This 'Complete Works' is for sure a complete literary classic 
 When I listen to this live recording I feel as though I am really there.  The introduction given before Frank takes the stage gets you really excited and pumped. Then when Frank hits the stage he starts off with "The Lady is a Tramp" as the crowd gives him a warm welcome.  Right away, we see that Frank's voice is still in great shape.  He sounds great!  Most of the concert features classic ballads like "I've Got You Under My Skin", "My Way", "I Get a Kick Out of You" and "My Kind of Town".  I was very pleasantly surprised to see "The House I live In" included on this CD.  This is a great siong about America and its people. Another pleasant surprise was "Leroy Brown".  That is a great song and Frank does such a good job singing it...as he does with any peice!  Every so often Frank talks to the crowd.  He shares stories about his own life as well as some humor...nice touch.  One of my biggest regrets is not being old enough to have ever seen Frank Sinatra live.  I'm 27 years old so it just wasn't meant to be.  I can only imagine how truly great it was to be there at Madison Square Garden on that magical night in 1974!             
 The July 6, 1944 circus fire at Hartford CT is still considered one of the top twenty greatest disasters in the history of the United States (I saw the list in a news story printed around the time of Hurricane Katrina).  Recounting the events could not have been easy, particularly when so much personal detail was included, but Onan did the impossible and pulled it off in remarkable fashion.  I was moved to tears many times while reading this book.  I still get a lump in my throat when I think of Little Miss 1565, particulary the story of how one police office never gave up trying to identify her and how when he died years later, the local paper's headline procalimed that now at last he knew who she was.  I am a circus fan and I'm so hapy Mr. Onan wrote this book.  It is worthy of those about whom it is written 
 My goodness, this story evokes so many emotions in me--rage, pain, tears, and disappointment. It was domestic violence at its zenith. I gasped, shouted and cried through the beginning nightmare scene and later. But Ruth overcame and found...herself.  Andre, dear old Andre, disappointed me bitterly. Sometimes we make decisions without truly counting all the costs and those we love pay dearly. And I shed tears as Ruth offered the only thing she felt she had to give and it was rejected.  JD Mason is a premier storyteller and I am definitely her groupie 
 Surprise,surprise! Sarah Jessica Parker can *actually* dance! I enjoyed watching her and the other talented actors/actresses kicking their heels in this movie. The plot's pretty simple: Janey (Sarah) is brought up by her mom and extremely strict father, loves to dance, auditions for a dancer spot on Dance TV with best mate Lynne (Helen Hunt) and gets paired up with bad boy Jeff (Lee Montgomery) in the finals. Will her dream of becoming a regular on DanceTV come true?   Get the DVD and see for yourself! ;)  
 Living in the city where most of architect Wallace Neff's 'California homes for California people' exist, it is a pleasure to see a monograph on this gifted artist in print.  Neff's homes remain grand and quintessentially California, referencing Spanish Revival in the most elegant sense.  Driving the streets of Pasadena, San Marino, and Altadena, Neff's estates are an indelible mark on the landscape -  tall, statuesque homes with carved columns and grand entry ways quietly guarded by his signature heavy wood and iron decorated doors.  His homes, created in the 1930s for movie stars, moguls, and the wealthy, are mementoes of another era and their eloquence is untainted by the passage of time.  Yet equally as interesting as the numerous homes illustrated in this excellent book is the warm, scholarly, immensely readable text by Diane Kanner. Not only does she inform us about Neff's biography in novelistic fashion, but she also places Wallace Neff in the historical setting of California of his heyday.  The writing is rich in the colorful history of the new frontier, the Eden where dreams like movies were made.    This is a fine book in every way, and the layout and design make for a coffee table book of California history that comfortably moves to the lap as a fascinating non-fiction novel!  Highly recommended. Grady Harp, December 0 
 I've been a fan since the start.  This CD is very strong in lyrics and showcases their excellent talents.  Leaving to see them in Oakland in a half hour!! 
 This screwball comedy keeps you laughing through the entire film.  An oldie but a goodie.  It truly highlights the talent of Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert.  
 This is worth it all 4 "For a Breath I Tarry," which is 1 of my all-time faves -- words fail me; it's hilarious, heart-wrenching; it'll change your world in 25 pages. "He Who Shapes" (aka "The Dream Master") is also outstanding. Also solid: "The Last Defender of Camelot," & a romantic heart-wringer called "The Engine at Heartspring's Center." There R many others which R at LEAST worth reading. Zelazny was a poet; I miss him. If U like him, U might also try early George R.R. Martin, early Samuel R. Delany, & some of Robert Silverberg's mellower work (like DOWNWARD TO THE EARTH, DYING INSIDE, THE BOOK OF SKULLS) 
 If ever a film could capture the very essence of syrupy conception while making us love it with utter devotion, this is it. Gort, oh Gort, where art thou? The story is perfectly linear in construction, the characters neat and tidy with voices clear. The story unfolds before you like a clean, speckled linoleum walkway. Just put on your high-tops and stroll along, glass of milk in one hand, cookies in the other.  This is the film that reminds the peacenik in us that those higher powers, you know - the guardians of intergalactic peace we just know are out there, are watching, waiting for that single telltale act of malicious intent from homo sapiens that will bring down every last heat ray of righteous fury the outer space cops can muster and "leave our world a burned out cinder." You'll love the fact that huge diamonds are the currency on the space cops' planet, and that he carries a few million dollars worth in the pockets of his borrowed woolen suit for change. You'll especially love the fact that just three little words, constructed of strangely Germanic phonemes, when spoken to a ten-foot tall robot awakened with a boy scout's flashlight, can belay its built-in command to destroy our world. Watch in bug-eyed awe as Michael Rennie's hands play over those big `ol light bulbs that double as his flying saucer's controls, waving this way and that, as he launches the most complex shipboard functions. Gasp agog as you discover that the cop's ship is made of material so tough that it's un-scratchable, un-filable and un-blowtorchable. Watch the space cop scribble the answer to a monstrously long mathematical equation on Albert Einstein's doppelganger's chalkboard to get the pipe-smoking professor's attention. It's pure poetry I tell you. 
 All these years after this 1979 release I still shake my head why this came across in such a negative light. I guess this wasn't the time people were ready to expand their minds. After all it was 1979, Disco music was at its height, Rock music was soaring/expanding and punk was just about to explode and singer/songwriters were being squeezed out of the seen and the 80's was just about their death nail. Joni Mitchell was an artists right from the start that continually expanded her musical palette and I just couldn't understand why such a musical genius got herself stuck forever in such a firestorm. When I listen to this now, MINGUS is full of brillant moments, vocally as well as the guitars, bass, horns just some of the most challenging jazz/pop hybrid sounds. I can't recall anything quite like this at the time.  Joni had some pipes on her and a one of a kind guitar style. I believe the late 70's vocally were her finest moments, to bad she listened to her critics and turned inward and bitter, what would she have become if she just let it all go and moved on. She was by far the most gifted of her peers. Just listen to some of these haunting, underated gems and mix it up on a cd burn with your other favorite music, it stand right out 
 A very well constructed foray into the psychedelic world from the more objective point of view.  Includes updated information, chemical properties, effects on the human body, history, legal information, and MUCH  MUCH MORE 
 This is a really good book that covers it all.. almost.I'd say it's worth buying and it has tons of info from the 70's and some from 80's- i just expected it to have a lil more info from 80's but other than that it is good and has lots of cool stuff in it. It definetly brought back lots of memories and reminded me of things i havnt thought of in years and stuff ive totally forgoten about yet i enjoyed as a kid. It's a good read with some really cool facts and pictures 
 This is definitely like a sequel to E PLURIBUS FUNK that is my favorite power trio GFR album. I just do not understand why CRAIG FROST was not a full-time member for this album since they ask him to play keyboards.  His presence would play an very important sound role for the revamped GRAND FUNK RAILROAD.  Anyway, the organ drivin FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX that features a violin player, guitar solo, sounds a whole lot like the organ driver FOOT STOMPIN' MUSIC, and TRYING TO GET AWAY that features excellent keyboards, guitar riffs, and vocals is musically very similar to PEOPLE LET'S STOP THE WAR.  The next song SOMEONE is an excellent ballad/rocker with the keyboards and vocals,  and SHE GOT TO MOVE ME with DON BREWER'S vocals and drums, CRAIG'S organ riffs, MARK'S guitar riffs, and MEL SCHACHER'S bass guitar riffs is a excellent rock tune. RAIN KEEPS FALLIN' is an excellent guitar rock song.  I JUST GOTTA KNOW is an excellent rhythm/blues/rock song with MARK'S singing and guitar playing and various keyboards,. SO YOU WON'T HAVE TO DIE has a excellent beginning with MARK FARNER'S acoustic guitar and then the electric guitar and organ.  FREEDOM IS FOR CHILDREN is an excellent ballad, and GOTTA FIND ME A BETTER DAY that is song by DON is also an excellent song with the harpsichord by CRAIG, guitar solos and harmonica by MARK.  The hit single ROCK AND ROLL SOUL  financially saved the band after the falling-out and lawsuit with former manager/producer TERRY KNIGHT.  The live version fro CAUGHT IN THE ACT is a whole lot better, but this is a great version though.  Although this would be the last album that Mark would write all the songs, other band members would later write excellent songs for the future albums to come. Most importantly, this is a outstanding comeback and self-produced album without original producer/manager TERRY KNIGHT (He was the lead singer of THE FABULOUS PACK that also featured MARK, DON, and CRAIG) before WE'RE AN AMERICAN BAND would make history.  Bottom line, they did not give up once they settled out of court.  I have not listened to the extended version of FLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX yet.  I downloaded this and others off Napster, but bought this repackaged issue this BORN TO DIE and LIVE ALBUM because half of these albums were from turntables.  I am so glad that all of their orginal albums are available again after so many years of being out of print 
 The Flintstones are a classic! This is great viewing for the new generation as well as the old. This beats the cartoons of today. My six year old son enjoys it 
 This is a book I read when I was 10 and was amazed. Unique sense of humor, extraordinary ideas (the title means "a man who can pass walls") and great prose. Highly recommended 
 As I immerse myself in the field of evolutionary psychology/biology and Baron-Cohen's work on biobehavioral differences in men and women, I wonder when and where a value judgement got placed on his proposal of men "systematizing" being better or worse than a female tendancy to "empathize"?  Don't we need both types to complete each other?  There wasn't one claim in this book (that I could find) that the author's conclusions are attached to a value judgement, nor does he claim EVERY woman is an "E" and EVERY men an "S".  Other evidence supports him: studies of women with higher testosterone levels show they act in more aggressive and traditionally "masculine" systematizing ways, while Shelley Taylor's pivotal study on oxytocin, a female hormone, proved a connection to nurturing behaviors.  But how is that somehow "bad"?  This doesn't mean (nor do I think Baron-Cohen claims) that we need rigid rules prohibiting or allowing certain opportunities and behaviors for men and women.  It does help us to understand and learn from each other--and perhaps have better relationships.  As I discussed this book the other day with a colleague that "light bulb" moment occurred, and she realized why her significant other was so much more driven to compartmentalize than she was--it's how he's hardwired, for the most part.  It's been documented that women tend to pick friends for relationships, not as basketball or golf buddies, as their husbands mind.  In retail, women apologize, men replace or resolve.  Don't we need both approaches?  Let's not consider this book a canon for behavior, but use it for the valuable and insightful observations that can help us cast aside judgements about superiority of either gender and accept each other for our strengths--and weaknesses 
 Jessie Daniels is a superstar and I know that she will make it big time in the industry. She is a superstar both in the music business and at SSHOA! 
 What a great series!  It's such a fun easy read, it's nice to just read and not think!!  Very good book!!  I would get them all! 
 Schaeffer's book was a godsend to me, answering and echoing the questions that rang in my mind when trying to figure out what it really means to be a follower of Christ, and whether or not being one entails leaving reason behind in favor of revelation. This work goes a long way in answering the questions of HOW I know what I know; and exposing presuppositions about the nature of the universe that shape our thinking. It prepared me for many onslaughts against a reasonable faith, showing that there is another way other than accepting either the dissolution of absolute truth in postmodernism or the anti-reason/anti intellectualism of certain branches in fundamentalism. This is an excellent help to anyone experiencing a personal paradigm shift in Jesus' direction, or as a primer to exploring and examining competing worldviews. 
 This is my favorite cookbook. I have used so many of its recipes, and have never been disappointed. The Butternut Squash Soup is great for Thanksgiving, and is my family's favorite soup. I highly recommend this cookbook 
 Wow! Arch Enemy before Angela are almost like a completely different band, one that's far better. The crux of this album, as well as the back bone of Arch Enemy, are the two Ammot brothers, who pack this album full of heavy and catchy riffs and shredding solos. Johan's voice is quit different when compared to Angela's (well, of course from the obvious difference of sex). His voice is very raspy and reminds me alot of the guy from Pestilence. It's somewhere inbetween death metal grunts and a growly thrash voice. At first I was a little put off by the different vocals, but after a few listens I must say I almost prefer them now. The drumming is good and is somewhat unqiue in that he uses alot of bells and ride cymbals. The solos are all very good and certainly are interesting. The best track is the closing "Bridge of Destiny". The last few minutes include one of the most impressive riffs I have ever heard. It is just so filled with emotion in every note bend. I do not think I have ever heard a guitar part with so much passion and emotion in it before. Another excellent track is "Let the Killing Begin" which showcases a little drum/bass break between the intro and verse. The drumming on this part is very good but the bass suffers from tuned too low syndrome as its very difficult to hear and just not good, but its passable and doesn't take away from the awesomeness of this part and track.    Pros: "Birdge of Destiny"! Awesome solos and riffs aplenty from the brothers Ammot. Frenized drumming. Overall the instrumentation is pretty good.     Cons: If you are used to Angela's vocals you probably won't like Johan's voclas. Production is pretty dry at best.    Final Word: A great release from a good melodic death band. Highly recommended for metal headds who apprieciate good metal. This is and "Black Earth" are much better than any of their newer releases 
 Gary Zukav and Linda Francis did a wonderful job in bringing those who have a hard time feeling and dealing with their emotions a powerful book that will help you journey "from your head to your heart."   This is a great book for people who feel a lot of anger, who try to stay in control, and have difficulty relating to others from the heart center with genuine authenticity. If you tend to run away from your feelings, only to find yourself feeling unloved, or thinking you are unlovable, than this book will help you with the many diagrams and self-help techniques. From sex addiction to drinking too much, to using outward activities to not deal with your emotions, The Heart of the Soul will help you uncover and notice what is blocking you so that you can embrace your truth, and learn how to express it genuinely from the inside out.

 I have had this for a while and watch it often.  I have done Irish dance in the past and appreciate how difficult it is.  I also have Feet of Flames and Gold.  RD is my favorite.  Not only is the Irish dance and music excellent, it also includes other ethnic dances which adds to the show for me.  
 the carob is great! all of their products are fresh and tast 
 This is my favorite album from TMBG. It's clever, irreverent, sometimes sad, but never seems to take itself too seriously. I love every song on this album and have grown up with it for years. It's got amazing tracks, clever and funny songs, and retains that amazing TMBG uniqueness that makes them so satisfying.   Everyone loves "Ana Ng" when they hear it. It's catchy and wonderful. One of my absolute favorites on this album, though, is "Kiss Me, Son of God." Maybe it's just because I'm a religion major and I appreciate people poking fun at fanaticism and cult mentalities, but I find it to be lyrically fantastic and just posessing a generally fantastic sound.   The Johns cover a wide range of topics on this album and I'll be the last person to say that it flows together. It really doesn't. There is no flow; each song jarringly grates against the other. This is one of the many reasons I love this album so much. It just doesn't fit and yet, somehow, it fits remarkably well.   I would suggest this for anyone willing to give this band an honest attempt. "Lincoln" is not for the faint of heart 
 This is the replacement for what I believe is the original Cuisinart coffee maker and works well although the lid sometimes does not snap into place on the first try (after washing). I was very happy to have found it through Amazon, as I do not think the original (no bells & whistles)coffee maker is produced/distributed any longer 
 I read the first two stories in this series and loved both of them. The plight of young Virginia in the first, and the older Virginia in the second gave us a glimpes into the life of a girl in that time period, I'd say,  around the turn of the century. This third book introduces us to an adult  Virginia, a married woman, caring for an elderly grandmother and an abused  child as well as her husband, her own child, and household chores. Life for  her was not easy, but she had God by her side, and He is the only one who  can give you the stregnth and endurance to make it through the tough times.  This book was really inspiring, and I hope Ms. Oke takes pity on us and  writes the next one soon 
 This book was required reading a sociology class I took and I would  recommend it to anyone. The book is easy to read, easy to understand,  interesting, and relevent to any member of society. Currie builds a strong  thesis as to why our justice system does us little justice, and he offers  some valuable suggestions as to how the system could do us more justice. I  would especially recomend this book to all voters 
 Wolff makes great writing seem effortless, which it is clearly not, even for him. The story is excellent, and would be worth reading even if it weren't so masterfully written, but it's the quality of Wolff's writing that places "This Boy's Life" on my short list of required reading. He exposes a lack of self-worth and insight that takes me back to my own adolescence. At times, his level of acceptance and almost forgiveness of Dwight (the abusive stepfather) seems forced, but perhaps Tobias had a better therapist than I had. I can't wait to read "In Pharoh's Army". 
 and Ryan.  Lowbrow comedy - sight gags only, but who cares-you'll laugh!  I'm an "adult" far from 19 and I laughed through the whole thing,  Most "romantic comedies are not funny, they are cute,  This I will watch again with my friend, just to see where she laughs.  Hot chick was funny too, also with Anna 
 I was lucky enough to meet Will Eisner this summer and get my copy of A Contract With God autographed.  It is one of the most amazing pieces of comic art I have ever read.  His characters are amazingly real, the stories are everyday tales of life you can relate to.  Even though the stories take place almost 70 years ago, they retain a timelessness that is unusual in today's pop culture 
 We know some things about Saul of Tarsus (later named the Apostle Paul) but a complete biography is always lacking because of sketchy and incomplete information. Most everything we know from Paul is from the Dr. Luke in the Book of Acts or Paul's epistles themselves.  II Peter Chapter 3 makes some very intriguing statements.  Peter, in some of his last earthly words before martyrdom, validates Paul's apostleship and states that some of his writings and teachings are difficult but that we should follow them.   Pollock's book is presented as documentary-style reading since Paul's complete biography is not entirely clear.  There is much the author states is inference or speculation. If you can respect that and not build doctrine and facts on where the evidence is fuzzy, I think this is an excellent book.  One example of "fuzzy" facts that Pollock considers is the age-old controversy over the authorship of the Book of Hebrews.  The author of Hebrews does not identify himself and scholars argue who wrote it.  Pollock speculates that Paul, while imprisioned in Acts Ch. 24 for two years may have had time and motivation to write the book to the people he so desparately wanted to reach.  With his imprisonment and his controversial style among the Jews, he may have left his identity anonymous so he himself would not be a stumbling block to reach his Jewish brothers.  Eternity will reveal who wrote the Book of Hebrews but it is certainly a plausible theory.  Overall, the greatest benefit in reading this book is to provide a better framework for understanding Paul as he travels among the early churches and wrote letters to them correcting the various false teachings and problems that developed. 
 I enjoyed this book as I enjoy every book by Danielle Steel. She's got a knack for bringing out a wide range of emotions as you read through her books, and this one was no different.  I can't believe the amount of people that are complaing about this book. It was real. Would it have been ideal if Sam had held her hand through everything? Of course! But it's not always like that in real life, unfortunatly.  This book was depressing at times - but what do you expect? Alex, a beautiful, vivacious woman gets breast cancer. Her husband deserts her and starts fooling around with some tramp from his office.   But when you take out the sad parts, you remember to focus on what counts. Alex was incredibly brave, and incredibly strong. She fought, and she didn't give up. People need to focus on that. It's truly inspiring.  As for the ending - again, it's real. It happens. People go through horrible things together and then get back together and start again.   I enjoyed this book, and I think if you read it with an open mind, you will too 
 I don't agree with the previous reviewer. It is a serious book with wealth of information and it is not a marketing info book. It covers GSM basics, detailed GPRS and EDGE information and an intro on 3G technologies. GPRS and EDGE chapters particularly good and contain a lot of simulation results also. Warmly recommended 
 Read it but be careful! The abyss will look back at you. The reports, letters and diary excerpts... This is really the backside of the nazi grandiose facade. Not forget the Holocaust? This book will never let you forget 
 This was my first B. Traven book, and I am hooked.  His satirical wit and narrative prose are well constructed.  A simple story about early 20th century Mexico.  Traven follows characters through the story and makes  reading easy.  The interesting thing is how true some of the same  bureacracy and logic of those times is still with us in this modern day.   After having traveled extensively in Mexico, it also gives me a better  understanding of the plight of the indigenous people and the history behind  their current governmental structure.  The insight garnered is not country  specific, however, as the same systems can be found in all walks of life,  countries, and governments.  Highly recommended 
 Although I'm only 14 year old boy who lives in Utah, I've been a die hard Stephen King fan since I was twelve, and I have to say, this is really the high light of his career.  Don't be turned off by the massive length of this book, it goes by very quickly, and you'll be glued to it bye the first fifty of so pages.  As I'm sure you know, this is a coming of age story about seven children who together must face an evil that has plagued them and even gives them personal grudges. Other people have already gone over the basic story, but one thing that most of them failed to mention that I find very important is that after their child hood encounters with it, all of them But Mike Hanlon lose every memory they ever had of it.  Yes, this book is vulgar, it is violent, and there is some sexuality, it is an essential part of the story. It is over a thousand pages long, and each page is genius. I will go to my grave saying that this is the greatest book I've ever read, because it's so much more than a horror story. I think this book has greater characters than any other book I have ever read. This is a five star book, and is almost completely flawless. This is my favorite book, and some of Stephen King's other great works are The Dead Zone, Misery, The Shining, and Christine.  Read this book, it is well worth your time, I won't go in depth into the story, because hundreds of other people already have, but this book will scare the piss out of you, make you reflect on your childhood and the friends with whom you shared it, and really just change you. I can't express in words how great this is, but don't take my word for it. Buy it, rent it, whatever, just READ IT (no pun intended). ~Love, Dallas~   
 Shiva takes on globalization and the overall anthropocentric view of the world's powers with an in depth look at how Intellectual Property Rights have been stripped from the commons into the hands of multinational governments and companies.  Although the writing is sensational, the feelings run deep in the developing world.  Acknowledgment of these feelings is an important step in the realization that the Western World has infringed on human rights and ecological balance.  The conclusion that placing value in the diversity of cultures and in biodiversity can lead to a more peaceful world if IPR's are left out of private pockets should not be taken lightly 
 I'm a first-year Ph.D. student, taking a graduate-level number theory course, and I still use this book from my undergrad years as a reference. Just about any basic number theory topic you're looking for is in here. I can't recommend it highly enough 
  Peter Robinson grew up in Yorkshire, and is the author of thirteen previous novels featuring Inspector Banks. He is the winner of numerous awards in the United States, Britain and Canada, and in 2002 he won the CWA Dagger in the Library. As I also come from Leeds the background to his stories is something that I have experienced first hand and because of this I have a special affection for his books. However they would be first class crime fiction wherever they were based. This particular novel is one of the author's earlier books in the series.  The scene looks like a typical Christmas in many households, a log fire, sheepskin rug, lights twinkling on the tree, the all is not as it seems.  Caroline Hartley, the attractive woman lying on the couch is dead, brutally murdered. Inspector Banks is allocated the case and he soon has more suspects than he can handle. As he looks into Caroline's past he realises that secrecy was a way of life and her death is no different . . . 
 Great! I love this Cd! ITs funky and original- describes Missy well. There isn't anything bad you can say about this album. Missy shows her R&B roots as well as crafting some slick hip hop beats. The only thing I would nitpick about So Addictive is, it leaves you wanting more songs from the extraordinary Missy Misdemeanor Elliott. Favorite songs are: Take Away, Xtasy, One minute man, and of course Get ur freak on! 
 My 7 year old daughter loved it! She didn't know what"maestro" meant, so we got to introduce her to the dictionary and she still remembers the definition. Great product for the cost. 
 This was the best Dr. Seuss book of them all! I read this book when I was a little kid and I still read it now! This is the best book you could buy 
 SMART ABOUT CHOCOLATE: A SWEET HISTORY is one of the SMART ABOUT series of children's books. These books are written and designed to inform students about a wide variety of topics that they probably have some interest in, but don't know much about. The books are written in the form of an essay that a "student" writes for a school report.  CHOCOLATE: A SWEET HISTORY is filled with all kinds of photographs and illustrations that complement the information it contains. The book gives a history of chocolate and how it was first used, how it has changed moving from one continent to the next, and how it is produced. The book is only 30 pages long but is very informative. For instance, I learned from reading this book that the scientific name fro the cacao tree is theobroma cacao which literally means "food of the goods". I also learned that most of the worlds cacao beans are imported from Africa and that the Aztecs found cacao beans so valuable that they eventually started using them as money. The book is very colorful and has plenty of illustrations to catch even the most disengaged of young readers attention. Towards the end of the book a recipe for making chocolate yum-yums appears. The final page of the book is a sort of bibliography that lists a few other titles that student might be interesting in reading if they like chocolate. Overal, a tasty bit of reading 
 I had always been intrigued by the qabala, but found all the books on the subject too daunting to keep me interested. So when I came upon this little book in the New Age shelf at Scribners I was sold after just a brief look.   I finally understood what qabala is! As a previous reviewer stated, the  exercises really work. Therefore, I must warn any casual dabblers out there  - this is not a game! If you are interested in the subject, by all means  read on and enjoy the book, however do not attempt to practice its  principles unless you are a serious student.  Approach the practice with  seriousness and reverence or you may find yourself in a predicament not  unlike that of Pandora 
 Boys book is about 100 years old and is flat out the best first book on bubbles.  It takes you through a lot of interesting experiments that Boys did into areas that are very remote from soap and bubbles.  Full of "oh, wows", it is a book that I reread about once a year (I do bubbles professionally, and every rereading contains new insights for me) 
 Debra Frasier's classic On the Day You Were Born is a magnificent way to welcome a new child into a family. And it's not just for children who are born into a family, but is a great book for all those beloved adopted children.  On the Day you Were Born is a book of nature's celebration of the new arrival. The author's touching narration is a moving and loving declaration of the importance and value of the new arrival.  "On the eve of your birth, word of your coming passed from animal to animal...and the marvelous news migrated worldwide." And the grand ending is that a family is born. How great is that?  Armchair Interviews says: This is a must-have book for every family. It can be read during happy times and when things are not going so good in the little person's life. We suggest it as a gift for all new arrivals, through birth or adoption.      
 fun rhyming, simple counting and an interesting introduction to instruments.  hidden cat and mouse chase is an added bonus. my children and my nieces and nephews (ages 3 - 8) love it 
 We now live in a post-denominational world. Technology has moved us all into a global community. We find ourselves daily exposed to the rich cultures and perspectives of the world. Our provincial and limited  expressions have expanded exponentially because of this. Today we have the  freedom to draw from past and present traditions to shape and enrich our  faith and world-view. People are more open to discussion and interaction  than ever before. In keeping with this new reality, Richard Foster has done  us a wonderful favor by applying this to our spirituality. No longer do we  have to be limited to our own particular denomination or upbringing. We can  keep our own spiritual background and identity, but also add on and  incorportate different streams of Christian expression to enrich our  approach to God and practice of faith. And so Foster paints a broad picture  of the Christian faith for us to gaze upon. We don't have to take sides.  Foster persuades us that the issue at hand is not either/or, but both/and.  Like a mosaic each Christian can incorporate the living streams of the  contempletive, holiness, social justice, evangelical, charismatic, and  incarnational traditions to the "warp and woof" of life, as  Foster likes to phrase it. This approach will make our lives into a  unified, yet diverse work of art. He illustrates so clearly each  "stream" by using historical examples of those who practiced each  style particularly well. First he uses Biblical characters that emphasized  each approach. Then he shows how Christ perfectly fulfilled each tradition  of the faith. He clearly spells out the strong points and the dangers of  each tradition. And finally Foster helps us put into practice each of them  from his own perspective and experience. I appreciate how Foster has helped  introduce church history to mainstream Christianity. However, some portions  of his point by point explanations in the book get a bit tedious. But that  must not stop us from drinking deep of this book. Foster shows how  practicing a well-rounded faith will protect us from being prideful,  narrow-minded, or falling into a spiritual rut. If we follow Foster's  beckoning we will also be more unified as the body of Christ. Foster is  right that our unity is one of the most powerful testimonies to the world  that God is alive and well. This book has opened my eyes to areas of my  faith that need to be cultivated more. Foster has inspired me to draw from  the wells of the living streams of Christian expression throughout the ages  and nations. Any serious 21st century believer should slake his or her  spiritual thirst with "Streams of Living Water" by Richard  Foster 
 I don't have much to add.  If you love Seger, get this CD.  LOVE IT 
 The authors take an even handed look across several major languages and point out pitfalls in each. Probably, for you as a programmer, you have met many of these ideas before. But maybe in the context of a given language. This book lets you take a metalanguage view.  Consider integer overflows. C# and Visual Basic guard against these. But not Java, C or C++. There are also commonsense recommendations like using unsigned integers when describing things that are intrinsically non-negative, like memory addresses or sizes of memory allocations. Alas, Java does not support unsigned integers.  Cross site scripting gets a chapter of its own. A dangerous phenomenon of the web. Where a web page gets user input from the user's browser. The application does not check this input for malicious content, and it proceeds to send it to a web page. The text might have scripting commands which are then run by the user's browser. These might mess up the browser or even the user's computer. Worth checking out 
 Opens any jar or bottle better than my pipe wrench. We got some more to give as Christmas presents.  Good for the "more mature" consumer, possibly with arthritis in the hands. An excellant value 
 this book is comprehensive and easy to understand in learning the art of knitting and crocheting 
 As a beginning Videographer I found this book a great introduction to the many different lights and techniques used in obtaining good video. The book is also very current on what is available today. I feel it could have been a little more in-depth, but for the price and length I found it well worth buying and reading. The authors write in a very "readable" style that educates you but doesn't bore you. Highly recommended 
 This is a very handy product for video editing.  Definitely saves time and keystrokes.  Wonderful for repetitive tasks.  I'm using Adobe Video Collection (Premiere PRO, After Effects, etc.), Window's XP Pro and a Dell workstation.  Pros: - Easy to install, configure and use - Totally customizable - Small size easily tucks into the back of my keyboard tray when not in use - Nothing in the market comes close in design or price  Cons: Was not pre-configured for Adobe Premiere PRO (but was easy to configure manually and it does have preset configs for the other versions of Premiere 
 This is one of those books that make me glad my native tongue is Spanish. A warning, tough: This book is full of Mexican Slang (Even I, being Mexican, had trouble understanding some words!) So, even if your Spanish is good, I would recommend reading the translated work, unless you have, or have had, contact with the Mexican Culture (i.e. You have lived in Mexico). Other than that, I understand the English translation is very good. So, forget about the reviews and start reading "Queen". It is as addictive as the drugs its characters deal with. Four and a half stars 
 This is a freaky movie! It's about this writer Sutter Cane who writes books that are like a disease and people go insane after reading them. Soon, so many have read them that those who do not read Sutter Cane books become the insane ones. John Trent is sent to investigate Sutter Cane's disappearance and soon finds his own reality and sanity slipping away. This movie is way too crazy to even explain it or attempt to write a spoiler. It's just something you have to see. It's part horror, part psycological thriller and a disturbing ride beginning to end. It has some gore but not too much, great suspense but is mostly a 'smart' type of movie delving into the darkness that exists in all humans. It has very creepy undertones and is anything but predictable! It's the type of movie you have to watch more than once to notice all the subtle details.  
 Its great to lay down and listin to this CD at night and just   listin to the ramblings of an old man. Dead Radio City is hard to put into a certain category because it touches them all. Burroughs goes from disturbing revelations to dark comedies to simple life findings. The music backing his voice in this album is pretty good even though it sometimes eclipses his voice at times. Burroughs has a great monotonic voice on this album which creates a great atmosphere and really drills home his jaded,disgruntled, and sarcastic message. All in All every song on here is not a winner but most of the album is pure nirvana 
 This is a fair and balanced book calling for the open discussion of bias in the media. He's not pointing fingers, he's pushing for changes. For the left-wing media to consistently deny that liberal bias doesn't exist is to sign its own death warrant. Look at the consistent drop in viewership in the major network evening news programs as an example. I applaud Goldberg for his honest evaluation of the problem and his sincere interest in making it better 
 A few years ago, I was caught off guard when my husband shared his fantasy of BDSM with me.    I was flattered that he wanted to try new things with me, but I wasn't sure I'd be able to transform myself into a "Dominate Mistress".  After a few feeble attempts, I threw my hands up and demanded that we try something else.  Sure, I absolutely LOVED dressing up in Dom clothing and looking the part, but when it came down to it, I had NO CLUE what to do with the poor guy once it was time to deliver.  Fast forward a few years later: The interest has been stirring again in both of us.  And this time I've decided to research BDSM a lot more extensively than I did before.  Which is how I came across this book.  I've learned so much from the lovely Claudia Varrin. In addition to being very instructional, and chock full of techniques to try out, this book is really a delightful read within itself.  I love the honesty and humour she injects throughout. Reading this has given me so much reassurance and confidence and now I feel ready to don the latex and give my darling husband a taste of having a Bitch bring him to his knees in loving humiliation. 
 When I saw "The 13th Warrior" is the theater, I was struck by the number of similarities it had to Beowulf. I didn't realize until a few years later that was the point of the movie. Nor did I realize then it was based on a novel by Michael Crichton.  The movie and the story work well together in a simple format. An Arab courtier, after a dalliance with a married woman, is "promoted" to ambassador and sent on a doomed mission. On the way, his band encounters a band of Viking warriors. He is conscripted to journey to their homeland to fight an ancient evil, monsters in the mists. Along the way he notices the great cultural differences between himself and the Northmen. His records of the sexual prowress and daily hygine definitely stay with the reader.  Despite the artful telling of the story and the true writings of Ibn Fadlan that are used as a foundation, it still can't compare to the rustic beauty of the original Beowulf poem. Nothing against a great writer like Crichton, but there are some things just best left as they are 
 Doomsday is coming out with a new raw album. These guys can put it all  together at times and on this album they did. This is the undadogg in  Seatown and I'm givin this album a 10. Other albums of doomsday you may  have heard and not liked but this one is legally dope 
 I was thrilled when my son started reading and was glad to buy books of interest for him. This book was used a lot in our house, he eve took it with him when we went to the traveling tour of the Titanic. Loads of great information 
 This is one of the best CDs I've bought in a long time.  I love it from beggining to end; all the tracks. The music is very good. I feel like getting up and dancing every time I hear it. Ana Carolina's voice is beautiful and unique. This one is a must buy 
 This book helped me find a lot of little known places to photograph in S.F. with stories about their backgrounds.  
 Duts, by Martha Grimes, marks the 21st entry in this exceptional series featuring Superintendent Richard Jury and his scene stealing friend Melrose Plant.  Though I would have preferred the duo spend a little more time in Melrose's hometown visiting with Marshall Trueblood and Vivian Rivington, I do think this book marked a return to form for Ms. Grimes.  Many of the preceding reviews speak of the "violent sex" in this book being such a departure for Jury.  Give Ms. Grimes a little more credit for her understanding of Jury.  I do not recall Jury every having such an intense reaction to any romantic muse.  Aguilar seems to be the catalyst for this intense relationship.  But the relationship, and its effects, are but one of several plotlines in this story.  Clearly Ms. Grimes gives more credit to her longtime readers than having to provide a Perry Mason like ending with closing arguements.  How anyone could not know who killed Billy Maples by the time the novel ends must not have payed attention.  I was disappointed at first to learn that Harry Johnson made a return appearance; however, I enjoyed Harry's role hear.  More as foil, rather than ever present dinner companion as he was in much maligned The Old Wine Shades.  Melrose and Richard Jury are in fine form here.  They work together well to solve the murder as they have so many times before.  A fine mystery that works.  Ms. Grimes is back.  I hope for many, many more Jury/Plant mysteries to come.  
 Pretty handy for a small yard with lots of 60 ft trees.  As or more powerful then my old gas blower but no fumes, no gas/oil to mix, not as loud.  Have not tried out mulch/vacuum mode with bag yet.  I like adjustable contol but it is a little difficult to adjust when running blower.  Sometimes adjustble control changes by itself.  Has concentrator nozzle that is nice.  Good secure extension cord anchor.  
 Reefer Madness remains a cult favorite to this day. Originally produced to scare parents into keeping their children away from the scourge of marijuana, the film faded into obscurity after a brief while. It was rediscovered during the 1960s when, of course, all types of experimentation and drug use spiked up much higher than ever before. People then found the film to be amusing--and they are right. Reefer Madness was produced with good intentions but quite frankly it's a hoot to watch and sometimes you just can't help but laugh.  This generous DVD offers us both the restored black and white version released in 1936 as well as a colorized version. You can also choose to listen to a commentary during the movie or you can simply watch it straight through on your own. Mike Nelson of "Mystery Science Theater 3000" does a great job with his running commentary. Either way, the film's scare tactics prove to be too lame for today's much more street wise people. If you want to scare kids away from drugs, Reefer Madness won't do the trick. The kids will probably be smart enough to just laugh at all the melodramatic scenes replete with over-the-top campy performances.   Reefer Madness tries its best to tell the story of the dangers of marijuana by showing us a few months in the lives of several high school students. In just this brief period of time they go from being the All-American Boys And Girls Club to being the horrific monsters who actually share intimacy before any wedding plans are announced--and they dance as if they're truly enjoying themselves! Of course, there's the obvious byproduct of playing the piano too fast, which in and of itself must be stamped out. The only truly serious scene in the movie--when someone gets bumped off--is probably the only time you'll experience a sense of sadness at the situation. Reefer Madness also points the finger at organized crime for distributing the drug.  Reefer Madness is best seen in its historical context as an outdated form of scare tactics meant to keep kids away from drugs; and it truly was produced with the best of intentions. However, with the passage of time and with new social mores and norms, the film plot becomes campy and hard to completely believe. The truth is most people laugh at it; and frankly it is pretty humorous, too.  The added short film entitled "Grandpa's Marijuana Handbook" by Evan Keliher is hysterical. Take a close look at that cat's eyes as the cat eats the leaves of the marijuana plant--man, is that cat stoned!  I highly recommend this DVD for fans of cult classic movies and people who want to take a look at how drug abuse was tackled in this country during the 1930s. The movie vacillates between true drama and mostly melodrama; so keep this in mind if you're looking for a truly dramatic flick.   
 For me, Afshin Molavi is the best native commentator on present day Iran. As I am writing this review the United States, Western Europe and Israel are growing more paranoid by the hour about Iran's nuclear program.  As usual President Bush and his people are relying on simplistic notions and contemplating simplistic solutions about this situation. Why is the West doing nothing to support and further the cause of the reformists and progressives in Iran?  Americans need to keep in mind that Iran is not some backward Arabic nation. Iran is truly a potential world pwer and it possesses one of the youngest populations in the world. Most of the Iranian population, especially the youngest, are disgusted with over 30 years of mullahism. Recall the student riots a few years back. They are ready for change and have attempted to do their best to vote in reformism.  Iranians also have deep affection for the United States. Remember that after 9/11 the Iranian people were perhaps the only Muslim people to hold candlelight vigils, expressing sincere sadness for that day.  The United States and Israel would be making serious mistakes and perhaps irreparable damage if they try any military intervention. We Iranians hate the mullahs and the Islamic Republic but we are also patriots and proud of our nation and heritage. Iran will never be in the same situation as Iraq.  Please, please, America must do what she had done during the Cold War with communism. America must offer support to the Iranian discontented, utilize satellite TV and offer people such as Molavi and other like him a voice to be heard.   Molavi should be on CNN and Fox, Larry King and Bill O'Reilly and be allowed to tell the American people that when you see "Death To Amerika" signs or hear it chanted in Iran realize that it is government sanctioned and the vast majority of Iranian people do not feel this in their hearts. When the Mullahs rant on and on about Israel he would be their to tell world that most Iranians are not concerned about that situation and don't feel it any of their business. He would remind the world that under The Shah, Iran was a major Israeli supporter. We need to see so many of the bright asnd talented and beautiful Iranian men and women who just want to live their lives, love their families and hold their heads up as proud Iranian patriots.  Do not give up on the Iranian people. We are the children of Cyrus and Zarathustra and Avicenna, Khayyam and Rumi. My fellow Americans and the West must learn this 
 This fullfills its purpose - very warm and comfortable, yet doesn't show underneath other clothes. I am very pleased 
 First of all, I would like to address a previous reviewer's "points"...   "Also, like most socialistic propaganda, the whole book has the feel of a out of control conspiracy theory. The capitalists control the state, and any wage increases to workers are bribes to prevent revolution. Furthemore, capitalists conspire to carve up the world between themselves."   It seems as if the writer of that "point" misses the bottom line, which is incredible taking into consideration the fact that corporations have always entered other territories in order to 1) establish a market, 2) strangle the region's attempts at establishing its own monopoly.    There is no "conspiracy" here...you only need to look at the way capitalism naturally functions, understand that monopolies are (usually?) inevitable, and realize that profit supercedes principle.  Check anything on the role of corporations in the Third World and watch how domestic economics become "geared" towards debt-repayment, not social construction, and thus remain in a permanent state of backwardness.  Regardless, there are "solutions" -- assimilation into capitalist society is one of them.  Kinda like, "help our ideology out, and your people can eat."  Not much of a "choice," though, no matter the number of earnest pleas to the contrary.   "Of course, history has proven Lenin totally wrong. Furthermore, Lenin invalidated his own thesis. He predicted that the socialist revolution would occur in Germany, getting tired of waiting for his foolish theories to work Lenin led the Russian revolution."   First of all, Lenin did not attempt a revolution because he "could not wait" for the German revolution to take place...he planned to take Russia from the start. As a matter of fact, just as Lenin predicted, a German revolution was not only underway, but erupted as quickly as it was put down by the Social-Democrats that betrayed it. But I guess "history" can be altered and made to look as if these predictions did not come true.    "It's ironic that upon reading the book is that, according to its arguments, Russia should have been one of the last places for the revolt to happen due to its economic backwardness.  Lenin's book is just one more example of the complete failure of socialist rhetoric to translate into reality."    Hmmmm, interesting, and open to interpretation, considering the fact that Lenin and other Marxists have always predicted that revolution will take place during civil unrest and economic backwardness. The depression in Germany was Lenin's basis for his idea regarding the fact that a revolution there was inevitable.  Backwardness in Russia -- as well as OBVIOUS unrest -- led to rebellion, and then Lenin's coup.  Note that I said "coup" -- there was no "active rebellion" of the worker against master.  Instead, Lenin's approach was quite authoritarian; an elite group of revolutionaries establish themselves OVER the peasants and workers, thus creating the foundation for tyranny.  Which is why I am, by no means, a "Leninist."  Still, Lenin's approach towards revolution should have no impact on the merits of his economic analysis in this book.  And, of course, his economic analysis is...impeccable 
 I'll have to admit I steered a bit clear of Joshua Bell in the early years of his career. My aversion wasn't based on his musical abilities. He was one of the performers that a few music industry publicity people decided would appeal to a younger audience so he was dressed as a teenaged heart throb that seemed to belong on the cover of a magazine geared toward junior high school girls than a lover of good, serious music. I think I resented shameless attempts to lure a "younger crowd" into concert halls to hear a symphony. I was young at the time and it didn't matter to me whether the guy on the cover was wearing a tux and might be a bit overweight or if he looked like the kid next door or the woman was slightly flawed wearing a gown or if she looked like a sex symbol. All I cared about was the music and I responded by not purchasing any of the various wunderkind releases and Joshua Bell was in this category. Of course I could boycott the recordings but I couldn't ignore the likes of Joshua Bell. He was always on television, performing with symphony orchestras (classical music radio stations still broadcast a plethora of concerts at the time) and I think only the most closed minded listeners could deny his talent. Since that time I've seen him perform and what I've found is an amiable performer with great talent who knows people that while people are paying to hear him play, the performance has to be about the music and not the performer and even if he hasn't aged, at least according to the cover photos on his recordings, he has matured as a performer. His technique is still evolving which could one day earn him a place with some of the great violinists (remember he's only in his thirties, he still has quite a career ahead of him), and he's able to perform some of the works of the greet classical composers and pieces with popular appeal without getting gimmicky.   VOICE OF THE VIOLIN is a collection of vocal pieces arranged fop the violin. Each of the arrangements works well for violin. The challenge is performing them with the same passion we are used to when we hear them performed by vocalists. Just about every tenor and soprano of note has performed and recorded Schubert's "Ave Maria." Massenet's "Porquoi Me Reveller" from WERTHER is a showstopper that was a favorite of tenors from Caruso to Pavarotti. Fans of Fredericka Von Stade and Renee Fleming have grown to love "Song to the Moon" from RUSALKA. We've grown accustomed to the greats singing many of the works on this collection with beauty and gusto. Chances are expectations are high for anyone familiar with these works. Bell delivers. He evokes the emotions of each piece and in a way his violin does sing as he performs. This can be tricky. So often vocal works, especially those from the operatic stage, don't adapt all that well to instrumental transcriptions and it is the rare instrumental performer that can do justice to the works, but Joshua Bell seems to in this recording.  Fans of Joshua Bell do not need to be convinced of the merits of this recording. Some may feel this is not a serious enough recording but I think most people who enjoy good music will appreciate Bell's artistry and the beautiful melodies are sure to give listeners hours of pleasure.   
 I bought the DVD for my daughter's 7th birthday. Both she and my 5yr old love the movie. They sing the songs from it all day long 
 I can't believe the the low rating on this CD? 1976's Sad Wings Of Destiny is JP's greatest work! You will not find a better tune than Victim Of Changes. A 5+ Rating 
 I really love the pictures.  They are very interseting to look at and they hold the attention of children.  I like to look at them myself.  We like to think of other questions and things to find on the pages.  WARNING: the "V" page (Vampire) may be a little scary for some small children (I think they could have left off some of the make-up and the blood on the fangs) 
 It arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition. I would not hesitate to use this vendor again. 
 The focus of this book is the Collection in Trafalgar Square but is not exclusive to it. It contains works of art that either picture a representation of Christ or allude to Him. I found my reading to be a delightful and awe-inspiring theological journey. Each chapter deals with a different aspect of how Christ is perceived. Several authors have compiled brief descriptions of the works that explain their significance and meaning. The book traces it course through predominately Catholic art. This may have been done mostly out of necesity because the plethera of art from the 13th to 20th centuries is largely by Catholics. However, it would have been nice to see some more Protestant imagery to complete the respesentation of Christ in art 
 This new addition to the Modern Library's 'Chronicles' series confronts many issues inherent in Holocaust history, from Hitler's plans for mass genocide to the relationship between his efforts and the larger war. Hitler And The Holocaust is an excellent survey of the underlying social and political beliefs which helped shape the world Hitler changed 
 This is the most comprehensive book I've found yet about flower gardening  in the desert.  Color pictures accompany each entry.  Both the botanical  and the common names of flowers are listed as well as other pertinent  information. I am constantly referring to it.  This and Sunset's WESTERN  GARDEN BOOK are my bibles for gardening in the desert 
 This is the kind of writing/reflecting many people do while travelling and is not a "how to" type of travel guide.  I've recommended this book to several thoughtful people, given it to many thoughtful teens as they begin to self-discover, and re-read the book twice.  VERY nice writing, good thoughts, great ideas about humans.  
 This is a great book for who wants know about boat construction. It's easy to understand. I really recomend 
 This one volume history of India offers a great perspective on the 3500+ years of known history (plus the 1000+ additional years of archaeological history) by focussing equal attention on equal periods of time, roughly speaking.  Naturally, the sources are admittedly sparse the further back we go, but the author does a remarkably good job of keeping a reasonable perspective.  Of course, it skips many details later in the story, when details from the recent past are abundant.  This makes for less conjecture, but also leaves one with a sense of glossing over, if you are familiar with recent Indian history.  Overall, this is an excellent history book for the serious beginner, and can point the interested reader to further enquiry.  It is adequately illustrated, and rather nicely diagrammed (particularly for some dynasties where successive rulers went back and forth across generations) 
 In answer to the gratitude that someone thought of recording James live during that seminal period of his recording career, it should be known that it was none other than James Brown himself, who put his own money on the line, rented out the Apollo theatre and the recording equipment and financed the entire deal on his own. He was ahead of his time musically and this artistic foresight extended to marketing as well. This album is a must-own for a little bit of insight as to what it might have been like to experience the James Brown band live as they were just hitting a groove that hasn't stopped so many decades later 
 Being a church planter in the South, I was ready for this book to blow me away. I'd read other titles that started with the similar "something is wrong with the church today..." and this book made the case just as well, if not better, than most other books on the same subject. The real meat in most of these books is in how and what it communicates as a solution.  And as far as solutions go, "Present Future" is a book for those who are looking to make changes within their well-established status quo- people that are in between something old and something new. McNeal's solutions really cater to those in Baptist or Baptist-like settings and want to align themselves with God's mission to redeem mankind.  With that said, the solutions, stories, models, and ideas spelled out in this book are well worth the read. I'm not in a Baptist or Baptist-like setting, and it gave me a lot to think through and some serious solutions to consider.  This book is worth your time no matter what church setting you're currently in. It's challenging, thought-out, and inspiring. The only drawback is that it's geared more for the "in betweens" and less for the frontier missionaries 
 It might not be my favourite book, but somehow it managed to attract me.  Great topic discussion, contents are clearly explained, and describe the view of modern world.  How do drug dealers still live with their mums? What makes a perfect parent? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common 
 Jeff Smith has again astounded me with the hardback publishing of the Dragonslayer series.  A great plot, witty dialogue, and precise drawings make this one a must for any hardback collector 
 I started watching Trinity Blood on Adult Swim a few saturdays ago like a bunch of other people and I am finally ready to put down my take on it. I have to admit that I knew very little about this series before I started watching it. It did catch my attention when I heard rumors about it but I didn't think it would be this deep. The very first episode starts off a little soft and quiet but assuring that something not so gentle is lurking. A very hungry priest named Abel Nightroad sent by the Vatican on some business is getting set for what would seem like a regular flight but notice that there's hardly anyone on the plane and boy are they lucky.   Ok the plane is taken over by a vampire which is no surprise because the anime is about vampire's walking among men and trying to feed off of humanity but the real surprise is what that vampire is there for and how Abel stops him. Now this is where the really good action comes in because Abel not only surprises viewers but also he surprises the vampire that thinks he knows everything that's going on. Abel is a shy and kind man that is holding a huge secret. The background story is kind of mediocre, hundreds of years ago a war between mankind ended leaving only some surviving and one being the Vatican and now mysterious beings (vampires) are creeping out of the darkness. Though the background is a bit weak the main character (Abel) and the characters to come are guaranteed to surpass it and make an promising story. I think that Trinity Blood has major potential to be great and hopefully it stays that way in the future episodes.   One thing that is making me a bit nervous with this series is after episode one the action is missing but it could just be those episodes or at least I hope. Trinity Blood actually reminds me of Chrono Crusade and Hellsing but not as good yet. The animation is sure to remind you of the two series too but with a little bit of a different touch on the action scenes. The animation style helps the action a lot to give it its own unique look and it stands out.  Contains episodes 1-4:  Flight Night  Witch Hunt  The Star of Sorrow 1 - City of Blood  The Star of Sorrow 2 - Hunter's Banquet  DVD Features: Director Interview, Cast Auditions, Cultural & Historical Facts, Concept Art 
 Winter has hit the small town of Crozet, Virginia with quite a blow, but Mary Minor "Harry" Haristeen, the town postmistress, isn't shocked, or perturbed by the abrupt change in weather. After all, she and her friends (both furry and human) know exactly how to keep warm by indulging in warm treats, working hard, and...rooting for the University of Virginia's women's basketball team, in an effort to keep their spirits high, and bring the gold home for the team. But when local contractor, H.H. Donaldson, dies in the parking lot after one of the spirited games, word quickly spreads that it wasn't your average death...H.H. was killed, and his murderer's trail is cold. Harry is shocked to believe that one of her fellow basketball fans, and acquaintances is a cold-blooded killer, finding it hard to let H.H.'s death sit right with her. And everyone knows, best of all Harry's tiger cat Mrs. Murphy, that when something doesn't agree with Harry, she has a tendency to start poking her nose where it doesn't belong. Even if she risks putting herself, and her feline (and canine) friends in danger. Now, in an attempt to ensure that their curious (okay, downright nosy) mother doesn't waste one of her nine lives, Mrs. Murphy, along with her feisty feline pal, Pewter, and their canine relative, Tee Tucker have decided to join the amateur sleuth in uncovering who exactly H.H.'s killer is, and why he (or she) did him in. But with Harry constantly gallivanting off at all kinds of odd hours of the day and night, it's becoming complicated for the feisty furballs to keep their eyes on her 24/7, leaving Harry wide open for discovery, or, even worse...gambling with her own life.  There's nothing that I love more than curling up with a cozy mystery on a cold day, especially one with felines and canines scurrying around. So, when the temperature made a quick drop, I headed directly for Mrs. Murphy and the Crozet gang, to see what new mysteries they were wrapping themselves up in. As per usual, Harry was her delightful self. A self-confident, brave, intrepid character, whose independence is admirable, as are her hard work and sleuthing skills. Accompanied by the always-hungry, often sarcastic, Pewter; the short-legged, stubby-tailed, flying solo canine, Tee Tucker; and the oft-times conceited, but lovable, Mrs. Murphy; along with handfuls of other enjoyable characters, THE TAIL OF THE TIP-OFF was certainly one-sitting-read worthy. The descriptions of the Virginian countryside were incredible; as were the additions of some new characters, who will hopefully be sticking around for awhile. The purr-fect mystery to accompany a nice, warm mug of cocoa on a cold winter's day.  Erika Sorocco Freelance Reviewe 
 This book fed me richly for a period of two years, and I am not easy to please 
  This was one of those tapes that you really do not want to wait to hear the rest of it.    The ending is a surprise even for those of us who consider ourself mystery book master solvers. 
 Anyone who appreciates real science will appreciate this book. Like science, the most exciting thing about Wheelers for me was delving into ideas that are new. As you read along totally involved in the story line, all of a sudden the authors poke you gently in the side ribbing you a bit to make sure you're still paying attention. Such play on words is also one of the trademarks of their science books. Excellent character development without over doing it, leaving room not only for the great imagination of the authors, but for the imagination of the reader. I felt as if I was a participant in the building of the possibilities that are explored 
 Although it seemed a bit strange to me that Mark Twain detoured away from his usual straight works of fiction to something that is obviously based on fantasy, I am from Connecticut, so I embraced this novel with open arms. What surprised me the most was that it was in the junior fiction section of my local library, and the more I read, the more surprised I was. I was an advanced reader when I was young, but I would have been hard pressed to understand or get much out of this book anytime before high school. That said, I was fairly riveted throughout the novel. Hank Morgan's character was amusing, resourceful, and altogether human. After reading so much about the "perfection" of Arthurian and Round Table society, it's nice to hear about what life would have been like even if King Arthur and his Round Table did exist. The ending was distinctly bittersweet, and I can honestly say that this has become one of my favorite classics 
 ... It would be one to express how good this album is!!! I'm a huge fan of this lady, not because she is beutiful and stuff like that (I'm a woman too. So I prefers boys), but because she sings like an angel!!! And I was expecting a new album for so long when she released this one... What I did not expect was the inteligent choices for songs. Til this day I can't even choose my fave ones, cause I loved the whole album.   She put some class and some new sounds to well known and aproved music. Really great!!! Many artists are doing this revival albuns, and this one I would recomend to people that are embracing this wave. Vanessa put her classy stile to this, and made the music sound new, cool and good to hear whatever the moment.   July 
 A Time to Kill and The Broker are my two favs from Grisham.  Suspense is the name of the game.   I like books that make me read them straight through because they're so suspense filled. Another great novel is Deadly Behavior by Dee Sullivan. 
 This book is great, don't get me wrong. I bought a copy and I didn't even want to put it down till I was done, because it offers a fresh and interesting look at an age-old industry. But the book leaves out lots of points that would be very helpful for anyone trying to learn about the industry. Want something that picks up the slack? Buy "The Music Business Bundle" by Ty Cohen along with this book 
 Perfect condition; new book; great packaging and arrived on time. This book cost less than paying my school's book store for it and it was deliever-free 
 Ayn Rand is perhaps one of the most important writers of our time, both in terms of her philosophy and literary style.  Unlike her other works of fiction, 'Anthem' is quite concise and its message is crudely blunt.  The text is written in a simple format, reminiscent of Biblical parables, which was, perhaps, Rand's intention.  (Even the text's font of the Centennial Edition gives a crude and primitive impression.)  The plot is simple, and the book itself is unconventional in the sense that there can be said that 'Anthem' has no real climax, but rather, the main character goes through an epiphany.  Set in a Dark Ages of the future in which all traces of individuality are outlawed, one man, Equality 7-2521, dares to defy this spirit-crushing world and set the standard for a new age of individuality.  'Anthem' is not simply about the horror that is socialism, but also the struggle against the 'herd mentality'.  Equality 7-2521 chooses to live his life solely for his own happiness.  In the world today, we may not be threatened by the onslaught of socialism anymore (which is still debatable), but we are constantly bombarded by our commercialistic society, which tells us that we do not own certain (new) things we will never be part of the 'pack', so to speak.  This leaves us in a predicament where we will never be able to ever fully feel as part of the pack because as soon as we do (or, more accurately, purchase) something that gives us that feeling of belonging, something else is comes out that just questions our very status once again.  'Anthem' is a warning to all of us not to fall into that 'herd mentality'.  Let's remember that one sacred word: EGO.. 
 I strongly recommend this book for both beginner and veteran pistol shooters. Gun safety, how-to's on gun care and operation, shooting tips, self defense and legal issues are all addressed in an easy to understand manner. This book is perfect for teaching a newcomer the basics. It is a good reference for the experienced also 
    	Voice performer Robin Atkin Downes is a more than proficient actor - he's equipped to narrate in some 40 dialects.  Television aficionados recognize him for his appearances on Nash Bridges, Beverly Hills 90210, Buffy the Vampire slayer and others.  His London stage performances include starring in Dracula, Taming of the Shrew, Much Ado About Nothing, and more.  He delivers a stellar reading of "One Good Turn," by Whitbread First Novel Award winner Kate Atkinson.  	What does a Good Samaritan get for his trouble?  In the case of 50-year-old Martin Canning, a second tier crime novelist who spends much time in wishful thinking, maybe a star in his crown but only a wealth of woes on this earth.  	Set in Edinburgh, Scotland, our story opens with a crowd of people witnessing what appears to be a minor bumper bash but quickly turns ugly.  The driver of one of the vehicles  jumps from his car and brutally attacks the other driver with a baseball bat.  Just as a perhaps fatal blow is about to be delivered, someone in the crowd tosses a laptop case which deflects the attacker's aim.  The tosser  is Martin.   	For his life saving act, surely the most untoward thing he has ever done,  Martin  is robbed and worse.  	The crowd is quick to disperse, leaving  listeners  to believe that is the end of them.  Not at all.   Atkinson's magic pen brings them back,  weaves them throughout her narrative in surprising ways.  While we never know what life may hold in store, this author leads us on a fascinating journey of what it might.          - Gail Cook 
 The question is whether you're viewing this as a lover of Bacon's work or to enjoy what is simply a fascinating cult film in itself.  A few of the intermittant shots are not the most original and the storyline might not be to all tastes, but the Jacobi-Craig clash and borderline humour of supporting characters combine for some wonderfully twisted dialogue that brings it alive!  If you're aware that none of Bacon's work is on offer, and appreciate tongue-in-cheek humour of it's darkest type then you will love this film 
 I bet all the people who rated this cd loved it from the first listen. This is one of those few cds that as soon as you put them on you cant stop grinning and thinking your money was very well spent. On another note i wanted also to agree with one of the other reviewers that said he couldn't stand people comparing these guys with Deep Dish. Their sounds are completely different, and Saeed & Palash are a little more tribal than Deep Dish 
 Excellent read for anyone from lay people to academics. Moves along quickly but doesn't skimp on the details 
 This is a wonderful and riveting story that is strangely missing in Classic English Literature.  The three Bronte sisters were indeed a talented lot.  But I always hate it when a person never lives to see their deserved acclaim.  It's always a mark of a good storyteller when you can actually feel that you are truely a part of the story.  I actually like this story a little more than Jane Erye, but that might just be me.  Highly, highly recommended 
 The book condition is fairly good for a second hand book. However, it took 2 weeks to deliver 
 This book of Bukowski's work was released by his wife after he died. Some good stuff in here. its hard to tell if they werent released because he didnt theink them good enough while he was alive or these works were simply ready not for prime-time yet while he was living 
 I've often wondered that if I had to attend a party or a ball that was made up of every character of a particular author's body of work, whose creations would I wish to meet? You couldn't do much better than Charles Dickens, and surely the host of such a gathering would be Mr. Pickwick of the Pickwick Club.  The club, discovered in a collection of "posthumous papers," is something of a toast masters society that journeys from London to the English countryside and back again in search of various forms of stimulation.  Instead of finding that philosophical, poetic, and scientific wisdom that they are in search of, more often they stumble into situations not of their own making. Nearly always, hilarity ensues.  They spirit of the novel is both jolly and tender; never has a book so often made me want to join the action.  And while I haven't read every Dickens novel, I doubt that you will find a more wonderful pair of friends that Samuel Weller and Mr. Pickwick.  The two are genuine and devoted friends, despite their differences in interests, mannerisms, and stations in life.  Regarding the very long novels of the 19th century (this may sound obvious), they take some getting used to, especially to readers of much shorter contemporary novels.  One inevitably will forget a character or a detail that appears on p. 35 as they read p. 700.  Yet, one should remember that the novel came out in 19 monthly installments, and thus does not call for a quick reading.  One can set the book aside for a few days and not worry about losing the plot; there isn't really a plot.  Like a television series today, the adventures involve the same principle characters, with many of the supporting characters reappearing throughout the narrative.  But the work itself is less a story than a canvas, and there is no central conflict or tension.     My first crack at one of Dickens' long novels was David Copperfield, which was also my first review on this site.  I gave it 2 stars, despite the fact that I enjoyed so many pieces of it.  Trying to race through a Dickens novel will end in frustration and exhaustion.  Don't be afraid to read other books simultaneously.   Lastly, do yourself a favor and read the Introductions written by GK Chesterton.  These essays both elevate one's own reading of the novel, and provide pleasure and insight in their own right.  They bypass both the jargon and ostentatious learning that can make contemporary criticism a battle to read. 
 Brown does an excellent job of introducing the reader to the period of late antiquity in this work.  He is able to cover the major political, social and philosophical transition of the Roman Empire of the Antonines to the emergence of the Christian Succesor States with clarity, and accuracy.  Although this work does not take an indepth look into any of the many subjects that fall in this period, it is an excellent overview, and maintains a level of scholarship that is almost unparalled in a work of this nature.  The book is documented to an excellent degree, so that even the most critical reader can see where it is that Brown is comming from.  I would recomend this book to anyone from the avid scholar to the most casual reader 
 I love Butcher's take on werewolves in this second book in his series.  As if Dresden doesn't have enough trouble trying to help track a serial killer for his friend at the Special Investigation branch of the CPD, he has to cope with the involvment of several groups/gangs of werewolves along the way.  Again, Harry Dresden blunders his way into a situation that he feels that he must cope with, wizard that he is, but is way over his expectations.  And, of course, things are not what they seem.  But with the help of some silver bullets and his own wizardly knowlege, well, people still get badly hurt.  This is no "G" rated series where people just get knocked over after all.  I have to say that I love how consistant the "special effects" are in this series.  And I love the characters and the way they interact.  Dresden may be blind to the obvious at times, and mess up regularly, but that just makes him human like the rest of us 
 When R.E.M. released its first full-length album, nobody else sounded anything like them.  They were Southerners but this was not Southern Rock, the Rickenbacker guitar sounded a little like the Byrds but this wasn't folk, and while they immediately became Indie Rock standards, "Murmur" was more elegiacally beautiful than anything else labeled "Indie" at the time.  "Talk About The Passion" and "Shaking Through" are beautiful songs, even if Michael Stipe's garbled lyrics cannot be heard clearly.  Early R.E.M. still sounds timeless, like nothing before or after.  This is as good a debut as any band has ever had, and a few more great albums, and several worthy records, would follow.  
 First I must say that I find it truly amusing that the worst review for this was writen by a man who so odviously has never actually used much less properly used the equipment.  I can asure everyone that the machines are quite easy to use without "thrashing around" and that when used properly don't seem to cause injuries.  Having the cardio everyother is nice even if it is redundent bc most of what I need right now is cardio.  The environment is also nice as it is not full of people who live to workout.  Certainly is a beginner environment but I am a beginer.  Oh and on the medical side many of the people where I go including myself were sent by dr's.  Yes we all know that exercise and a healthy diet will help us loose weight but this program is great for those of us who have no idea where to start 
 Plot: After Officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) defuses a dramatic situation (excuse the pun) involving a madman bomber (Dennis Hopper) and a rigged elevator filled with innocent people, it looks like these events were merely a rough day on the job. Unfortunately, this badguy has only just begun. Jack ends up entangled within a dangerous web spun by a mind bent on revenge and mayhem -- and it soon becomes personal. He ends up among the passengers of a public transportation bus that has been wired with a bomb. Once the bus goes above 50 MPH, the bomb is armed. If it drops below 50, there's gonna be a hell of a mess to clean up. The crazed villain demands money as well as full cooperation from Jack and the local police force. But Jack knows that if anybody's going to make it out of this alive, the rules must be bent and the bomber must be outsmarted. Yet with so little time and many hazards, is that even possible?  Speed (1994) is one of those instant action/thriller classics that popped out of the 80s and 90s. It may not have any Bruce Willis or Arnold Schwarzenegger, but it does have some major suspense, superb acting, a solid script, and tons of booms and bangs to satisfy any fan of the genre. My favorite aspect of Speed (and I doubt I'm alone in this) is Dennis Hopper as Howard Payne -- the out-of-his-mind kook who's causing all the trouble. Hopper has always had that edgy, slightly crazy feel about him, and it goes very well with the violent antics and intriguing dialogue of his charatcer. Overall, it's definitely white-knuckled entertainment with the first viewing, but still maintains its appeal time and time again. In the end, it's all just another thrill-ride that steps out of the bounds of reality to give folks a good old-fashioned action flick, but come on, isn't that we wanted 
 Since I'm not physically able to use a regular vacuum, the Bissell serves to pick up the every day little things that get on the floor.  I have a cleaning lady once a month for the deep cleaning, but this enables me to have a decent looking carpet in between her visits.  It's light enough to not give me pain.  
 Kevin gives us a nice twist with Black Maria.The title is a slang for a police wagon or hearse. This collection is a  blues based detective novel written in poems and is actually a screenplay.It takes a very talented writer to pull that off and Kevin has done it well. I read this novel/collection/play straight through. The story is captivating. What do you get when a sexy singer crosses paths with a drunken detective? A plot full of drama, the hunt, the chase and the catch and broken hearts.Bravo to Kevin for this refreshing mix. I've never read anything like it before. Lyrical Brilliance!  Reviewed by Dawnn 
 I love EFO live and this show is a shining example of why!  Beautiful harmonies, excellent rhythms, and lyrics that vacillate between hilarious to heart rendering.  This 2 CD set brings me to the border of euphoria and high energy dancing.  I shared it with many a friend and they all are new EFO fans, from the deadheads to the folkies to the head bangers to the disco ducks.  
 Although definitely not as good as his later collections, this one is worth at least four stars. I would have given it 4 1/2 if it were possible on Amazon.com. Recommended, but if you're strapped for cash, I suggest purchasing a later work first, as you will probably enjoy it more. Also, the typeface (font) used in this edition is annoying, though quickly gotten used to 
 The Golden Fleece Found by Basil Hill is not just 'another book'.  It is packed full of provocative questions, answers and conclusions-- this book fosters a love for knowledge, wisdom and truth.  It will send the reader into seeking real answers to real problems.  This book is one of the most relevant contemporary books I have ever read.  The author's motivation for writing this book is much different than many other authors; I have known him personally, and can say his focus, passion for the truth, ability to report accurately, inability to exaggerate and sense of duty, love and personal responsibility are hallmarks of this book.  Read this book-- it is the product of a labor of love, written through personal sacrifice.  It is not just 'another' book; the author's life is an authentic portrayal of the conclusions in the book, which is a stark constrast to the 'money driven' ambitions of most authors in this genre.  Read this book, and you will find many of the answers to your own life's questions. (People who love without fear of personal loss ALWAYS provide answers for the rest of humanity).   
 Power and Prosperity is an example of economics at its best. First of all, it takes a balanced or neutral approach to its subject matter. The author is not out to prove the superiority of either markets or government. Governmental power is a double edged sword to Olson. Government power promotes prosperity by restraining 'roving bandits' or special interests. Government power is also susceptible to the influence of special interests. Olson also discusses the merits and faults of markets. Markets are ubiquitous and can lead to prosperity, but often do not. Government has a role in this. That is, he finds blame for this in the most negative aspects of government. Olson does not assume market efficiency either. He explains it, as well as some possible limitations to markets.  This is also a highly insightful book. Much of his analysis derives from his earlier work on "the logic of collective action'. He also uses some transaction costs and basic supply and demand/substitution effect reasoning to explain historical events. Students in my comparative classes had more trouble with this book than any other, but it is still manageable. Reading it might be difficult for those who lack an education in economics. But I am not sure if there is an easier way to say what it says, and what it says is most interesting. The concepts the author employs makes a greater understanding of different economic systems and historical periods possible. This is penetrating analysis.  It is also highly relevant. Much of this book focuses on the Soviet Union. One could say that the USSR is a done deal- it failed so forget about it. It is, however, important to understand why it failed so as to avoid repeating such errors in the future. This is what the Author is driving at with in his use of the Soviet example. There were reasons for the failure of the Soviet system that also apply to problems in other nations- not to mention Russia today. The misuse of power has the potential to prevent prosperity as much now as it did under Stalin and Khrushchev.  Does this book have faults? Certainly. Olson takes too positive a view of Stalin's industrialization program (not that he praises Stalin). Olson dismisses complete privatization, or anarchy, too easily. There is nothing wrong with arguing against anarchy. But, his arguments against privatizing the state (i.e private police and courts) are little more than an unsupported dismissal of such arrangements. If he did not want to debate that issue, he should not have taken such a strong stand. He also might have mentioned a few things about FA Hayek- especially on p136 where he wrote "a bureaucracy cannot process all the information needed to calculate an optimal allocation or put it into practice".  While there are a few faults to this book, it is still excellent. It is a must read for anyone interested in either comparative economics and politics, Globalization, or the economic history of the Soviet Union 
 This book effectively combines real world examples of most every topic discussed.  Many strategy books that I have read are rather academic.  I read this last week and, I have already taken a strategy that the authors outlined and have applied it.  Co-Opetition is presented in a very straight forward and engaging style.  It was a JOY to read.  
 My kinda music. Joyce is a very good musician.. 
 This is extraordinary story and easy to follow. It is easily comparable to modern socitey. The tragic flaws in Creon and Oedipus are very defined.  This is a classic "must read"  
 If you know other guitar building books none of the author's methods will be new to you (with the exception of how he makes the sides) and I'm wondering where the "modern approach" is. Anyway I like this book a lot because it's an exceptional well made guitar building guide. It's very thorough and covers everything from start to finish with tons of quality pictures that clearly help you understand the process. The author recommends to buy a ready-made fretboard so you will not find information on cutting fret slots in this book.  I consider this book a must have for any one interested in guitar building 
 This program is a wonderful balance between written and spoken French, with cute songs and games which entertain children as they learn.  Most notable is that the program is presented by a native French speaker, not a  speaker of French as a second language.  I highly recommend this program,  especially for (but not limited to) children who can read 
 I was lucky enough to see this band in Chicago back in November of 1972 right about the time this music came out.....AWESOME! Leslie West came out in front of a wall of Marshall amps and did a 30min solo with a Gibson Flying V, he was HUGE back then...made the V look like a ukelele. But, man could he make them Marshalls beg for mercy! There are so many good songs on this cd it is hard to start, WHy Dontcha, "love is worth the blues" "The Doctor" Jack Bruce is so talented,,,,what a great band, BUY THIS 
 No professional library would be complete without this book 
 I came upon this book while preparing for the North American debut of a 1640's Baroque opera in Washington D.C.   The information in it is invaluable and succinct.  Great for anyone trying to extract meaning from music and convey it to an audience.  Well-written and containing excellent advice and exercises, I recommend it 
 Hermann illuminates lesser-known Greek figure Parmenides in this carefully constructed treatise on the early years of philosophy. Beginning with his more famous contemporary, Pythagoras, the book delves into the curious sides of Pythagoreanism, exposing the vulnerabilities of this calculating thinker. Clearly, the author prefers the less exacting measures of Parmenides, who sought to include more than he eliminated. Side by side, the two philosophers make an interesting comparison, like pairing a physicist with a politician. Hermann attempts to personalize these historical figures whenever possible. Sharp illustrations bolster the narrative, carrying it beyond the dry prose often found in other texts 
 This book turned out to be a little advanced for my 10 year old.  She learned slang words she didn't know before 
 I bought this book after watching a Webcast where the book was repeatedly referenced. Glad I got it, lots of defailts that weren't covered in the Webcast and I probably would have tried some of the things on my own and have failed. The book stepped me through the migration process to a point where I understand what is going on. This is a GREAT book, I highly recommend it for any company migrating to Windows 2003 
 Horror master Arthur Machen's crowning achievement, a still shocking compendium of interwoven short horror tales.   In late 19th century London, a scientist and an unpublished writer join forces as amateur detectives in an attempt to solve a minor but puzzling mystery which ultimately leads to the discovery of a truly diabolical conspiracy.  In the course of their investigations, the two men find themselves repeatedly surrendering their attention to a series of seemingly outlandish tales spun by an assortment of eccentric story tellers.  The stories, which all deal with imposture of some kind, are only tangentially related to each other, yet offer the somewhat bumbling sleuths important clues to the mystery at hand.  Machen builds suspense slowly and methodically, masterfully leading the reader on to a completely unexpected, gruesome climax.  Comical, tragic, sophisticated, violent, horrific, and even downright disgusting, THE THREE IMPOSTORS is a classic horror novel of sly deception and wit.      The 1995 Everyman paperback is the only critical edition of this remarkably rich book released to date, offering a scholarly introduction (by editor David Trotter) that carefully details Machen's main influences (chiefly Robert Louis Stevenson) and themes (imposture of various kinds, also derived from Stevenson).  A short text summary nicely encapsulates the narrative's various twists and turns.  Finally, a section entitled "Machen and His Critics" provides a welcome offering of mostly contemporaneous critical responses to this remarkable book; while many of these reviews were laudatory, quite a few passionately outraged quotes reveal just how shocking THE THREE IMPOSTORS must truly have been in its time 
 We asked.  We pleaded.  We begged, "Pretty pleeease."  Ruth Culham responded to our request with great enthusiasm with 6+1 Traits of Writing: The Complete Guide for the Primary Grades.  And teachers across the globe cheered, "Wahoo!"  Finally, a resource book for primary educators who have been searching for child tested ideas that tackle instructional strategies and assessment techniques in one comprehensive book.  Thank you, Ruth, for doing a wonderful job of explaining each trait, equipping us with developmentally appropriate focus lessons, and reminding us that teaching writing to young authors is a process in which they need plenty of practice and opportunities, and an extra helping of patience on our part doesn't hurt.  This must have book for all teachers - novice and experienced alike - won't be another resource that is shelved after a quick glance.  It will be close at hand as it is used throughout the year to help develop the talents of young writers 
 Not one to shy away from a challenge, I still was somewhat hesitant and apprehensive after pulling this massive tome down from the shelf and computing the time commitment necessary to read it. I needn't have been, this book was worth every minute. Mr. Black delivers a comprehensive yet concise narrative of FDR's life and times without meandering too far off the subject in, (what I found), a lively manner. Sparing you a mini-FDR bio here, Black provides a much needed description of FDR's almost other-worldly intuition. If at times he credits FDR with a foresight that belies belief, Black can be forgiven, for in hindsight FDR's vision for the US was extraordinary .... and correct. I highly recommend this book. 
 I bought this book a few months after my first daughter, Kayla Marie, was stillborn on her due date April 14, 2003.  It helped me get through a second pregnancy that ended in a miscarriage and the pregnancy of my beautiful and healthy baby boy this March 2005.  I felt very much alone during my pregnancies because none of my friends had went through what I did. Your innocence is gone once you experience a loss. The book helped me realize that what I was feeling and the fears that I had where normal.  I definately would recommend this book if you are trying again after a loss.  It is an easy read and I felt it gave me great comfort.  She really put great information into this book 
 This is great movie jazz of the late nineteen-fifties, in a row with the MJQ's own "Odds Against Tomorrow", Miles Davis' "Ascenseur pour l'échafaud", the Jazz Messengers' "Des femmes disparaissent", and Duke Ellington's "Anatomy of a Murder". Excellent, if a bit top-heavy, sound. True jazz lovers may want a little more improvisation here and there, but should respect John Lewis' great score, which is done with great purpose and dexterity 
 I never really cared for the Little Mermaid, but I liked the songs nevertheless.  But I was more of a fan of Beauty and the Beast.  I found the songs, acting, and animation a joy to watch.  And it was around that time that I wanted to be a Disney Animator.  Well..that's not going to happen anytime soon.  Beauty and the Beast is in my opinion the best out of the three Ashman/Menken collaborations.  It has such an amazing adult and kid broadway feel to it that it was meant to be both on stage and screen.  Prologue--David Orgen Steirs (spl?...he plays Coggsworth as well as a few other Disney characters) has an amazing timing and voice.  Also a great singing voice.  His narration is great and it really captures you into the story.  Belle--This song was so amazing.  I really liked the whole "three groups" singing at the same time idea when I was little.  Gaston, chasing after Belle... Belle, off in her own little world... the towns people not giving a dang about Gaston, but focusing their time on critiquing Belle and how she doesn't seem to fit in their society.  Page O'Hara has an amazing voice... not many people know that she was the original Belle on Broadway, only for a short time though.  Belle (Reprise)--This really shows who Belle is and it's such a powerful scene to see on screen (the instrumental part in the middle where the camera pans out over the fields and woods), it shows you how big her dreams are.  Be Our Guest--Jerry Orbach has an amazing stage voice, I mean I actually thought he played off a nice fake French accent.  He never gets out of it and he never lets you down throughout this song.  Though I don't think how they brought this song on Broadway was good at all...I don't think it sounds all that grand.  I think it's meant more for the movie.  And Angela Landsburry, I think of Miss. Lovett (Sweeney Todd) when I hear her voice or when I hear her singing from Bedknobs and Broomsticks.  She is a great singer and the song's lyrics are phenominal.  Gaston--This has to be an amazing adult song.  I never really "understood" it when I was a child, now hearing it when I am older, it's great.  I think Ashman really let his lyrics fly in this song and I think it's one of his best.    Gaston (Reprise)--"Lafou I'm afraid I've been thinking... A dangerous pastime!  I know!", whoever doesn't crack up at that makes me surprised.  It's basically dissing Gaston and how his looks are more than his brains.  It gives hint to his "evil plot", and also allows the vilian to have another bit of the spotlight.  Something There--Is a great song between Belle and the Beast.  It was one of my favorites when I was young.  It shows how Belle is starting to have a change of heart about the Beast.  It's also showing that the Beast is starting to have a change of heart towards Belle.    Human Again--...I guess because I heard this being sung  on the Broadway cast, I like the Broadway one better.  I like what the Beast and Belle were reading before (King Arthur) than Romeo and Juliet.  Also the animation was too crappy looking.  But the song itself was amazing and on cd is much more better.  I think they somewhat excell more than the broadway cast in some aspects.  It'd been nice to have heard it when it was originally inserted in the movie.  Beauty and the Beast--Angela Landsburry sings this song as if she was singing to a grandaughter or a child.  In the movie she is singing this to chip, I thought when hearing it she was singing it to me.  I'd listen to this song when I was going to bed because it was like a bedtime story.  It's sweet, touching and pretty.  The Mob Song--I love this song, it's powerful and simply thrilling.  To hear Gaston going to kill the Beast, Belle wanting to save him, and the Beast simply not carring anymore (knowing well enough he may live a beast forever and never return to his human self).    Beauty and the Beast (Reprise)--I love how this song is the reprise.    Beauty and the Beast (Credits Duet)--Celine Dion and Peybo were nice choices for this song.  I think they sang it well and it was arranged quite nicely.  (On the DVD, when putting it on sing-along, watch the credits.  It's hilarious watching kids trying to sing the "ooohs" and "ahhhhs" of Celine Dion.)  Alan Menken has an upbeat score, but next to Hunchback I think this is one of his best.  I just adore the "The Beast Lets Belle Go" and "The Battle on the Tower".  I love the Battle on the Tower, esp. the music being played while Gaston is walking among the statues searching for the beast, taunting him.    I do like the original death music for the beast.  I am glad they included this on the soundtrack, because hearing it on the SE DVD during the credits is pretty.  Transformation is another nice piece of music and before I heard the alt. track, I really liked that piece.  In the end I love this soundtrack.  It has amazing singers, songs, and soundtrack pieces.  This was nominated for an Academy Award for best movie, obviously because it was something different than The Little Mermaid.  It really appealed to adults and I think this was the begining of Disney movies for kids and adults.  All in all, the original soundtrack is a good buy too.  But this works as well. :)  
 My kids really like this yoga DVD.  Although they have yet to actually do the whole thing, they enjoy it.  I like the way it's done, really geared towards children to make it fun, but they are definitely learning yoga.  I also like the instructor, she's clear, adds elements children enjoy and best of all, isn't talking "baby talk".  I would definitely recommend this DVD for any young children interested in yoga.  By the way, my husband liked doing it too 
 I've read this book twice now and both times were floored by the brilliance of this history book.  Shirer was an eye witness to some of the events he describes in this book and lends a sobering perspective.  This book is without a doubt the best introduction and the most comprehensive single volume history you'll find on Nazi Germany.  Highly recommended. 
 Return of the Living Dead 2 isn't as good as part 1, partly because we follow a group of survivors made mostly of kids, which doesn't leave a lot of room for them using firearms like an adult survivor can. There's not a lot of shooting, but the film does make up for it by sheer number of decaying zombies. The zombies stumble and run as well, and the make up effects look great, there's no mistaking they're the undead.  The film has plenty of zombie death gags to ogle at, and this is the main strength of the film for a zombie fan. The gore is good at times, but overall, not as gory as it could have been. Most of the zombie scenes take place at night, but a number of shots are well lit, allow the viewer to appreciate the detailed zombie work. The pacing of the film is decent, there are some light comedic moments worth smiling for, and in general, this is a worthy zombie film to add to your growing zombie collection.  Tarman makes a return here as well. The music is okay, but I don't remember the original's music-so long ago. The commentary features the bully kid from the film, along with the director, who pretty much "hated" making this film according to his comments. He did a nice job regardless 
 I have had the priviledge of viewing this and found it to be very insightful into the world of exotic male dancers, and trust me it delivers!!  From start to finish, this film keeps you totally involved and interested in what really happens.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone! 
 i think its great book,it has potential that can bring poeple more respective and succes toward their dream.. you will be more likeable and famous among your friend after you read this boo 
 `Cookies Unlimited' by Nick Malgieri is the sixth book dedicated exclusively to cookies I have reviewed, and I can honestly say I have found not a single poor book in the lot. However, there are several reasons for selecting one of these books over the other depending on your needs at the time. Two books, `Rose's Christmas Cookies' and `Field Guide to Christmas Cookies' are dedicated to Christmas cookies, so you may only want these if you bake cookies only around Christmas, except that the first of the two books by Rose Levy Beranbaum has a great introduction to baking cookies in general. One of these books, `The All American Cookie Book' by Nancy Baggett is dedicated, obviously, to American cookie recipes, including some of the very best recipes for chocolate chip cookies and the Pennsylvania Dutch specialities. The `King Arthur Cookie Companion' and Carol Walter's `Great Cookies' are both superb general cookie books, although the King Arthur writers give a much better introduction to cookie making in general. King Arthur and Rose Levy Beranbaum do the best job, in general, on the cookie tutorial at the beginning of the book. So where does Nick Malgieri's book fit in?  For starters, while Malgieri's book does cover several famous American cookie types such as the chocolate chip and the Pennsylvania Dutch sugar cookie, he devotes much space to a lot of classic French, Austrian, and Italian cookies. If you could have but two cookie cookbooks, this book paired with Nancy Baggett's `All American' book would do a good job of covering the subject worldwide.  Malgieri also does not give us the in-depth tutorial we get from King Arthur, Beranbaum, and Carole Walter. Instead, we get a seven (7) page no nonsense survey of ingredients, equipment, and technique which I strongly urge you to read before doing any of the recipes. As a former chemist, I am a pretty good baker, as I am expert at weighing and measuring. My downfall usually comes when I mix things, as the rule of the day in chemistry is that things be mixed thoroughly. As with biscuits and pastry dough, many cookie doughs are better mixed lightly, leaving a certain coarseness in the mix so that the baking cookies are not leavened too much by the sugar's creating little air pockets in the creamed butter. As counterintuitive as this sounds, I am taking Herr Malgieri's word on this as he is the baking instructor and I am not.  My general experience with Malgieri's books is that except for yeast bread baking, it is to him I always look first for a particular recipe for things like cakes, pies, and quick breads. Now that I have this book, I am sure I will come to him first for cookies as well, since I have never been disappointed with my implementing any of his recipes. The only weakness I have found in any of Malgieri's books is in the misleading title `How to Bake', which is much more a collection of really good recipes than a tutorial on baking technique. Malgieri simply knows how to write a recipe that is easy to follow and which delivers satisfactory results.  `Cookies Unlimited' is organized in the same way as Carole Walter's book, by style of baking. That is, his chapters are on:  Bar Cookies Drop Cookies Refrigerator Cookies Rolled Cookies Piped Cookies Macaroons Molded Cookies Biscotti Fried Cookies Filled and Sandwich Cookies Wafers Crackers and Savory Cookies Fillings, Icings, and Glazes Decorating Projects, including a great plan for making a gingerbread house from scratch.  Walter's book is organized around a smaller number of topics, not quite as neatly summarized. Choosing between these two books is not easy. They cost the same, they are of similar lengths, and both contain high quality recipes. Neither book gives pictures for all their recipes, but Walter's pictures are just a little better. Both books make a great virtue of giving us recipes from colleagues and friends. So much so in Malgieri's part that the book begins to look like the publication of his personal cookie recipe box. In fact, Walter's book contains a Malgieri recipe and Malgieri's book contains a Walter recipe. Malgieri gives us a very nice little page of lists of recipes by country. Oddly, this list does not include American recipes, in spite of the obviously American source for some of the recipes.  Overall, I believe Carole Walter's book (and the King Arthur book) is superior if you are really serious about learning everything there is to know about cookie baking; however, I think Nick Malgieri's book is as good a source of a wide variety of recipes, especially from international sources. And, it gives a somewhat better coverage of some specialized topics such as Springerle cookies imprinted with a German or Swiss rolling pin or mold and his very nice little gingerbread house. The single most useful theme I found in Malgieri's book was his doing some classic cookie types in several different ways, as when he does the classic Linzer cookie as a sheet, a roll, or a traditional square.  I also suspect that for the casual cookie baker, Malgieri's book may be slightly better as a simple collection of very good recipes from a wide variety of sources, including most of the famous cookies from around the world such as Madelaines, Arnhem cookies, Springerles, Zeppole, Linzer cookies, Pizzele, and Wiener Mandelgipferl (Almond Crescents).  If you love cookie baking, get all of these books. If you simply want a good source of unusual cookies, Malgieri's book will do the job for you.  Recommended. 
 best series out there on any sci-fi show, makes you think and imagine the worlds out there in the universe.  this is a good after thought of star trek 
 I can't tell you how much this album had impacted my life. Yet another band that made a big difference in my life. Daylight Dies is purely dark, melancholic and beauty at the same time. The music crafted is extremely touching to my soul. I listen over and over and over again every single day. For the first time in my life I have found another band that had helped me in my time of need. The mixture of clean and harsh vocals adds to the overall sound of the band and gave it a dark evil gothic tone. I am currently in search of dark gothic metal music because of what I am going thru in my life. Dark and evil cultures gives me the power and strength to live my life stronger than ever. In addition to the vocals the composition and song writing from both guitar player for this incredible album instills the listener with enormous amount of emotions. I am an emotional person so this affected me tremendously in my daily life. I just don't know how they came up with such a melodic and yet melancholic guitar melodies. It sticks in my head and soul and gave me a boost everytime the songs are played. Daylight Dies is my savior 
 I like part 2. I'm not a fan at all of cussing and that sort of thing, but the martial arts was great. The thing that I like the most is the fact that the former undefeated world karate champion, Mike Stone, was not only the fight coordinator, but the "head" bad guy ninja. Mike is the best karate fighter in history due to his pro career with no losses. He beat Chuck Norris, Allen Steen, and many other greats of the 60's and 70's karate era. It's good to see a former champion doing fight scenes like these. The fight scenes were more realistic that what you see in most movies like Van Damme's flicks. I think Stone did a good job as a coordinator. Watch the way mike fights, he's very technical and good at what he does 
 this gun is very good. its amazingly good for the about $20 itl b with shipping. this gun shoots about 80 feet acurately. it is very good but runs out of ammo faster than you'd think so get and extra high cap mag with the order 
 Perfect quick-look for how to run a meeting using Robert's Rules of Order.  Cuts to the chase without having to browse through pages and pages of text from the original version 
 I am enjoying my Senseo even more with the addition of the new varities. I like the Brazil Blend as well as the Sumatra 
 This is a very entertaining version of the old nursery rhyme.  My daughter loves this book, and so do we.  Its great for traveling, not too heavy like the board books.  And its just long enough to keep her attention throughout the book 
 Have purchased several bibles looking for the one that was easy to carry in my purse and to read. I found it right in my Avon brochure.  Now I have shown it to several friends who want a copy and I have referred them to  Amazon.com because Avon no longer has it.  Easy on the eyes and very  inspirational.  Thank you 
 This is one of the few Cd's I crave, if I have not heard it for awhile...I love the lush orchestration the tight lyrics and...Meshell's voice. It perfectly sums up what heartache would sound like if one could distill it musically. 
 I have my degree in English... I like reading and teaching with this version as "help" not as a substitution. It gives a clearer understanding to Shakespeare for people who have difficulty with it. 
 Didn't think it was necessary but it came bundled with the book and I figured I'd have it if I wanted it. So glad I got it. It seems simple: just keep a journal.  It's not really that simple. The pages, because they have inspirational smatterings of the book printed throughout, help keep you focused on where you are in the 12 week process. It's very useful and I would recommend anyone using the workbook to start, also get the journal. Once you're done you can always continue the morning pages in a generic journal, but to get going, this is the way to go 
 I picked up this book with much intrigue, as I myself am a football junkie. This well-written, first-person account of joining a semi-pro football team is not only inspiring, but entertaining as well. Cowser (the "Professoer", as his teammates refer to him) describes his lifelong dream of playing football after his high school and college years, and how the idea to play in the nation's most storied semi-pro team was met with much resistance. As a husband, father, professor, and now semi-pro football player, Cowser learns to balance all the duties accompanied by each role, and at times, barely by the skin of his teeth. A great book not only for people who are interested in football, but for those who long to re-live a childhood dream. Well worth a read 
 If you're looking for a scary love story, then this is the book for you! Eric has the voice of an angel but the face of a monster. When he takes his ask off people scream and run away. So, he hides himself away in the bottom of the opera house. 	Eric falls in love with a beautiful singer named Christine. Christine is forced to love him but she loves another man named Raul. Raul knows about the phantom and wants to hurt him. 	The phantom scares everybody by turning the lights off and tacks Christine to his dungeon there she sees Raul in the dungeon...but you will have to read the book to hear the ending.    
 I know, I know, the story is much more than Falco and Helena. This is the second book in the Falco series (see Silver Pigs for the beginning) and as usual, there is mystery, wit, humor and irony. The characters are very real and you are drawn into Italy (circa AD 70). The style of writing is so vivid that you can actually picture the streets of Rome, with men in togas, street vendors selling their wares, ex-gladiators hulking in the doorways and of course, Falco, going from one end of the city to the other. Falco takes care of another mission for the emperor and in so doing, Helena and he realize their mutual affinity for each other. Finally. After all those misunderstandings. And therefore, since I am a romantic at heart ... this book is about Falco "getting his girl" 
 I felt this was an extremely well written and moving little book, and I have recommended it to many friends.  In fact, I bought copies and sent them out. It made you stop and think about your own life and how we complicate and prioritize.  
 I found this book very useful in continuing not only my general education but also allowing me to read the better works of all time. I have started a book club to read all the books and discuss them.. 
 With VANISH, Tess Gerritsen reaffirms her status as a top notch thriller writer.  Once again, we have two of her heroines in deep doodoo.  Officer Jane Rizillo (sp) is now with child by her new husband, FBI agent Gabriel Dean.  ME Maura Isles is still unattached but deep in the throe of things too. Maura is preparing to do an autopsy on a beautiful young woman found in the ocean, when the woman opens her eyes and begins attacking her!  This Jane Doe is sent to the hospital where later she shoots and kills a security guard and using Maura as a shield tries to escape.  Forced to remain in the hospital she ends up in the imaging unit where Jane is scheduled for testing.  Soon a hostage situation arises and all hell breaks loose.   Gerritsen weaves her tale tightly, focusing also on the plight of a young Russian immigrant named Mila who has been sold into a prostitution type racket for rich businessmen.  How these two stories interact makes for delightful reading, with a surprise villain at the climax. A truly good novel for Gerritsen afficionados and newbies 
 Given the recent hurricanes Katrina and Rita that hit the United States in the past year, 'Stormy Weather,' by Carl Hiaasen, seemed like a timely read.  This novel tells a story of tourists, native Floridians, scam artists, and insurance adjusters as they interact in Miami after a Hurricane strikes.  Max and Bonnie Lamb are honeymooning in Disney World when the hurricane hits Florida.  Bonnie just wants to resume the honey moon festivities, but her husband, Max, an advertising rep, sees an opportunity to impress his bosses and drags Bonnie down to Miami to get footage of the destruction carved out by the storm.  Edie Marsh has been roving Florida in search of a Kennedy.  Her plan has been to seduce one, and then blackmail them on her way to easy street.  The plan never bears fruit.  After the hurricane, she sees an opportunity to work another scam and sets off for Miami with a partner named Snapper, who acquired his nickname after an unfortunate childhoot incident left him with a deformed jaw.  Edie's plans go awry when Snapper turns out to be more difficult to handle than she thought.  Augustine took a plane trip one day to discover he had spent months in a coma after the plane he was riding crashed.  He also found wealth in the form of an insurance settlement.  He no longer works, and spends his time dating the wrong women and juggling human skulls.  Just before the hurricane strikes, he learns he had inherited his uncles exotic animal farm.  After the hurricane, he has a problem:  although the weather passed, the animals are loose.  Finally, there is Skink.  This crazy wild man has great teeth and a protective streak for Florida's wilderness.  He trusts one man, Jim Tile (one of Florida's few black highway patrolmen).  He has been waiting for just the right hurricane to hit Florida, and is disappointed when this one doesn't do all he hoped for.  However, when he spies a tourist taking advantage of the destruction to shoot home movies, he hatches a new plan.  These are just some of the characters that fill the pages of 'Stormy Weather.'  Throughout the novel, they end up running into each other and confounding one another's plans.  It's an incredibly twisted plot, but Hiaasen pulls it off perfectly.  This is more than just a spirited novel.  This book allows Hiaasen to take swipes at many Florida institutions from Disney World and high rise developments to crooked politicians that sell out the environment and scam artists preying on the desperate after the hurricane.  Still, the novel is a great read and to borrow a cliche, a real page turner.  I recommend this novel to anyone that wants a fun and entertaining read that falls on the edge of crime fiction.  Elmore Leonard and Dave Barry fans should enjoy it immensely.  Existing fans of Hiaasen will delight in getting more adventures of Skink.  Overall Grade: 5 stars 
 I thought these speakers looked a little strange to begin with, but I then put the subwoofer under my desk and left the non-obtrusive satellite speakers next to my i-book and I think they look great.  The bass is deep and the treble is clear, although I really only use for music, so I can't confirm the sound for gaming.  I'd highly recommend to anyone looking for an economical system that sounds terrific 
 Black Thought and Malik B are at their best in this album. Their rap is smooth and innovative while the choruses are melodic and catchy. This album is right there with Do You Want More??!? in terms of song quality and jazz influence. Once you hear this album, you will be hooked on it for months 
 I just finished John Irving's The Cider House Rules.  (WARNING... SPOLIERS)  I really don't know what to say.  Like the end of all Irving's books, I'm a bit speechless, a bit melancholic, with a heavy weight on my heart from the tragedy of it all, and yet I can't be angry or feel manipulated because I know that's exactly how things should have happened, and it says much for Mr. Irving that he wrote it anyway, regardless of the lives he had to create for these people.  At the end, it all makes sense, and you can see the terrible arc of each character, the orbit of their life, and yet he manages to keep it hidden from you, revealing only piece by tiny piece.  The most powerful aspect of this book for me was Melony.  Brutal and vicious, anger incarnate, she came to represent everything dark and backwards about Homer's past, and in a way became the very symbol for his past, always out there, searching for you, no matter how far and how fast you run from it.  No matter how much you hide it, cover it, confuse, blunder and belittle it, it will follow you and one day, it will catch you.  Because it is part of you and you can never leave part of yourself behind, no matter how ugly and embarrassing.  And once Homer was reunited with his past, he became whole, Melony became the sunshine she'd always thought of him as, she shed light into his life, the darkness of his past had become the light that saved his life, that made him complete.   The imagery is powerful, when Melony has her breakdown in the bathroom, and she thinks of how she's never been a mirror girl, but she acts as a mirror for Homer, reflecting back what he has become, not the hero, but incomplete and corrupt.  It is only when he is brought into the light, reunited with his shadow, that he sees his true path, the path he'd been running from for all those years.  I hated her for most of the book.  I couldn't stand her.  I prayed she would never find him, and loathed at the thought of her reunion with Homer, cringed when she would get close, but it was her final return to St. Cloud's that really brought the book home and left me in tears.  Long live Melony, though she lived in darkness, always saw the truth.  I am suddenly reminded of something I read long ago, about how God must dwell in darkness, for he is the source of all light, and thus none shines upon him 
 Many mergers, acquisitions and alliances fail due to lack of preparation before, lack of care during, or lack of focus after the deal. Joining Forces is a sober, to-the-point manual directed at business leaders who want to provoke successful combinations, as well as managers and employees who have to deal with the burdens, both mental and physical, of combinations. For the past decade, corporate America has embraced M&A - often with mixed results - and the consolidation pace seems to be accelerating. But too few people inside and outside of the companies involved understand what the combination process means or how it should be handled. Organizations must be willing to focus on the psychological impacts of a combination on their employees. Joining Forces provides a rough sketch of how this can be accomplished - minus any unnecessary strategic details or legalese. We [...] recommend this book to executives, managers and employees at every level - all of whom probably will have to face the realities of corporate consolidation some day 
 "Thriller" is to my mind essential Cold Blood. I've been surviving for twenty-five years off a cassette tape dubbed from a very scratchy copy of the album, checking periodically to see if it would ever be reissued. Truly, I can't imagine what took so long. This is the perfect blend of jazz, blues, and funk, the best the '70s, or any decade, has to offer. Of course the essential track is the cover of Stevie Wonder's "You Are the Sunshine of My Life." But the straight-ahead blues of "Feel So Bad" can't be beat. Neither can any other of the tracks for that matter. If you don't know Cold Blood, there's no better introduction than "Thriller." If you do know Cold Blood but don't know "Thriller," you need to buy this CD. Now 
 I've always loved the Golden Girls and having this DVD makes every evening entertaining.  Excellent and funny and entertaining 
 This review is about a single question. Why if Borges considered himself a poet above all, and if this book contains as it does contain most of his major themes are his real readers and his real fame the readers of his stories essays and short prose-pieces ? Why is the most loved Borges not found in the poems when the poems too do at times like the stories tell stories?  Perhaps it is because the language of poetry is more dense and ambigious and breaks the flow of the story. Perhaps it is because on the nonetheless more extended palette of the story a more extensive picture can be painted. Perhaps it is because too the element of mystery so great in Borges work comes to us in a stronger way in a narrative telling? Or perhaps too Borges whether he likes it or not is in his lists and his recollections really more a figure of prose than of poetry. And perhaps and this the real paradox Borges poetry is too more prose- like than poetic in many ways. Perhaps his way of going on in such intellectual questioning fashion renders his poetry more mind- like and less in deep lyric feeling than the deepest poetry means?   I ask this as prelude to saying a few words about these poems most of which I have read, and few of which I remember.And this too is part of it. The Borges name is connected with those tales from The Aleph to Funes to Borges and I . It is less connected with any of the poems  And all of this review seems now to me somehow unfair. Borges is a great writer and his words mean more than anything written about them. Reading these poems will give so much pleasure , so much material for reflection, so many characters, stories, moods, ideas, dreams, passages of life, labyrinths, ships, coffee cups, imitations, duels in the sun and duels in the darkness, light as a metaphor and light as light, darkness as darkness and darkness as sight, worlds within and more worlds within and more worlds within and without and words as literature true literature literature of the tradition that the maker Borges makes and remakes and makes and remakes a poem.  
 In a clear and concise format Coach GP lays out some basics for improving your running by focusing on biomechanics.  Without getting caught up in a pile of technical mumbo-jumbo, Coach GP provides a simple explanation to help every runner analyze the physics of one's running style.  Yes, the training suggestions and other accouterments are there, too.  But, as a RRCA and USATF (Level I) certified coach, it is refreshing to read a different point of view on my favorite subject matter -- running.  This book could help make every reader run a litle better (maybe even faster in the process) 
 This is an oustanding album but does anyone expect anything less from ole Bocephus.Too bad country isnt like this anymore..Huh?All the tracks are good and tell the stories of everyday life.Bring back the outlaw country!! 
 Loved Marty since I saw him on Rockstar!  He's fantastic and love this cd! Can't hear it enough times.  
 Reading this book is like having a holy vision: I feel as if I should tell the world about it, but at the same time it seems so sacred and personal that maybe I should just keep it to myself and try to figure out why it came to me, into my life, into my head. The book is the story of Billy Parham, a son in a late-1930s New Mexican ranching family.  Billy traps a wolf that has been killing his father's cattle but realizes he can't kill it and has to return it to its home in the mountains of old Mexico.  Billy crosses the border into Mexico, and as he does he crosses from real life into a world of dreams, where everyone moves as if the air was liquid, where every ruin has an irretrievable story, where soot and heat and danger hang in the air, and where nothing ever goes as planned. The story is not as streamlined or as focused as its thematic predecessor, "All the Pretty Horses," but that's not necessarily a shortcoming.   The book sprawls out like a wide hot desert--curling north and south, east and west, across the present and into the past.  The writing is as good as any writing I've ever read ever, and certain metaphors and feelings will stay with you for years.  For example: the coals of a campfire seeming like an exposed piece of the core of the earth. This is a book that needs to be read.  Pick it up, and let it seep into your skin, let it open you to other worlds and peoples and ideas, and let it change you.  Let it open your eyes to the world, and to the West, and the goodness and the hope and the sadness that haunts the lives of all of us.   This is a book made of all those ineffable things that most of us just can't put into words.  But here, somehow, Cormac McCarthy has managed to do just that.  Here is the intangible, but tangible.  Here is the unnameable, but named.  Here are the thoughts you could never express, expressed. 
 I really enjoyed the book.  Being from the "Range" and previouly working in the mines, I felt like I was back there again.  The book was very discriptive and made me feel sorry for all of the women that broke ground for those that followed 
 This follow up book to the SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE (Covey), repeats a lot of the same ideas in this title.  However, it applies the ideas in a slightly different way and is a useful read who want to enforce the difficult to develop seven habits and apply them on an organizational level.  I particularly liked the way Dr. Covey handled the discussion about the two "must have" qualities of any leader -- character and competence.  The former of these two is often forgotten in today's rough and tumble business world.  While there is redundant information in this volume, I found it to have enough new information to be a worthwhile read.  I also found that the way the repeated information was presented made it interesting to review.  I don't think you can go wrong buying this book, it contains many worthwhile ideas and case histories to ponder that will spark your own creative thinking 
 Louise Penny does a fantastic job in her Still Life novel. I was blown away by the character development and the descriptives. I felt like I was there through the whole thing from beginning to end. Can't wait for her next book about Inspecter Gamache to surface 
 What an amazing collection of James Bond poster artwork!  I ordered this book when I saw it listed on Amazon and I prayed that it would be good, and it turned out to be FABULOUS!  The poster art of the Bond movies (especially the earlier ones) is legendary, and this book has taken the most memorable Bond posters and created a fabulous keepsake.  I was impressed that so many posters were included, and I especially enjoyed seeing the posters for Bond movies from around the world...it's interesting to see how different countries promote the films.  (For example, in France's promo posters for "The World is Not Enough," Sophie Marceau is positioned in front of Pierce Brosnan and Denise Richards, which is different from other versions of the poster.)  All in all, this is a wonderful book for Bond fans to add to their collections 
 This has got to be my all time favorite book...I could not put it down....I read it several years ago...  The Scenery, mystery, romance all intertwined makes for a great novel.  
 A Step From Heaven		    		 An Na								ISBN-1-886910-58-8  	 	Change is formidable! People settle into one way and it is difficult to adjust, whether it's customs, language or what you eat everyday. A Step From Heaven is about a four year-old girl who moves to America from Korea. Young Ju has a hard life in Korea and it always seems like her father is in a oppressive mood. When she hears she is moving to a place called Mi Gook she believes that she is moving to Heaven and will join her dead grandmother, when, in reality, Mi Gook is America. "I am a mountain rabbit bouncing, running. Where am I going? I am going to see Harabugi. And when Halmoni comes, I will ask her if she liked the bus called an airplane. In Mi Gook, everyone will be happy and filled with love. I am a mountain rabbit bouncing, running closing my eyes. Waiting for heaven."  Young Ju arrives in America after a long journey on a plane with her mother and father. They move into a cramped place that they rent from a Korean man they call "Uncle Tim". After she lives in America for a while, she talks to Uncle Tim about living in heaven and he tells her that this is America, which he tells her to consider "a step from Heaven".  	Young Ju has to struggle with adapting to American culture while trying not to forget her parents' Korean customs. Unfortunately, America still does not improve her father's temper and he is often drunk. Her father, or Apa, gets only low-paying manual labor jobs. Young Ju's family is poor and lives in a very plain condominium with limited space. This embarrasses her because her wealthier friend, Amanda, whom she meets once she starts school, has very involved, loving parents and lives in a pleasant upscale house. Whenever Amanda offers to drop her off at her house, Young Ju tells her she lives in one of the big, wealthy homes at the top of the hill and then, after Amanda drives away, Young Ju  walks down the hill to her own house. She pretends her parents are chefs who work all the time so her friend can't ever come over. Young Ju builds up so many lies that she finds herself trapped in them. As the book goes on, and Young Ju gets older, her family problems only grow until Young Ju's father is so unhappy and abusive to her and her mother that something must change. Young Ju's American perspective helps her realize her family might have choices which they did not have in Korea.                       	A Step From Heaven is a powerful book about immigration. The voice of Young Ju begins as a young child and grows up with the story, which I think makes the book increasingly exciting as Young Ju gets more intelligent and able to contemplate what is going on around her.Young Ju's far-from-normal childhood shows intense and even violent differences between Korean and American culture. Young Ju's father feels it is acceptable to treat his wife and child in a way that is actually against the law in America. A less drastic example of this is when Young Ju is invited to her best friend Amanda's birthday party where there will be girls and boys. Her parents will not let her attend. Young Ju's parents accuse American girls of not studying and caring only about boys. This aggravates Young Ju because she knows Amanda does study and is an  intelligent person. I think this incident is a dramatic illustration of how Young Ju's parents don't let her do many things that a normal child growing up in America would be allowed to do.   	This is the first book about a young girl moving to America that I have ever read. This book took me through a variety of emotions. At times I felt really sad for Young Ju because her family was so hard to deal with. I also felt angry at her father for treating her the way he did. I understood how uncomfortable it was for Young Ju to be in a country and not know the language and have a hard time communicating. There were two things about this book that frustrated me. The first was that ideas were not always followed through. When Young Ju was in her first year of school, she told her class that her brother died to get attention, but that topic was never brought up again and her brother attended the same school. The second thing that bothered me was that at the begining, it was incredibly hard to follow the story because quotation marks were not used when people were speaking. Korean words were also used and then not explained. Even though these parts were frustrating, I am really glad that I kept reading because I ended up loving the book. Young Ju's story is like millions of stories American immigrants could tell every day since America is a country made up of immigrants from every part of the world. I think it is important for people born in America to understand what immigrants go through to live here. This novel, which I would call cultural fiction, could be enjoyed by people of all ages, but is particularly effective for teenagers. I highly recommend this book to people who want to learn about the challanges people face when immigrating to America.  Danielle Goldber 
 This book was a concise and short fable on management that was to the point, enjoyable, and provided much usable information.  
 Start with this book. I bought this book when I was halfway through a sculpture workshop at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. I learned so much from this book. Peter Rubino demonstrates two ways to "get started" and clearly shows techniques to help you figure out some of the tough parts of sculpting a head(like the eyes.) The photographs are clear and the text is direct. This is really a terrific book. If you are interested in getting started tn clay portraiture then buy this book. I'm sure you won't be disappointed 
 He's on the right track here.He didn't write about Nixon pardoning Jack Ruebenstein ,from testifying to the HUAC ,in 1947.These men were socially and ideologically ,polar opposites.Yet,they both had a common link,the freemasons.Nixon was more than likey a big-wig in the masonic Scottish Rites and Jack Ruby a big price in the masonic jewish B'nai B'rth. How could a strip-tease nightclub owner escape the Cold War inquisition ,if he provided politicians with escourt girls? Well,very easily. Nixon may have cut a deal with Jack Ruby.If Ruby shot Oswald,Nixon would pardon him ,once he reclaimed the White-House throne,in 1964.Nixon knew if Ruby tried to explain publically the conspiracy-plot,the butterfly nets would swoop him up.So,Ruby followed along. In 1959,Nixon was the heir-apparent.Yet,America wanted something fresh and glamorous,not clammy and shifty.Nixon's quest to break the law ,in order to maintain his control over American politics,is well-known with the Watergate scandal. So, anyone who thinks that L.B.Johnson was the main-schemer in the asssassination plot,take a look at the far-right wing side. Good book  
 I am hoping as much to address the writer as to counsel the reader.  To the reader I would say that this is a very reader-friendly translation.  I like the fact that some modern expressions and idioms are used when it clarifies the text.  If you are fascinated about the early church,  or simply ancient history,  these writings are full of issues which will stimulate thought.  To the writer,  Mr. Trigg, I would ask that future volumes (for I assume you are still writing and translating) include a more extensive index for readers like me who would like to explore Origen by topic.  The index to biblical verses,  which is 12 pages long, and which you painstakingly prepared, is extensive and well done.  But the topic and name index of just 6 pages is too short.  If one wants to search for Origen's teachings on a particular topic,  it could be easier.  I would also say this.  You keep yourself in the background of this book,  I am sure out of modesty.  But I'd like to know  where you found these texts.  Are you working from the original texts or from copies.  What condition are the original texts after over 1700 years.  How did they come to be spread across Europe.  How are they preserved?  Were you permitted to photocopy the texts to translate them back in the U.S. or did you have to work there.  You mention that much of Origen's writings were lost,  but that much remains to be translated.  How much is there?  What are we missing?  Finally,  I would ask the question, "Was Origen a Moral, Vituous Man?"  What can we learn from his life?  What is the lesson of his self-castration?  What is the lesson of the austerity of his lifestyle?  He addresses Gregory as "his son."  Did he literally adopt him,  was he merely a favored student,  or did Origen not fully castrate himself?  Were the rifts he caused among the early Christian churches the result of pridefulness or spite,  or was he the innocent victim of jealous peers.  I have this feeling that Origen will be "re-discovered" someday soon and ordinary people (Christians and closet academics) will again want to know about him.  Books like The Da Vinci Code make me believe that there is a thirst for knowledge about the early church that will only become more intense with time (and with release of the movie).  I think we are at the beginning of a great upwelling of interest in this topic,  and I think that your books will help to satisfy that need.  
 I teach children's literature at a major university and this text is an ecellent source for mulitcultural literature, as well as a beatifully  illustrated text. A sure winner 
 The book Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH is written by Robert C. O'Brien. The story tells on how the rats of NIMH helped Mrs. Frisby to save her son, Timothy, from death. I think this is an excellent book because it has many details and events on Mrs. Frisby's journey to the rats.   The story takes place in about late winter on the Fitzgibbons' garden. Mrs. Frisby's family can't survive during that time. Mrs. Frisby is a very brave mouse.She is also very kind. Her problem was how Mrs. Frisby can save her son, Timothy from death. She deals with her first complications by cooperating with other animals to help others. The story starts by trying to figure out a way to save Timothy before Moving Day. So she goes on a journey to find the rats of NIMH. Nicodemus, one of the important characters in the book, is the leader of the rats an he usually find ways to figure out poblems and challenges. Mr. Ages, who is also an important character, gave Timothy some medicine and helped Mrs. Frisby find the rats. Justin, another important character, is very brave and he helped a lot of creatures like Mrs. Frisby to complete tasks and challenges. Mrs. Frisby met a lot of characters and with cooperation you can accomplish amazing things.   One thing that stands out to me was the theme. Mrs. Frisby and other characters showed a lot of cooperation and the book had a lot of events and details about bravery and education. For example, to get rid of the exterminator, the rats needed to have a lot of bravery, education and cooperation.   Another thing that really stood out to me was the setting. It made the complications interesting and the setting affected a lot on the conflict. For example, Timothy can't move away from the garden during Moving Day because he was too sick from pneumonia.  I would recommend this book to everyone because the book was really interesting and there were so many details that made it interesting. 
 Jack Welch boils down his philosophy and GE's success to a few key principles. For this the book does an outstanding job, and provides the reader with some best-practice guidelines for his or her own company. It's a much more interesting read than many management books, yet stills happens to continually reinforce GE's and Jack Welch's key concepts.   Some of the other reviews seem to reflect opinions of readers that simply don't get it. While there is some fluff in the book you will get a lot out of it if you stay focused on the few key messages. These you can take to your own company or job and have a very positive impact.  
 Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer is a beautiful story about understanding and appreciating others, and having belief in ourselves. If one really tries, they can find negativity in any story. Focus on the important lessons of faith, hope and charity Rudolph's story embodies and it will bring a little light into your life. Merry Christmas to all 
 This was the third Goddard title I read .. & I was a little disappointed. I wouldn't recommend reading this title first .. try (say) In Pale Batallions or Hand In Glove first. I've given it 4 stars because the writing/language is still superb Goddard. I deducted one star only because (personally) I found the ending a little far-fetched 
 No praise is too high for this book, which is exceptionally entertaining as well as informative. Its most attractive quality is the way that it gets behind the newspaper headlines and gives a real sense of what life is like  in the hugely different regions of Spain. Particularly interesting on the  modern Spanish Catholic church and on youth culture 
 This book is a very good guide if you are looking to take the 70-290 exam. The topics covered align with what is covered on the exam but as always, you should use several sources when preparing for an exam. 
 Just when I thought he was in a Nuevo Flamenco rut he surprises me with some guitar playing that is very nice.  I am learning how to play classical guitar, and just love to listen to someone like Ottmar who is so flawless.  I especially like the rock covers, since I grew up listening to all of them too.  But he throws in more "Ottmar type" stuff, to make this a well balanced album.  A friend of mine tells me that sometimes he just shows up, playing in coffee shops in Santa Fe, where he lives, so if you're in the area you might see him 
 The New Encyclopedia of the Occult by John Michael Greer is a monumental achievement in modern occult literature. It is a thorough, respectful, sane, well-researched and unsuperstitious reference work -- the finest of its kind ever written. I give it my highest recommendation 
 Jean-Claude Romand seems to have a well-organized life: he is a successful doctor at the World Health Organization in Geneva with a beautiful house, loving wife, two nice kids and a lover on the side. That is, until he kills his wife and children on a Saturday afternoon in January 2003, murders his parents and their dogs and attempts to kill his lover before he half-heartedly tries to commit suicide (and remove any remaining traces of the crimes). Then it becomes clear that his life was one big lie: he is not a successful doctor but a medicine student that did not finish his education and who for the past 18 years pretended to be successful, but spent his days reading in the car or hiking in the mountains while everybody thinks he is working. He "earns" a living by pretending to make profitable long-term financial deals for family and friends with Swiss banks, while he is in reality using up this money for his daily expenses. And then the moment comes when people start to realize that there is something fishy going on. All in all it is a miracle that this took 18 years...  Emmanuel Carrère reconstructed this real (!) story based on court reports, interviews, meetings and even correspondence with the murderer. This is an intriguing and terrifying glimpse into the soul (if present) of a psychopath.  
 I'm an avid book reader. I came upon Nora Roberts several months ago. I enjoy all of her books, but this tops the cake. It was just an awesome, can't put down, book 
 CAUTION: Don't read this book if you're content with your current way of being. Following the techniques and ideas from this book will virtually assure you of a fuller, richer appreciation for life!  This book is not only transformational for the soul but beautiful to the sight. The breathtaking photos add to an already amazing publication.  The book is broken down into lessons and exercises which cause you to rethink your entire life, and guide you lovingly through uncharted soul territory.  Following the 12 Success Strategies promises you a great new start in your life, free from the constraints of your past.   I've used the meditations and exercises with groups and individually and they have been equally successful. I'm transformed ... and a huge Dave Ellis fan 
 "Gorillas In The Mist" is more than just a scientific journal, it is a window into the world of nature itself. Dian Fossey paints a clear picture of her beloved mountain gorillas and brings forth her passion, through words, to save them from extinction. She went against the odds and changed the way we think about gorillas. She is a heroine in my eyes.  And to the reviewer who stated that Dian Fossey went against the laws of science by touching and becoming emotionally invovled with the gorillas, the only way that you're ever going to actually be able to really get to know something or someone is to become emotionally invovled. That's just common sense to figure that out. With that said, Gorillas In the Mist is a wonderful book and I highly recommend it to everyone 
 I love this book. I checked it out at the library, but wanted to highlight so many things, I bought it. I keep it close at hand as a great resource for marketing my company. Kim Gordon is a competent, qualified writer, and I plan on reading more of her books 
 While I enjoyed this cd when I was younger, I still find it catchy today. Its not as hard as most of the music I enjoy today but still a great listen. Its like Kerry King said: You listen to a nu metal band like Distured or Godsmack but then you crave something harder. He's right and thank god I found out about Slayer. 
 so...your lookin for something to pop into your stereo and dance to..definetly put it in this! this cd is one of my favorite Toots and the Maytals. seeing them live in Philadelphia was the best show i have ever been to! best of TATM definetly has that funky beat to get your feet movin! starts off with Funky Kingston, one of my favs, and keeps on goin through 54-46 Was My Number and finally ending with another personal favorite, Freedom Train. through this cd, you will hear my absolute 2 favorite Toots and the Maytals songs, Pressure Drop and Reggae Got Soul. truly amazing. now click "add to shopping cart" already if you want to get your groove on 
 The well researchedand terribly honest bio KAZAN by SCHICKEL opens old wounds that haven't healed yet. Stalin was a monster that admired Hitler and they signed a pact in 37 that Hitler violated. (Dominique di Santi's book  Les staliniens should be another eyeopener about  20Mil.people killed in goulags)It is obvious again reading KAZAN that the soulless HUAC and their revolting red scare should have spared the artists. Since the artists write or film the human condition they are "par la force des choses" LEFTIES. Let us  reconcile Elia Kazan and Abe Polonsky and salute both as great artists, one a realist and the other one a utopist. Knowing how hard it is to write a thought-provoking bio from my late husband's Samuel Fuller's auto-bio A THIRD FACE, my tale of writing, fighting and filmmaking, I recommend SCHICKEL's KAZAN as a great read not only for filmlovers, but for everyone interested in history and the world we live in 
 We're about to order our second copy - we think we loaned the first one out, but we can't remember to whom.  I think there may actually be a section in this book on juices for improving memory...  In any case, we're on our third juicing machine and this is the best juice "cookbook" we've found so far.  Counterbalancing the taste of raw kale juice is a culinary trick, but these folks do it 
 I used to love this movie as a child, now my Goddaughter and I watch it together. This dvd has 3 different shows on it, all with a great moral 
 Pierre Birnbaum's book has an envious quality among history books to transcend describing events by time but rather movements in thought.  He describes events from as early as the French Revolution in the same breath  as current happenings.  He is not shy to express a viewpoint that strongly  supports the French model of the Jewish Citizen.  Birnbaum is confounded  with the destiny of french Jewry because French Jews today do not all share  his vision of the Republic. This Americanization of France  (multi-culturism, etc.) and the traditions of the Sephardic immigrants  frighten Birnbaum slightly, but he does not provide firm answers as to what  exactly he is afraid of.  The book also covers many overlooked topics  through many primary sources 
 Goldin is the one of the most talented and prolific photographers of the 90's. Her work, which is based mainly on friends and lovers, is painful and delicate, striking a nerve in anyone who looks. It shows the beauty and  horror of everyday life, sometimes bringing a tear to your eye. This book  is worth every dollar 
 This is a great book, easy to understand and use as a reference guide through my first PHP/MYSQL creations. The supporting website is informative and the supporting forums are very helpful, Larry (the author) has replied to my posts a few times which led to fixing my problems quite easily. Well done Larry and thanks for your support 
 This is a perfect novel.  Fitzgerald, whom I was only recently introduced to, writes with precision and grace.  In The Bookshop she exposes the small-mindedness of people in provincial places.  In Hardborough the townsfolk are cruelly reminded of their relative irrelevance and, rather than stretch toward loftier horizons, they take aim at the book's protagonist and quash her dreams.  A piercing stab at all that is colloquial, this book is also a funny satire of small-minded people.  I'm surprised Fitzgerald is not more widely read on these shores (U.S.). What a talent 
 our five year old has this story read to him over and over.  he has memorized it now.  a great way to teach beginning sounds 
 This is a well-paced documentary, appropriately held in the secure embrace and commentary of Quincy Jones who has proven to have the deepest and widest influence on nearly all popular music.  Interviews by key witnesses from the story and event of Rock and Roll add legitimation to the international story that it has become. History at its best, may not so much be performance as it is a passionate retelling and revisiting the story in the hearts and souls of the brothers and sisters who poured their lives into the state of the art of Rock and Roll (including good coverage of Soul and R&B in all of its various expressions).  You get to taste the sights and sounds of the experience, thanks to some choice footage and video, but you get to hear how the pioneers of Rock and Roll impacted the artists that inherited it.  While the material is dated, it gives the essential information right up to the post alternative and pre American Idol age in which we find ourselves now.  Not every artist can be included and at times less significant ones are, but the the mainstream of the story remains in-tact.  For those who are willing to listen to the story and get a substantial take on how the art of Rock and Roll that has touched so many lives, this series will likely be the defining DVD overview of Rock and Roll History until something better comes along 
 I found Mr. Cristol's book a great read.  It provides an engrossing fictional account of Israel's attack on USS Liberty during the middle of the Six Day War.  The author does an excellent job of portraying highly skilled and experienced Israeli fighter pilots as being dazed by the "fog of war" and thinking they saw a high-speed, enemy destroyer when in fact, it was a slow-speed, WW2 cargo type ship -- laden with antennas.  Mr. Cristol's description of only two aircraft making several attack passes at the front of ship, and firing only 30mm cannon in few second bursts, followed by two others attacking from the rear with a couple of napalm bombs, while flying at 600 knots, makes you feel like you're in the pilot's seat.  Unfortunately, the fictional elements of this account don't hold up as well as others because photographs of attack damage clearly show the ship was hit from the front, side and rear by many rockets and 30mm cannon; i.e., the attack involved more than four aircraft, and rockets were the primary weapon.  Nonetheless, it's a good piece of story telling.  The torpedo attack is well explained too.  While reading about how seasoned Israeli Motor Torpedo Boat commanders confused the modern looking USS Liberty with an old Egyptian horse carrier, I almost came to believe it was possible.  Both vessels were cargo type ships and they both had a bow and stern.  The author's treatment of this phase of the attack is a brilliant work of fiction.  I highly recommend this book to anybody who may be interested in reading a fictional account of the USS Liberty Incident 
 These girls are extremely talented!!!  My daughter and her friends absolutely love this CD, especially track 14 (Breakaway) sung by Jacqueline. What a beautiful song and voice!!  These talented young vocalists are terrific role models for all girls. What a great CD to get the kids moving, dancing and singing.  Fantastic for a playdate, rainy day, birthday party, or car ride.  I have given this CD several times as a birthday gift.  The kids LOVE IT!!!!   
 This book is great all the way through, following Jon Shannow trying to have a break from being himself.  Jon finds himself trying to go to the other side of a large wall where men have been trying to climb and pass  with no success, the land seems to be run by lion-men, men have been  mysteriuosly turned into walking lions and soon the great beasts of the  wild themselves.  The sword of God is an interesting part in the story as  the reader wonders how sword could be suspended in the air. Also the story  has a link with Atlantis as a gateway has opened between the past and the  present, a tidal wave aproaches Atlantis with the capabilities of  destroying the past and the future 
 This is a tribute to the Dirty South.  All tracks are bangin.  The lyrics are tight as well.  This compilation includes many of the artists the South has groovin to for the longest.  From Scareface to Ludacris these artists are laying down vocals that are outstanding.  My personal favorites are Top Notch Freestyle, All I know, and Trial Time. This is a must have for anyone who digs the Dirty South 
 I am a college student majoring in education and read this book for a class.  I thought it was a great book.  I would have read it even if it was not for a class.  Carol Ann Tomlinson put a lot of usefull information about differentiating the classroom in this book.  She gave many wonderful examples.  It was also an easy book to read and easy to understand.  I recommend anyone who is a teacher or who is going to be a teacher to read this book 
 This is a very warm, youthful portrayal of an African American family and their experiences in Flint, Michiga and Birmingham, Alamaba.  The book is jovial and centering on the theme of youthfulness, it also has some corny humor. It indirectly touches on racisim. This may be a good book to introduce young children to some of the social and moral issues pertaining to racism. Getting involved in the story naturally leads one to thoughts on racism, though rather indirectly 
 The book is a revamped version of Helen Corbitt's previous cookbooks, all  of which I own.  I was, however, disappointed that it did not contain more  of her unpublished recipes. The chapter on Helen Corbitt's life will  certainly be of interest to many people.  I am a registered dietitian in  Texas and actually met the fascinating Miss Corbitt. Her fabulous recipes  for Sugar Cookies and the Flower Pots are included in this cookbook, so it  must be more than an okay book!!  These are two recipes that I constantly  use.  They are delicious and are always a hit!! Patty Vineyard MacDonald  brought Helen Corbitt's recipes up-to-date by including oven temperatures  and other information which was sometimes excluded. This is a great  cookbook, especially to introduce the present generation of cooks to  Helen's recipes, as well as to let the older generation relive her great  artwork 
 Ibn Fadlan is a diplomat, not a warrior. His mission was to represent his people and make contact with other civilizations on their behalf. But it became so much more.  Fadlan finds himself among the Northmen (aka, the Vikings), a rustic group of behemoths whose customs and way of life are as repulsive as they are odd. But, far away, their people have become plagued by a violent horde of barbarians whose behavior transcends humanity. So, twelve of the brave Northmen warriors are selected to journey to the besieged village and relieve them of this demonic threat. To Fadlan's surprise, he is also chosen. He becomes the 13th warrior and, despite his objections, joins the men on their journey.   When they arrive, the greeting is robust even though some look at them with suspicion and this plays out as an inner conflict amidst the villagers and their leaders despite the looming threat from the barbarians. Then, the mist arrives, and so does the first attack. Most of the warriors survive, some with physical scars, others with mental ones. They endure a second attack and when their numbers continue to dwindle it becomes clear that an offensive strike is necessary. Fadlan's own words describe the showdown in a way that would challenge today's most proficient adventure writers.   I can't deny the historical intrigue of this book, taken from the actual journal writings of Fadlan himself. Michael Crichton's best talents are his in-depth research of his topic and his ability to know when to step back and allow the story to tell itself. This book is where both talents shine. This is Fadlan's story in his own words and Crichton does a masterful job of guiding the reader by interjecting timely footnotes along the way. In fact, the story was so good it became a major motion picture that, in all honesty, didn't do the book justice. Even though violent conflict played a major role in the tale, the narrative was not dominated with its descriptions. Instead, more time was devoted to the mystique of the Northmen, the vast cultural differences between them and the narrator and the underlying dynamic that drove the conflict in which they found themselves immersed. It was a refreshing reprieve from today's typical explosions-and-death action/adventure tale.   Crichton is one of this generation's best, and Eaters of the Dead is one of his top-shelf works. 
 Excellent book for our team building at work. Truely a good tool that will help your group in their leadership journey of knowing themselves and seeking self improvement. 
 I am a big fan of Robert Haas!  If you are looking for a diet where you can lose weight while watching tv and you don't care whether you are actually healthy, this is not for you.  If you want a change of lifestyle that will make you fit and healthy, eat to win is a very effective.  Although the book is not specifically geared for weight loss, but rather athletic performance, I lost 18 lbs. in the first month.  Contrary to what a reviewer below said, you don't have to be an "endurance athlete".  But you do have to exercise moderately.  I run 3 miles, 4x a week.  I agree with a reviewer that the food is not the tastiest at first, but once you have been on eat to win for a while, your tastebuds adjust, and the junk food you were eating becomes very unappetizing.  Try sticking to it strictly for a month, while exercising moderately and you will be glad you did.  After that, you can go on to level two and three where you are allowed things like a beer or glass of wine and olive oil, etc.  Then it is no longer a diet but a lifestyle change 
 This book is great for those of us who are just "discovering" that we're Jewish.  Easy to understand language; it's as if the author knew what the reader was going to ask next and then answers it.  Terms and pronunciations are included as well.  All the basics about the Jewish religion.  Good reading for teens and pre-teens as well.  
 Debra Rienstra has mastered a difficult literary form.  She is a terrific essayist.  The individual chapters of Great With Child are not only thoughtful and occasionally profound (as I had expected), but she has also managed to engage me with her wonderful gift for writing.  Each chapter, I think, stands by itself as a well-executed piece of what good writing can be.  A book about pregnancy wouldn't ordinarily be my first choice for casual reading, but I'll read a book any time that's as good as this one, even if it is about pregnancy!  I hope Debra writes again soon.  She has a literary voice that ought to be heard again 
 This is my personal favorite of the 3 Firm Basics, with Tracy Long an excellent instructor.  As a 50-something (aging baby-boomer), I want to keep in shape, but am not a "jock" with nothing to do but work out.  Alternating the 3 tapes in this series according to how I'm feeling that day, capably achieves my goals, although I've begun some of Tracy's more advanced routines when I've felt I needed an additional challenge.  I work out faithfully 5-7 days a week.  Even doing 1/2 the work-out per day helped me maintain when I was working, although doing the whole 45 minute routine daily helps to ready me for more advanced work-outs.  It definitely improves my quality of life, and makes me feel strong, and I love the convenience of not even having to leave the house!  I've recommended it to friends and have been disappointed that it is only available right now second-hand.  The Firm's ownership change with their limited offerings have hampered my ability to get the tapes I've wanted to share, and they seem to only want to sell their new box, rather than work with previously satisfied customers 
 This is the most well written, yet challenging book I've read for a long time. His theology, as well as his sensitivity to lay language, is unsurpassed.  I've recommended it to many and given away several copies.  It is gives hope to those of us who can't relate to the super conservative or fundamentalist interpretation of a relationship with our Creator 
 David Gemmell, in Stormrider, has written another fun piece of fantasy and concluded the Rigante series quite nicely. It is packed with action, intrigue, and magic. I can't stop reading Gemmell's books and hope that he will write forever.  Kaelin has found the love of his life and fought for her, and the Rigante, to live free from the rule of the Varlish. But there is another evil lurking in the land and stealing the magic from it. Will the Rigante have to unite with the one person they hate in order to rid the lands of this new evil?  Gaise Macon has been training to become a leader in the Varlish military, but he always has to watch his back from people he thinks are on his side. He will make many tough decisions but their will be one that could lead to the death of many or the salvation of the Rigante.  Both the Drenai and the Rigante series by David Gemmell are excellent. Every novel stands on its own, but they come together to create some great reading. The Rigante series finishes with interestingly and leaves the reader satisfied but at the same time wanting more. Keep writing David Gemmell and I and everyone else will keep reading. Everyone enjoy the last book of the Rigante series 
 This album was dropped like a gazillion-ton rock and roll meteor onto the world in 1980.This album changed the ear of the new decade,and set the bar so high,it has yet to be me met again. While cited for being over the top sexist, every rocker girl I knew understood it was just saying out loud everything that was being said and done while the chase was being plotted. All part of the game,and this was perfect background music for the whole ritual. Yes,it's about booze,dr#gs and women.  Regarding this remastering job, it's one of the best I have ever heard. Sounds like this is being played live,instead of being a studio effort,and I mean this as an absolute compliment. We KNOW how much studio time and effort went into this album,but for this to NOW sound like a perfect live recording?! WOW! If you own any version other that this, throw it away and re-up today. 
 This is a good replacement carafe.  The original was nicer though, to bad it shattered.  This one fits well but has a little drip when pouring, if you perfect your pour you can get it to not drip.  This will break, as mine is already in the garbage.  Amazon's price is the best.  Love the Free Super Saver Shipping! 
 Dr. Kirschenbaum presents sounds principles of weight reduction and management.  His text identifies critical factors for successful weight loss and maintence including low fat eating, self-monitoring and daily exercise.  His gentle yet persuasive approach is both motivational and effective.   I have lost 8 and a half pounds in 10 days on the low fat, low sugar approach he suggests without hunger or cravings.   The self-monitoring is educational and has improved my self-awareness of my own eating patterns.   My only regret is that I did not find his text many years ago to enjoy the increased energy and feeling of self-confidence I am enjoying now.   Now, I am greeting each day with a feeling of elation.   This book has changed my life 
 It's a very nice CD with all the songs from 4 Barbie movies.  My girls love this CD so much that we listen to it whenever we can.  I also wish that the dialog from the movie can be removed from the first two songs, but my kids don't care.  It's worth to buy if you love the songs from Barbie movies 
 I am a dislocated Appalachian that took the food bull of Seattle by the horns, but that was before this book. Now I am sure I will be THE Seattle epicure-genius among my circle with this book tucked into my collection. I am amazed by the variety of food resources, from chocolatiers to ethnic markets, where to get the greatest baguettes. I also love the anecdotal sections on the pioneers/owners of some of these purveyors.  Oh, and recipes! There is humor, knowledge, pleasure, and respect written here, and a love for Seattle and the food treasures it offers.  Buy it 
 You make one up. Duh 
 Great Textbook, good explanatory sections.  Instructor's book not as clear as needed with daily plans, I found it a bit cumbersom, wrote my own class plans and outline.  But the textbook was concise, and constructed in a good methodic manner that allowed personal adaptation 
 This book is for anyone who is serious about achieving long term wealth commensurate with their risk capacity. Mark Hebner's 12 Step Plan is a sound and prudent investment strategy. It is the only proven method with enough historical return and standard deviation data to back up the claims. The Illustrations are a work of art. This book will travel between my financial library and coffee table. 
 The Seventh Seal (Ingmar Bergman, 1957)  So I've finally seen The Seventh Seal, Ingmar Bergman's most famous film and, perhaps, one of the most famous films ever created. And I have to say, while I found it interesting, well-written, and occasionally amusing, I ended up thinking that my view of the film was somewhat tainted by the constant praise to which the film is subjected; in other words, that it didn't live up to a level of hype that, perhaps, no movie (with the possible exception, of course, of the immortal Night of the Lepus) could ever hope to.  The much-abbreviated version of the plot known to most-- that Antonius Block, a knight (Max von Sydow), returned from the Crusades, challenges Death (Bengt Ekerot, fresh from playing Hamlet) to a game of chess-- is hopelessly simplified. There is a great deal more to this film, and anyone expecting ninety-six minutes of chess playing is probably going to be quite confused. Block and his squire Jons (Bergman regular Gunnar Bjornstrand) have recently gotten back from a decade away, and Block is eager to return home to his wife Karin (Inga Landre, still alive and working as she nears the age of eighty). Death appears to Block, and the game of chess is proposed as a way for Block to buy time to get back home. The chess match acts almost as a framing piece; the journey's the thing here. Block and Jons, as fine a team as Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, have learned to suffer one another over the past decade, like an old married couple; Jons, however, an avowed and vocal atheist, has noticed his lord's crisis of faith, and spends much of the film subtly manipulating Block to his way of thinking. Block, meanwhile, is seeing more than enough in a Swedish countryside ravished by the Black Plague to make him think that God may, in fact, be dead. The clergy to be found in the film are all bombastic buffoons, and a good number of them are outright evil; Block and Jons, in their own ways, are determined to do right by the few souls they encounter (in contrast to the clergy's scope, which is the entire country, or so it would seem). The two of them gather a small band together, all headed for Block's castle; the chess game unfolds piecemeal as the journey continues.   There is, certainly, much to be praised about this movie. The acting is good all around; von Sydow overplays a bit, but one gets the idea that that was stage direction straight from Bergman. The camerawork is well-done. The sound is a bit rough, but I'm more than willing to blame that on the transfer, or my particular copy of the disc. Where the film usually treads the line of greatness is in Bergman's understated script; Block's understatement and Death's civility are excellently counterpointed by Jons' brashness.   An enjoyable film, and an exceptionally good one. While it may be all that, you might still have to buy the bag of chips yourself. *** 
 As someone who is long out of high school, I thoroughly enjoyed reading Wuthering Heights (and properly this time!)  One literary critic I read somewhere said that the sheer number of characters is deliberately confusing.  Certainly, it doesn't make it any easier that there are two Catherines.  Nor the frequent use of surnames, rather than first names and vice versa, quite interchangably.  Like many reviewers before me I found many of the characters thoroughly odious and of moral outrage.  Why Nelly Dean doesn't just leave them all is a mystery to me.  One thing I found of great help to my understanding of the book was to paste a clearer copy of the family tree to the inside-front cover of the book.  I found this on page 308 of The Scribner Companion to the Brontës by Barbara and Gareth Lloyd Evans.  The marriages and births are clearer and far more readable.  I also felt the need to take notes from a number of other literary critical works on the book to get my head around the whole plot, the characters, themes, imagery and Haworth landscape.  Perhaps for the most serious among us there is a concordance to Wuthering Heights!  This is great for those doing a paper on some certain theme found in the book, who want to find all the references to that topic all in one place.  If you are wanting to find it:  A Concordance to Brontë's Wuthering Heights by C. Ruth Sabol and Todd K. Bender, Garland Publishing, Inc. New York/London, 1984, Garland Reference Library of the Humanities Vol. 428.  Thoroughly recommended.  It only loses a star because I would have enjoyed something slightly less complex, which is really just a reflection on this poor reviewer, rather than Emily Brontë 
 This is one of those movies you can watch and enjoy over and over 
 I have loved this album, and Joni, for more than thirty years now. In this and many times in the two preceding and next three albums, she is giving us, and is capable of giving us, wreckage and craziness and joy straight from her marrow. The poetry of "Blue Boy" or "The Priest", amongst others, is similar in a way to Elizabeth Bishop or Robert Lowell, and just as unfettered by commercialism. It's funny, just how un-commercial this music sounds, now, and how uncaring Joni the artist auteur is. She is focused on other, higher things, here, and it always gives me goosebumps hearing how unabashedly un-self-conscious she is, a trait she shares in common with fellow Canucks Neil Young and Gordon Lightfoot. Essential music this is, if you would know the folk and very LIBERAL bedrock from which all contemporary music, including hiphop, is builded 
 The new wave revival continues unabated into 2005 and indeed, it seems to be growing more popular still with the profusion of bands flying its flag today, one of its main standard bearers being L.A.'s Metric.  Old World Underground, is in a word, fun.  A perfect soundtrack to a night out with your favourite mascara wearing new wave f(r)iends (boys AND girls), it boasts instantly hummable, danceable and memorable dancefloor fillers with enough different styles and ideas in the mix that Metric can never be accused of being a one trick pony.  IOU kicks off proceedings in fine style, a guitar led tune in the vein of Elastica or Sleater-Kinney, the band keeping their full arsenal of keyboard and synth stylings under wraps until later on.  Succexy and Dead Disco are among the best tracks on the album, taking the listener on a hook laden journey through a Saturday night, defying even the most hardened cynic at the corner of the dancefloor not to at least nod along in appreciation.  The infectious dance-ability of these tracks must surely bring the band to a much wider audience and while there is much more to be enjoyed on this album these will be the songs that catapult Metric to greater recognition.   Of course there is much more to this album than dancefloor fillers, the blissed out electro-ballad that is Calculation Theme or the beautifully minimalist Love Is The Place being perfect music for the morning after, the former not sounding out of place as a Cardigans album track, the latter using only one guitar and vocals in a My Bloody Valentine wistful-yet-happy manner.  The only point that may rankle with a listener is the running order of the album, which can be a tad stop-start as momentum is never allowed to build. The bouncy, and extremely fun pop sensibilities that comprise half the album can rarely take flight as their more sedate tracks are sandwiched in between, giving the album too many peaks and troughs to be truly appreciated.  That said, in an age of MP3 players and CD writers, a quick DIY shuffling of the playlist and voila!, the album can build up, peak and then drift the listener back to earth with a satisfied smile...  Just like the best nights out... 
 Molly O'Neill has blended two of live's pleasures, food and baseball, into a warm, touching family memoir.  The ingredients for this fine book include:  good writing, "NY Yankees," cooking, interesting family dynamics.  There is much here to appeal to a wide readership.  Enjoyable reading all around 
 This has diagrams similar to the ones that Japanese crochet books use.  My mom taught me the basics but I was able to create projects by simply looking at the diagrams in her Japanese crochet books...without the ability to read the text!  This book is also similar to the "Magic Crochet" magazine which is no longer in circulation (what a shame) 
 I bought this movie for a friend for Christmas and ended up watching it with them.  I'm not a big Woody Allen fan, but the story was very well done and kept me interested.  What I really loved was all the music.  All around a good movie.  Enjo 
 Every first-time reader of "Finnegans Wake" faces a simple question -- are you going to jump headlong into Joyce's prose and swim through the murky waters alone or are you going to follow a guide?  And if you follow a guide, which one?  I tried three on for size -- Campbell, Tindall and Bishop -- and it was much like taking a roadtrip with three backseat drivers who couldn't agree on the correct air conditioning setting, never mind the correct route.  So I quadrupled my reading load and, worse, was spending only a quarter of the time reading the most beautiful prose stylist in the history of the English language and the rest on fairly mundane writing.  About 240 pages in, I decided to ditch my fellow passengers at a rest stop and finished the journey with Joyce alone.  I can't claim to understand most of what happened the balance of the way -- if, in fact, anything actually *happens* in The Wake, but the experience was rapturous.  It was like floating through the most beautiful dream of my life, occassionally laughing at a brilliant Joyce wordplay, sometimes recognizing phrases appropriated by other writers, but mostly just drifting off into the language, half-asleep in a literary isolation tank.  Yes, I'm sure that there are English PhDs who will scoff at my journey ... they'll say that I never actually read The Wake because I didn't read it closely enough to understand every phrase.  Others will congratulate me on the first run and will say that it better prepares me for a more serious read through again.  Well, I finished those guide books afterwards and I can't say that they really add much to the experience. Joyce jokes about the good red herrings of the book and from draft to draft he clearly took great pains to make the prose more murky.  I tend to agree with Bishop's analysis that Joyce's self-proclaimed book of the night is not supposed to be deciphered, it's supposed to be experienced in a semi-dreamscape.  I would posit that the cottage industry of Joyceans has, in fact, built a wall around The Wake.  If it's not enough to read a 628 page novel in semi-English, but rather you must study it closely like the most learned theologians interpret Greek translations of the Bible, then this novel has been taken away from the masses and become the sole province of the academy.   So what did I take away from The Wake?  That the English language can be far more beautiful than we commonly assume;  that I must read Vico; that Joseph Campbell's theories of mythic cycles came directly from Joyce; but most of all, that the novel didn't have to begin its slow decent into irrelevance.  Joyce mapped a new course for narrative fiction, one that plumbed the depths of the subconscious, one that could not possibly be overtaken by motion pictures or television.  The one third of our lives lived in the dark are filled with beautiful and terrifying images we'll never comprehend.  Joyce dared to put those images into words.    It's a shame that, in a quest for literal understanding, too few have attempted to experience Joyce's journey in the same way that you experience the dreamstate ... alone 
 This is one of several Hemingway books I have come to read, actually in this case, listen to.  I loathe idling about so I decided while I wait, wherever that maybe, I would listen to an audiobook. I prefer the unabridged versions which in this case was quite long.  I found the subject matter mysteriously complex ( who doesn't find love  complex ) yet simplistic in it's exposition true to Hemingway's style.  Each character is carefully developed and his/her relationships meticulously crafted and consistent with their dispositions.  Hemingway explores humanity and allows us a glimpse of it in the most trying circumstances....love and war. It really is very hard to discuss the book without ruining details and the outcome so I will stop here.  I would suggest getting the audicopy on ipod and listening to it on your next long journey overseas 
 While i love this entire series and consider it one of my favorites, this is probably the best of the bunch. Here, at the beginning of his career, King created the centerpiece of his future works. Nearly all of King's books fit into the general framework of the Dark Tower and a few are directly related. It is telling that King works to include stealthy references to the series in many of his books.  But why is this the best of the series? It's hard for me to express. The writing conveys such an environment of grit, suffering, and entrapment for the ultimate anti-hero, Roland Deschain the last gunslinger, to fulfill his ultimate purpose within. The greatest success of this work lies in its genesis of this character. It is only because of King's surpriesing success at creating the dramatic and complex persona of his morally questionable protagainist that the, at first,apparently unwieldy and daunting task of writing such an expansive series was permitted to reach its final completion.  This book, and the series as a whole,is a great attempt at recreating the epic nature of life's journey towards destiny, purpose, and finally, its end 
 Not many people realize that over 50 million Russians, Ukrainians, Belorussians, etc. lost their lives unnaturally at the first half of the 20th century. This book, however unbalanced by its constance reference to the Orthodox Church and other mistakes, should be applauded by taking this grim statistic and analyzing its effects on the minds and mentality of the Soviet people. These facts have been hidden behind the Iron Curtain far too long for Westerners to be so blissfully ignorant. Bravo to Catherine Merridale for writing this excellent book 
 So often with digital answerers you read reviews about poor voice quality with comments like "it sounds like people are talking underwater."  Not so with this hi-tech phone/digital answerer released by Panasonic in 2006. I ordered a KX-TS620B in a rush over holidays after my old-syle Panasonic phone/cassette answerer finally quit having 14 years of use.  My new digital answering system sounds every bit as good as tape, both with the outgoing and incoming messages. Panasonic uses enhanced digital voice technology with its higher-end phones and it truly makes a difference.   The only tradeoff with this unit is a mere 15 minutes of record time.  That's not a big problem for me but it may not be ideal for someone who receives a lot of messages before getting a chance to review and erase.  This can be done remotely from a touch-tone phone, however.  All the other features with this phone/answerer are slick and easy-to-use.     If high digital voice quality is an important factor for you--this is the phone to buy. 
 I have a six year old son who loves this book, especially the pictures.  There are a few pages that have extravagant landscape scenes with tons of stuff going on and we play a "where's waldo" type of game to find all the different types of fruits and veggies and also find the different snack posse team members.  He absolutely loves it.   The story is fun and not preachy at all and it's good to see my child with good eating habits on his mind.  What more can I ask for 
 this movie should enthrall you and keep you on the edge of your seat for the extent of the movie.  The ending is the most psychologically intense since I saw Fight Club and you will agree when you watch it. Expect the unexpected and enjoy this underrated thriller masterpiece 
 I've tried 4 recipes so far and my whole family loved the all.  They are very easy to make taking only about 30 minutes.  I can't wait to try more recipes 
 Dimple Lala is one of the most developed charactors in a book I've ever read! She is so amazingly powerful, well not at first but later she is. I could relate so much to her, always feeling in the shadow of her best friend, afraid to fall in love cause she dosen't love herself. I just love this book and recomend it to everyone, unless you have fears about homosexuals. Then you may want to step back from this book. 
 I just love this workout, it really gets you sweating. It's a great workout for beginners as well, not too fast or complicated. I just started working out with The Firm System, and plan to use it to get back into shape. You can always purchase more DVD's to keep you motivated. I recommend this product to anyone who want to get into or stay in shape.       
 First, I want to say that the ONLY books that I buy are written by Nora Roberts/J.D. Robb!  I am so addicted to her books that I have a really hard time putting them down once I start reading.  I just finished reading Valley of Silence.  WOW!  I loved it!  I started with the very first one in the trilagy and flew through it.  I couldn't wait until the second came out.  Then time seemed to drag until I could get my hands on the last one so that I could find out what happened!  I loved the story.  I am not really into vampires and witches and things like that, but the way that Nora tells a story is so captivating and I will read anything that she writes.  I have never been able to find an author that has such a wonderful way of telling a story that keeps me interested.  I am always on the look out for a new book.  I can't wait to get my hands on Angel's Fall.  The excerpt at the end of Valley of Silence had me wanting to know what was going to happen next.  Why was Reece the way that she was.  WOW!  Great job holding my interest once again.  Ready for the next IN DEATH so that I can get my dose of Eve and Roarke 
 this is a nice hat for women looking for short brims instead of the longer mens brims on most hats.. I own 2 of these and wear them everyday, to keep my hair in control due  to my Jeep window being down, while I deliver mail. Good fit 
 While Hanging Out With The Dream King isn't exactly what you would consider a biographical work, it does come across as such because of the order of and nature of the interviews in the book. It starts out with an interview with Mr. Gaiman and then the proceeding interviews kind of chronologically follow his career from Neil's early journalist days through his time working on the comic The Sandman and beyond. The book concludes with an another interview with Neil to sort of book-end everything together.   My self personally, I really enjoyed all the interviews, wich kind of give you an insight on how Mr. Gaiman works and his relationships to the people he has worked with over the years.I especially enjoyed the interviews with all the various Sandman artists. After reading this book I felt compelled to break out all my Sandman graphic novels and read them again. ...I definitely recommend Hanging Out With The Dream King to any and all Neil Gaiman fans out there. You will not be dissapointed! 
 This book is good for a quick jump into the realm of good murder  mysteries. The stories can be read in 15 to 25 minutes, for those of us  without enough time to fully appreciate a full length novel. They are  however engaging, fun, and nicely thought out. The title story (The Under  Dog) is the longest and in my mind the best, as Mrs. Christie had more  pages for charater development and story twists. Our favorite detective,  Hercule Poirot is featured in all of the stories with multiple appearances  of Captain Hastings. Each story had me wondering until the last page.  Definately recomended as a before bed reading 
 My four-year-old daughter first got this book as a loan from the local library, and liked it so much that I bought her a copy to keep.  Kids love Sue's free-spirit character and are fascinated by the alligators with whom Sue grows up and regards as her siblings.  The book is broken up into three or four chapters, all colorfully illustrated.  Because the book is a bit long for younger children, I find it best to read only one or two chapters at a time.  Highly recommended 
  I'm reluctant to read books on recent history as I believe it is harder to achieve that difficult, yet noble goal called objectivity. I'm glad I overcame this reluctance and decided to read this well-informed account of the Clinton Presidency by former Washington Post reporter John Harris.  Harris is to be commended for providing a  well-rounded view of the man and his time as president. Harris presents a very contradictory man who was both strong on some fronts and weak on others, like any person. His presidency experienced successes and failures which along with the man himself and those around him, are all well-covered in this fluid narrative.  	As Harris stated, Bill Clinton came to office in 1993 with high ideals and lofty goals, but that idealism led to problems for a president not yet fully mature in the workings of Washington politics. Harris points out that Clinton was of two minds politically: one side supporting the noblest and most idealistic of goals and trying to implement those ideas; the other was more realistic and understood that you can't get everything you want. This second side won out and helped Clinton mature into his presidency and most importantly, helped him to achieve some very notable accomplishments. Clinton's first years were marked by overly ambitious goals which resulted in numerous setbacks, culminating in the Republicans taking control of Congress after the 1994 election.		  	But Clinton's ability to overcome obstacles and emerge even stronger became quite clear during and after the showdown with Republicans over the government's shutdown, the impeachment scandal, and his ability to still get things done on both the domestic and foreign fronts even during his last years in office when most presidents wonder into obscurity.  Harris still points out the mistakes and missed opportunities of his presidency. 	 	Harris also provides us with valuable insights into how the president worked. For example, how he had to weigh every angle to a question of importance, considering every possibility or consequence of a decision. This can be both a strength and weakness. He worked long hours, but not on a strict, disciplined schedule. As Harris also astutely observed, he possessed an activist mind and conception for the role of president, yet constantly displayed a more passivist approach to actual governance in terms of leading the way on an issue and in trying to shape events. As Harris mentioned, he was a natural peacemaker and liked consensus and conciliation over conflict.  	Another plus to this book is the detailed look at some of Clinton's inner and outer circle of advisors and cabinet members, people like Al Gore, Lloyd Bentsen, Dick Morris, Robert Rubin, Robert Reich, Leon Panetta, Erskine Bowles, Harold Ickes and so many others who came and went during his two terms. But of course the most obvious person to focus on is his wife. Hillary shared his obsession for politics and its possibilities for achieving and advancing their set of political values. Perhaps because of this strong common bond and natural respect for the other's abilities and talents were they able to endure the challenges to their marriage, on his part for his unfaithfulness due to his propensity for succumbing to temptation, to put it politely.  	Harris's book is extremely well written and very insightful. Clinton was one of the most charismatic political figures of the twentieth century and he continues to be an active force. Bill Clinton endured incessant struggles, yet emerged stronger and more confidant; he was a survivor. While not an academically rigorous book in ways, it still provides enough information to give you a good, balanced picture of the Clinton presidency and the characters who were involved. A good read 
 I've seen (heard--whatever) Klute spin a few times, and he is unbelievable. Mostly dark , hard stuff (which is my taste--see his Breakbeat Science Exercise mix CD). This orginally produced music by him brings out some different tastes I didn't realize he had in him. I'm not going to get into his "collage of genres" cd (#2) [revision--I actually wrote this review before I had given disc #2 a full listen. There is some really good sh** here--especially for you breaks/ party dj's--that would probably never think to look in a D&B's producers direction for such trax--check "Artificial Sense" and "Overchoice"], but cd #1 has a lot of flavours on it. I'm not a big 2 step fan, but "Part of Me" is completely addicting. "Problem Reaction" and "Tacky"--("Ether" falls somewhere in between 2 step & jungle)-- are typical Klute standouts, and only he and High Conrast could even get me in the 2 stepping groove (if you can call it that). According to silly people who don't have a clue about music, D&B is fading as a genre. But w/ more producers like Klute (and High Contrast) around, it will be here to stay. 
 I think this movie is great! it first came out when i was 2, and i remember all the time i wanted to watch it. just last year i saw it in the first in 9 years! all those GREAT song like "Too Much" and "Stop!". i also had "Spice Girls: One Hour of Girl Power" and my mum and dad used to put it on when i was born! i still reckon the spice girls are great and i cant belive that i forgot all about them! My Cousin just reminded my about them at my other cousins birthday. my favourite song would have to be "Who Do You Think You Are 
 I listen to everything in the wide gamut of music from Marylin Manson to Nick Drake and out of my 1500+ CD's this would be in the top 5 albums ever recorded. I bought it as an impulse purchase one day after someone that I worked with said it was a great album. I was totaly blown away by it, it is dirty and dark and kicks out attitude like Pantera couldn't muster. If you don't feel the need to move your body while listening to 'Hip Shake' up loud you must be either dead or deaf as it is possibly the most infectious rock n'roll, dirty, dark, back room blues club, over driven amp sound you will ever hear.  Just buy it and when you listen to it forget it is the rolling stones and don't compare it to anything you have heard from them as nothing on 40 licks or the radio is on there, but you have to listen to the album from begining to end it is not a singles album, it is a night out in what rock n' roll was meant to be. I would give my left arm to have heard this whole album live at the time it was recorded in some dirty little bar somewhere in the south of france 
 I love bad girls very much that i had to get the dvd you now 
 In my twenty-one years as a teacher of theater, I have found few books as  valuable as this one.  The book provides hundreds of interesting and  challenging improvisation situations which have functioned to tap the most  creative impulses my students have to offer.  The situations have inspired  my student actors to explore complexities of character conflict and  motivational objectives that they don't often realize exist.  I also found  the chapter on using improvisation in play direction very worthwhile.  I  now use the author's suggestions during rehearsals for every play I direct,  and my actors benefit greatly.  No collection of books on acting,  directing, or teaching theater is complete without this one.  I give it my  highest recommendation 
 I absolutely love every cookbook that Holly Clegg has come out with and I have every one.  This latest book is so informative and with such delicious recipes.  I have recommended it to all my family and friends.  I was lucky  enough to be at the book signing of this latest book this past Saturday in  Baton Rouge and I actually have all of my cookbooks by her signed.  My  advice to everyone is to buy this latest cookbook.  You won't be sorry 
 this is a good book for anyone interested in auto safety. for the record though, Mr. Nader's explanation that the wheels "tuck under" is impossible. otherewise the book is right on the money.  as weight is shifted from the inside wheels to the outside wheels during cornering the chassis presses outside wheel into the pavement.   I have raced RC 1/10th scale rear motored RWD cars for about 8 years. the wheels on the Corvair are simply too small to carry 2/3 of the wt of the car. the wheels on the beetle were large enough to blunt the weight differance between the front and rear wheels.  the Corvair has 2 design defects:  1. the car has a natual oversteer bias. if a customer puts the same amount of preasure in each tire the car will have a very massive oversteer bias.  2. because the tires are too small to carry the weight handily, when the car gets sideways the tires get pushed aside and rims will make contact with the road, dig in and trip the car and cause it to roll over. I know how this works because I have seen it 1000s of times and I have obseved rim damage to new rims especially the rear rims many times over the years.  someone close to Nader working for GM must have planted this idea of the wheels tucking under in Mr. Nader's mind since the truth would be much more damaging than the "tuck under" theory.  the basic rules of stability are:  the longer the track, the wider the wheelbase the lower the center of gravity and the closer the center of gravity is the the middle ot the track and wheelbase the more stable the car will be.  other interesting reads are The Book of Expert Driving by ED Fales and Power Under Control Ch. 8-13  Pierre Bourgon Cornwall, ON  
 Eau de' Vonnegut is discernable in each Monkey House short story. They are simple and conceptual, Vonnegut doesn't bog down his stories with specifics. These are meditations: Brief, fun to read, interestingly cast plots. It has been a long time since I read (or  watched) Slaughterhouse 5, or Cat's Cradle. I remember how familiar but demented character types were thrown into oddly improbable circumstances, with surprising outcomes. My favorite story was "Who Am I This Time". Or, perhaps it could be "Harrison Bergeron", or even "Welcome to the Monkey House"... you'll understand how hard it is to choose a favorite, as you randomly skip from the end of one short story to the beginning of another 
 Teens and adults alike will be inspired and moved by this most amazing book.  I'm very inspired by others who rise above the challenges of life-not in a sugar coated way, but in a real, down to earth way.  The endings are not always perfect, but they are always inspiring.  This book brought me to tears, for the sadness of some young people's trials, but mostly for the way each of these amazing young people are changing the world with their actions.  They are the light of hope.  (Okay, so I'm corny!)  It really doesn't get much better than this.    From a girl who finds herself terribly lonely after a move, to a boy who loses a limb, to a boy from a gang, to battling illness or drugs, and many more, each a different story, a different challenge, the teens in this book represent everyone. Kudos to Jackie Waldman!  If you work with teens, if you are a teen, if you're related to a teen, if you were a teen:  read this book.  Be inspired.  And then share it.  I'd give it ten stars if I could.  Highly recommended!  Aunt Laya  Author of the self help book for teens "You Don't Have to Learn Everything the Hard Way"  
 "Forever Young", "Rock & Roll Queen" and "Hide and Seek" are my favourite songs 
 I had borrowed this CD from a co-worker a couple of years ago and was so thrilled to find it available here. Mario is wonderful and so easy to listen to.  If you like Josh Groban, Russell Watson, Andrea Boccelli than you'll love Mario Frangoulis 
 My 12-year-old picked up this book and devoured it in one sitting, reporting it helped him conquer some of the problems he had encountered as a recreational cartoonist.  He especially enjoyed the section devoted to writing.    This is a gorgeous book - hardcover with color on every page.  Great art, lively text, and very inspiring -  it works as both a "how-to" and personal cartooning cheerleader.   
 Linking learning and performance is filled with the kind of rigor that all of us Hodges-junkies have come to expect and look forward to.  What Hodges maps out is not easy.  It requires soul searching and a lot of work.  But standing up in front of a CFO with a bullet-proof case for corporate learning makes it all worthwhile 
 I purchased this book for my daughter and daugher-in-law for their first babies born this year and they have found it so useful and regularly refer to it.  Not only is it great for new mothers but as things have changed so much since my children were born Grandma has used it a lot as well.  I first purchased What to Expect When You're Expecting by the same author and likewise it is a great book with lots of info 
 Kershaw is God. This book is the bible for any scholar of the Third Reich 
 Bright does nothing to insult or diminish the traditions of religous persons; nor does he ask those with pure scholastic interest to carry beliefs in line with any given tradition.  Instead, he articulates the scripture's statements of history and infuses external sources in a lively narrative reading that provides much insight into the history of Israel. Hebrew Scripture is not dismissed with harsh disregard for its riches; external evidence is not dismissed either.  Tensions are allowed to remain and presented to the reader 
 Dr. Dalrymple repeats a thesis that few seem interested in hearing these days - that the problems of the underclass are not problems of racism, or injustice, or lack of opportunity, but of values.  These people are not poor, in the traditional sense of that word; they are instead trapped by extreme but logical application of the values of the outside world.    Like those few other commentators who have looked at this issue from this vantage point, Dalrymple understands that the problem is not "their" values, but "our" values.  We cannot expect the underclass to, for example, form stable marriages unless the mainstream society not only reduces its own divorce rate (from something like 50% to less than 5%), but also emphasizes in its writings and teachings that stable marriages are a vital part of society and that all of us have a stake in creating and maintaining them.   (Thus, Dalrymple might predict that, for example, as long as abstinance education remains "controversial", we will have an underclass.)  Every serious student of social policy needs to read this or another Dalrymple book.  If nothing else, his books make it very difficult to keep saying that the problems of the inner cities are due to "racism" 
 I recommend this book to anyone who has come from a dispensational background and is interested in eschatology (end-times).  It is very well written with short chapters that don't bog the reader down with difficult theological jargon.  Exposes the reader to a historicist (typically Seventh Day Adventist) interpretation of end-times scriptures that will challenge you to dig deeper into the Word of God with a critical eye 
 Not having heard Altan before, I took a chance on LOCAL GROUND, convinced by those who said this was one of their  best, and I'm certainly glad I did -- the format is songs with lovely vocals by Maread Ni Mhaonaigh, who also plays fantastic fiddle, alternating with instrumentals, lively toe-tapping jigs and medleys of reels.  I listen to all sorts of music, I'm not immersed in this style, and so I lack the knowledge to compare this album to other traditional Irish music.  I do know Altan has the reputation of being the finest of its kind in the world, and based on LOCAL GROUND I can see why.  Absolutely timeless, this is music that humans might have made from the beginning of time and might be making until the end of time, with joy, sorrow, love, regret, nostalgia, longing, and sheer celebration of being alive another day!   
 In my opinion, this is the best book on general principles without going into detail on specific therapeutic areas. I would consider it a must-read for those in clinical pharmacology post-graduate training or those working in clin pharm. However, previous knowledge of pharmacology is needed, as this book is not suitable as a first primer for medical and undergrad students 
 I am a high school United States history teacher in Florida and I wanted to learn a little more about what life was like in Florida during and after the civil war.  I found this book online and bought it.  What a pleasant surprise!  I was not expecting such a well-written, well-researched and endearing true account of the lives of these Florida women during the Civil War.  Not only is it replete with first hand documentation, but it is comprehensive of all aspects of life and circumstances faced during that time.  And what I didn't expect was how involved I became in the lives of these women.  I was reading it primarily for research, but certain women's letters and diary entries kept popping up and it started to paint a complete picture of their life, so much so, that when I neared then end of the book and it talked about the loved ones they lost in the war, or how they themselves died... I actually grieved.  I didn't realize that I was being emotionally pulled into their lives as I was taking notes and highlighting bits and pieces of information.  If you are the least bit interested in Florida history, or women in the civil war (it speaks almost equally about their menfolk as well) YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED with this book.  Highly recommended 
 I'm not good at reviews, all I can say is that I really enjoyed this movie, I am a big fan of horror and psychological horror, this movie has you confused, not really sure if the lead character is crazy or if your going crazy. All in all this is a awesome movie, and highly suggest it for anyon 
 OMG...I just now found out about this REPRINT!  I am SO EXCITED.  I have read this book many times when our library actually had TWO copies in circulation.  Of course, like most of the really great horse books in our library system, both copies were 'lost' by someone who checked 'em out (riiiiiight).  Dang, I HATE that...arrrggh.  Anyway, I've come across used copies for sale but they're always so freaking expensive - I could never bring myself to spend all that MONEY.  So it's a GREAT thrill to see this wonderful book - which has everything you could possibly want in a book about that great, legendary horse - at around $10 or so here on Amazon!  Yay!  Like Walter Farley's "faction" version of the great horse's life, the authors used the unpublished manuscript "Turf Career of Man O'War" a good deal but the book also includes a COMPLETE list of his progeny, auction prices, race records, mares bred to, etc.  AND every single one of the Daily Racing Form official charts for his 21 races.  Amazing, and great reading.  Of course something to keep in mind was when the book came out in 1951, there were still a lot of folks alive who remembered seeing "Big Red" in person, and the horse himself had just died four years before, a lot of key people were still alive and so on.  This book is like a rich slice of chocolate cake, immensely delicious and satisfying!  If you haven't figured it out by now, I recommend this book : 
 The Art of the Incredibles is an epic journey in its own right beyond the smash motion picture release from Disney and Pixar. Reading the interviews from Pixar giants like Brad Bird and John Lasseter on the impetus that began the In-cred-uh-ble (never mind) journey for the movie feels like you're sitting in a conference room at Pixar headquarters being debriefed on the joy and pain that brought an age-old story about fathers that want to be the super-heroes of their kids' dreams into a CGI medium that made its expression all the more enjoyable. The term "eye candy" doesn't even begin to talk about the content of this book, as collage after collage and drawing after drawing illustrative the evolutionary process employed by Pixar and other bleeding-edge animation studios to breath life into characters that in turn produce a realistic, enjoyable, and profitable film. I purchased this book for my brother, as he wants to be a storyboard artist for Pixar or ILM (Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic) one day. It really serves it's purpose to help him think about the creative process and realize his true potential in this field. As a CGI fan, I'm impressed by the ability of Pixar's technical team to innovate new technology (such as sub-surface light scattering that removes the "plastic look" of Toy Story and gives the human characters more human appearance) for their projects. If you're a fan of Pixar, CGI, or good art in general, this book will serve you well on a coffee table or near an artist's drawing table 
 Then buy this dvd.. the definitive collection of videos... a great documentary on the band.. Even my two year old enjoyed watching it (and dancing with his dad)... Definitely worth owning for anyone who ran to the dance floor when they heard the opening bars of Blue Monday or Bizarre Love Triangle... Also has some back-story of NO in the form of a story of Joy Division 
 I really like this book.  Provactive it is!  Sexy it is!  Visually rewarding it is!  Are the men, men?..Oh yes, very definitely; edgy too.  
 Lucy and the gang head for Hollywood in their best season.  Disc One: The Business Manager - Ricky is fed up with Lucy's mismanagement of the household funds and hires a business manager.

Lucy Cries Wolf - This is Lucy's version of the Little Boy Who Cried Wolf.  Lucy reads an article about a woman who called her husband at work to tell him about a prowler and he did nothing.

 What an extraordinary book!  This book, with its beautiful, imaginitive illustrations and straightforward presentation of the simple realities of our complex world, is one of the most important books in my library of thousands.  Smith's simplicity in his presentation of statistics without bias allows the thought process that inevitably follows the reading of each page to take over the reader's mind as it soars with the accompanying illustrations.  As a teaching tool for children, I use this book with kids in grades 3-6 from a very poor school district to illustrate their comparitive socioeconomic advantages, study geopolitics, and meet our data analysis standards.  My kids then can be heard enthusiastically retelling and explaining their new understanding of the world throughout the school.  HOWEVER, this is as powerful a book for adults as it is for children.  I have often given it as a gift to friends.  We would have a different world if everyone read this book, read it with their kids, and carried the information with them as I have since I first opened it 
   Once again, David McCullough's treatment of an american icon is the best of its kind. This biography reads like a fascinating novel, and McCulloughs narrative ability is unmatched. No one seems to be able to tell a story the way he can.    The great Theodore Roosevelt, known throughout the world and across the ages as an incredibly strong, tough, larger than life figure actually began as somewhat of a weakling. The book covers his total transformation from a sickly child to a man of great resolve and courage, the man who would become President of the United States.   Best of all is that McCullough likes and admires his subject. This is not always the case with biographies. Roosevelt and his family are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. Highly recommended, as are all of McCullough's books 
 The Book is very informative, one can comprehend what is being taught in the Book, it lines up very well with the Bible 
 This book chronicles the exploits of a young computer enthusiast who managed to break into an alarming number of computers, mainly by sheer perseverance.  The book is also the story of the people who hunted this early cybercriminal and how he was ultimately caught.    One of the remarkable aspects of the story is that the chief antagonist (the "hacker") was not particularly skilled.  He was what's called a "script kiddie" in the biz.  Another remarkable aspect of the book is that after breaking into dozens of computers, and finally getting caught after dozens of people had invested hundreds of hours tracking him, he was basically let off the hook with very little punishment.  I found this to be a fascinating account of an extraordinary series of events.  I recommend this book especially for those who are interested in the field of information security as it provides a glimpse of the motivations and methodology of one notorious cracker.  For people who are interested in crimes or security, this will be a riveting story.  All that said, this is only one side of the story and I wondered how accurate the reporting was.  In particular, I wished that there was more on the motivation and thinking of the main antagonist, the super-cracker-slash-script-kiddie pseudo-named Matt Singer.   In the book, he is characterized basically as a bad guy.  There has been more written about this story and apparently the script kiddie's real name is Tim Bach.  You can find his posts in the freebsd.org mailing list archives from 1995 and other on-line traces.  These "real-world" glimpses do not seem, IMHO, to jive completely with the character in this putatively non-fiction book.  In the same vein, Trent Fisher (no pseudonym for him in the book) has a website and doesn't seem too happy in how he was characterized.   And, finally, the events are ancient history.  In many ways, information security has taken strides since these events unfolded.  Law enforcement and especially forensics are more advanced.  And in important ways, modern worms represent the evolution of this breed of attacker.  But it's still a fascinating and, I think, important story 
 This movie changed my life! I have become a buddhist now!  DO NOT QUESTION THE PUMPKIN OVERLORD'S REASONIG!  The sexual tension between the main character and the boogeyman is electric!  The whole movie is about the main character's need to be appreciated  by coathangers in his closet!  While fending off the sexual assaults of satanic forest critters he comes to the realization that pirates were really cool!  Praise Buddha and OBEY THE PUMPKIN OVERLORDS 
 This book on French cinema is a very important book. It really offers the reader a unique and splendid overview of one hundred years of French cinema, which influenced American movies as well as many other national cinemas. Rémi Fournier Lanzoni organized its narrative structure chronologically and provided at the beginning of each chapter a concise but valuable historical retrospective. Most likely one of the best books on the history of French filmmaking 
 I received the book in a timely manner and in better condition than I expected! Thanks, Tamm 
 This is a letter I wrote to Katherine Cohen, author of this book as well as Rock Hard Apps, another book I highly recommend.I was compelled to write this letter after her books left such an impression on me.    Hi Katherine.        I just wanted to take the time to thank you for writing two terrific books. I recently purchased your book, The Truth About Getting In, and found it so engaging that I had to pick up Rock Hard Apps as well.          I am strongly considering applying early to Princeton and your books gave me added confidence. In fact, I just completed my "brag sheet." I am an only child, so my family does not have much experience with the college admissions process. Before reading your books, the process seemed overwhelming and daunting, but now, I know exactly what I have to do to put my best foot forward and distinguish myself from other applicants. It may sound corny, but the admissions process and formulation of my application now seem more like an adventure.          As I was reading your books, I felt as if I were sitting right next to you receiving a private consultation. While writing this email, I feel more as if I'm writing to a close friend than an accomplished college counselor. If you have the ability to make such a profound impact through your words, I can only imagine the impact you have on your students.         When I put your books down, I actually felt like I had gained an inside look into the college admissions process. You do not lie. You truly reveal the "truth about getting in." All other college books I've read seem superficial compared to yours. I will take what you have taught me and do my best to apply it to my Princeton application as I work on completing it this summer.          Once again, thank you. I hope I will be able to attain success in my endeavors with your wisdom behind me. I will keep you posted 
 I purchased two of these last Saturday.  I LOVE THEM!!  The  first table only took 30 min and the second 10 minutes!!  Would have given a 5 star review however, there was an excessive amount of grease on the screws and hardware included to put it together.  Although sealed excellently, it was hard to put it together without getting grease on the table.  <br /> <br />  
 I would encourage any serious Stones enthusiast to pick up this book which is full of great photos, many never before seen, and Wyman's insight on their career . It's also a great companion to his Stone Alone autobiography. Just one thing though ; he mentions that "Tell Me (You're Comin' Back To Me)" is one of the least covered Stones tunes in their catalogue, and mentions two groups that have covered it, one a little known 1965 group, and the other, Cleveland punkers The Dead Boys (Stiv Bators RIP). Well Bill,this is one that you just didn't do the homework on. The Beltways (I'm the bass player)covered "Tell Me..." on our 1998 CD Stella On Mars. It's legal and official; we paid the mechanical royalty to put it on our disc and I wrote the check, so Mick & Keef did get paid, it's legit and the disc is still available. I'd be glad to send you a copy,you're still my hero and the Stones are still THE band 
 These 12 tracks were all popular in the clubs (versus the radio) during the years 1976-81, and many of them are not easily available on CD.  Examples include Michael Polnareff's "Theme From Lipstick,"  Undisputed Truth's "You+Me=Love," and Stargard's "Wear It Out."  The recordings on this disc are well-selected;  all reflect the disco aesthetic and cohere to a consistent-sounding set.  The tracks are less obscure than those on the "Disco Spectrum" series-- the cuts on "Disco Connection" nevertheless make up a pleasing collection for disco fans and casual listeners of dance/party music 
 This cd was off the chain. my favorites are I never will and favor and i can`t forget It`s not over this cd was nothing short of mind blowing. This cd should have more than 5 stars because this cd was really good. I highly reccomend this song to people who are looking for karen clark to hit nothing but the notes this cd was amazing even know this cd was`nt the best i personally prefer karen second alblum but overall this cd was really good, these songs really ministred to me espcially You showed me that song was a very uplifting song. I hope whoever pick this alblum up u be blessed because this cd was so good and i am looking forward for more of miss karen clark sheard because that woman is truly a woman of god 
 This film for me has always been a guaranteed laugh. The southern accents and snooty New York attitude superbly played are hilarious! Bette Midler and Lilly Tomlin now how can you come up with a better duo other than double it 
 This is an excellent video for collectors and enthusiasts.  Those who plan to learn martial arts, should look elsewhere though.   ---  http://www.geocities.com/bjjamalta  Official Web Site of the Bushido Ju-Jitsu Academy (Malta).

 The state of art history comes into qusetion when reading what Andersen has to say about Picasso's Brothel. How did so many errors and misinterpretaions get into the literature? Andersen reconstructs how the Demoiselles looked befor the epiphany that Picasso underwent on seeing tribal images in the Museum of Ethnology in the Trocadero. And based on that recconstruction, he proposes that the retrospective and determinist notions about the way the imagery evolved, and the psychoanalytic interpretations of Picasso as to his terror of women, should be completely revised 
 This is one of my all-time favorite collections. This CD contains songs from the 80s and 90s that will bring back sweet memories. "Don't Want to Lose You Now", and "Anything for You" are classic ballads that told the world how talented Ms. Estefan realy is. This is definitely a favorite to add to your musical collection 
 This is an important book that explains an incredibletransformation in American social policy. Sometime around themid-1960s, a new code of private values and government policies pushed their way into mainstream society.  This vision and its consequences were a radical departure from our nation's past.  From 1950 to 1965, an economy founded on free market principles, nurtured on minimal government regulation, and protected from large welfare programs, had slashed the poverty rate from one third of the population to just over one-tenth.  Eliminating poverty seemed like a real possibility to Americans as long as the wheels of capitalism continued to spin unhindered.  From 1950 to 1965, African-Americans won court battles giving them the human rights guaranteed to every citizen. These belated changes were cemented by the hallmark 1964 Civil Rights Act and accompanied by a remarkable surge in African-American incomes. This fifteen-year period was an era of immense progress.  Not only were the classes and races coming together but crime was remarkably low, families exceptionally resilient, and drug use almost non-existent.  Then around 1965 something happened.  All of a sudden the capitalist economy that made Old World immigrants into middle-class, suburban home-owners was described as a guilty, imperialist system that exploited the poor and the weak.  Government planners in Washington got right to solving this "problem." From now on, people could expect a guaranteed income for an unlimited period of time, without regard to personal behavior or the ability to work. To show what a compassionate society we are, we would destroy the work ethic that was the bedrock of Western civilization.  But that wasn't the best part.  After 1965, the principle of equal opportunity for all races that Martin Luther King martyred himself for was also described as a "guilty" system that kept blacks and women oppressed.  Suddenly, it wasn't only white supremacists who claimed that blacks couldn't thrive in American society.  It was the very black leaders themselves.  They claimed that affirmative action programs were needed to keep African-Americans functional.  Too bad if it destroyed the American ideal of merit and equal opportunity.  Tough luck if it strained relations between whites and blacks.  Those claiming that racial preferences were unjust could be dismissed as closet racists.  Only a decade later, the consequences of this change in values and government policy were beyond dispute.  Destroying merit and the work ethic did not create a "Great Society." Rather, it helped create a large underclass imprisoned by poverty.  Crime rates tripled, illegitimate births exploded, and drug use surged.  The trends have leveled off since the late 1970s but the consequences of this values shift remain with us today.  Opponents of racial quotas are still lampooned as closet racists.  Reformers of the welfare state are dismissed as "uncompassionate." What is really racist and uncompassionate is defending the government policies that created this wretched condition.  We made this happen.  And we can unmake it. The power, as always, is ours 
 As an acting teacher I was thrilled with this book. It has lots of terrific improv games and ideas. I'm inspired and I know my kids will be too. 
 You just can't go wrong with this book!  The text is perfect for youn children, and the illustrations are precious 
 In the trio of "Guitar" CDs that I consider of Tangerine Dream, this one ranks behind Turn of the Tides, but ahead of Rockoon.  "Guest musician" guitarist Zlatko Perica left the band sometime between the release of Turn of the Tides and the sessions for this CD.  His replacement is Gerald Gradwohl, a competent guitarist to say the least, but Zlatko's fire on the previous CDs was partly the reason that they were so good.  Tyranny of Beauty has some great guitar work by Grohwohl and Jerome Froese, I love listening to this CD, but for whatever reason the tunes just aren't as memorable as those on Turn of the Tides.  That being said, it is a great CD and there is some great guitar work.  Turn of the Tides and Tyranny of Beauty should be in the collection of any instrumental rock fan or guitar enthusiast.  I think the saxophone is more prominent on this CD than the predecessor, but it doesn't detract from the listening experience in my humble opinion.  Some standout tracks for me are Catwalk, Birdwatcher's Dream, Living In a Fountain Pen, and Haze of Fame.  Similar to its predecessor, the only thing that could make this CD better would be the use of an actual drum set then the drum machine/synth samples that they use for their drums 
 I always find it frustrating when I go to Amazon and look at the reviews that are posted and find that they are at least 2 to 3 years old. So I decided to at least make a more up-to-date review.  First and foremost, this book is NOT a `How to Write a great Script' book. This book is about screenwriters and their knowledgeable insight on the practice we all know as Screenwriting. These established screenwriters ( Akiva Goldman: A Beautiful Mind, A Time to Kill, and the up coming The Da Vinci Code   Steven E. de Souza: Die Hard, 48 Hours.) reference their past experience on what works, what does not work, and what habits you need to establish to have a successful career in the shark infested waters of Hollywood. Not sure how many hours you need to write day in day out? Thinking that you are the only one with a spouse and kids, fearing that you will not have enough time to write? Arrived at Hollywood lost with no plan of action on how to get your script read? Worried that you born yesterday and began sending inquiry letters to agents and producers? Fear of rejection (it is inevitable) from everyone? All these topics are discussed and more in this book.   This book is required reading for all serious screenwriters. I also suggest Breakfast with sharks by Michael Lent, The Art of Dramatic writing by Lajos Egri, Story by Robert Mckee, Making a good script Great by Linda Seger, and The Writer Got Screwed by Brooke A. Wharton. 
 This is an inspirational and insightful account of the power play amongst important players who have shaped the history of the Middle East and the impact it has had on the current state of affairs there,especially in Iraq, Iran and the Palestinian Question. One of the questions it seeks to answer is whether the blending of power, faith and fantasy will inspire and point towards addressing some of the more pressing issues in the Middle East. This is Michael Oren at his delightful best!    
 I am in love with this book.  Instead of telling me what a slob I am or that I should just toss all clutter, the authors understand what its like to have collections of stuff and busy lives.  There are so many "home organization" (and i use that term loosely) books out there and instead of focusing on how to organize your home and indirectly your life, they pound into you that one must always get rid of stuff.  This is not the case with the wonderful Casey Ellis and Randall Koll!  I can live clutter free and organized.  Yes, junk mail gets thrown away as soon as it enters the house but I now have lovely baskets to organize the myriad of magazines that cross my threshold and I can actually get to the things I use most and sleep well knowing that my linen closet could be in photo shoot 
 These are simply amazing wildlife photos, all from East Africa, where the Shah brothers live. This large-format book is beautifully printed, and these photos are about as good as wildlife photography gets. Lots of everyone's favorite (mine anyway), baby animal photos!  Now, almost anyone (even me) can take a cute photo of baby cheetahs in their furpunk soft-Mohawk glory. But the Shahs can photograph a baby *hippo*  and make it look cuddly (p. 146)....  The Shahs have the unfair advantage of living in Kenya, so their photos represent literally years of fieldwork in their own backyard (big backyard!). Which wouldn't matter except that they may well be the finest photographers of East African wildlife so far. Astonishing work, absolutely not to be missed. I know, I'm stuck in superlative mode here, but these guys are really, really good, and Harry Abrams has done them up proud.  You've almost certainly seen some of the Shah's photographs, likely in National Geographic -- though if you're as oblivious as me, you may not have noticed their names. I've uploaded a couple of images to jog your memory. Most highly recommended for anyone who's interested in African wildlife. And yes, you should save up for a trip to East Africa someday....  Happy viewing-- Peter D. Tillma 
 One of the most vexing global problems today is gobal criminal capitalism, or international organized crime.  Three years ago its gross revenues were estimated at $1.8 trillion. Today it is most likely to be over $2 trillion, annual, of which 50 percent or so is profits.  The impact of their trade, which is narcotics based, on the moral fibre of people everywhere is incalculable. It does not take a rocket scientist to understand that this type of money translates into massive political, financial, legal, judicial, and law enforcement corruption in all countries, including the United States.  So far, there has been too little attention placed on the Chinese Triads and their contribution. Dragon Syndicates is an excellent start towards filling the gap. Its history is excellent. It makes clear the reason organized crime exists is that it is politically protected and very rapidly becomes integrated with the political and financial structure. The weakness in the book is its failure to understand the present-day government involvement, especially in the case of China, which while it outlawed internal use of drugs in 1949, as described in the book, at the same time it nationalized the poppies and began using opium and heroin to undermine other societies, most notably Japan and the United States (See The Peking Bomb by Gerd Hamburger and Psycho-chemical Warfare by A.H Stanton Candlin). The State-Triads connection has grown and can now be seen in the marketing of designer drugs, produced in military labs, and in the coordination with the Yakusa, Mafia, and Russian Organized Crime, in which the intelligence services play a major role.  The threat posed by international organized crime and the need to recognize and respond is clearly evident in the Dragon Syndicates. This book is especially useful in showing how tremendous the Triad-supported crime has grown in the United States since 1965, when immigration controls were significantly relaxed. This is especially apparent in places like New York, San Francisco, and the Pacific Northwest. The book is also excellent in showing the variety of activities -- from narcotics, to white slavery, loan sharking, pornography, arms sales, money laundering, and piracy of computer software. The book is a valuable and insightful read. See also Drug Politics by David Jordan 
 This book is extremely interesting -- not at all in the style of most mysteries, it offers a surprisingly introspective look at the key characters.  The beginning is rather bizarre. Get through it, and you will  really enjoy the rest 
 I used this movie as part of my Hispanic Heritage Month (october) lesson in the classroom.  We did a study of Jaime Escalante and Salvador Dali.  The children really enjoyed the movie.  We just watched the classroom scenes (teacher's version of editing for content and time), while I explained what was happening.   My class loved it and so did I 
 Using this product for about 4 months now and it's simply great.  This unit received a lot of use during the Holidays and it never missed a beat.  I've read a few reviews here and they seem either fake or the folks didn't understand how to operate it and should probably go back to a Fry Daddy for simplicity.  The Euro does require that you get the unit set in the rails to trip the safety switch and you do need to keep this thing clean.  I change the oil about every 2 months - depending on how much protein I fry.  Nice to be able to put the tub in the dishwasher and looks like new upon reassembling.  The MAJOR difference between this unit and several others I've owned is the larger capacity (4 liters!).  Capacity is very important in keeping the oil to temperature and keeping the food less greasy.  In addition to the capacity, the wattage is upped to 1800 watts which is above par for consumer level fryers. This is one of the largest capacity home fryers around at this price.  Fried zucchini and mushrooms are simply restaraunt quality!  I also recommend experimenting with batters - search the net for this (i.e. use Italian dry mix in flour for a KFC type fried chicken - good stuff!) 
 Maybe it was because it was sunny finally, warm and felt like summer again, and all the associations spring/summer brings, but The Hold Steady album "Separation Sunday," I listened to sounded like early Springsteen, only better, b/c Bruce was pressing and yearning too much on his first few albums (before he found his voice and metaphor of the car as a way to explore America).  I recommend it because the songwriting obsesses on women, not in a lewd way, but with sympathy, sometimes sorting through their independence and other times, their mistreatment. In addition, the guitars are good, and yes the vox sound like The Boss, with a few piano moments eerily familiar. Don't burn it, don't download it; buy it and leaf through the words as you listen 
 This is a great book providing lots of general information that would help any novice and even some experienced woodworker. The text is easy to read and the photos and drawings superb. About the only problem is the age the book shows in so far as power tools. This book could really use an update when it comes to this area. Power tools have come a long way in the last ten to fifteen years and many joinery operations can be performed with them instead of by hand - the book would benefit from showing and discussing this. Little things like carbide tipped blades, bits, and tools are barely mentioned though today they outsell HSS versions by several times and are much more frequently used. That said, however, it is indeed nice to see so many operations shown being done by hand despite power tools being able to do the job. It is always good to know how to do something by hand instead of always relying on power tools. I consider this book a "must have" because it supplies a broad range of information on pretty much everything dealing with woodworking and does it quite well. 
 This is a most excellent guide to the food of northern Italy, maybe the ONLY comprehensive guide in English to that vast and delectable region.  It covers a huge range of cuisines from the rustic simplicty of Tuscany to the highly inflected Franco-Savoyard provincial foods of the Val d'Aosta.  It gives special attention to the rich traditions of Emiglia-Romagna, especially Bologna.  It also does a fine job of sampling the gamut of local offerings, from simple but excellent family kitchens to the greatest restaurants.  Unfortunately, the book is out of date. Last updated in 1998, I have found that maybe one third of its listings are now defunct, and many more can no longer be reached at the phone/fax numbers listed.  I am currently planning a trip to Arezzo, Pisa, Assisi, Bologna, and Modena, and many of the restaurants I wanted to visit no longer exist. Still, the larger, more established restaurants and the older more established family kitchens tend to have the same contact information that they did eight years ago.  Please join with me in encouraging the author and publisher to revise and reissue this great guide.  I'd love to see it as a supplement to the Fodor's Italy guide, which is generally excellent but provides only cursory coverage of food.  Please note that my rating is somewhat arbitrary given that the book has become largely obsolete 
 He's been voiced by Judd Nelson, replaced Optimus Prime as leader of the Autobots, hated by fans, and called by a variety of names: from Hot Rod, to Rodimus Prime, to Rodimus Major.  Through it all though, he still makes one sweet toy that longtime Transformers collectors will have a blast with.  Since Hasbro no longer owns the rights to the name Hot Rod, Rodimus is here in all his glory in this Deluxe Classic figure, and he looks sweet.  Looking pretty much like the futuristic sports car that debuted in the 1986 animated movie, Rodimus is, as a previous reviewer has already pointed out, surprisingly easy to transform back and forth from vehicle to robot.  In robot form, Rodimus looks pretty good as well, albeit a bit bulkier than he ever did on the cartoon, but that's nothing new with Transformer figures though is it?  He comes with a missle launcher that actually shoots and is easily put in his hands.  All in all, Rodimus is a great Transformers toy that collectors young and old will love, and he deserves a welcome place in any collection 
      The idea of using Batman to discuss forensic pathology is quite clever. (Indeed, one can easily imagine a CSI-Gotham City series.)      Moench does a good job intermixing research and storytelling. Much of the research is well done and interestingly told, although the interested reader might wish to consult DiMaio & DiMaio's Forensic Pathology regarding analysis of knife wounds and drowning deaths, where the textbook differs from the information in this book.      All in all, a good read and a good introduction to forensics 
 I have six pairs of these pj's in different colors.  They are the most comfortable sleepwear I have ever owned!  They feel so smooth and luxurious,  and dont bunch up while I sleep.  No special care required,  just into the washer and then the dryer, and I never notice any static in them.  They are wonderful for travel, practically wrinkle free.  Light weight and take up minimum space in suitcase.  The matching robes are equally wonderful.  
 As a Designer myself whose work has been featured on HGTV and in publications (although my style is different from Kelly's) I HIGHLY recommend this book to anybody interested in design because not only is it exceptionally beautiful, I think Kelly will go down in history as one of the greatest for her "Out of the Box" creativity! She is truly an artist and we can all learn from and appreciate her amazing sense of style! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! 
 If you want to just play rock, or just play blues, then this book will help you out... but if you want to get started in being a great all-around guitar player in any style then this book is the perfect way to get your foot through the door, and open your ear to new possibilities. (Even Acoustic Finger Picking) I think this book is more focused on some genres (Rock, Jazz, Funk) than others however they do give a just amount of each style for you to get a feel and some basic knowledge for each. (Country, Fingerstyle, Blues, Rock, Latin/Brazilian, Jazz & Swing, Funk 
 This is a beautiful documentary that touches on a small element of how slavery was from the exact words of ex slaves. It is impossible to embody how the whole experience was from the tales of the slaves that appeared in the books and in the movie. But this movie does a good job on exposng some of the main facts and atrocities that were committed against africans in amerikkka. This movie needs to be shown in all academic arenas as well as homes to expose how africans have been treated for the past 700 years 
 A great resource to help study for the MCAT :D Glad I spent the buttload of money! 
 There are as many ways of honoring the long forgotten as there are ways of mucking that honor up.  I came to "Fortune's Bones" with just a bit of trepidation, I admit.  Though I knew author Marilyn Nelson had created this book to honor a man long dead in the best way she knew how, I was still recovering from a similar, and foul, title called, "Journey To the Bottomless Pit" which also came out in 2004.  In both books, a man who was a slave during his lifetime is honored with a children's book of fiction.  In "Journey", the book was a simplistic version of a complicated man's life.  I prayed that "Fortune's Bones" would not be the same.  Those prayers were answered tenfold.  Marilyn Nelson tells the story of Fortune in a manner respectful of his life, then accompanies this retelling with a requiem written in his honor.  Though I would have enjoyed further factual information on the topic, this is a worthy addition to any poetry collection or non-fiction collection, for children, teens, or grown adults, anywhere.    	 There once was a man named Fortune.  Born a slave in the 1700s, he and his wife and his children all belonged to a Dr. Preserved Porter.  Later tests on Fortune's bones show that his life was not an easy one.  His back was once broken and though he had a healthy skeleton, he died at the age of 60.  When he did, Dr. Porter took Fortune's death as an opportunity to study human anatomy.  He removed Fortune's skeleton, tapped the bones, and made himself a complete human skeleton.  Every bone was carefully marked and studied by Porter and his ancestors.  Years later, Fortune's name was lost and the skeleton was mislabeled "Larry" and given to the Matttatuck Museum.  In the 1990s historians did research on it and found Fortune's true name once again.  Now the only question that remains is what to do with Fortune's bones.  Do we bury them and put him to rest at long last, or do we learn more from them about 1700s slaves and slavery?  The question remains unanswered, but author Marilyn Nelson has done what she can.  In this book she writes a requiem in Fortune's memory.  Filled with free verse poetry, a Kyrie of the Bones, and a Sanctus at the end, "Fortune's Bones" is a text of respect.   	 One of the many things I loved about this book was the fact that as an author/poet, Nelson tells us why she wrote what she did.  One poem is entitled, "Not My Bones", in which Fortune states clearly, "I am not my body", to anyone who cares to listen.  This phrase comes from the Vietnamese Buddhist leader Thich Nhat Hahn, a fact that could well have gone uncredited by a less careful author.  Each poem in this book is accompanied by factual information pertaining to Fortune's story, along with photographs, papers, tapestries, maps, and other important documents of the period.  As a whole these poems speak beautifully together, forming a single Requiem.  I especially liked "Dinah's Lament" in which Fortune's wife speaks of the cruel injustice of being forced to dust the bones that once would, "hold me when I cried; to dust where his soft lips were, and his chest what curved its warm against my back at night".  Nelson, the accomplished voice behind her other great book, "Carver: A Life In Poems", is at her best here. 	 Admittedly, there were aspects of this book left unspoken that I (and I'm sure others) would have liked to have heard more about.  The book is a Requiem and doesn't dwell on the fascinating process scientists took to discover Fortune again.  There's a small series of three pictures on one page that shows three stages of facial reconstruction of Fortune, taken from his bones.  That's something that would have made for a fascinating story in and of itself.  Or how did the researchers and historians eventually discover who Fortune really was?  Who did they talk to?  What did they read?  Sadly, such information will have to wait for another book.  It's not answered here. 	 "Fortune's Bones", will obviously be snatched up by any child and/or teen assigned to read a book of poems since it's a mere 32 pages altogether.  This is a great good thing.  In spite of its scant length, this is a title that will teach a lot of information to a lot of kids in a wonderfully stirring way.  The poems are mindful of the past and give the greatest of respect to a man of whom we know so little.  A wonderful publication

 Zahn does great justice to the continuing story that is star wars. Unlike many other EU content, Zahn sets the bar for this trilogy not in a childrens book, but for a mature star wars fan {Geeks if you must}. Also very inivative for a star wars wrighter, uses things from past movies to form very intelectually synced idea. Fast paced, exciting, most definatly a page turner, and very well written. The only flaw i find with the book is Zahn's obvious fan based wrighting. That might not be a problem to others but to one such as myself it sometimes pollutes the story line with his so called "flashes" to movie seens that he seemed to have really enjoyed. Great book and a fantastic way to open up the trilogy. 
 Funny. There seems to be a Law of Nature that fantasy and science fiction series descend rapidly in quality after the first few books. Terry Pratchett is a notable exception to this rule. The first few Discworld books are a pleasant enough way to spend an afternoon. The later books are considerably more than that. In them Pratchett's characters have deepened and the engrossing storyline is only the top layer of the book. This is one of the best of the Discworld books I've read (my favorite so far is Monstrous Regiment). I'm sure both that I'll be rereading it and that I'll be pick up subtleties I missed this time around. 
 This is, hands down, the funniest Marvel story I've seen.  If you like comic books even a little, and can appreciate a few jokes at their expense, this is a must-read.  My only complaint about it is that the G.L.A. mini was only four issues long.  This is definitely something that needs to be an ongoing series.  Fortunately for G.L.A. fans though, and if you aren't one yet you will be after reading Misassembled, they also threw in the original appearance of the G.L.A. as well as the first and only previous appearance of Squirrel Girl.  They're not as great as the main story, but they do prove that it was possible to write funny comics upwards of twenty years ago, and hey, six issues for the price of four.  I can't recommend it highly enough 
 OUTSTANDING!! I have never heard a better version of Giant Steps. This is bop at it's best 
 An exciting, fun book.  It keeps your interest with a fast pace and riveting adventure 
 Reading this book is like having a holy vision: I feel as if I should tell the world about it, but at the same time it seems so sacred and personal that maybe I should just keep it to myself and try to figure out why it came to me, into my life, into my head. The book is the story of Billy Parham, a son in a late-1930s New Mexican ranching family.  Billy traps a wolf that has been killing his father's cattle but realizes he can't kill it and has to return it to its home in the mountains of old Mexico.  Billy crosses the border into Mexico, and as he does he crosses from real life into a world of dreams, where everyone moves as if the air was liquid, where every ruin has an irretrievable story, where soot and heat and danger hang in the air, and where nothing ever goes as planned. The story is not as streamlined or as focused as its thematic predecessor, "All the Pretty Horses," but that's not necessarily a shortcoming.   The book sprawls out like a wide hot desert--curling north and south, east and west, across the present and into the past.  The writing is as good as any writing I've ever read ever, and certain metaphors and feelings will stay with you for years.  For example: the coals of a campfire seeming like an exposed piece of the core of the earth. This is a book that needs to be read.  Pick it up, and let it seep into your skin, let it open you to other worlds and peoples and ideas, and let it change you.  Let it open your eyes to the world, and to the West, and the goodness and the hope and the sadness that haunts the lives of all of us.   This is a book made of all those ineffable things that most of us just can't put into words.  But here, somehow, Cormac McCarthy has managed to do just that.  Here is the intangible, but tangible.  Here is the unnameable, but named.  Here are the thoughts you could never express, expressed. 
 Francis Fukuyama is one of the most original and interesting political thinkers the world has today. In his first pioneering work 'The End of History and the Last Man" he argued that the world as a whole was moving in the direction of Liberal Democracy , and that when this ideal state came into being there would be in a sense the end of history as we know it. Now he has written a work in which he somewhat retreats from his earlier optimism, and focuses on the nuts- and- bolts of our present real- world situation. And here he sees that the movement toward diminishing the role of the state which had its great impetus with the fall of the Soviet Union has not always brought about the desired results. Instead of there emerging stronger more liberal economies there have often emerged ' weak states' without the power to perform the basic state functions of law enforcement, defense, protection of property.  Thus Fukuyama believes that there is an urgent need to engage in ' state- building' that will bring about proper governance. Here however he acknowledges that the theoretical and practical knowledge of state- building is not really sufficient. And that there should be a concentrated effort to provide the knowledge required.  Fukuyama may remain optimistic about the ultimate end and direction of history but he sees great problems in the present and near future. He points to the state- breakdown in Africa, and the failure of state- building in other areas of the world. And he questions how successful the United States can be in building state- institutions for other societies. He points out that the British Empire succeeded in laying the foundation for only  one state, India.  He also wonders aloud about precisely how strong the state should be . Clearly the former Soviet Union and totalitarian states which aimed to take over every area of life are one negative extreme. He contrasts the United States model with the far more state- centered  European one. While Fukuyama centers on this particular major problem other political thinkers are focusing on other major problems , from globaliztion to nuclear proliferation, from the growing  American hegemony to the shifting of world- power to China and India.  Fukuyama in a previous work also considered the implications of the biotechnological revolution which may be altering the character and definition of the 'human'.  This is said not to undermine the importance of the problem that Fukuyama points to in this book, but only to indicate that it is not ' the beginning and the end ' of human problems, the one 'key to it all' or the problem which even must be most focused on at the moment.  There is after all an 'energy crisis' ( Remember that one ) and a Demographic Dearth ( The developed  ) and the Social Security and Greying of Mankind Crisis and tens of others.  Moreover it is by no means certain that the ' nation- state' will be the fundamental political unit of the future. I would not bet on anything else, but the new Europe seems to be trying to say something about new organizational frameworks for Mankind.    
 I received my first magazine, it isn't glossy or flashy, but is full of in-depth info, which is exactly what I wanted.  Not very thick for the money, but I'm still satisfied due to the quality of the content.  
 Sniechowski and Sherven have developed a unique approach to loving -- celebrating your differences rather than fighting over them.  If their technique were embraced by governments as well as individuals, war would become a thing of the past

 This is a fantastic book.  It is filled with thought provoking statistics and charts, accompanied by an easy to read history of the multi-faceted nonprofit sector 
 Please note that most of this review is actually on Heinlein's Citizen of the Galaxy. That's because I was unable to post this review on that product page for some reason, maybe because of a system problem, and rather than delete the review, I thought I would post it here under another one of Heinlein's juveniles. So I apologize for that but hope you will enjoy this review too.  However, I would like to make one brief comment about Time for the Stars. The two main characters are interesting in that Heinlein has portrayed a dysfunctional twin pair who, although not close personally, they are mutually telepathic. Usually, twins are close and almost inseparable, but not in the case of these fictional twins. And when one twin dies in real life, often the surviving twin dies shortly thereafter.  Heinlein started out writing juvenile novels, although sometimes the dividing line between juvenile and truly adult works in his oeuvre is not as simple as is commonly thought. There are a number of these that Heinlein fans are familiar with, such as Rocket Ship Galileo, Time for the Stars, The Star Beast, Tunnel in the Sky, Starman Jones, The Rolling Stones, Podkayne of Mars, and Citizen of the Galaxy. As my fellow reviewer Dark Genius points out, this is probably the most mature of his juvenile works. But they are still notable for containing some of Heinlein's best fiction and ideas.  For example, in Starman Jones, we are introduced to the concept of the cruel and unjust society. In Heinlein's juvenile novels, they are allowed to exist, but in the later adult novels, they are resisted and overthrown. In Starman Jones, we encounter a society of intelligent but violent and carnivorous horse-like quadrupeds who capture and imprison the exploration team sent down to the planet. In this society, the old and sick are not cared for by their family. Instead, they are brought before the tribal chief where they are judged and put to death rather than allowing them to become a burden.  Although Starman Jones was written almost 60 years ago, unfortunately the quadruped culture is not so different from what modern American society has become, in which old people are considered useless and of no value. Contrast our culture with that with China, where the old people are valued for their experience and wisdom.  Getting back to the present book, in addition to the several points Dark Genius discusses, such as slavery, that make this a more adult novel, there are a number of other themes that are more mature, some of which became standard Heinlein fare in later adult works. These include the pervasive corruption of government officials, the odiousness of most governments in general, and their virtually ubiquitous abuse of power. Heinlein feels that such governments richly deserve to be violently overthrown and destroyed down to their very foundations.  Then there is the self-imposed, almost ritual poverty of Baslim, the beggar; the over-regimentation, authoritarianism, and bloodthirsty cruelty of the dominant society; the importance of education and knowledge as power; the moral and ethical obligation of duty and of an unfree citizen to overthrow unjust authority; and many others.   Another interesting idea is the female as the aggressor in initiating a romantic relationship, which Thorby encounters for the first time in the Sisu trading ship--which is actually how things normally work in both primate and human society. :-) And in Heinlein's books, the female is often the more intelligent and educated of the two partners, as in his story Gulf, Mr. and Mrs. Stone in The Rolling Stones, and in the case of Valentine Michael Smith's parents in Stranger in a Strange Land.  Another way to think about the book is that it is basically a Heinleinian, Sci-Fi version of the rags to riches tale, as you watch Thorby's rise from a poor, ignorant, beggar boy to one of the richest and most powerful men on earth. Overall I think Citizen of the Galaxy counts as one of Heinlein's best novels, whether juvenile or adult 
 I just completed reading this book and I can't get enough!  If you are ready to roll up your sleves and study the truth of God's Word this is for you.  It gives you pratical and sound skills for digging deep into the vast riches of God's word. I have studied for years but this is a systematic approach to Bible study and it allows you to first search out the scriptures for themsselves and then refer to other resources such as comentaries and word study guides as a source of enrichment rather than a foundation to you understanding and interpretation 
 I have studied this book and author as well as theosphy and comparative religions, philosophy, science of mind for over 20 years and the truth contained in H.P.Blavatsky's writings as well as intuitive knowledge have  caused me great joy and massive yearning for additional lifetimes of  study...I highly reccomend this book for serious students of lifes  mysteries and higher learning 
 Paula, I think we are sisters, but I'm not sure! :)  I got on line and got tickets to your show here in Nashville in August, and about that time, UPS delivered your book!!! I could not put it down.  Some of the stories that you tell, I could have told word for word. (the peeing your pants story topping the list!! I did the same thing in a candy store when I was about 10 yrs old!!!)  I just about fell through the floor when I read that story.  Your writing is phenomenal. As I read, it feels like a conversation between friends, or sisters. I felt you in the room with me, and could hear your powerful, wonderful laugh.  Lady, I knew you had guts, but to put yourself out there in this way makes me respect you even more. You are one heck of a lady, and I would give anything to meet you some day.  I see a trip to Savannah in my future.  Thanks for every single word! HUGZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ 
 Seeing what this book was about, I thought it had no chance of holding my interest.  However, once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down.  Manchester really makes this history read like a first class novel 
 Great with a mixed-age group of kids in church-school.  The kids eagerly answered the questions, and it had something for the 3 year olds and the 12 year olds 
 For years I was mystified by the popularity of "Seinfeld," the comedy about nothing.  Nothing of any substance ever happened, and the protagonists were a bunch of shallow jerks.  The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series adopts the "Seinfeld" motif, but here we have a "Seinfeld" of a superior sort.  Nothing much happens in the stories, but the protagonists are a group of admirable characters.  Seinfeld & Co. worked through mundane situations with the "hurrah for me, the heck with you" attitude that scars so much of postmodern secular society.  In contrast Mma Ramotswe and her cadre of of friends confront the mundane with humble dignity and depth of character.  If you, the reader, can come away from the stories without feeling a deep affection and respect for Mma Ramotswe's circle of friends, you are hard-hearted indeed.  The success of the series can be attributed to the effectiveness with which Alexander McCall Smith mines the same comedic vein so well done in the Rumpole stories--large repertorie cast, engaging (but flawed) protagonists, dead-on observations of the human condition, and all leavened with good humor and good will.  In this latest installment, Mma Ramotswe again confronts situations which are at once slap-your-knee funny, scratch-your-head thought provoking, and dab-your-eye compelling, and she handles them with skill and savy.  Smith even works in a send-up of Sherlock Holmes' deductive methods, as Mma Ramotswe attempts to apply them with mixed results.  
 Only the facts that a seasoned Chinese cook who lives amongst the Han Chinese for decades will have an insight into these subtle notions of enhancing Chinese foods.  Few or none of the other so-called Chinese cookery books in the West have any of these well-known ideas of flavoring - facts known to those in the Far East of course - and few bother to print stories on these facts 
 It had been three years since the release of Jets first album ,"Get Born" so I was very excited for the release of "Shine On" This album is simply amazing. I dont know what other word to use. Almost ever song is great. Some of my favorites include....  Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is  Hey Kids  Stand Up   Shine On  Skin and Bones 
 While the CD I previously reviewed was for the Sony budget CD entitled  "Big Bad John and Other Fabulous Songs and Tales," this is my  review of the Bear Family compilation entitled "Big Bad John."   While this CD does have all of the songs on the CD I previously reviewed,  this collection does have many of the singles A & B as well as the  entire "Big Bad John and Other Fabulous Songs and Tales" album,  although unlike the Sony disc, this CD does have the version of the title  track that has a lyric that goes "at the bottom of the mine lies one  hell of a man, Big John," rather than the lyric "at the bottom of  the mine lies a big, big man" that was used on the Sony budget disc of  the "Big Bad John..." album and also appears on Sony/Legacy's  "Greatest Hits" CD.  Because the extra songs on this disc are  first rate, it's worth buying this CD if you can afford the cost.  This  disc only goes up to 1962 while the "Greatest Hits" collection  goes up to 1966 and both CD's are a must have as his recordings do have  great sound, they both have liner notes and great remastering, while this  Bear Family CD does have a discography of songs he recorded in 1961-1962 in  the booklet as well.  Before I had this disc today, I long had the Sony  budget CD which has just as great sound as this import but the extra songs  do justify the cost of this disc very well to the point that I gave the  Sony budget CD to a local radio station who has been playing the tracks off  of the album ever since.  A couple of the songs are previously unreleased  on LP and they are just great and this disc is recommended to all Jimmy  Dean fans who want more than what "Greatest Hits" offers, but  "Greatest Hits" offers the basics and nothing else for those who  only want the hits or those who are new to his music.  This is for the  people who are already fans just like myself 
 This is the perfect book for those interested in the art and science of examining and interpreting the built landscape. Providing the same instruction as an intro-level Historic Preservation course, it teaches the  reader the process for building documentation , as well as some of the  other basics of the Historic Preservation profession.  The beautiful  photographs, drawings, and illustrations clarify the more-difficult ideas.   Not for the casual building-enthusiast, but it will greatly add to the  enjoyment of the more serious vernacular architecture fan 
 Larry Cohen's GOD TOLD ME TO is one of the most intelligent, gritty horror/thrillers ever made! In New York, a series of mass murders occur with each perpetrator saying the title phrase. But is there something more going on here? Tony Lo Bianco is excellent as the devout Catholic policeman who is investigating this bizarre phenomenon and discovers something really shocking about himself along the way! As with most cult movies, GOD TOLD ME TO must be seen to be believed; it's a genuinely thought-provoking and scary thriller that raises interesting questions about religion. The visual style is amazing; it inspired the look of shows like NYPD BLUE and 24. In the tradition of the best science fiction movies, GOD TOLD ME TO raises more questions than answers, and very important questions at that. Don't miss it 
 In this recording of all jazz standards, Kurt Rosenwinkle provides a number of fresh, tasty solos which make listening to this CD a pleasure. Unfortunately, the piano player isn't quite up to speed on this date, playing a little behind the beat and struggling a bit on his solos. Most people probably won't even notice, however, as the guitarist more than makes up for this slight deficiency with his distinctive sound and deft playing. KR excels especially on the last track, "Conception," which is worth the price of the disk all on its own.  All in all, a date which is sure to please straight-ahead jazz lovers and, perhaps, may influence cross-over audiences to delve further into the rich, century-old tradition of jazz music. 
 I have literally read thirteen books on screenwriting technique and story development and this one easily trumps every single one of them. I have used his guide on every screenplay I've ever completed, one of which is already in development.  If you are looking for a book which can expand your ideas into full-length screenplays without having to write to Hollywood's block-buster market, "Twelve Steps" will arm you with the perspective, creativity, courage and form to do so.    Among other things, Walker engages his readers in the creative process, developing one's own voice, and structuring that voice around ancient story-telling techniques (like the warrior myth). In twelve steps, you can easily expand a phrase like "tampering with nature | leads to | nature getting out of control" into an entire film like Jurassic Park.  Piece by piece, bit by bit.  Don't get me wrong, the writing process is still long and does require substantial effort, but if you are committed and looking for a guide to take you to the next level, Twelve Steps is the only choice.  Everyone has an idea, but unless you know how to cultivate it, it will never see the light of day 
 The paper towel holder is great, although doesn't quite stand up straight. A slight lean to one side is not detrimental, but I tend to try to straighten it every time I walk in the kitchen. 
 Great book for your child's collection. After looking for cows, pigs, horses, sheep, frogs, etc. and the standard animals found in most books - this book is a refreshing change of pace for the adult. Just the right amount of rhyming words to hold the attention of a toddler. My 18 month old daughter loves it. She points out all the belly buttons on all the pages, and then on any stuffed animals or people nearby. If you don't mind being silly when you read to your children, this book is a must. 
 I found this book to be an excellent resource for historical, cultural, and economic issues relating to the Palestinians.  However, the authors have written with a discernable, pro-Palestinian bias.  The bias is definitely anti-Britian, anti-American, and anti-Israeli.  The authors' attempt at fairness by criticizing Arafat does not make the book balanced overall.  If you can read past the biases, there is some excellent information in this book on the plight of the Palestinian people.  The authors could have achieved five stars with me by just presenting the facts about the Palestinians and omitting the frequent condescensions

 Robert Motherwell, is one of the great geniuses of American art. His Paintings are broad and powerful images; more "pure" than many other of the abstract painters of his day. This is a superlative book, which lets you into Motherwells mind. Any reader will see his sharp criticism and poignant observations, those who are open will take them to heart 
 If you're not getting a good night's sleep, and conventional ideas haven't worked, then GOOD NIGHT: THE SLEEP DOCTOR'S 4-WEEK PROGRAM TO BETTER SLEEP AND BETTER HEALTH takes the next step. It comes from a Senior VP of Clinical Operations at a sleep clinic on the cutting edge of sleep research, and offers up a survey which outlines 6 common reasons for sleep disturbance, how to fix short-term and long-term problems, and how to refine the art of napping. Any sleep-deprived sufferer needs this.  Diane C. Donovan California Bookwatc 
 Nancy and Lawrence Goldstone loved reading and they loved books, cheap paperbacks led to hard covers, which led to 1st editions. Before they knew it, the Goldstones, were not only book collectors they were beginning to seriously consider spending the "big bucks" real book collecting requires. Where once an ancient leather bound edition of Dickens had them running for the bookstore exit, by the middle of their story the Goldstones become captivated if not obsessed with such books.   In terms of learning the ins and outs of book collecting, there isn't a ton of information much here. The joy of this book is following a couple that love books. From basement stores in New England to first class offices in New York, the travel from book nook to book store looking for the best deals. Like any hobby, they flirt with obsession and the real drama comes not from the books, but from the people, the other "book freaks", they meet along the way.  "Used & Rare" is an eye-opening look into a world of musty paper, bookworms, and great literature. 
 After reading Dave Andersons' Column in "Dealer" magazine, I ordered 25 copies of his book, one for each salesperson.  We listen to his tapes in weekly salesmeetings.  Finally, I invited him to speak to our  staff about Leadership.   His books have changed our entire outlook.  We  are now a dealership with a vision.  I just asked him to return for another  3 day session.  He definitely gets us going 
 I searched for these pants and only after putting the style number in online was I able to find them on Amazon. Although I paid a little bit more for them, I will order more colors. These pants are great for everyday wear and comfortable for working out in the gym. Plenty of pocket room as well 
 This is a great bag.  It has lots of pockets, storage areas, and extremely good protection for the laptop.  The only downside is that the bag weighs a lot, even before you put the laptop in it.  It has ergonomic nested handles and a padded, stretchy shoulder strap which helps, but does not counter, the extreme weight of the bag and laptop together.  Needs wheels at this weight 
 Dodson just keeps getting better. This one has everything a classic hard-boiled PI mystery should: murderous biker gangs, corrupt politicians, and the wealthy who'll stop at nothing to get even wealthier. The ongoing saga of Colton Parker's struggle to raise his teenage daughter, his resitance of faith, and the agonizingly slow-to-kindle romantic spark with his former FBI partner add great depth to his character. Of course, it also keeps us wanting more. I highly recommend this series to any mystery fan 
 The car seat protectors have worked well over the past several months I have owned them. They are a little too big and interfere with my kids trying to buckle their seatbelt.

 One of better movies from Jacq Clusoe series, although not the best. There are some dull moments but also plenty of laughs supported by Peter Sellers antics. Recommended for "Pink Panther" series funs but also for those who love European comedies in general.  
 This is the story of Elizabeth Turrill Bentley. No one suspected a "well-bred, Vassar educated descendent of Puritan Clergy" would join a communist party and run "two of the most productive spy rings in America." That is exactly what Bentley, code name Clever Girl, did. Equally unexpected was her transformation from spy to FBI informant.   It all started in March of 1935 when Bentley was lured to an American League Against War and Fascism meeting by a neighbour. It turned out to be a front for the Communist Party. Kessler's descriptions draw the reader into the setting and give an idea of the atmosphere, as well as Bentley's mentality. Clever Girl attempts to shed light on the motivations of the most important woman to affect the McCarthy Era.   Bentley's early dealings with the party made her feel important and independent. She lived in a one room apartment and was unemployed. She was lonely. Going to meetings may have started off as a social event but it turned into something more. A calling. She was impressionable. In the opening chapter I felt she had been brainwashed and lured into the fold because of her loneliness, desire to have a family and ties with others.   Shortly after joining, Bentley met and fell in love with soviet handler Jacob Golos whom she affectionately called Yasha. Golos was the glue that attached Bentley to the party for years despite him not being as loyal to her. She let him interpret the world for her through his communist eyes. Regardless of what she gave up for him, it is because of her association with Golos she was able to move up through the ranks. After only 6 years (1935-1941), Bentley was running things.   When it was discovered he was no longer in control she had to fight to maintain her status. She quickly became deemed a problem and after Golos death her status was taken away. Although Kessler doesn't come out and say it, I think this had more to do with her being a woman than the fact she was an American in a high ranking, Soviet spy position.   When things started to look worse, she decided it as time to go to the FBI for help. In exchange Bentley named hundreds of Americans involved with the party. It is incomprehensible, the number of people who willingly supplied sensitive information from the Treasury Department to the party. It isn't so hard to believe or see the Soviet Union (the US wartime ally) as an "evil-doer" but what is difficult to believe is that Americans could be spies against their own country.   What I found most interesting was not Bentley's plunge into the depths of communism but her relationship with the FBI and media after she became an informant; as well as her flip flop between a secure, independent woman of means and a neurotic paranoid, probably brought on by the alcohol abuse.   Bentley played a game with both sides, never winning in either. She survived under a short-lived spotlight in each. Being an FBI informant wasn't as glamorous as being a Soviet spy. As a spy she basically worked alone and had control over what happened to her. As an FBI informant she was constantly scrutinized by the FBI, congress and most indignantly by the media. Her life was never normal. While most days I think she reveled in the limelight I also think that she longed for privacy, but mostly I think she longed for their respect.  The stereotypes of this time period are evident and well known. Bentley was a woman in a male dominated society. She held a high-ranking position but she was never really respected for it. Not by the Soviets, the FBI, nor the media who directed lots of name calling her way. If she had been a man I wonder what their views would have been of her and how she would have been handled. Clever Girl shows the life of Elizabeth Bentley, the past she couldn't outrun and the price she paid for the choices she made. Kessler's interpretation of the facts is worth reading both for its historical and entertainment value.   Review Originally Posted at http://www.linearreflections.co

  Future Amateur Operator:  I purchased both this (Now You're Talking) and "Amateur Radio for Dummies."  I only had time to read "Now You're Talking" before the next ham test.  I read, studied and passed the first time through.  Believe me, if I can do it, you can.  In this book, you will find all the questions that make up the test.    Make sure you get the 5th edition.  It features the latest pool of questions.  Sure, you can go online and take practice exams, but nothing beats actually understanding the answers.  Get this book!  Good luck on the exam!

 My wife and I were unfamiliar with Billy Collins until we recently heard him on "A Prairie Home Companion."  We were delighted to find this album, which includes most of the poems he read on the air.  The poems are great in print, but there's no substitute for the poet's laconic delivery, and this album has the added feature of his explaining the origin of each poem.  An unexpected bonus for me, a somewhat senior citizen, was finding that my 28-year-old daughter enjoyed the album as much as I did.  A word of warning, though:  Do not drive or operate machinery while listening to this album.  Lines that crack you up beyond control can sneak up on you!  (One downside:  Bill Murray's introduction is pretty lame unless you're a really big fan of his. 
 Pulp magazines were long gone before I was even a gleam in my father's eye and yet they have always held a tremendous fascination for me and are one of the very few things I collect today.  The great thing about collecting pulps is that while many range into the thousands of dollars, many more such as the Sci-Fi pulps of the 50's are very affordable.  "The Incredible Pulps:  A Gallery of Fiction Magazine Art" focuses on one of the main reasons that people collect pulps...the incredible artwork, particularly those covers that just had to have mesmerized kids and adults back in the 30's and 40's.  Writer Frank M. Robinson (who also wrote the very excellent Pulp Culture) provides a brief, but enlightening history of pulp magazines, beginning with Argosy Magazines decision to move from slick magazine, to all-fiction pulp.  One of the great things about pulps is that they virtually could appeal to any person due to the diversity of subject matter.  The pulps covered it all:  crime, mystery, western, romance, adventure, war, horror, Sci-Fi, sports...if it had a possible audience, there was probably a pulp to suit them.  But perhaps the most popular were the hero pulps featuring characters like The Shadow, Doc Savage, and The Spider.  The popular misconception was that the pulps were written by hacks but some of the great writers of the first half of the 20th century wrote for pulps, among them:  Edgar Rice Burroughs, Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, Ray Bradbury, H.P. Lovecraft, and Frederick Faust AKA Max Brand.  But this book is not about the stories, but rather that beautiful, often terrifying and downright shocking artwork.  The artists are as legendary as the writers:  Virgil Finlay, J. Allen St. John, George Rozen, and Frank Kelly Freas to name just a few.  It was their job to create covers that would grab the attention of readers in a very crowded and competitive market.  Today their works are worth thousands and many of them are on display in this great collection.  The book reprints hundreds of pulp covers and is divided by four main genres:  Sci-Fi, Horror, Mystery/Detective, Adventure/Western.  The book provides the name and date of the issue and the artists name if known.  Tragically, so many of the artist names have been lost to history.  The covers are reprinted beautifully and seemingly from flawless copies of the pulp.  Frank Paul was one of the very early greats and did many classic covers for Amazing Stories in the 20's and 30's.  He was a man well ahead of his time and his imagination was limitless as his paintings foreshadowed many technical advances that would not take place for decades.  J. Allen St. John is best know for his Tarzan illustrations but a great cover in this book features Burroughs' other great character John Carter of Mars from Amazing Stories January 1941, for the story John Carter and the Giant of Mars.  My favorite pulps have always been the horror and weird menace pulps.  So gruesome were some of the covers that the government eventually had to step in and force the publishers to clean them up a bit.  One great cover is by Grave Gladney for Dime Mystery August 1937, showing a woman about to be sliced in half by a very large paper cutter.    George Rozen may be my favorite pulp artists of all-time.  His Shadow covers were beautifully sinister.  The cover to Shadow January 1933 is one of the all-time great covers showing a skeletal shadow emerging from behind a curtain.  You think gore is a product of modern times?  Then check out Rudolph Relarski's cover to Thrilling Detective from August 1940.  It shows a table full of decapitated heads and a man locked in a stock, about to be the next victim of an evil Asian's sword.  The book reprints numerous Rozen Shadow and Doc Savage covers.    It's really a great little book that anyone who is a pulp or pop culture illustration fan will love.  I do have a couple of minor complaints though.  First, there are no cover reprints from Weird Tales, arguably the most famous pulp ever.  I can only assume that since Weird Tales is still being produced that perhaps the rights could not be obtained.  Since there is no Weird Tales covers there are no examples, and not even a mention of Margaret Brundage, one of the truly great pulp cover artists.  That aside, I highly recommend this book.

 I've been into Haste the Day since Burning Bridges and I know that their first singer Jimmy Ryan was sick on screaming vocals.. you can't deny any of his talent on songs like Substance or American Love but with his departure they had to find someone and I couldn't be happier with their pick. Haste the Day still have all the great vocal parts and they still have the sick breakdowns thrown in for fun. The production is fabulous on this record so I'll point that out as well. There are very few CDs where the last track keeps you wanting to let the CD repeat itself but Chorus of Angels is that song and it provides the perfet ending. I really have to hand it to HTD, it takes a lot to come back from a singer leaving but they should really proud of the effort and it's a really enjoyable CD from beginning to end. The DVD is really good too! It's got a lot of footage and Jimmy's last show with them.. well worth it to seem the play Blue 42! I won't spoil it. Keep going HTD 
 Not 2pacs best ever but it would not be expected as this is originally material which didnt make the cut to earlier LP's such as all eyez on me and The 7 day theory. However saying that this still beats all competition hands down showing 2pac's true talent for song writing and delivery.  All songs have been remixed and remastered to give a 2002 feel with a great mix of R n B, traditional hip hop and chilled acoustic beats (as heard on me and my girlfriend).   This LP however is in danger of betraying what tupac stood for and becoming another sellout. This is seen with Nas , 2pac's sworn public enemy appearing on Thugz Mansion. It is rumoured that Nas and Pac were friends underneath the public persona, however Nas is put in the shade by Pac on this track. This underlines how unique 2pac was , as Nas is one of the best emcees around now, yet never comes close to replicating the passion that 2pac had.  Not his greatest album, yet in comparision to others that year it is definatley in the top two perhaps just ahead of the eminem show. This echoes the fact that 2pacs legend will never die and shows that he is not just one of the greatest rap artsist that ever lived , but also one of the most infulencial people that ever lived; infulencing a generation to rise up against opression in society 
 'In a Moorish Market Place' on vinyl soothed my soul as a teenager in the late '60s and still affects me the same way today.  His mingling of classical and jazz styles spoke to my heart and soul.  His style is mellow yet moving, steady but not pushy.  I still have my tattered albums and I'm delighted to have his music on CD.  It's said 'You can never go home again', but music is the exception and Don Shirley does it best 
 Though perhaps not as exciting as... as... well, its not really very exciting at all.  Professor Tilly rips to shreds nineteenth century notions of how populations organize to form dissent.  His   findings are often shocking.  To summarize, he has discovered that most often populations organize in somewhat of a star shaped pattern when organizing to resist oppressive regimes, whereas they organize in a more free-flowing pattern (somewhat suggestive of radio waves when advocating Marxist revolution 
 My 3 year old son received this as a Christmas gift last year and he loves it.  He explores outside and collects things from the yard and hauls them around in the truck.  Must say the truck is durable, it stays out on the deck and the weather doesn't effect it.  We hose it down to clean it, no issues there.  Highly recommend 
 Bought these on sale and am quite pleased.  Totally non-stick but I have not had them long enough to comment on their durability 
 I remember listening to this album a lot. You could tell a lot of hard work went into it. I would put it up against anything going at the time including efforts by the Beatles. It's one of the great unknown albums of rock 
 All I want to say about the movie, seeing as how it already has been touched on by 670 something people before me is that this film is beautiful and deep and entertaining. The negative things that people say are unwarranted i.e. "The faces have no emotion" actually they have alot of expressions, the cgi is exceptional and there is a fine range of emotion. The biggest complaint people have is that the movie isn't "Final Fantasy", this is of course coming from those people that love the RPG games and think anything attached to the "Final Fantasy" title has to have "swords and potions". I'm just trying to tell you guys that this film explores a beautifully animated and completely realized world and alot of work was put into the film. Almost anyone with an open mind is bound to enjoy this movie and acknowledge how hard the filmmakers worked to bring it to the screen.  
                                        A book I have read was the Julius Caesar , The play was rather confusing because of the old dialog and the setting was played back in the ancient Rome. The story line was interesting and kept me thinking what was going to happen next.                                       There were many different characters with different Roman names , they were kind of confusing to keep track of because of the Unique Roman names. The plot was interesting, there were many people who though Caesar had to much power with were the consperitors and planed to assassinate him. It was kind of weird in my opinion that the People included in the assassination of Julius Caesar would bathe there hands on his blood so no one else would get credit for it. 
 This slender tome won't tell you much you couldn't learn from David Halberstam's far denser treatment of this decade in his lively book "The Fifties."  Nor will it provide the context necessary for a complete grasp of any of the discrete subjects touched upon, such as the golden age of television, the early civil rights movement, the Korean War, the Cold War, the nuclear family, or the Eisenhower administration.  And of course no history book could hope to accurately capture the experiences of all who lived in the very large and diverse USA during any decade.  But this is an engaging summary of the cultural generalizations that can be made about this time and place, and an excellent outline of the experiences shared by many Americans such as the cold war, the fear of communism, nuclear anxieties, the influence of television, and conformist pressures.  This would be a good introduction for late high schoolers, early college students, or any history novice who simply wants a bird's-eye view.  Alternatively, this would be a good book to read after Halberstam's book, and other more in-depth treatments, to reinforce the salient points.  The well-chosen photographs provide further insights.      
 Should have been five stars, but omission of "A Change Is Gonna Come" (Rolling Stone recently ranked it the #12 song of all time) is indefensible.

 I was handed Blow from a friend and finished it within a busy schedule in less than a nine days.  It is the unbelievable story of George Jung's life from being a small town local hero, to becoming deeply seeded in the Colombian drug trade.  He managed to make more than 100 million dollars before he was caught for the last time and his extraordinary life leaves you nothing but dumbfounded.    My favorite aspect of this novel is that you fall in love with and root for the bad-guy.  The reader never really acknowledges George as the enemy even though he is part of a murderous, criminal trade.  Because his personality is so likeable you disregard many of the immoral things that he does.  How he plays the prison game and makes friends everywhere he goes.  George even manages to befriend Senor Pablo Escobar.  As a white kid from suburbia this feat is astonishing.    The story is written through a mix of George's and author Bruce Porter's point of view and with interviews from several of his close friends and colleagues you can understand his life and actions from every point of view.  George's dialogue is especially captivating because he is such a humble, carefree man with it seems no fear and complete control.    Since the book is vulgar and sometimes portrays cocaine use in a humorous and unapologetic fashion I would recommend the book for at least, mature late teens.  This book instantly became a new favorite of mine and because it is a true story I think it is especially unbelievable.  This intensely researched and complete chronicle of George Jung's life is one of the most irresistible stories I have ever read. 
 This book is informative, insightful, and intelligent.  It's not a trendy cookbook with a lot of flash, it's just got good recipes that come out perfect.  I highly recommend it to any cook 
 I don't read "The Cat Who..." books for mystery or thrills. I read them for their charm and warmth, to visit old friends again, to walk down the streets of Pickax and browse the shops, to admire Quill's reserved intelligence and thoughtfulness, and to play with Yum Yum and Koko as they race up and down the ramps in the apple barn. By that measure, "The Cat Who Went Bananas" is a wonderful and thoroughly enjoyable addition to Braun's series.  Some reviewers have criticized the ending as vague or unclear, but I found it more realistic than endings where everything is wrapped up neatly. In real life, nothing is wrapped up neatly. If you view these books as character studies of idealized small town life, then the ending was more appropriate, more fitting, and more satisfying.  If you're looking for a comfortable, cozy reunion with your friends in Moose County, you'll enjoy this book 
 You would think that this album put Herbie Hancock on the map.  Nope he was already there.  This was just Hancock reinventing himself, setting new paths in music, challenging the norm.  Chameleon is of course the most popular and familiar song on the album.  He takes the keyboards and invents new sounds fusing it with drum beats, horns and unconventional instruments challenging your sense of music and interpretation.  No this is not contemporary jazz.  This is an extension of classic jazz.  A big difference.  Hancock's a musical genius. This is a must buy.  5 stars. Keep swingin. 
 After my husband died suddenly, I was beside myself. My aunt insisted on placing this book in my hands. It has been a lifeline to me. I have purchased well over 20 copies of it for friends and continue to haunt my local bookstore when they don't have it on the shelf for immediate purchase. Having read almost every grief book out there, don't waste your money, just buy this one and learn to live again. 
 I received the cover, and it fits just as the picture indicates, it comes down to about the wheel. I leave charcoal underneath mine, and haven't had any problems with rain soaking it. The cover is heavy-duty and seems to be a very good quality. I'm pleased with my purchase 
 For me, cookbooks have two functions. The first is to  act as a spur to the imagination. A properly provocative  cookbook would be one you could browse through with the same  pleasure that you might take in reading an adventure novel.  You get to have the excitement withoutthe danger (or the calories).  As an added benefit, you increase the store of ideas from  which you put together your own cooking. Seen in this light,  a book that offers you recipes that you might never make or  suggests ingredients that you could never find is doing you  a favor: it is developing your imagination. Maybe I don't have  Chinese five-spice powder or galangal, but I wonder how that  recipe would work with dried ginger or a cinnamon, salt and  fennel mixture.  The other function, of course, is to provide the cook with  recipes and information on the craft of cooking. There are  certain constraints on the cook's imagination and some  experiments not worth pursuing. A good cookbook tells you  what works and what doesn't. As a bonus, sometimes a cookbook  is just plain fun-to-read.  As a writer of wine books, I try to spur the imagination,  suggest the limits and come up with a good read. Let's  see how Bernard Clayton's New Complete Book of Breads  stacks up.  In terms of igniting the imagination, Clayton does a  pretty good job. He explores the many different faces  of bread throughout the world and makes them seem  accessible to the home cook. By stressing the use of  Rapid-Rise yeast, baking with Clayton becomes a relatively  quick affair. At culinary school, I gave his recipe  for Cuban bread to classes that had four hours to prepare  lunch for the public. Their bread always came out on time  and made a great impression. The book is not comprehensive,  but its range is wide.  Bread-making can seem complicated and there's no end of  books that delve  into the complications. Clayton's treatment  is straight forward, enough information so you understand  what you're doing, not so much that the process seems inaccessible.  The novice baker who has gained some confidence can go on to  incorporating techniques like slow rise and sourdough.  The book is also a good read. Clayton's introductions to  each recipe are well-written and apropos. As a gift or  as a single reference for a cook whe's expanding his reach,  this is the best of the reference-cookbooks on bread.

 It is a tragic, heart wrenching account of an unfortunate simple man, Yakov Bok, a handyman, a Fixer. He is also a Jew, living during waning days of Tsar Nichols II. He is falsely accused of murdering a boy of 10, a case reminiscent of Dryfus affair, who was also falsely charged and sent to prison, later exonerated, however. It is a remarkable tale of suffering, faith, hatred, endurance and above all triumph of truth. One is helpless when the whole state, the establishment commits such dastardly act. Yakov is doomed as wherever he turns he runs into blood drenched anti-Semitic wall. He spends horrifying three years in solitary confinement just to get his indictment. He waits and he fights against insurmountable odds, never compromising on his principals. Finally Yakov gets his indictment and goes to trial. This book must rank among the best 100 books of 20th cenury.  Before we tell ourselves that such horrible deeds do not occur in our free society, think of Abu Gharib, Gauntanamo and recent revelation of kidnapping of passengers and flying them to foreign countries for interrogation under torture. How many Yakovs are in prison today?

 If you do an advanced search on Amazon for "mysteries published in 1970" you'll first find a lot of Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew books, and some by old reliables Mickey Spillane, Ross MacDonald, and John Dickson Carr. Then there's the newcomer, Tony Hillerman with his first anthropological (or is it "anthropomystical" ?) mystery and hero Joe Leaphorn.   While the cultural/spiritual side of things is never far from the goings-on in a Hillerman story, they overshadow the crime/thriller element in this novel. That's not necessarily a bad thing; the mystery in this case is very slight and makes use of some convenient scapegoating at the end (not unlike secondary character Bergen McKee's theory on Navajo Wolves). The book gives us only the briefest character sketch of Leaphorn (he's absent from a lot of it), and we don't find out much about his wife or co-workers (half the fun - and sadness - of the later books). The transformation of McKee from milquetoasty professor to wilderness he-man is overdone and/or underexplained; fortunately it's a problem Hillerman avoids in the future. Even if things end up a bit too nicely, you've still been entertained for a few hours and learned a thing or two in the process - and bringing things into a harmony is a big part of the story, after all.   Hillerman is a remarkable author. He is able to tell his story in a way that keeps readers engaged while imparting pages of folklore that in lesser hands would put an audience to sleep. Then consider that he's been able to carve out a niche without much competition for thirty-plus years. That means either a) people aren't really interested in this kind of story (not true, or he wouldn't be writing them for three decades), or b) it's a very hard kind of story to write (persuading other authors to stay away and write things with helicopter explosions).  If you're a fan of the Leaphorn series or are looking to make his acquaintance, give this book a read. It's not his best, but it's better than a lot of other things published in 1970 (Three Days of the Condor, excepted, of course - as is Shaft) 
 It's a compilation, so you expect to hear all of the hits of one of the best groups of all time, and that's exactly what you hear on this CD.  For those like me that never replaced the EWF albums with CDs, this is a must have because you get the best of the best on one CD.  There are always a few songs that you wish had made the cut, but you will not regret owning this CD.  The EWF concert in Vegas in Sept. proved yet again that this is one of the best bands to ever grace the stage.  Thirty years later, they are still amazing

 I started watching this show as reruns in '96 on Comedy Central and could not believe I was actually seeing the results of rare comedic geniuses.   Not many things crack me up anymore, but I was hooked after seeing this.  It even inspired me to visit London for the first time.   This is one of those rare syzygical moments in comedy that will always be remembered.   A must have unless you're an uptight conservative snob!   Get 4 DVD set only.  The newer DVD set is funny, but the magic is hardly there any more.

 Movie:  I finally got around watching one of Asian cinema's finest classics, Ringo Lam's "City on Fire."  I must say I was really impressed.  The film starts off on a little shaky ground but soon gains its footing and takes off when Chow's character (also named Chow) reluctantly goes undercover.  I really like the scenes where he's first tailed and then actually *hunted* by rival cops who seem to want nothing short of him being dead.  The ending is just incredible, not just the fireworks, but the way loyalty plays out.  The film is worth watching just for the last 30 minutes, although the rest is also well-paced and the part with the girlfriend thing is a little boring but does add dimensions to the Chow character, thanks to Chow Yun-fat's good acting.  DVD:  I know I'm not a purist when it comes to foreign films, and I usually don't like subtitles (esp. chop suey subtitles), so forgive me for saying I actually liked the dubbing job on this one.  There's no Chinese soundtrack on this at all, just English dub.  I thought the voice actors did a pretty good job, much better than any other dubbed foreign film I've seen.  The ADR remix was also really good, and they even have an English song worked into a nightclub scene.  I'm usually turned off by the high-pitched and cacophonous audio effects of Hong Kong films, but the American remix engineers did a very nice job at pairing surround sound audio with the great visual experience Ringo Lam has given us 
 This was an excellent book.  Before giving my own personal review of it though I'd like to answer a few of the critics of the book (as in the critics in the Amazon reviews below)  -------------------------------------------------- As per M. Duffy comments under "So What?" M. declares that "She's not changing for any man."  This sounds like the comments of someone who expects that any man who's with her should change everything about himself to suit her.  The fact is that relationships are a TWO-WAY street: this book is meant to be one-half of the overall issue (the author is very clear about this).  The book in no way says that "men should do whatever they want and women should only do what the man wants them to do."  If that's how M. Duffy read the book, she's sadly mistaken.  If she knows that the book isn't saying the above but she's pretending that's what it's saying, then she's simply being intellectually dishonest, making her review irrelevant.  As per I. Bodden's comments: Her review is just drooling with disdain for anyone who doesn't have as high and mighty of views as she does.  Perhaps it's time to open her eyes to the fact that not everyone has the "knowledge" that she does, and perhaps a lot of these "obvious" things are not so obvious.  Her cheap shots at 'religious' people also reveals either that 1. she's simply had bad experience with 'religious' people (which is unfortunate, but you cannot judge any philosophy/religion by its illogical outworkings) or 2. her own mind is too tiny to comprehend the idea of the supernatural (I find that most people only accuse other people of having 'closed minds' when that particular person disagrees with the one who's making the accusation) or 3. (and most likely) she is too afraid to think that there may just be a higher power. ---------------------------------------------------       On with the actual review of this book!  (I should note that I'm  not a woman... a close female friend of mine lent this book to my wife who read it and then wanted my opinion, which is why I read it.)       This book is not meant to be an exhaustive study - the book itself (not including excerpts from other readings at the end) is only 188 pages...obviously this won't cover every last thing.  In other words, I can understand Emily E. Spinozzi's comments in her review, but this book is not meant to cover as in depth as she was hoping.  The book serves as an excellent INTRODUCTION to issues surrounding what many (not all) men want.  Nowhere in the book does Feldhahn claim that ALL MEN feel/want the things that are in this book.  That is to say that throughout the book, Feldhahn talks about how MOST men want/feel such and such.  You may read this book and your husband/boyfriend/etc may disagree with the entire book.  That's not the point.  The point is that MANY men feel/want the things in this book, so it's worth considering the things in this book.  Some of the topics/thoughts covered in this book are:  - "a man's need to have his judgment respected" - "don't tell him how" - "the most fragile thing on the planet" - "I have no earthy idea how to do this" - "the imposter at work" - "affirmation is everything" - "create a safety zone" - "haunted by romantic failures" - "it's difficult to change gears" - "playing together is very romantic" - "when you take care of yourself, I feel loved"           Since my wife and I both read the book it was funny to compare how according to the book I was sometimes more of a 'woman' and she was more of a 'man.'  Again, this book does not claim to be an exhaustive apologetic on how EVERY MAN feels.  This book is a simple, very quick read (I read it in about 3 quick sittings) - if you're looking for a complex, very in depth look at male/female relationships, look elsewhere.    I believe this book achieves every aspect of its authorial intent: a tool to help open the eyes of women as to just what their man might be feeling/thinking.  Enjoy 
 This book was in good shape and was delivered in a good time 
 I laughed, I cried, and I laughed again. Randy and Quentin will be my forever heroes. A couple of chapters were hard to read - not because the author didn't write them well, but because reality is often painful. I tried to imagine what Randy went through during his research for this book and I am overwhelmed with admiration for both Quentin and Randy. Well done 
 This book is a valuable and inspirational tool for anyone wanting to bolster their career 
 BEST PENTAGRAM ALBUM!!!!!  This is darker than any ''black metal'' cd you could come up with!!  This is also a PERSONAL FAVE of mine!!  TIMELESS DOOM!!!!! 
 I am a deeply religious Sikh living in America.  The Four Quartets is to me a shining example of a man of deep understanding of God and reality.  I have read this poem many times since I first read it back in college.  It speaks directly to my soul.  There is no passage, no phrase, which does not work for me.  I read some sections to my wife when we were first married, and she thought that it was an English translation of the Sikh holy texts.  "We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring  Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time"  There is no better explanation of Eastern religion than this.  I am eternally grateful for this work 
 I like this book it was asome i like that it had all the characters going to angel except for dawn and anya and giles. It was cool that it was something about doyle. Now i'm reading the next crossover cursed so far i liked all the crossovers. Hope they make more crossovers 
 In some ways BETTER than "The River Why," but then again the perfect follow-up. Duncan growing as an author, and just as funny, sweet, sad, multi-colored and deep, like the reflections of sky and stars off his rushing waters, and as deep as the fish swimming therein. About the only complaint anyone can have with David James Duncan is WHY doesn't he write more? Not many people write as well or as richly as William Goldman, or make it all seem so effortless, but Duncan is one contemporary author, who like Goldman, seems one part philosopher and one part magician and two parts poet, an ethereal recipe for a great writer. If you love to read and haven't yet read David James Duncan, get "The River Why" and "The Brothers K" together and prepare yourself for weeping/screaming/laughing jags that will keep you going through many days -- these are books you will read more than once, and will treasure forever. And like me, you'll feel the overwhelming urge to share Duncan with those you love best 
 This is the third edition of this book that I own.  As a dual diagnosis counselor I have found this book to be an invaluable resource.  The psychopharmacology of both drugs of abuse and mental health medications are explained in a detailed manner that is very accessible.  I find it a valuable resource in helping me educate clients about drug action 
 Why is Seven Days not on this CD. It was my favorite part of the DVD and then I find out its only on the Import CD. Still a great CD though 
 Mr. Thomas deserves credit for researching and providing essential information for the cattleman who is serious about improving the efficiency of his operation.  I have recently purchased and read several books on the subject, and while this is an older book, Beef Cattle Production:  An Integrated Approach is head and shoulders above the others for reference material covering a broad spectrum of subjects.  From sire and dam selection, disease control, reproduction of purebred, cross-bred and commercial cattle, to ranch layout, operational issues, financing tips and equipment concerns this book hits on them all.  NOT for casual observers - its for the cattleman 
 Arguably the greatest military memoir ever written as well as the one of the greatest adventure stories ever told.  Xenophon shows himself to be both a strong, fair leader and a humble person as he recounts the retreat from enemy territory.   I understand there was a time when this was part of a mandatory curriculum in schools. How far we have fallen.   Anabasis is a great story for all ages and would be a wise choice as a gift for young readers ( even if the younger ones need some help from their parents). 
 This book is one of Philip K. Dick's most autobiographical, and is about the least well known time of his life.  He had just left his wife and kids in a stately house north of San Francisco to live with the junkies and vagrants of San Mateo.  The house that he lived in became well known as a place where people that were into drugs could go and always find more of what they were looking for, and usually something new as well.  Dick himself only did acid once-he preferred the more predictable effects of prescription drug abuse-and he called his experience with LSD the most terrifying 8-hours of his life.  The loss of identity that this book takes to extremes really did affect the people of Dick's house in San Mateo.  Paranoid theories ran rampant, and no one really knew who was a narc and who wasn't.  As such, it is an interesting portrait of the collective state of mind that predominated this period.  As a work of fiction, this book has a lot to say about the sources and apparatus of control in society.  The movie version does a poor job of conveying what is the central evil in the book-and in society-that Dick was trying to get to the heart of.  NewPath is an organization that purports to be the only one in society to be able to deal with the epidemic of drug abuse that 'Substance D' is ravaging on society.  They are however, the only group in society that is outside the realm of surveillence.  To quote _Enemy of the State_, "who watches the wathchers?"  That is definitely true of this book, and reflects Dick's deep distrust of the FBI/CIA.  To see how far this analogy goes, read _A Scanner Darkly_ and then ask yourself some key questions about the War on Drugs 
 I've had DVD players come and go, so its kinda cool to have a gaming console that plays dvd's too.  Yeah, I know the PS2 has that capability without a remote, I have one of those too.  But one of the cool things I noticed about the X Box playback kit is that the remote looks just like the ones made by RCA. I tried a few of the controls on the DVD funtion of my RCA universal remote, low and behold it worked.  Kinda a hand thing, I've got to many remotes floting around as it is, so that part was nice.  Mine works great, I use it instead of having to re-arrange my already overpacked entertainment center to put in my other DVD player.  
 I bought the BE650R for two purposes:  The first is to provide battery backup power for my home computer system on a daily basis.  The second is to use with my portable generator to provide "clean power" to all of my electronics when the power goes out and I'm forced to use it.  The BE650R handles both situations very well.  The provided PowerChute software installed without a problem and managed the computer system perfectly when the power went out, completing a graceful shutdown when the battery got low.  APC only provides the most basic version of their software (you have the option of buying an upgraded one).  It doesn't have any reporting or testing features, but given the size of the BE650R I don't see why you would care.  This is a UPS for workstations and small electronic, not servers, so I don't see the need for robust UPS software.   The UPS hooks up via a provided USB cable and the setup was very easy.  The BE650R provide about 11 minutes of run time for my system, which is comprised of a 350-watt computer, 19-in lcd monitor, wireless router and dsl modem.  As for using the UPS with the generator, I haven't had any problems so far.  The generator maufacturer recommmends using at least a surge supressor with their product, but I figured a UPS would be one step better.  I would definitely recommend this unit 
 Dean Koontz writes a tale of deeply penetrating detailed intrigue ... mind-blowing experiences and events occur to various characters in the book which are tied together so intricately that the book is spell-binding from start to finish.  Martie Rhodes has accompanied her good friend, Susan Jagger to the psychiatrist's office for over a year. Susan has had recurring nightmares about her ex-husband entering her apartment at night and doing inexplicable things. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Ahriman is a famous author of top selling 'self-help' books along being published in peer-reviewed journals for research in his field of expertise. His kind considerate manner balanced well with his superb credentials and unsurpassed reputation. Lately, Martie has begun experiencing unsual mental stress symptoms herself. She couldn't look herself in the mirror without thinking of harming herself and began experiencing intense fear when she handled sharp objects ... part of her knew this behavior was abnormal yet she couldn't stop the thoughts from arising at times. She was considering visiting Dr. Arhiman herself to help control this new onset of chaotic thinking ...  Her husband, Dusty, a painting contractor had just saved Skeet, his brother, from jumping off a roof and killing himself. Skeet had a background of psychological problems from his youth. He had been a "babe magnet", a handsome young man but his negligent eating habits made him look like a gaunt shadow of himself... Dusty had him admitted to a local psych facility ... where it turned out Dr. Mark Ahriman was a silent partner. In the facility, Dusty was exploring his brother's problems and was looking through his belongings. He came upon a phrase in a book which he read outloud and discovered ... put his brother in a trance. Essentially his brother followed his commands and answered questions in a distant voice with no recall of the event after he fell asleep ...  Susan Jagger sets a trap to prove once and for all whether Eric her exhusband is paying her visits at night while she is asleep ... She shares none of the details of these nightmarish events with Martie ... As Martie and Dusty settle down for the night they discuss the days events, with many of its peculiar aspects. Susan tries calling Martie who does not pick up the phone. When Martie does not hear from Susan for over 24 hours, she becomes suspicious and goes to her apartment. Susan is discovered dead - an apparent suicide. But was it? Dr. Mark Ahriman reassured Martie that Susan was doing splendidly and improving ... He felt she was near a breakthrough and could likely be cured? What happened to Susan to make her kill her self?  The answers to these questions are explained in a twisted tale of intrigue and mystery. Dean Koontz uses normal events and unusual ideas and concepts based on scientific research which is exaggerated in his imagination to build a suspenseful murder mystery with complex underpinnings of winding labyrinthine paths. Reading this book is a thrilling roller coaster ride ... There are many ups, downs and hair-pin turns at the most unexpected moments. This is another exciting book by a master author who is tops in his field ... Read and enjoy. Erika Borsos (pepper flower)  
 Richard Evans attacks a controversial topic on the world of history today -- how to write history.  There are many schools of theory in the historical profession which can affect the way historians view historical sources.  Evans particulary narrows his viewpoint to those historians known as "post-modernists."  He does this beccause post-modernists are perhaps some of the most controversial historians, not to mention the very theory itself, in the profession today.  He also ponders what place post-modernists do have in the historical profession.  Evans explores how some historians have gotten into trouble with how liberally they took their sources -- concentrating on one scholarly work about the Holocaust.  This book is sure to continue the debate that continues to this day.  It is thought provoking and will lead to more debate, to be sure 
 Milestones should be part of anyone's jazz collection. You'll get some of the best music money can buy here. The title track is my favorite, great catchy melody and Trane's solo. Straight No Chaser is another winner, again with a catchy melody. Two Bass Hit is also good, though I, as a bassist, wish it had two basses. Billy Boy is pretty much a seven-minute piano solo, but by a great pianist. Doctor Jackle is really fast and catchy, and Sid's Ahead is a really long song with a good solo by Miles. The alternate takes are okay, but I listen to the regulars more. You want Miles at his best? Buy this, Kind of Blue and 'Round About Midnight 
 "American River" shows us how spoken words can be as powerful and moving as those that are sung.  In his new album, Jonathan Elias matches his hauntingly beautiful melodies with spoken messages from some of music's legendary artists.  My absolute favorite has to be "Continuance," which Elias collaborated on with the late Johnny Cash and his daughter, Roseanne.  When I first heard it, I got a knot in my stomach from hearing Cash and his daughter speak about their struggles of fitting into the American society.  The rest of the album certainly delivers as well as "Continuance" did... other featured guests include Kris Kristofferson and Emmylou Harris.  "American River" is the perfect album to wind down to... the amazingly composed pieces of Elias will surely soothe and refresh anyone who listens to it.  
 Finally....ER Season 5 is here.  I have been checking here like every week waiting on this season to come out.  I have never watched ER until my recent deployment to Iraq.  I went through the first 4 seasons in like 2.5 months.  And I know if those were really good, then season 5 is going to even better.  
 I'm so glad I got this score.  Such a humorous film like Shrek doesn't sound like it would have so much beautiful music, but this score proves it does.  The music is absolutely stunning, sometimes powerful, sometimes scary, sometimes sad and sometimes just beautiful.  There are a few recurring themes, but they are great themes and sound nice in every song.  Although most of the soundtrack is pretty serious, there are a few funny songs placed in, which only add to it's greatness.  If, while watching Shrek, you happened to notice some of the nice themes like I did, then I suggest getting this score.  It really is a great CD and I'm happy to have this part of my collection 
 This book is fascinating (in a terrible way, of course). Living with someone who has munchausen by proxy is terrible enough, but this book illustrates how children living with this problem can easily go from childhood to adulthood without anyone else recognizing there's a problem or trying to help the child escape from it. Julie lives her life without another family member, friend, teacher, doctor or other close relation doing anything to help which astounds me more than the mother's words and actions do. I give this book 4 stars because the second half of the book didn't flow as well as the first half. Many places towards the end jump around without the explaination or detail that I would have liked to read. Perhaps more will be explained should she write a sequel 
 On this DVD you are catching the best of the New Orleans jazz culture up front in all its earthiness from Doc John to Allen Touisant .Simply a true joy to hear almost all the great aspects of New Orleans jazz stll cooking now .If you dig earthy New Orleans jazz you will cherish this DVD  
 Any musician who is serious about a career with any kind of longevity needs to read this book.  It is too easy to get screwed these days, so it's important that artists understand the nature of the business and have as much control as possible over their product and finances.  
 There are real nuggets of divine wisdom in this classic. My only concern is his very heavy animosity towards the world. His spiritual insights are rewarding, but I am (currently) a strong believer of being *in* the world but not *of* the world viz "Passionately loving the World" by St. Josemaria Escriva. I can still temper or filter his animosity to mine some real spiritual gems 
 Brooke Sheilds takes the reader into her own private-eye view of the world through the eyes of a mother suffering from Post-Partum Depression.  She is amazingly truthful with all that she has gone through.  Who wants to tell someone, much less the world, about thoughts of harming one's own child?  How do you get help for that?...without someone thinking you need to be institutionalized?  That fear alone, keeps a mulititude of women from seeking help for this debilitating disease.  Brooke allows herself to be put up before judge and jury, and for that, I truly admire her and her book of confessions.  She is a strong woman who has dealt with and beat, PPD.  I highly recommend the book, especially if you are in need of a sense of comradery.  Brooke lets you know that you are not alone in your suffering and gives you hope with a sense of comfort and understanding, that only one who has suffered from the disease itself could possibly offer 
 Nice video transfer but better sound. Uncompressed 5.1 PCM, the perfect demo disc 
 I purchased this book for my girls to use in a college class. Hopefully it will get a lot of use 
 The authors are also the inventors of Proactiv Solution, the #1 acne treatment in America... 
 This is a great purchase for any fan of Chicago sports. I enjoy collecting championship videos, including the White Sox's DVD's. After watching the bounus footage games numerous times, I find myself wanting more. There were better games to watch than the ones in the 1992 and 1997 Finals. For instance, game 1 of 1992 was a great game. A blowout. That's all we have from that year, and I would love to watch the clincher in Chicago with the great 4th quarter comeback. I've only seen that once or twice since June 14th, 1992, and it was a "game for the ages" with the bench contributing in the final period. And I think I might want to watch that game a little bit more than game 1, which isn't even close after the first half, even if Jordan did set a record for points during it.   Then take game 5 of the 1997 Finals. Jordan on the verge of collapsing to score nearly 40 points and hitting a game winner. Good game, yes. But what about Steve Kerr's winner in game 6? I like having the Chicago crowd behind the team for the closeout games. I was watching game 6 of the 1996 Finals and realized that's the only game of the six with a championship won in the city. I know that this set was all about Jordan, but there were some greater games from those Finals in my opinion that I would jump up and down to watch again.   In conclusion, since A&E are now releasing World Series DVD's, why not someday release Finals games? Then everyone can get the entire Finals experiences over again. True, A&E have nothing to do with NBA basketball. These games were associated with NBA TV. But it's a nice thought and something I'd buy. 
       This clearly written book offers a handy guide to tax strategy for the rich and for those who hope to be rich. Author Diane Kennedy, a certified public accountant, provides basic information on common tax risks and opportunities. Without using burdensome jargon, she explains the fundamentals of financial reports and record keeping. Her approach is commonsense and straightforward she doesn't make outrageous promises or exotic, inapplicable recommendations. The title is slightly misleading. This book is not really about loopholes, but rather about sound planning and management - especially for business owners. It does get into the minutiae of tax law, which is subject to change, so some of the details may have a short shelf life, and much of the advice will have little applicability outside of the United States. Nonetheless, we recommend this basic guide to anyone who needs a fundamental introduction to personal financial and tax management in the U.S 
 Helpful for my final project in Psych. It taught me there are strategies that can be used to help those who suffered during childhood 
 Neoconservative Professor Richard Pipes' Communism: A History is a 160-page obituary for the Marxist-Leninist variety of totalitarianism in the Soviet Union, but not for totalitarianism by other names.  Inspired by Darwin's theory of evolution, Marx predicted that Communism would evolve in industrial, capitalistic Europe. Lenin discovered that a revolution against Czarist Russia was as easy as `lifting a feather' (page 38).  False promises of peace at any price and of grassroots democracy were enough to gain support of peasants in agrarian, feudal Russia.  Most of Lenin's Communist Party members were illiterate or functionally illiterate.  After the death of Stalin, Soviet leaders attacked Stalin, but not Lenin, because Soviet leaders wanted to remain in power.  Pipes provided ample documentation of the brutality of Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, and the other Communist leaders who murdered more than 100 million persons and who destroyed the lives of even more.  While Marx and Engels claimed that their views on Communism were based upon scientific theory, Pipes documented that Lenin and later Communist leaders learned quickly that Communism is based upon false assumptions about human nature.  Millionaire entrepreneurs live in mansions in Communist China today.  There has been no abolition of private property.  In 1920, Lenin learned that Marx was wrong about an international brotherhood of workers.  The Red Army's attack on Poland failed because Polish workers and peasants fought against the Red Army, not against the Polish bourgeois and landlords (page 50).  After 1920, Soviet leaders decided it was better to provide financial support to local communists or others in each country rather than to attempt to use the Red Army to extend Communism throughout the world.  In Germany, Stalin supported Hitler and the Nazis as the best choice for fighting against Western democracies.  Surprisingly, this neoconservative historian mentioned Trotsky only briefly and did not explain neoconservative ties to Communism.  Trotsky supported world revolution and opposed any alliances with Hitler.    With the collapse of the Marxist-Leninist Soviet Union, Pipes predicted that Communists would turn to "... an eclectic social democratic platform laced with nationalism." (page ix)  The Web site of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) and other Web sites list large numbers of Members of Congress who support the DSA.    The author's son and fellow neoconservative, Daniel Pipes, has been a strong supporter of Marxist terrorists (MEK or MKO or Rajavi cult) who have murdered American military officers, Rockwell International employees, and large numbers of innocent persons in Iran and in Iraq.  In 2003, the American military attacked Camp Ashraf in Iraq and killed many of the MEK.  Neoconservatives were able to reverse the situation.  The American military had to protect the Marxist terrorists.  Totalitarians have gained powerful positions in Congress and in Democratic and Republican administrations by modifying some labels and messages.  Totalitarians, who cannot win elections by explaining truthfully their objectives, need endless, violent wars under any pretext to impose their views and control of the world. 
 Blavatsky was an incredible mystic and probably the best known Theosophist. The Secret Doctrine is such an incredible work. Although some parts may seem to be cryptic, Blavatsky gives so much information and insight into the occult world. It's not an easy read, but I find myself rereading chapters only to find a hidden nugget that I overlooked before. This is a compendium of vast esoteric knowledge and I am so grateful this scarce third volume has been made available 
 An excellent, detailed textbook style examination of the radical right, in all its manifestations. Of all the books I've read on the right, and I've read a few, this one is the best. Carefully crafted and scholarly, Ridgeway pulls no punches. He gives detailed explanations of the history, origins and rhetoric of the KKK, The Posse Comitatus, The American Nazi Party and many related right wing haters. He makes copious use of the rights own pamphlets and speeches to reveal their twisted belief systems, and the book is full of pictures and even includes exerts of the infamous Turner Diaries. Well written and readable the book is also a gripping page-turner and will definitely keep you interested until the end. My only gripe is with the final chapter, which is unduly alarmist. It is true that the radical right is active and that they are a danger to society, but I am not convinced by the notion that there values are more acceptable in society than they have been in the past. Was Bull Conner an outcast in his time? Is David Duke more important politically than George Wallace was? Has the KKK been able to defeat a presidential candidate in modern times the way they defeated Al Smith? I also found the suggestion that Madonna and Tom Petty of all people are spreading racist propaganda to be laughable. Further the notion that opposition to affirmative action is evidence of a racist mindset is absurd, and revealing of the authors `liberal' bias. Affirmative action is not only a racist notion, based as it is on the idea that minorities need special help to succeed, but also has given aid and comfort to the racist cause. Racists can point to Affirmative Action as proof of their own beliefs. That being said, the ideological quirks of the author do not detract from the excellence of his scholarship. As a detailed explanation of the radical right across the broad spectrum, the book is peerless. Highly recommended 
 Being a professional performer myself, I really enjoy listening to this music from the circus. It really puts you in a positive mood for the rest of the day no matter what happens. I will often play it when driving to one of my performances to put me "in the mood". I am so glad to have it on CD since my cassette of this item is rather frail. Highly recommended 
 I enjoyed this novel, but the pace is slow and the story line does not compell you to read keeping reading, so I ut it down for days at a time 
 What a book. That's one of those books that keep you turning the pages rapidly, until you get to the end. But then you just have to take another look at the first pages, and before you know it you are in the middle of a  second round. The main character tells his story retrospectively, starting  from the night a winged horse flew over his parents house at the time of  his birth - a Jewish Centaur somewhere in Brazil. His parents are terrified  at first, but afterwards he is grown as a regular... well, centaur. It's no  use even trying to tell anything of this strange, fascinating book. Two  things, however, are certain: this is a book that you will be thinking  about for a long, long time, and this is NOT a children's book. Read it. If  I can't convince you... well, imagine yourself living your life without  knowing that "One hundred years of solitude" existed. What a  loss 
 This book has been like a Bible to me as I have been training my first hunting labrador! Mr. Wolters is a "no bull" kind of writer whose meathods have turned my now nearly two year old dog into a wonderful hunting companion and the envy of all our friends 
 Not many writers can characterize children realistically. Somehow a stylized silhouette emerges and the child fades in the background and the plot or adult characters take over the storyline and the children characters end up being nothing more than fluff. This is definately not one of those novels. Carson mcCullers writes almost with artistic persicion on her two most elaborate characters, F. Jasmine and John Henry West. I really cannot think of another story, maybe, A Good Man is Hard to Find, by Flannery O'Conner, where the writer can get inside the mind of a child; evoking their unique thoughts and feelings with a sense of ease. John Henry West is one of the most well rounded and well written children I have ever read, and that is a great homage to her writing ability.   *I first read this at ten, can see that age or older reading it. Will have a intense impact on a sensitive pre teen reader 
 This is not a traditional biography, which was what I expected when I picked up the book.  If you wish to know about Rudy's life before 1989, his first marriage, childhood, days as U.S. attorney, this is not the right book for you.  The first 100 pages or so this book are a bit slow--too much campaign stuff and not enough on governing.  However, the narrative picks up quickly over the last 200 pages.  We learn about Rudy's mistakes and triumphs--of which there are many.  You learn a ton about Rudy's controversial policies.  The personal scandals are discussed, but not in a malicious way.  We never learn about the details of his mysterious marriage to Donna Hanover--or anything much about Hanover.  So, yes, things are left out.  However, Al Sharpton is a fascinating character here.  You learn about Rudy's day on Sept. 11, when the author was actually running around the city with the Mayor. The narrative ends in 2001.  I would have loved to hear more about Bloomberg, but who can change the publication date now?  It isn't perfect, but Rudy remains one of the fascinating--and successful--Mayors of our time 
 Sari Locker is the sexpert for Gen-X and beyond. She knows her stuff. This book is like the Joy of Sex for the new millennium --  but it has more than just sex positions. Like the new generation demands, it also tells people of all ages about more than the basics, getting into advanced issues and tips for sexuality. 
 I didn't know what to expect before reading this book, but after reading it, I recommend it to any and everyone.  One of the best I've read of Koontz, and I've read quite a few 
 Shipwrecked and held captive by Muslim slavers, this true story is so well written and researched and the story so unbelieveable it is difficult to put down. I have deliberately not read the ending because I don't want the experience to end.  With every step that these brave souls take through the unforgiving desert and the treatment they receive, because they are Christians and therefore "dog dung" is beyond human endurance. Their story of survival and their belief in their salvation is the best book I have ever read of this genre.  I am grateful to the author for giving me this life altering experience 
 The elegant piano of Allen Toussaint, topical lyrics and wonderful voices plus Elvis' rocking guitar....what could be better?  Excellent 
 I suggest spending some time browsing the works of Bearden online while listening. This isn't a LIVE CD as the Amazon listing would suggest. RecordedÊJune 23 - 25, 2003 at Clinton Studios, New York NY. This disc, comprised entirely of newly recorded music, was produced by saxophonist Branford Marsalis in celebration ofÊThe Art of Romare Bearden, the major retrospective that opens at the National Gallery of Art inÊWashington,ÊD.C.Êon September 14 and subsequently travels to museums inÊSan Francisco,ÊDallas,ÊNew York and Atlanta during 2004 and 2005 
 As a society, we value all sorts of physical fitness and despair over the decrease in mental accuity that can occur with aging.  This book addresses, in an objective manner, this disparity. An individual can come away from  this book with a clear sense of the true state of their mental fitness.  It  is the "four minute mile" of the mind.  Incidently, it is also a  great read.  A real page turner 
 There are few actors who could deliver such a performance as Patrick Stewart. His recital of A Christmas Carol is by far the best avaliable. The story's tone and Dickens' characters are truly brought to life through Stewart. Highly recommended for the holidays, the classroom, or for any fan of this classic 
 Trust me on my word. This is the best calculator ever. And if you dont believe me just because i am a kid, well it's your loss. I bought this calculator and i gave it to my older cousin and he is in high school. Then he gave it to me and i am using. If your wondering what a 12 year old is doing with a scientific calculator well i go to HUNTER COLLEGE and it is from the 7th grade to the 12th. This claculator is best for freshman high schoolers and going to college. The only con is the buttons wiggles, but everything else is fine. Buy this calculator for a fine price or you will be sorry. it works from pre algebra to pre-cal and knows trigonometry 
 One of my favorite movies, it is a great comedy to watch.  The actors are at their best in this one 
 I don't want to give too much away,  but I was really surprised by the main character's take on reality. When you finally realize what is really happening, you will be shocked. 
 James Luther Dickinson is the patriarch for the first family in American roots music. From his many keyboard contributions with the Dixie Flyers in the early 70's, to his production/player credits with the Stones, Ry Cooder, Mud Boy and the Neutrons- to his sons, the North Mississippi Allstars, Dickinson has devoted a lifetime to creating timeless, quality music.  "Jungle Jim" is unique, even for an artist as heterogeneous as Dickinson. His first two solo projects included  both known and obscure Memphis stompers, but his latest focuses more on instrumental interplay( ("Rooster Blues", "Samba De Orfeo") and soulful grooves (Violin Bums", "Out of Blue"). As on 2002's "Free Beer Tomorrow", Dickinson pays tribute to Eddie Hinton with one of his compositions, "Can't Beat the Kid". Dickinson is backed by his sons, Cody and Luther of the North Mississippi Allstars throughout, along with violinist Tommy Burroughs, saxophonist Jim Spake, and on two tracks, Alvin Youngblood Hart.   Acoustic bassist Amy Lavere supplies the perfect support for Dickinson's brand of eclecticism. In addition to her musical talents, she portrayed Wanda Jackson in the 2005 movie "Walk the Line", and has also appeared in "Black Snake Moan". Her second album, " Anchors and Anvils", was produced by   Dickinson and will be released May of this year.  Once again, Dickinson has scored a winner with his own- AND his extended Memphis family. Do not pass this one up.     
 This work came out of a session at the 1987 annual conference of the Modern Languages Association - MLA. The session organizers (the editors of these essays) putting on the "Working-Class Women in Academia" hoped for "an engaged audience".  The response was a bit more than engaged: a packed house, non-stop questions and an ending that was more a bouncer announcing "last call" than the usual polite clapping and then off to the next session.  It took 6 years to put these questions, responses, more questions and some solutions into print. There are 20 essays here taking various literary forms written by women from working class backgrounds who have also taught working class women.    Each essay is followed by a bibliography and there is a more general 5 page bibliography at the end. The index, though, is too slim - 3 pages- for such an important book. Since much of the essays are about different aspects of writing I expected to see many references to writing in its various forms in the index but did not. Nor did I find Mennonite, Marxist theory, names of academic institutions mentioned or specific ethnic groups. But given the unique contribution this set of essays makes to the literature, this is really a minimal complaint.  At the very end, the authors, their affiliations and important works are listed.  Personally I felt like I have finally found the rule book for a game I`ve been playing for years. The essayists don't mention much about the need to keep grades up to maintain a scholarship in order to  remain in the undergraduate academy but this is what fueled my entire choice of classes - taking only those I knew I would do well in. And quickly, within one week, at my private liberal arts college I knew my major better not include writing. The required freshman English seminar was about four white women poets - all suicides.  How these 18 year olds could have so much to say in such elegant ways about grievous mental illness and literature boggled my mind. I had gotten into this college on the scholarship ticket of "poor foster kid that might be smart enough because she graduated high school at 16 and didn't do too bad on her SATs". But there was no way I was going to be able to compete against these hyper-articulates...so it was off to the math department. Chemistry and math had always been my strengths so I enjoyed my choice which subsequently opened doors for me in industry where I eventually did learn to write `the right' way.  But yet I was cheated out of fully exploring the college's history and economic offerings which I was extremely interested in. I had been reading fairly deep stuff since I was 12 and would have loved to finally have a place to discuss some of these readings - but the inability to write the way the academy wanted me to locked me out - never mind the way I spoke. By the time I could have figured out how to put my comments or question into "the king's English" my turn would have been long gone.  This set of essays says a great deal - in different ways - about the automatic rejection of the working woman's true voice and writing style in academia. And then what this does to the woman learning and the cost to the academy. The essays also describe the costs extracted from these women who finally learn to write `academically' and then begin pursuit of a PhD in the liberal arts - particularly in English and Sociology. And then the added work only they endure  once reaching the exalted towers in academia.  One would think that this book and others like it would be causing a flurry of committees convening, faculty senates engaging in truth-telling and so on, but it turns out that's far from the truth. Sharon O'Dair does an exquisite job at explaining that academics are actually in serious competition with the working class. Both academics and the underclass depend on subsidies from the government which in turn depends on the taxes of the working class. And to add injury to insult, in the `70s the academy began ascribing the source of all the `isms to the working class - biting the hand that has been feeding them....  Who woulda thought.

 I was very pleased with the product and with the fast service,  I would use Amazon again if I find something I want.  Thank you  Annett 
 I use this book every time I work on a quilt.  The descriptions are easy to understand and the results are great.  With this book I learned how to miter my borders as well as the binding and this technique has given my quilts a more sophisticated look.  I consider myself a beginner-intermediate quilter so if I can uderstand this book anyone can 
 I saw Charlie & The Chocolate Factory last night for the first time (I'm behind the times, yes) and though I usually don't care very much in giving my opinion, the journey Tim Burton and his team made me cross deserves an homage. Especially with all that criticism rising around the film before it has been released.  I have been a Tim Burton fan for more than a decade now; I grew up with his films. But what I have been through yesterday his really unique. I actually never thought he would offer us such a film one day. Fans of his first period, with all the lonely and desperate characters won't like it for sure. Since Mars Attacks !, and more specifically since Big Fish, Burton decided to tell things differently. His vision of the world slightly changed in every of his films : now, the rejected freak comes down to the world and stays. A world that remains frightening and weird even thought we call it "reality" but a world worth living in. And that's what Charlie & The Chocolate Factory is all about... It all begins with a main title sequence that may be one of the main weaknesses of the film. The sequence is very entertaining and visually ambitious but they decided to go with CGI and it looks like it was a decision they made in last minute. Since the film was proudly made with "real" sets, "real" Oompas Loompas, "real" squirrels, the main title looks inappropriate. It's not that important but it's a Tim Burton film and we know how much he usually works on his main title. Hopefully, Danny Elfman is there with a crazy mix of the Edward Scissorhands and Spider-Man (the music when the title of the film appears gave me shivers), a true musical roller-coaster that gives a hint on what his score will sound like through the film.   After that, it's just emotions. All kinds of them: laughs (many - the audience laughed almost every thirty seconds), tears of joy (we all know Charlie's gonna find that ticket but when he does, you just can't refrain your heart to beat faster), mercy (the way Burton depicts the social misery of the Bucket's family is really touching), amazement (the Wonka Factory and its many rooms is true wonder, one the most achieved design Burton ever offered us) and many mores. Very much like the book, even though it seems simple and childish, you would like to stop for a second to collect those feelings and try to analyze them but you don't have the time. It just never stops (I realize it might be a flaw for some people in fact). Burton never has been so generous in terms of human warmness.  Johnny Depp proposes another inventive and completely wacky interpretation here. I won't compare with Gene Wilder since I don't know the first film very well (pretty unknown flick here in Europe) and those comparisons should stop anyway. Depp makes of Wonka a tormented and unadapted character who doesn't know much about common courtesy and doesn't really care anyway. He built up his own universe in response to his authoritarian father and he's pretty proud of it. He just doesn't want those "weird" (a word he likes - you've all seen the TV spots) and boring parents with their despicable children to ruin what is life is based on. Yet... So Depp's Wonka is actually very moving and pathetic in his attempts to entertain his visitors. As Burton does everything he can to make you hate Augustus, Vercua, Violet and Mike at the moment you first see them, you get instantly closer to Wonka when you noticed he feels the same. In addition to that, John August's vision of Wonka's past (including an always perfect cameo by Christopher Lee) offers the character a real depth you didn't expect.  Danny Elfman is also one of the main attractions of the film. While his score is already classic Burton/Elfman work with some interesting experiments (the main themes are splendid), the songs he wrote for the Oompas Loompas are just so funny. Hugh laughs in the audience for some musical choices. Those songs don't intend to stay with you for months (it would have been hard as they're based on Dahl's lyrics that doesn't allow Broadway impulses), they're just off-beat numbers playing with many references in so many styles. Oingo Boingo fans have to buy the soundtrack when it'll come out, it'll bring them back 15 years ago.  What, can I tell you more? McDowell's sets are amazing, Pescucci's work is impressive as well as Rousselot's beautiful cinematography. Some Oscar Nominations should fall here.  As for the ending, without revealing it, August's additions are really touching and fit perfectly to Burton's new approach. Even though the final shot tempers the "family" theme that he developed through the film (it's still Burton, not Disney), Burton makes you feel good because he feels good (and what I'm writing here will ring a bell when you'll see the movie). I don't know for you but after so many distressed and pessimistic films, it really moved to see that he found a certain peace. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is a step forward in the direction he gave to his career with Big Fish. He lost his father, he became one, he's getting older and all those questions and doubts are expressed in many important and very complex images and scenes he imagined for the film. That's why I could call this film the "Edward Scissorhands" of his new period. Those films are very different but gave me both some very essential emotions.  Thank you, Tim Burton. Thank you very much 
     The epilogue of the book brings the dramatic storytelling and allure of the initial years of high altitude spying to a screeching halt when the author makes a futile effort to connect the 1950's and 60's to our post 9-11 world.  He believes that "terrorists are everything Soviet military forces were not," and that civilian and military intelligence analysts were crutched by the availability of high-resolution pictures vice experienced Human Intelligence operatives in the world's hot spots (pg. 361).  This loosely formulated conclusion seems to be as cockamamie as blaming the "smart" bombs dropped from B-1's and B-52's for not homing in on and killing terrorists like Osama bin Laden.      Every technology has its place.  But, it's like comparing apples and oranges when it comes to the intelligence disciplines.  Human operatives have a different focus than imagery intelligence, and can really give a ground truth perspective of the political, emotional, and potential hostilities of a situation.  If Taubman feels that the lack of CIA and other agents on the ground in places like Afghanistan and Iraq were the crux of the problem, then he could have addressed such in a different forum than this very comprehensive effort on the history of United States air and space-borne reconnaissance. 
 After 2003, Klaskey-Csupo said they were not continuing with the Rugrats. Little did we know, they had been cooking up a brand new dvd series for the show. "Tales from the Crib" is a new DVD series in which the babie from the Rugrats put themselves into classic fairy tales. "Snow White" is the first one of the series, it will be followed by "Jack and the Beanstalk". I am excited to buy the movie, its a great way to start off the school year. I want to see just how well Spike will be at a dwarf, just how poison the apple really will be, and how the babie come up with a wacky twist on the classic fairy tale 
 Geoffrey Robinson, a British jurist and worlwide advocate for human rights, has produced a gripping biography of a man largely ignored by history, John Cooke, a barrister selected by Parliament to prosecute the deposed and imprisoned king, Charles I. In pressing his case, Cooke broke new legal ground, arguing that rulers derive their power, not from God, but from the people they rule. And following from this, rulers can be called to account, deposed, and punished if they rule tyrannically. In this case, and in his subsequent juridical career, Cooke is shown to have been farsighted and fair. His patriotism, his concern for human rights, and his integrity gained him no protection from Stuart wrath, however, after the Restoration, and the terrible payment they exacted from him is detailed, almost too vividly, in the final pages of the book. Still, the principles he espoused are today the recognized rights of Englishmen, are enshrined in the American Constitution, and are slowly becoming part of international law, as Sadaam Hussein recently learned.  
 This book creates a great foundation to train yourself and your horse to excell in jumping no matter what your intentions may be. I personally would recomend this book for all ages and engligh riders even the one's with no intention on jumping 
 We're used to books that give answers. We want to be spoon fed, and often whine when the answers are not sugar coated as well.  The books about the origins of life that I've read (De Duve's "Vital Dust," Margulis' "Early Life," Gribbon's several books, Crick's pan-spermia, the anthropic principle...) follow the usual pattern. They start at different stages of the origins of life, but they all: - expound a theory as if it were universally agreed to be true then  - explain how the process progressed whether from stardust or extra-terrestrial sources, oceanic amino acids or bacteria-like organisms.  Well, Freeman Dyson does it differently. He starts with good questions. Questions, when formulated well, help us to think and arrive at better answers. He asks about the first living cells: - Did replication come first or - Did metabolism come first? - Did those two processes happen simultaneously? - Did they happen independently or were they correlated or causative...? - Which process might be 'better' or 'worse' if it happened first?  He reviews the well-known research (natural  selection, statistical methods...) and how well they may be able to answer these questions. Then he tells us his preference and why. Why? Because it helps us to think further.  Then he says that being a physicist (and a mathmatician who, at age 17, devised the pattern for cluster bombing that would create a self-accelerating firestorm. His theory was tested on Dresden and proven to be very effective), he does not know about biology and with that disclaimer, built a 'toy model' to help us think through ways to arrive at conclusions.  The third part of this book goes into the 'fidelity of replication (or error rates), and an analysis of the smallest number of self-organizing molecules that still 'work.' This seeming tangent is of special interest to me because it furthers my quest to learn how we acquired mitochondria and how they work now, with so few DNA of their own. And also what might be the evolutionary future of extremely simple organisms that are formed into colonies such as some sea jellies?  This book made me think so hard that I don't actually remember its conclusions. It's a short book so only took a few evenings to read, even including the periods I had to put it down to let my mind digress down a path that was triggered by the book, but I might be thinking about it and studying the questions that it raised for a very long time 
 I really like all the Capt. Underpants books.  They are very funny.  Whenever mom wants me to read something I read these books.  I also like Ricky Ricotta by the same author, Dave Pilkey.  If you want to have a laugh, read these books.  They are filled with adventure and fun 
 Whenever people tell me which is the funniest Trollope novel to start with I always suggest BARCHESTER TOWERS; whenever they ask for the most typical of his novels, I suggest this one. Trollope rarely planned his novels through to the end when he started writing them, so his stories flow by almost haphazardly; you cannot expect them to adhere to the tighter construction of Dickens or Eliot. But for all of its vagaries this novel is extraordinarily captivating, and you will find yourself particularly drawn to the women in Phineas's life and their peculiar limitations. The most deftly portrayed of them, the gifted Lady Laura Standish who makes a disastrous marriage to a wealthy MP in the hopes of involving herself in meaningful political activity, is unforgettable. The masterful little chapter detailing her dawning horror at having married an uptight prude, "Sunday Morning in Grosvenor Square," may be the finest thing Trollope ever wrote 
 This album is so brutally honest which is a shock because most artists nowadays try to cover them selves up and shy away from the truth.  Annie Lennox is the exception to the rule on her lastest release.  "A Thousand Beautiful Things" is by the far the greatest song on this disc.  Thank you for "Bare"  This is one of my favorites discs of all time 
 STEVE JENKINS CHEESE PRIMER is a great overview of how cheeses are made, what regions of world produce which cheeses and general information about how to serve them.  Though truthfully this book offers way too much information to digest in any one sitting - without a morsel to taste, I have found the information contained here valuable in figuring out how to approach such a broad subject.    The biggest thing I have learned is that there is no real way to learn about most great cheeses in the United States.  Thanks to government regulations that do not allow merchants to sell non-pasteurized cheeses, we Yanks are prevented from tasting the most remarkable ones -- widely available in France, Italy, Switzerland and Spain.  Still I do recommend this book because Jenkins knows his stuff.  With 20 years experience tasting and buying cheese for Dean & DeLuca, Balducci's and Fairway (three of Manhattan's legendary specialty markets), he's traveled the world and sampled it all.  And he's not a snob.  He's good at translating his knowledge into information that anyone can relate to.   I think this book would be fantastic for a book club, though I doubt any would consider reading it.  Still it would be wonderful if each week the club covered a different chapter and offered a trio of cheeses that best exemplified the regions Jenkins covers.    -- Regina McMenami 
 This small book containing 4 short essays (and a poem or two) on the simple life makes one realize that possessions and big houses can be a burden; life can be lived simply and serenely.  These essays were written by one Chinese author and three Japanese authors, over almost a thousand years, ending with Basho.  I enjoyed all four essays, but Basho has so much wit to him that I have to say he is my favorite.  I love the image he presents:  nothing holy or wise, just sitting there admiring the view and squishing lice.  What more is there to life 
 This book is great at presenting problems and, perhaps more importantly, solutions facing our country today. Although it appears to be focused mainly on the last presidential election, the issues are still relevant today. It has been over a year since the 2004 presidential election and many of the concerns in this book have not been addressed by either side of the aisle. Each article is managable to the average fan of politics and yet it is detailed enough to make the most involved citizen think in different ways. Of particular note are the chapters on education. They are well written and offer very insightful solutions. This is an excellent book for you to read to get in touch with some of the real problems in America 
 John Davis provides an overview of commonly used business metrics that he subdivides in three categories: 1) Marketing Planning and Customers; 2) The Offering; and 3) Sales Force.  Davis usually explains clearly each metric that he covers by sequentially examining the measurement need, solution, and impact on decision making.  Most of the time, Davis gives a clear example that helps readers put the theory into practice.  Some metrics in the third section such as Four Factor Model and Sales Variance Analysis will be somewhat challenging to readers who are not very comfortable with numbers.  To his credit, Davis is straightforward about the difficulties that readers can experience in collecting some of the information needed to use some of the metrics under review.  Davis also cautions his audience against the danger of blindly using industry averages because each company has its own DNA.  Davis is at his weakest when he presents an overview of key Internet metrics such as gross page impressions, cost per click, and cost per action.  The coverage of these metrics is too superficial to be of any use to any reader who is looking for more than the basics.  To summarize, "Measuring Marketing 103 Key Metrics Every Marketer Needs" is a good reference book for a quick education about some of the most commonly used business metrics.  
 Lemme' start off by saying Tom Hanks is an amazing actor. Therefore The Green Mile is all around classic already. this movie displays good ol' southern life back in the 30's/40's time period in the heart of Louisianna. the movie also features Michael Clark Duncan. this is the story of a innocent man who turns out to actually be a healing instrument with connections through a higher power 
 Thanks for bringing information to those with kids who are tired of mainstream treatments that only blanket their ailments!  This book gives, in such a wonderful and basic approach, natural remedies and great  preventative suggestions to keep kids healthy.  Dr. White and Sunny Mavor  have given us an invaluable tool to use on a daily basis.  Thanks 
 These recordings are absolute gems.  In fact I daresay nothing like these performances has come before nor will come again.  Gould is a genius, and the music he performs is timeless as well as historical.  One can listen to this music and be transported to the 16th century, such is the power, beauty and effectiveness of Gould's interpretations.  I cannot say enough of Gibbons and Sweelink, these masters are terribly underrated and unheard.  Gould's touch is magical, technical virtuosity meets a true anachronistic artist.  To the naysayers I say they have ears to ear yet do not hear, or in one ear and out the other.  Anyone sensitive to true art will appreciate this music.  Gould's performances and the composed music transcends banal quibbles like "he plays it too fast", or "it should be played on a virginal".   Long live Byrd, Gibbons, Sweelinck and Gould 
 Simply put, this book is a winner. If you love character development, great dialogue and wit, you'll laugh and cry to the last page. Some writers don't know how to end a novel, and leave readers feeling cheated, unsatisfied, or disappointed.  Although I was worried as I neared the end of the book, I had nothing to fear. Richard Russo, in my opinion, couldn't have ended this story any better.   
 This is well-written and thorough guide to backpacking.  It provides helpful ideas for backpackers at all levels, not just beginners.  Like any book, it has its biases.  Townsend is a long-distance solo backpacker with most of his experience in western North America, Britain, and Scandinavia.  He often hikes on snow, and spends a significant amount of time on skis.  He is a vegetarian with a minimalist approach to backcountry cuisine.  What does this mean?  First, the weekend backpacker will find a lot of material that goes well beyond his needs.  This stems from the book's efforts to be useful to people at many different levels.  At the other extreme, a highly experienced backpacker will find much of the book too basic, though as a long-distance hiker Townsend will provide various nuggets of advice even for her.  Second, Townsend almost completely ignores fishing.  This is a popular part of the backpacking experience for many people and should be included.  (I suppose a little advice for backpacking hunters would probably also be helpful.)  Since Townsend doesn't hunt or fish, he may want to take on a coauthor in future editions who can help him a little in these areas.  Third, Townsend has nothing to say about experiencing the wildnerness by canoe.  This objection may be unfair, since canoeing isn't exactly "backpacking."  However, many people combine canoeing with backpacking and portaging in a way that probably belongs in an exhaustive guide to backpacking.  Certainly, Townsend's extensive discussions of cross-country skiing is as much a niche interest as is canoeing.  Finally, this is not the book for backcountry recipes or cooking ideas.  However, it is painfully thorough in discussing cooking gear.  Townsend reflects the Rockies-and-Sierras bias of most backpacking literature, though (like others) he acknowledges Appalachian Trial hikers.  It's easy to forget that the largest wilderness area in the lower 48, and the most widely visited in the entire country, is the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.  Some experience with North Country backpacking would serve Townsend and other writers well.  These criticisms aside, this is the best book of its kind that I have found.  I hope that it continues to evolve in its third edition. 
 Being a fan of 1930s jazz I've always loved the Ink Spots (and the Mills Bros. for that matter because they have a similar style). Their music is simple but so distinctly performed. Most of the short tunes on this collection begin with a signature little, subdued guitar intro. What follows is the perfect, beautiful harmony of their voices that go so well together.    All of their major hits or "most requested" tunes of theirs are here. My favorite tune has to be "My Prayer" - a song about a man who wants to be sure of his lover's devotion to him. Another gem on the CD is with Ella Fitzgerald on "Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall". Save Billy Holiday, in my opinon the best female voice in all of jazz. Most of the songs here are from their early period which is undoubtedly the high-point of their long careers.   Overall this is a nostalgic, relaxing disc - great for turning down the lights and to slow dance with your love :) That is, if you find the 1930's acapella jazz sound romantic. Even if you don't you gotta admit the Ink Spots' music is unique and has its own place in the vast history of the American jazz tradition. Enjoy 
 Firstly lets be clear about thing, this is not a martial arts movie  though it has some incredible martial arts scenes that will take your breath away and leave you looking on in stunned wonder.    Also it is a foreign language film, fortunately not dubbed but with subtitles, not everyone's cup of tea but this will not stop you from enjoying ever single second of it, from the opening credits to the blood splattered ending.  The Curse of the Golden Flower is a sumptuous tale about family secrets, revenge, lust, desire, incest, adultery, power, and corruption, all wrapped up in a beautiful but very flawed package that is the Forbidden City of 10th century China.  Never before has one come across such a dysfunctional family as the Tang dynasty, the exquisite but deadly Empress Phoenix, played by the gorgeous Li Gong, the thoroughly amoral Emperor Ping, a glorious Yun Fat Chow in his element, his three sons, the weak Crown Prince Wan (Ye Liu)who has been having an affair with his stepmother, the Empress, Prince Jai, (Jay Chou) brilliant solider, and loyal son to his mother, torn between duty and love, he will make a fateful decision that will herald the beginning of the end for his family.  And last but certainly not least the spoilt and unloved Prince Yu, (Junjie Qin) whose hatred of his family is cunningly disguised by his seemingly placid nature and acceptance of his lowly third son status.  Add to this mix, an Imperial Physician (Dahong Ni) with a wife (Jin Chen) whose connection to the royal household is a closely guarded secret, her daughter the lovely Chan (Man Li) who is is in love with the Crown Prince and you have the ingredients for a tragedy on a scale that can only be imagined.  With breathtaking scenery, the carpet of golden chrysanthemums has to be seen to be believed, fantastic costumes, atmospheric background music, coupled with stunning fight sequences between assassins and royal guards you will be left with your jaw hanging down as you witness the golden warriors go into battle against the Emperor and the twists and turns in a film that is none stop action and intrigue throughout.  The overall acting is without doubt perfection on celluloid, its a shame it didn't win an Oscar but sometimes Hollywood gets it wrong, and boy did they get it wrong this time 
 This is my second copy of this CD. I wore out the first one. Linda does an excellent job sining the old time favorites 
 More stories of the great physicist. In this book he tells of his early family life and the story of his first marriage. He also explains in great detail his role on the Challenger  Commission, and how the problem with the O rings came out. Great reading. Feynman was bigger than life 
 Forget Jagger and the Stones.  Stevie Marriott was THE MAN.  Stevie Marriott and Humble Pie were THE BEST British Hard-Rock band of the early 1970s. Who else but that little dervish with the monster vocals could rush from one end of the stage to the other in seconds, then strut his stuff from back at the drum set to the very front mike to deliver a blistering wail or put down some solid licks off his Black Les Paul? Ever see Jagger do that? Or Stewart?? Roger Daltrey???   Nah, none of them had the energy of Marriott who could do all of what they did and with a guitar strapped to him. He was the consummate frontman - screamin' Steve and played guitar with wild abandon.  "Smokin'" found Marriott at the peak of his powers and of his career. He proved, on this album, that even with the departure of Peter Frampton, the Pie was a Rock and Roll force to be reckoned with. "Black Lebanese, It Got You Weak in Your Knees. Newcastle Brown..." - and who can forget "You Take A Greasy Whore Add A Rolling Dance Floor" - Heh Heh - the lyrics of that great rock and roll song "Thirty Days in the Hole" which epitomizes the rock power of this album.  But wait there's more - much more. Besides "30 Days" there was "Hot and Nasty" with Marriott wailing on both voice and organ, tasty licks provided by Clem Clempson, the solid bass and drums of Greg Ridley and Jerry Shirley, and backing vocals courtesy of Stephen (yep, that's right) Stills and Rick "Foreigner, Peter Frampton, Bad Company" Wills; that raucous version of Eddie Cochran's "C'mon Everybody", Ridley and Marriott's "Sweet Peace and Time", and Ridley (with Clem) on "Old Time Feeling". The Pie - fuelled by Marriott's voice, the twin guitar energy of Marriott and Clempson, and the driving rhythm section of Ridley and Shirley, Nah, Nothin' could be finer.  There wasn't a bad track on this album, excepting perhaps "Road Runner's C Jam" which was recording in the jam spirit of the 1970s but perhaps a tad too long."Smokin'" was indeed one of the best Rock and Roll albums and arguably the Pie's best. Unfortunately by the next year and the next album Marriott had pushed his I wanna be Wilson Pickett too far, his drug use had become too excessive, his marriage went kaput, and the Pie went downhill fast. Had Marriott stayed stable, energetic and the Pie remained on that hard rock formula, who knows? They very well might have given the Stones a run for their money. At any rate, when the Pie dissolved in '75, Stone(d) Keith Richards was so taken with Marriott's vocal abilities and guitar prowess (they had been friends for years) that he placed him on the short list to replace Mick Taylor. Evidently during Marriott's rehearsal with the Stones he got so carried away and enthused that Mick Jagger was so intimidated that he sternly told Richards - NO MARRIOTT.   And don't forget Jimmy Page years earlier had approached Marriott to join a band he was forming called Led Zeppelin, only to be told by Marriott's then-manager Don Arden (yes, Sharon Osbourne's daddy)that he could only do so if he wanted his legs broken!  Even during the post-Pie period, with a voice wrecked from a few too many catawails and too much good booze and bad drugs, Marriott could still wow an audience.  No doubt Marriott was one of the best rock and roll frontmen, but also one of Britain's finest showmen in the Cockney Music Hall tradition too. His sad death - smoking in bed after returning to Britain following recordings with Peter Frampton in 1991 - deprived rock and roll of one of the absolute greats 
 The version of this CD that includes "Vitaminless" is a bootleg.  It'll be from "Sonmay" or "Everanime" who make a number of bootleg versions of various Anime soundtracks 
  Sophie Scholl (a committed, intelligent, idealistic Julia Jentsch) is a young German woman dedicated to bringing down the Third Reich. It's 1943, the Germans are losing untold numbers of their men in Stalingrad, the news has leaked into Germany about the Final Solution and the young and college educated are risking their lives and that of their families by distributing leaflets all over Europe discrediting the War and Hitler...which is considered a death penalty offense. Sophie and her brother Hans (Fabian Hinrichs) are caught and arrested and the bulk of the film deals with Sophie's interrogation by a government functionary, Robert Mohr (a sleazy, squirrelly Alexander Held). For several days and until her brother Hans confesses, Sophie holds her own and even betters Mohr. Julia Jentsch is extremely effective in portraying Scholl's idealism and burning intelligence. Her Sophie is a leader, a firebrand: someone who accepts the consequences of her actions without remorse and without pointing fingers towards anyone but herself. Too much of what Mohr spouts is pedantic, Nazi drivel whereas Sophie's responses are likewise pedantic, pie-in-the-sky and emotional. What makes their exchanges interesting is that they are based on official Gestapo records available only since German reunification. Despite all of this or maybe because of it, these interrogation scenes crackle with fire and truth: both Sophie and Mohr fully committed to their cause. "Sophie Scholl: Die letzten Tage" along with the recent "Downfall" are more important as social statements rather than artistic ones. They are both shining examples of a country facing its past squarely in the face and recognizing and releasing its collective ghosts and demons: the first step towards redemption. 
 Hillerman really knows how to spin a good tale and tie together all sorts of different subplots together into one knot as they all interrelate.  Joe Leaphorn doesn't believe in coincidences, and neither does the author.  And nothing simply coincides in his books, all the subplots come together neatly.  An anthropologist disappears, two men are found murdered, a backhoe is missing and Joe Leaphorn, who's wife has recently died and is retiring from the force, wants one last big case before he quits.  He cooperates with junior officer Jim Chee who just wants to find out who stole that damned backhoe and murdered those two men in the truck.  The book is really full of surprises and has a totally surprise ending.  Not the one that I was really hoping for or betting on, but it was a shocker.  A little hard to follow all the plots coming together however, which was why I gave it only 4 stars instead of 5. 
 How would you like the opportunity to sit down, one-on-one, with 21 of the exemplary top leaders of our time? What would you ask them? Would you enjoy getting to know them and yearn to begin applying what you learn to make a difference in your own life-and the lives of others? What questions would you ask them to unlock the secrets of their success?  Oh, you might be a little bit intimidated to ask personal questions, like "what is your secret of success?" "What are their best practices?" You want to know what really makes them so successful, what makes it all come together. It might be helpful to have someone else ask those questions on your behalf. Keith Harrell is a been there-done that motivational speaker who knows how to get inside the issues to learn the real truths. That insight is what makes him one of the most popular figures on the speaking circuit today.  In these pages, Keith (you'll feel like you're friends from the beginning) takes us on an exciting and enlightening journey. Not only does he dig in to get profound answers for his readers, he offers his own expansion of the leaders' responses...with challenges for us to consider how we might want to apply the learnings to change our own lives. Each chapter concludes with a sort of official biography in smaller type to help us understand who we're learning from. In putting this book together, Harrell has selected well-known and not-so-well-known leaders. Each has an important message to share, and the author's style brings those messages to life. And, as a bonus, there's an extra chapter filled with a sort of rapid-fire collection of insights from other people Keith wants to share with us.   An index enhances the value of the book. For current and aspiring leaders, this is a worthwhile read. 
 I was very impressed with the amount of research that had to go into this book- from how cops do detective work to the roots and long-term effects of racism to how gangs operate. You get a very strong sense that what happens in the book happens in real life, only you don't know it. That is the good part. The realism of the book is subtle, and you just feel what is written.  The more I read of this book, the more I wanted to read... only the need for sleep and homework got in my way! Also, the frustrations of the main character were expressed very well- it is not just some guy ranting nonsensically about racism, rather someone who has the mind to think rationally through his emotions and express them well to the benefit of the reader. This moves us to compassion and hopefully action- not sympathy or pity and inaction. Furthermore, the second story running through is very good... while sometimes there are things that seem a little forced ([spoiler warning] how would you actually talk to Jesus, anyway?) So with that in mind, its okay and not bothersome. However, the author's ideas of what will take place in heaven were very thought provoking and just makes you anticipate that day when Jesus calls you home! Another part I really enjoyed in this book, was the debate between the main character, who struggles with his faith throughout the story, and his brother, who is part of the Nation of Islam. I thought this wwritten done very well also. Bottomline: Youll love it 
 This has been my main bilingual dictionary for many years. I have the 2nd edition, and imagine the 3rd edition will be as good or better.  It is a very complete dictionary for the beginner and intermediate French learner and has many useful features.  It is very user friendly.  In addition it is a very sturdy dictionary that is still in very good condition after 3 or 4 years.  I would recommend it to most people looking for a thorough dictionary.    
 How the Grinch Stole Christmas is my very favorite book!  It's all about the life and times of a Green, Cranky little Crook!  You see, the Grinch HATED Christmas, and no one really knew why.  He just didn't like it -- it made him grumpified!  So he came up with a plan, an evil Grinchy-plot, to do away with Christmas for every kid and tot!  This book tells the whole story about how Christmas was saved in its greatest Christmas Glory!  Every kid will love this clever Christmas Story, and will want to read it again and again from now until they're forty!  (Actually, they'll want to read it forever... but forty rhymed a little better!) 
 'The Glorious Cause' is the second in Shaara's two volume piece historical fiction concerning the Revolutionary War. 'Rise to Rebellion' was the first, and I believe the superior of the two, but 'The Glorious Cause' is an excellent novel as well.  'Rise to Rebellion' was the superior of the two novels due to the changes of heart that the readers sees in John Adams and Benjamin Franklin concerning the issue of independence from England. 'The Glorious Cause' has little of that type deep soul-searching. However, it is a fantastic portrayal of the difficulties encountered by the Continental Army and George Washington, in particular.  If I were to have my druthers, I would have preferred that Shaara had broken this 600+ page novel into two novels and expanded them both by delving more into the politics of the day and the difficulties of fighting a war with the governmental structures and restrictions that the Contintenal Congress was hampered with.   In addition, more battles and fronts could have been explored, such as the ill-fated American invasion of Canada and Benedict Arnold's naval adventures on Lake Champlain.  That being said, these are still a highly recommended novels - either for the American Revolution novice or the enthusiast.   Well done, Mr. Shaara 
 I have a B.A. in biology, and I can say now I have been duped by the evidence (or lack thereof) for Darwinian evolution. I knew all along that all the work with Drosophila was a lot of barking up the wrong tree, because all the variation that scientists have been able to create are all deleterious changes, creating individuals that would not survive in nature. But scientists talk about Darwinian evolution as if it was oviously correct and confirmed thousands of times through published research. Dr. Wells's book explains clearly and exhaustively, through the fossil record and through research on "molecular evolution," that neither Darwinism nor "neo-Darwinism" have anything approaching conclusive evidence. Meanwhile a new idea, "Intelligent Design," comes up to show statistical evidence that it's more rational that an intelligent designer came up with the complexity in nature, rather than natural selection acting on random mutations. The scientific community is so enraged that instead of exploring this new idea, they are reduced to ad-hominem attacks to make sure no one rocks the boat. It's as bad as the Inquisition's attacks on Galileo.  Biology teachers owe it to their students to read this book and qualify what they teach about evolution in our schools

 It was so fabulous to read this highly enjoyable chronicle of Kirk Johnsons journey from nonrunner, basically, to ultrarunner and badwater finisher. Amazing. As an avid runner and ultrarunner, it was refreshing to see the sport from his eyes. Ihad first learned of him in the documentary on the Badwater 135,Running on the Sun. this book chronicles how he first learned about the race, his trianing and time leading up to the race, and the race itself. It was a great book. I recommend it to runners and nonrunners alike. 
  OK--I loved the book and agreed with the basic premise that Americans sure need to take a good look at their lifestyles---the whole materialistic overconsumption thing is really disgusting once you recognize it-I have read several books with this similar theme(Kalle Laasen, Naomi Klein,Travels of a t-shirt in a global society, etc) and the more I read the more "stuff" I eliminate from my life- I do not think that all the kids are as bad as some of those out there think- and not everyone is so pathetic and greedy as the book points out--it is just better imagery to paint a portrait of an America that has lost itself in a self-centered materialistic mire- I have 4 kids who do not get everything they want--they do chores--they learn to behave and show respect and they work hard. I know so many parents just like me and there are many very close neighbors in my neighborhood and others in my town. There are block parties, people help eachother out (not only after disasters either) and life goes on--no--we do not live in some imaginary Eutopia--we live 0n the East Coast- we work jobs and save money for our childrens college etc-- I say all this because although I agree with the book that American culture as a whole is going down the tubes,I think there are many people who are living in America that are resisting this cultural downfall--I do wish that this book could be required reading in schools !!! Sometimes it is difficult to get my teenagers to understand my rantings!! It is worth the effort and if each of my kids and all those other great kids out there can recongnize the   games advertisers play and can resist the temptations toward overconsumption that is pushed on them-then they will lead us into a fine future. Lets encourage the "counter-materialistic-culture" and pass the reading along!! 
 I'm very pleased with this slicer. Shaves ham and slices bread. Cheddar cheese doesn't slow the motor down in the least. Nicely designed. Easy to clean, it takes less than 10 minutes to disassemble, wash and re-assemble. It fits on the kitchen counter and is good looking. Highly recommended 
 "Overboard" is a Goldie Hawn classic! "Bird on a wire" and "Overboard" are neck and neck for all time funniest Goldie Hawn flicks. Either way, "Overboard" is playfully entertaining from start to finish 
 This book is a great reminder of why we were put here on earth and what is really important. Everyone should read this whether democrat or republican.  If we all followed these principles our future generation would be emotionally and physically healthy 
 I thought it was cool. I had no idea how many places were haunted and such. I would definately buy more books of the same 
 Trust me on this: if you care about books, this is one you absolutely must read.  Elizabeth Young has a stupendous prose style, a sinuous & interesting taste and a way of hooking you from page 1.  I only heard about this because someone I know at Serpent's Tail gave me a copy, but it's a crime this book isn't better known in the USA.  I am about to buy several copies so that I can give them away & make some converts 
 I am a busy architect and this is the 2nd pair of Clics I own.   If you are active and need reading glasses they are perfect. Their only drawback is that they take two hands to put on!  I'd  look at slimming down the frames to make them less heavy and trimmer. Lastly ~ I've found these readers to be really rugged and good for outdoor use 
 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  It's such an eye-opener. Society should realize that women's rights benefit both women and men as a whole 
 This is the second book in the series.  If you have an afternoon to spend with a good book- this is it! Reading about Kinsey is like being with a good friend. 
 This was a wonderful yet tough one for me.  I listened to the audio version and wonder if because I heard so much emotion in Mr. Grogan's voice, I felt it even more than if I had read it.  At any rate, most parts were adorable and hysterically funny.  I am a dog lover so I understand the frustrations and yet, hearing them come from someone else was tough on me, particularly when Mrs. Grogan loses it.  That said, the fact that the Grogans loved Marley to pieces rings loud and clear here so no judgements intended if that's how I sound. Most times it sounds like their patience was endless and I believe that this is in part why dogs are here on this earth. To teach us all the simple things we should do but forget to.    Marley was a loveable goofball and sweet and innocent.  That is exactly why I love to read about dogs.  Sadly, their time here on earth is way too short.  I was driving to work while listening to Mr. Grogan telling Marley how much he loved him and I have to tell you, I nearly had to pull over.  I'm tearing up just thinking about it now.    I came away from this book loving Marley perhaps almost as much as his family...and that is a real tribute to Mr. Grogan's ability to share Marley's story with us.  Thanks to them for sharing Marley's life 
 A "MUST",  If you don't read it, you will miss something in your life.  There is a lot to lear 
 It is a bit florid and the performances are slightly over the top(Kirk),but it is  one of the best of its kind.The two leads are  marvelous(and in their prime) and the tiomkin score is outstanding.One reviewer tells of the lousy transfer;not my copy.The opening shot is clear and sharp and if throughout it is not exactly a minted jewel , it is always good and for a 50 year old film that is saying something.The best color transfer of a western I`ve seen from those days is john fords "she wore a yellow ribbon" and this one, while not perfect,is still very good.It is a vintage  story told in  hollywood style.They  don`t make them like this anymore.Good show 
 Let's just start by stating its a "Best of..." because (believe it or not) not enough people have bought his singles for him to make actual "Greatest Hits".  If your in this category, buy it, your in for a treat.  For those that already have everything he's ever done, I'll concentrate on this disc's value added, like how each song has a (real) short paragraph penned by Hiatt revealing the history/state of mind when it was written.  And the new/reworked/first time released songs, like...  "Have a Little Faith in Me" - Reworked like a single (as opposed to the stark/emotional original) complete with female backup, gospel choir, and set to a persistent 90's style clap track beat.  Its only missing the guest Rapper.  "The Way We Make A Broken Heart" - Left off of the "Riding with the King" album, this song features a duet w/Rosanne Cash (who sounds a little like Crystal Gayle in "One From the Heart").  Maybe not better than some songs that got bumped off this disc to make room for it, but it's nice to hear an almost lost/rare cut.  "Drive South" - Reworked to sound more thoughtful.  The words are the same, but the original had an impatient energy (and tounge-in-cheek sexuality) that this version lacks.  "Angel Eyes" - He gets to record his own song here.  Excellent soulful version.  "Love in Flames" - Recent recording of a tune written in '91, its average for a Hiatt Song, but his voice gives it enough character to be glad we get to hear a new Hiatt song.  "Don't know Much About Love" - Another new/old song.  It's kind of a catchy tune.  Why do I keep wanting to sing the Supremes "Come See About Me" ("You Keep me crying, waiting for you...") during this song?  The mandolin makes this tune, and again, since its new Hiatt, its worth having.  That makes about a third of the album new (and collectable) in some way, and I like that they weren't limited by label (like "Y'All Caught? The Ones That Got Away" was) so could include "Riding with the King" (one of my favs which also he played the last time I saw him live).  The real "Best of" songs on this disc are great...but you should get the albums there on (as well!).   Like I said, if you've never heard of Hiatt, you can get this disc as a starter.  Afterward, you'll feel compelled to buy the albums anyway. 
 WOW!  WHERE DO I START ?  A SUPERB RADIO.  SHINY DARTH VADER BLACK.  FLAWLESS IN EVERY DETAIL.  MUDDY BASE CLEARS UP IF YOU DECREASE IT. FRONT PHONE JACK AND A REMOTE MAKE UP FOR WHAT I THINK IS POOR LOCATION FOR CONTROLS.  ON MY SONY THEY ARE ON TOP AND ALLOW FOR EASY USE WHEN IN BED LISTENING AT NIGHT.  CONNECTIONS ON THE BACK FOR EXTERNAL ANTENNAS. A TERK TOWER IS COMING FROM UNIVERSAL RADIO.  12 VOLT POWER JACK TOO! JUST FROM A SIMPLE WIRE ANTENNA I GET FM STATIONS A HUNDRED MILES AWAY.  AM NEEDS SOME TINKERING WITH ANTENNAS TO WORK I THINK... FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY. SIX WHEN I JUICE THE AM SECTION FOR BETTER RECEPTION 
 Truly enjoyed this exceptional piece of work.  Very diverse music while maintaining the country base all the way through.  You can really appreciate all of their musical influences growing up.     Their writing is exceptional on "Red Dirt Road", "When We Were Kings", etc. etc. etc.     Don't know if there is anyone in country music today with a finer tenor then Dunn.  He shines on this CD especially on "I Used To Know This Song By Heart".  Kix sounds great as well.  Surprised more songs weren't released off of this CDs.  I think they went into this as wanting to express their musical influences and not necessarily to release radio friendly songs.  I REALLY ENJOYED ALL OF THE SONGS ON THIS ONE.   There are some songs that really make you stop and think/reflect which is what country music is all about.  ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS CD.  THE MORE I LISTEN TO IT THE MORE I LOVE IT.   KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK BROOKS & DUNN.

 This truly is vintage Joseph Ellis. I've enjoyed all of his books, particularly his writing. The fact you are reading this is proof you are interested in Jefferson, so you ought to get this book. Highest recommendation.  For the most unconventional book I have ever read on Jefferson, to give a little bit of contrast, also try West Point: Thomas Jefferson: Character Leadership by Norman Thomas Remick. 
 This book is a great "picture book" for anyone interested in art and/or women artist.  The descriptions of the work are concise, giving enough information to make you want to investigate further. A necessary addition to any art book collection 
 I enjoyed this book.  Not quite up to the Malory standard, but still enjoyable.  I own all of her books, so wouldn't consider not buying it.  
 During their existence in the early 1980's, Factory band Crispy Ambulance was dismissed as a Joy Division ripoff. It's true that C.A.'s early singles did sound an awful lot like J.D., but on The Plateau Phase, C.A. came into their own. On this incredible album there are hints of prog-rock, ambient, and eerie electronic effects combined with tense, shimmering guitar work and a bludgeoning rhythm section. Obviously Crispy Ambulance were pushing the boundaries, and their experiments with sound and texture paid off in spades. Listen to tracks like "Are You Ready", "The Wind and The Season", and the perhaps the bands finest song "Chill", and hear what I mean. As much as I love Joy Division (as well as many other Factory and post-punk bands of the time), for me The Plateau Phase stands as the most original and captivating album of the entire early 80's era. There has never been an album like this before or since 
 Pulparindo is made with tamarind pulp, sugar, chili powder and salt.  People either love or hate it.  I love it 
 I don't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained. I don't seek to psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique, it's only a movie. I either enjoy it or I don't. I just really love this movie. Kyra Sedgewick is hysterical, and the little girl that played "Caroline" was just adorable. The whole cast is very good, but those two are scene-stealers 
 Horton writes an environmental column in the Baltimore Sunwhich Isometimes enjoy and sometimes don't.  So I was prepared for Island Out of Time to be average.  But I was more than pleasantly surprised.  Horton has written a first-rate account of the watermen and their families on Smith Island from the first-hand observations of his family, which lived on the island for several years, as well as great oral accounts from the islanders themselves 
 Dalis Car is another of that rare pieces into Ash and Murphys catalog they have togheter and by themselves explored a bunch of musical proposals all for an insatiable sense of perfection and avant garde that have provided England and Europe the solid reputation known by real connosieurs, among several projects such as Tons Of Tail, Love And Rockets, Bauhaus, etcetera. were dark, rock , techno, alternative and every imaginable proposal converge Dalis Car is an appealing oddity more oriented into artificial flavored sounds (sinthetizers) many years before FSOL time or Massive Attack age, Murphys fascination for art and poetry and literary songwritting is evident and Ash musical creativity and experimentation combined complete this rare piece known by a few fans of any of the before projects named in this review because perhaps Dalis Car never had the fame that Bauhaus or Love and Rockets had but it has its own charm by own rigth HM  
 This is a beautifully written and highly enjoyable exploration of the history of women in writing. It is also a plea for the liberation of women, and their full entrance into the world of Literature. Woolf argues that a woman needs financial independence, a room , that is a space of her own, if she is to be able to truly create. She also needs the kind of access to everyday life that women confined to hearth and home were as she sees it, traditionally denied.  She urges that Woman enter into all fields of writing, and develop in directions they had no opportunity to develop in before.  She also perhaps reflecting on her own experience and nature argues for the androgynous nature of the creator, seeing in Shakespeare, Keats and certainly Proust a strong feminine element.  Woolf anticipates and perhaps in some sense helps creates the vast flourishing of Literature written by women which will come in the decades after her 
 Even though this book is targeted for young/teen readers, it is an excellent adventure story for anyone to enjoy. While it's not my favorite book, it is one of the best adventure stories I've ever read. If you crave adventure, & want to enjoy a great story, don't let the fact that this is a "youth reader" type book dissuade you from reading this one; its a grand adventure 
 I generally play poker, last year was my first season participating in fantasy football.  I read this book Drafting to win and took down first place.  If you have any sort of mathematical background I highly recommend this book.  Better yet if you are a competitive person who likes to win then get the book.  If you like to loose don't get the book.                
 If you are a long time Dolls fan and completist, view this as a great CD for driving around in the car, or for working out at the gym. If you were born after they broke up, and think Motley Crue or Guns N Roses invented this type of music, if you didn't know that KISS used to open for the Dolls way back when, or viewed the semi-drag get up on the first album as something to be scared of, or think punk was invented by the Ramones or the Sex Pistols, you need to buy this now. NOTHING afterwards would've happened without the NY Dolls. Period. EOC. All that happened after the Velvet Underground is directly as response to the advent of the Dolls. If you love late 20th century rock, and you don't own this, buy now. 'Nuf said 
 Schiff's understanding of the French is the key to this book -- that plus her lively writing style, wonderful wit, and the sheer craftsmanship of her phrasing and her story-telling. The book is a romp, through a trying and tedious time in the life of one of America's and the 18th century's most trying but least tedious characters.   Ben Franklin is presented here tenderly and fairly: warts and all, as Ben would have preferred, but with even the warts dressed up in their own special way, as Ben also would have specified. And the ladies of Passy and the Paris salons would have laughed...  America needed the French, and the French needed Franklin: Schiff's thesis is that Ben might not have been a man for all seasons, but that he definitely was the man for this particular occasion. Not John Jay, not Silas Deane, not even Thomas Jefferson and above all not John Adams: the French of this particular time and place, pre-Revolutionary Paris, required one American and only one, Franklin, to amuse them and tease them into parting with money and guns and international detente with the British and the Spanish -- all of which guaranteed America its revolution, while arguably bringing its own revolution upon France.  The Parisian whirlwind into which he stepped -- "In December 1776, a small boat delivered an old man to France...", as Schiff says -- devoured others, such as Adams, or rejected them outright. But Paris welcomed and delighted in and eventually canonized Ben. Why this is, others who have tried to achieve acceptance among the always-difficult French can appreciate: sometimes it works, although very often it doesn't, and just why Franklin was accepted and not the others is delicately and superbly outlined in this book.  Diplomacy is personal, also statesmanship, and jealous intrigue, and most of politics: Schiff's book is about all of this, a case study. Such subjects can be the driest of the dry -- "American foreign relations in France in the late 1700s..." -- but Schiff's personalizing of them, through Franklin, renders them approachable and entertaining and exciting. By the end of the book one feels for the man -- this great renewal at the end of a long life, his great strengths, his foibles and errors, his many weaknesses -- and for the situation, in which Franklin was the man of the hour and no other could have achieved what he did.   It's just as Wellington described Waterloo: American independence, too, was nothing inevitable but in fact a "damned near-run thing". Schiff's book shows just how dependent upon real people and their personalities this sort of thing can be 
 IF YOU CAN READ THE BOOK WILL DO THE REST 
  This is an excellent book on alternative forms of healing, including herbal and homeopathic remedies, vitamin therapy, and the like.  The information on nutrition alone is worth the price of admission.  It's a well-worn part of my dog's reference library.  I only have two caveats: one is that even though Pitcairn constantly recommends talking things over with your vet, especially when it comes to serious health issues, the general tendency of some people drawn to this type of material will be to use an all-natural-or-nothing approach, try everything and see if it works, and NOT talk to the vet.  This is not a criticism of the book itself, but a generic problem.  My other caveat is going to sound heretical to some readers, which is that Dr. Pitcairn, who's an advocate of all-natural treatments, recommends spaying and neutering, which is totally unnatural and unhealthy.  It's understandable for him to do this, given the nature of the overpopulation problem we have in this country, I just wish Dr. Pitcairn had been more truthful about the subject and hadn't resorted to the standard propaganda.  The truth is, testosterone may help male dogs live healthier, longer lives.  And research shows that natural levels of the hormone promote calm behavior so males are generally LESS aggressive when left intact.  And as a trainer who uses natural dog training methods I find that intact dogs, male and female, are also much easier to train.  (Anther quibble: Pitcairn doesn't mention that vasectomies are a healthy alternative to castration, and are a less invasive form of surgery.)    Still,it's a must-have for anyone interested in their pet's health and well-being.  Four stars.   
   This book breaks down strength training with science. There is a lot of rhetoric out there that preach unproven theories. This test cuts through these false ideas and let the exerciser know what is actually necessary.  Jason Rulo CSCS, HF 
 Since I have been unable to locate an address in which to write Mr. Garcia to explain how this film touched me, I thought this might be the next best thing.  As a "natural born" citizen of the United States, I often feel overwhelming guilt for the suffering of the people who live in countries ruled by dictatorships and tyranny, while I enjoy  innumerable freedoms here.  Mr. Garcia has brought us a film that inspires hope, courage of conviction, and raises our awareness  of the suffering still going on in his birthplace without bringing  the stinging guilt that such a movie usually instills in me.  I cried, then paced my apartment, then searched the Web for hours trying to find a way to contact  Mr. Garcia to tell him that his message is received and appreciated. The story is so amazing, it is almost difficult to believe that Mr. Sandavol not only lived it, but managed to see his whole family emigrate to the U.S.  Thank you, HBO and Mr. Garcia, for telling a story that deserved to be told 
 This the first book I have read by this author, and I was kind of thinking it would be a dense love story, with no action, but boy was I wrong.  The book was great, I didn't really want the story to end, but then I found out that this was the 1st book of a series, and I ordered the others.  The story is about a woman that has lost her Grandmother, and with missing her and trying to decide what changes to make with her own life, Marnie Wright goes the old cabin where she visited her Grandmother as a child.  Thinking she would have peace and quiet there, she takes her dog and leaves for the weekend to stay in the cabin. Only she is not the only one on the mountain.  While minding her own business and enjoying the atmosphere, along comes Jake Dolan, (TIN MAN). He pulls a gun on her and tell her to get off his mountain.  Being stubborn, Marnie, isn't going anywhere, especially sense Jake is the most gorgeous hunk of man she has ever seen.  Knowing he is hiding something, she stays in her Grandmothers's cabin until a tree falls through the roof and could have killed her, but who rescues her but none other than Jake Nolan, the grouch. She has nowhere to go but to his cabin.   Then the sparks fly, for her, but not necessarily for him. He wants her gone, and soon. With the bridges washed out, she has no choice but stay there. But uninvited strangers start invading the mountain. It is hide, run, or be killed.  Jake takes her to his underground hideaway. They have to fight for their lives. And in the process, live in the same space with each other.  The story was so fast paced that the book was so hard to put down. I recommend this book very highly. I like books with adventure, and this one really has it. And the romance was good too 
 The content in this book can be applied to adult children. It has a lot of practical advice. The reading voice is natural and easy to listen. It was very helpful to me 
 "When Gifted Kids Don't Have All the Answers" isn't just an excellent book for teachers and parents of gifted children (though it definitely is such a book).  I just picked this book up at the local bookstore, and, as a gifted child (well, young adult, now) myself, I can honestly say that this book has been just as much help for me as I think it would be for any teacher or parent, if only because it validates everything about gifted kids that I've known and felt ever since I was little.  I think that every gifted child should have a chance to read this book, if only to understand him- or herself a little bit better, as well as to understand the struggles that teachers and parents of gifted kids go through, trying to teach and parent such children.  And I thank the authors very much for writing such an interesting, useful book 
 Dreamscape is a fun, if undeniably underrated, thriller from the early 1980s.  Dennis Quaid plays a psychic who is recruited into a secret, government-funded operation by Max Von Sydow.  Under the direction of Von Sydow and colleague Kate Capshaw, Quaid learns how to enter other people's dreams.  Amongst other things, this ability allows Quaid to romance the reluctant Capshaw and to help a small boy who is haunted by nightmares involving a demonic creature known as Snake Man (who, years later, remains one of screen history's scariest monsters).  However, Quaid also discovers that the real force behind the project is Presidential advisor Christopher Plummer and Plummer has somewhat more sinister goals in mind for Quaid's newfound abilities.  President Eddie Albert, it seems, is having nightmares of his own and there leading him to sign a disarmament pact with the Russians.  While Plummer makes plan to send his own personal assassin (David Patrick Kelly) into the President's dreams, Quaid and Capshaw struggle to save the President's life.    Dreamscape is an entertaining film that, luckily, doesn't take itself all that seriously.  The film itself is a hybrid of several different genres -- part horror film, part political conspiracy thriller, part speculative science fiction, and part comedy and director Joseph Ruben manages to pull of an impressive balancing act by seemlessly integrating all of these elements into a cohesive whole that actually holds together pretty well.  Ruben keeps the action moving nicely and brings a truly memorable flair to the film's dream sequences.  As stated previously, the Snake Man (a creation that would simply be a cartoonish computer-generated image if the film were made today) is still truly frightening and the President's nightmares, with their images of nuclear devastation, still retain their power to disturb.  Ruben also gets uniformly good performances from his cast with special praise going to David Patrick Kelly who creates one of the most memorably quirky and hateful film villians of the 1980s.  All in all, Dreamscape is a blast from the past that is more than worth tracking down.   
 Lama Sura Das does an excellent job communicating Buddhism for the Western world.  We are all Buddhas inside, it doesn't matter if you are Christian, Jewish, or Muslim.  Buddhism is a way of living, not a "Church" as we may think of it.  I myself am a Christian and find it exciting how Jesus led a Buddha like life!  This book opens many doors to spirituality that are crying out to be explored!  Awaken your Buddha within!! 
 One has to appreciate the time and efforts of those that made this film.  It is one of the best nature films I've seen.  Everyone should watch it 
 A great album that is folk gospel.  A classic performance from Emmylou during the 70's.  I don't like classic country at all but I like folk and this is one must-have.  Downhome and definetly worth every cent 
 After buying so many business books for $20 and getting no real value, I wondered if this one might live up to its price. It's worth many times the price.  This book could easily be sold for $200 and I would pay it because the material written in The Startup Company Bible is priceless.  I just wish I had it a few years ago.  
 I won't say a single word about the emotional weight of Joy Division's music or the impossible burden of Ian Curtis' words; other reviewers do that sort of thing far more justice than I could ever hope.  Instead, I want to make some important points for those considering the purchase of Substance:  1.) Substance was not assembled at random.  Its logic is actually quite praiseworthy: theoretically this disc is supposed to collect ALL the non-album tracks - songs given to compilations, A-sides, B-sides, and EP tracks - into one place, to function as a companion to Unknown Pleasures and Closer.  To that end, NONE of the songs present on this compilation are available on their two regular albums, though two songs are duplicated from the posthumous outtakes album Still ("Glass" and "Dead Souls" - the former is only ho-hum for Joy Division, the latter is a key track, but their inclusion is more justifiable here than it is on that set since both were officially released within the band's working life).  People who see "She's Lost Control" on the tracklisting here need to realize that this is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT version than the one on Unknown Pleasures (the boxed set calls it the `12" version'), and it's arguably far superior.   2.) Frustratingly, Substance nevertheless fails at its stated purpose.  Now I'm not a pedant - I don't really begrudge the absence of minor tracks like the instrumental "As You Said" or the flexidisc toss-off "Sound Of Music" - but one omission in particular is agonizing: the spectacular, glowing alternate version of "Love Will Tear Us Apart" that shared the B-side of the more famous single version of that song with "These Days."  It's a gorgeous, poignantly haunting recording (I waver on whether it's superior to the well-known version presented here), and it was even inexcusably excluded from the boxed set (which at the very least ought to have collected all of their officially released work before including outtakes).  The only place to find it on CD is the otherwise worthless compilation Permanent.  3.) The sound quality on this CD is really beginning to show its age.  My introduction to Joy Division was with the sparkling remastered sound of the Heart And Soul boxed set, and when I happened to hear a friend's version of this disc I was stunned to find out how desiccated and distant the individual CDs sound.  I want to make it clear that I'm not a person with impossibly fussy ears, and that I have thousands of CD's worth of experience with remastering before-and-after comparisons, when I say that the difference between the cleaned up version of the Joy Division catalogue available on the boxed set and the versions available on these individual CDs is one of the more pronounced ones still on the market.  4.) As for the contents of album itself, is this where you should begin with Joy Division?  I'm not sure.  It's ONE possible place, but heaven help you if you begin here and fail to continue onward to Unknown Pleasures and Closer, none of whose songs are found here.  I sometimes like to argue that Joy Division's best moments came on their singles and compilation tracks, and that Substance really represents their peak.  Given the evidence of formidable tracks like "Digital" and "From Safety To Where...?," the incredible singles "Transmission," "Atmosphere," and "Love Will Tear Us Apart," and their equally impressive B-sides ("Novelty," "Dead Souls," "These Days"), that still seems like a good assessment.  But this is only 1/3 of the story, and the real problem is that if you're at all intrigued by this group, you're going to eventually want to buy the "complete studio works" boxed set Heart And Soul.  I was lucky enough to have begun there - I took a leap of faith that paid off - but if you buy this CD and are transfixed by it, I would recommend that you do NOT go buy Unknown Pleasures and Closer next (both of which sound equally flakey in their current unremastered CD form) but rather invest in the boxed set and save yourself money that you'd otherwise end up spending anyway 
     August Escoffier was known as "The king of chefs and the chef of kings". This book is indispensible to anyone who is serious about the culinary arts. Escoffier defined the benchmark for classic French cooking from which most western cooking gets its roots, much like all forms of modern music from rock to country have their roots in classical music.  You can find essences of classic French cooking in even the lowliest diner fare.      Much of what is taught in culinary schools today is based on Escoffier's tecniques.  By purchasing this book, you are getting this information straight from the horse's mouth, so to speak, rather than second-hand with the possibility of influences instilled by the instructor skewing the information.     I believe the most surprising section of the book is that dealing with treatments for various types of game.  This section contains comprehensive instructions for dealing with a wide variety of game from buffalo to venison that are very useful today.     I have noticed in at least two places, Escoffier appears to contradict himself. I believe this is due to the problems with translation, and if you follow carefully what he is saying, you can figure out the correct meaning 
 First off, the book is very easy to get through - the primary theoretical points are clearly laid out and easy to understand, the selected empirical evidence is interesting, and the style is fluid and coherent.  This is the strength of realist theory - clarity of thought, and results in a much more enjoyable read than something by a radical-constructivist or critical theorist.  The disagreement over theory is clear from the wide range of ratings in the reviews, but I'd like to briefly cover some of the issues brought up by other reviewers.  Offensive realism, as posited by Mearsheimer is NOT a rehash of Waltz's structural realism but rather adds some important new elements to realist theory.  As a result, it is still susceptible to some of the critiques of realist theory in general but also adds new theoretical problems.  Mearsheimer uses Waltz' assumptions on the anarchic nature of the international system and its implication for state behaviour but goes in a very different direction.  Using the same assumptions, Waltz believes great powers will essentially be status-quo and defensive while Mearsheimer believes they will be revisionist and aggressive power-maximizers.  Mearsheimer thus can avoid the argument against Waltz's defensive realist theory that it leaves no room for transformation of the international system.  The potential for conflict is a direct result of the distribution of power in the anarchic system.  The assumptions used by both are by no means "given" and disagreement over them has come from liberal institutionalists, the English School, and the various subsets of constructivist theory.  Whether state interests and identities are exogenous or endogenous, and whether there is any room for interests to be shaped by domestic politics, culture, ideology, or institutions is the primary diagreement.  Realism says there are only structural variables.    If you think you're a realist, you might want to take note that no prominent realists supported the Iraq War.  Realists would also pay no attention to the government of China - a hegemonic democratic China is as dangerous as a hegemonic authoritarian China.  Also, the environment and potential for conflict in Europe is the same as in Asia - NATO and the EU, as institutions, are merely tools for great powers to position themselves in hegemonic struggle(this might be included because Mearsheimer said NATO was to be disbanded shortly after the end of the Cold War and needs to find a reason why it is still around).  Ideational factors simply have no place in the theory.  Returning to Mearsheimer, he adds another variable to his theory, the impact of geopolitics on state interest.  So not only does the distribution of power affect the potential for conflict, geographical factors also play a role.  This complicates matters because no longer is there a single variable that can be used to determine causality, and it might be seen as a theoretical crutch.  The US and UK both are exceptions to the rule that great powers expand aggressively.  Some would say it is because they are liberal democracies, but Mearsheimer argues that it is because they are "offshore balancers", insular states that find it difficult to project power but also derive security from this.  An exception to that exception is Japan in WWII, which Mearsheimer explains didn't have a lot of resistance and so couldn't help itself.  Another reviewer wrote of the unverifiability of Mearsheimer's theory.  I think that the two variables and the stipulations he puts on power-maximization do make the theory a bit "slippery".  Mearsheimer concludes the book by saying that, "Of course, states occasionally ignore the anarchic world in which they operate, choosing instead to pursue strategies that contradict balance-of-power logic."  This is a contradiction of the book and realist theory in general.  States shouldn't be able to choose how they behave but should be bound by the structure of the system (and geopolitics in Mearsheimer's version) to behave in a certain manner (offensively or defensively according to Mearsheimer or Waltz, respectively).  There are too many exceptions and stipulations to Mearsheimer's rule to make it particularly useful.  Whereas the strength of Waltz's theory is its simplicity, Mearsheimer believes he combines theoretical simplicity with policy applicability.  He succeeds in neither.  Nevertheless, the book is the clearest articulation of offensive realism.  Perhaps more comprehensive reading would be Mearsheimer's article on international institutions in International Security Winter 1994/1995, followed by responses from John Ruggie, Robert Keohane, Alexander Wendt, and the Kupchans, and a concluding reply by Mearsheimer 
 There is no such thing as the Kennedy Curse, just a family who loves risky acts.  John John - He was died due to the fact that he was an inexperienced pilot.  The list goes on and one...   main point : THERE IS NO CURSE! 
 Good Product. I've gone through many different gadgets to hang my ties (motorized, rotary, hooks, etc.). In the end, I began storing them in a box on my dresser to keep them off the floor, and without damage.  I recently purchased this product and found that it is awesome! * Solid Construction * Chrome plated hanger * Non-slip vinyl tie holder area * Actually quite small  I only ordered one set, thinking that this was going to be a low quality problem, but they're great. I'll definitely order more of these for my ties.  That being said, I don't think this product is much for hangin belts. I like to store my belts either flat or coiled...but not folded in half. So, unless you have the belt buckle with a big hole in the middle, this product won't due much as a belt hanger.  In conclusion: Tie Hanger=Excellent; Belt Hanger=Not so goo 
 Vonnegut. Dante. Homer. William Burroughs.   ...All very well known, and highly regarded. They are all, generally speaking, regarded as geniuses of the literary world, applying with grace and power the thoughts, emotions, and techniques used to create enrapturing works.   Imagine, if you will, if these Authors penned works that were often far too controversial for mainstream acceptance... Would they still be regarded? Doubtful. Should they be? Has anything inherently changed within their work?... No. This is the case with most Bizarro authors today, often works of great classics go unnoticed, hidden on some far off, irrelevant shelf in bookstores, due to lack of genre recognition, works of genius slowly decaying, parallel to the hopes and dreams of the Authors that invested their very souls into their work.   Often, Authors become appreciated after they have passed away, never to realise the recognition of their work. Eventually quality could be noticed, and appreciated after massive periods of time have gone by. However, ask; 'Why not now?' The answer? No reason at all. This is the case with Electric Jesus Corpse. Buy this, and buy Bizarro literature.   - A Huge Fan. 
 It's surprising to find true innovation in such an affordable product. I was concerned that having extra features on a coffee maker would be annoying or cumbersome but, this coffee maker is very easy to program or just use. The 1-4 cup feature and the extra flavor feature seemed like fluff to me, but I find myself enjoying them too.  The design team should be rewarded for comming up with the dual purpose container, it's such an easy way to fill the resevoir while also keeping the coffee hot and fresh. Every morning I start the day with a gooood cup of fresh coffee, no mess, no fuss. I like it 
 Although not a great work of literature, these books are a light, easy read which are bound to entertain any animal lover.  The animals play a central role in all the charachters lives.  I love to read these series just before I go to sleep 
 I have looked for along time for a book like this. No where is more information packed into one book about our "critical lifelines". This is a coffee table book that explores the full spectrum of every lifeline/infrastructure society needs to exist. The only recommended improvement areas would be to add more in a another volume. I could not put this book down! For disaster managers or community planners, this book is for you. The price is misleading, so much information for so little cost. 
 BY itself it is a great SF movie and still worth watching today 
 This is a really good soundtrack. It basically has the same songs from the original, but with different sounds and titles to them. It sounds a little more complex. It also includes the song Mr. Sandman which gives it a more happy tone to the end of the CD. The CD is also very creepy, especially the song, the Shape Still Stalks. That might not be the exact title, but I know it is #5. If you get a chance, buy the CD 
 While I'm quite impressed with the health claims for these nibs, frankly they taste like dirt!  (Or what I imagine dirt would taste like.)    I don't understand how one reviewer got the nibs to melt.  When I tried it, I got hot dirt.  I finally settled on grinding them fine, mixing them with peanut butter, sweetener, regular cocoa powder and a little milk.  It's not bad -- but maybe next, I'll just get some really dark chocolate.  Life's a little short to be eating dirt.    
 Love the music - always relaxing and upbeat. Even my 12 year old son thinks the music is great. He really appreciates the fact that most of Jack Johnson's songs have an actual message that is common sense - something we all think and/or understand. Overall Good buy 
 This is a very thorough and detailed guide to what seems like every aspect of hydronic heating. Both theory and practical application advice are included. It is also indispensable as a ready reference for particular problems you are seeking solutions for. The cd rom included has many useful tools for estimating and calculating heating system requirements (there is one tiresome limitation - the cd rom does not run on MacOS. At the price paid for the package, it should!). Otherwise highly recommended 
 clive takes you thru twists and turns, both natural and man made and the danger is really page turning.  a GREAT BOOK TO READ DURING A THUNDER STORM 
 This is certainly a unique blending of genre's. Jazz, New Age mystical, & Medieval chanting are combined into something that feels new. The lyrics are chanted rather than sung, which works well since the music is the main focus. I found the use of Latin & French to be refreshing. This is enjoyable for driving or daydreaming, not at the same time of course. The listener is teleported back & forth to a time when they first heard this album. This is the ultimate synthesis of hormones, spirit, nature sounds, & mysticism. However, repetitive at times. I felt the 3 best tunes were "Principles Of Lust, Sadness, & Mea Culpa." All original & yet different in delivery & content. Give this several listens before you make up your mind. I'm sure you will find it interesting? 
 I think Seth is a genius and I love his witty, relevant books filled with tales of companies we know and concepts and ideas we can relate to. This is a good read, and well worth it 
 With the Piano Tuner, Daniel Mason has performed what all aspiring authors long to.  This book became a best seller for obvious reasons.  The story and plot lines are well thought out.  The history presented within the book is fairly accurate.  And, best of all, the story is a very original twist on a very old theme.  Being a huge fan of Kerouac, I was very used to observing and identifying the conflicts the main character is presented with when faced with traveling long distances away from home, family, and friends.  The conflicts here are similar.  What makes the Piano Tuner worth reading is the descriptive language and vivid characters presented by Mason.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to more by the author 
 Oh, my, this book was wonderful.  I devoured all 600 pages in a week.  Read it during the winter, curled up in a warm sweater, and drink a cup of hot chocolate while you turn pages.  The writing is just beautiful-- the characters fully drawn and interesting.  I fully identified with Maggie (the protagonist) as she moved through her very moral, principled life.  She has many complicated relationships with people that are just a joy to read about.  If you like Victorian novels, do not miss this one.  I've heard Middlemarch is even better and I can't wait 
 When Marlow begins his journey to find the mythical Kurtz in HEART OF DARKNESS, Joseph Conrad dares the reader to accompany Marlow on a voyage less into the physical jungles of darkest Africa and more into the mental labyrinth that human beings erect to protect themselves from the horrors that they themselves build. In this justly famous novella, Conrad depicts a pre-politically correct age when white men thought it only fair and inevitable that they plunder the riches of Africa all the while comforting themselves that they were uplifting the fallen state of a lowly people.    Conrad uses a twin layer of narratives in order to achieve the needed objectivity that he felt required to place the reader at varying distances from the horror that Kurtz cried out at the end. The opening narrator is unnamed, possibly Conrad himself, who sets the stage by placing the reader at a safe distance from the evils which lay squarely ahead. Through this narrator we get a bird'e eyes view of the true narrator Marlow, who is depicted as somehow different from the four other men on the deck of the Nellie. This difference in physical attributes slowly increases to concomitant differences in perspective, attitude, and general authorial reliability. Marlow is a deeply flawed man who has the disadvantage of viewing the unfolding events from the prejudiced eyes of a white colonial civil servant who is sure that the blacks in Africa are little different from his preconceived notion of uncivilized cannibals. Further, Marlow makes numerous errors of judgment along the way, many of them seemingly insignificant, yet the totality of the reader's perspective is twisted through the equally twisted lens of an unreliable narrator. Conrad's purpose in melding the reader to a flawed narrator was to insure that the reader could never trust what he reads, thereby increasing his sense of unease in that the sense of safety that Marlow feels, first on the deck of the Nellie, and later in the jungle itself, is as flimsy as the signposts that guide Marlow toward his goal.  The goal is Kurtz, a trader who set out to civilize the blacks into accepting a white version of civilization, but Marlow finds out that the reverse happened.  The true horror that Kurtz sees is the horror that all would be conquerors find when they discover that the philosophy of racial supremacy which led them into conflict with a people whom they deemed unworthy is shown to be built on straw.  Kurtz knows that the only difference between his brutal acts toward the natives and their own similar atrocities toward themselves is no difference at all. As corrupt as Kurtz must have been, in his closing cry of horror, he finds a small measure of redemption and closure.  Marlow sees what Kurtz saw, knew what Kurtz did, and heard up close and personal Kurtz's swan song of pain, but Marlow learned nothing of lasting value. All he could think of was to maintain the image of the Kurtz that was: "I remained to dream the nightmare out to the end, and to show my loyalty to Kurtz once more." The journey that Kurtz took was a horror only because he became what he sought. The journey that Marlow took became a horror only because he learned nothing from what he sought. As you and I read HEART OF DARKNESS, we must decide which journey has the more meaningful signposts 
 This was a keeper. The best I have found, so far. Light and airy. Can make peanut butter & jelly sandwiches.. doesn't NEED to be toasted like the others... Makes a "mean" french toast... My daughter (who is pretty picky) eats this bread a lot. 
 A classic work, as is usual from Stern.  Unfortunately, the Amazon entry is garbled.  Bismarck's banker's name was Bleichr[o with unlaut]der 
 You mean I don't have to pay $300 dollars for a used copy of this on auction?  Great.  That's what they've been selling for before this reissue.  It's about time.  I never thought I'd own a copy until now, without paying a small ransom.  
 The word "classic" gets thrown around a lot these days. Many so-called "modern classics" are not that important, but "Testament of Youth" deserves this reprint as a Penguin Classic. Brittain tells of her early life in the north of England between 1893 and the start of World War I in 1914 in beautifully clear prose, and her clarity of thought and powers of observation make the bulk of the book, dealing with the war's impact on her, painfully vivid without ever lapsing into self-pity. Like too many others of her generation (and the next and the next) Vera Brittain learned almost unimaginable lessons about life and her own inner strength. To that extent, "Testament of Youth" can serve as both example and inspiration.     Vera Brittain came from an upper-middle-class background shared by millions of young women in late Victorian England.  One thing that made her different was her great intellectual curiosity and determination to escape a truly suffocating existence that few of today's Western women can easily imagine. What made her like most citizens of the time (and of later times)was her complete ignorance of the meaning of "war."  Patriotism, her social conscience, and a desire to take part in the bigger world led her to volunteer as a nursing sister with the British Army.  Her grueling hospital experiences were a revelation to her. Her personal losses are even more powerfully revealing of the human condition. Brittain was a "survivor" in every sense of the word.   "Testament of Youth" is just as fresh and moving today as it was when it was written 75 years ago and Vera Brittain tells a story that must be told and retold to each generation. For every reader who finds the book "too long" by current standards (its almost 700 pages), there will be two who wish they could follow the author even further.  But even if you find yourself skipping ahead, particularly in the early part, you will not be able to forget Vera Brittain or her story. "Testament of Youth" is one of the great autobiographies of the past 100 years 
 This is another great book by Davis and Rawls. Davis and Rawls have spent many years attempting to inform the world of their discoveries. In fact, that was the purpose of their books in the first place.  The scientific community can be quite slow and stubborn when it comes to adapting new revolutionary discoveries. Egos, financial interests and a belief that if it can't be found in established textbooks than it can't be true, are some of the biggest reasons why.   Nikola Tesla, the brilliant scientist who is the founding father of modern electrical technologies, among other world altering discoveries, had a difficult time trying to convince scientists of the true potential of his inventions. As the acceptance and understanding of his work grew in the scientific community, a growing number of its' members, some previous co-workers included, layed claim to several of Teslas' original discoveries.   Many other scientists and inventors have had similar experiences, like Davis and Rawls. Just as Tesla's inventions have had a dramatic impact on the world, so too will those of Davis and Rawls. Their discoveries have already been in use for decades in several countries around the globe, but the enormous benefits of their proven and independently verified research are still largely unknown and unused.   
 Wow, I just viewed "Spun" the other night and I thought this movie was outrageous. This is sort of a guilt-pleasure movie but you want to take shower afterwards.   "Spun" has an impressive cast of recognized actors. The film is, essentially, about a few days in the lives of a group of drug addicts. There is The Cook (Mickey Rourke, he truly makes this story worth watching), who makes the drug (speed) and sells it to Spider Mike (John Leguizamo), a dealer with a junkie girlfriend, Cookie (Mena Suvari, looking infinitely less attractive than she did in "American Beauty"). One of his clients is Ross (Jason Schwartzman), who does a lot of favours for The Cook and his girlfriend, Nikki (Brittany Murphy).    I was surprised at how funny the film was at times. It doesn't drown us in anti-drug messages, nor does it become one of those, equally tedious, drug films where you feel like the sober driver at a drunken party. The humour is dark, certainly, but funny nevertheless. A lot of it comes from a subplot about Frisbee, Patrick Fugit,  who is caught by a couple of TV policemen (Peter Stormare and Alexis Arquette) and is told he will be let off if he helps them get Spider-Mike. I will only say of the resulting sequence that he does it with all the subtlety of an undercover policeman with his badge stuck to his forehead.  This is a film with a lot of energy, that seems, like its characters, not entirely sure where it is going, but determined to get there, and quickly. Although I am sure it is boring to be surrounded by people on speed when you are sober, this film almost makes you feel like you are on speed too. The director, Jonas ï¿½kerlund, has directed music videos in the past, and it shows in his impatient filming style, as he plays around with animation, speeded-up camerawork and such like.  I'm not recommending the film for its style though, although I am sure it is the best way this material could get to the screen. I am recommending it because I liked the main characters, which I think will stick in my head for much longer than the animated sex scenes or the split screens. I can imagine an entire film about The Cook and Nikki, or Spider Mike and Cookie, or even just Ross, who absentmindedly keeps leaving a girl handcuffed to his bed for hours/days. What makes "Spun" better than those hypothetical films is that it puts the characters into their own little community, and we feel as if we are watching their everyday, speeded up, sleepless lives. Simply amazing.  
 Evans crafted a book that doesn't fall into non-fiction traps. Many non-fiction works miss the mark when it comes to drawing a reader in to a book about the Cold War. They show that the OUTRIGGER program was funded at $XX millions and opposed by X liberals in Congress but it collected Y amount of information from the Stassi.  Those are trivial and boring works.  This one doesn't miss at all -- it's a bullseye.  Evan Thomas' The Very Best Men reads like a thriller. You become wrapped up in the lives of Frank Wisner, Richard Bissell, Tracy Barnes and Desmond Fitzgerald and their early work in America's CIA.  Evans' book isn't just a flag waiver. There are low points, and political failures. Notably the Bay of Pigs and the tragic life of Frank Wisner.  One note: I read Robert Littell's The Company before I read this book, and I see where his characters are drawn from. What order is up to you, but if you are a fan of CIA/spy plots, then I'd read both books together for enjoyment. 
 This was another great literary work by Hiaasen. I couldn't put it down!  I also bought RATED F, which is recommended by Amazon.com to be purchased with this book. I read both of them over the weekend! They make a great duo, I'd suggest purchasing Noker's novel with Hiaasen's most definitely. It's worth it 
 ... this film will be rediscovered and pronounced a classic! Mark my words and those of some of the other reviewers here. If ever there was a film that was ahead of its time, this is it. Fifty years from now it will stand in the company of films like "The Wizard of Oz" as an American movie classic. Breathtaking in every sense of the word and superior in every way to the current so called 'fairytale for adults' "Pan's Labyrinth." Long after that movie has faded from our collective consciousness, "A.I." will live on, possibly even eclipsing the memory of "E.T." This is one of Spielberg's best 
 I enjoyed this book. I enjoy romance books, but I cant stand to have them cheesy. I like a little romantic suspense, i don't like having everything a girl wants to read about being in one book all together and having it all predictable. If that makes any sense... But this book didn't have that as much, so I enjoyed it. I also enjoyed Dora and Jeds "words" between them. Sarcastic smart-assy remarks, I really enjoyed. They made me laugh and think how real life they could be. 
 I have just finised reading this excellent book and would urge others to peruse this earnest, thoughtful, caring and sometimes heartbreaking journal of growing up and becoming a man. The freshness and uniqueness of the author's experience offers warmth and encouragement to the rest of us. Thank you!!!

 The CD title may go a little far, but "Baby Makin' Music" is definitely move and groove music that puts you in the mood. Ron's smooth, lilting tenor takes you there. You know, this is the man who sang about "Between the Sheets" While the lyrics on B.M.M. may be a little spicey and dicey, they do have a positive bent. Nothing beats Ron's riffs for setting the right tone. He puts you in the mood to snuggle, cuddle, or whatever turns you on. You can even get your slow dance on to these melodies. Don't worry about the basically all ballad format. You don't want to break the mood, do you? As a matter of fact, put this joint on repeat. And ladies, if your man has a problem coming up with the words to warm the cockles of your little heart...get this CD for him as a gift, and don't forget to PLAY IT to your heart's content. If any babies result...you didn't get this advice from me! Check out keepers, You're My Star, Just Came Here To Chill, Pretty Woman, Beautiful, and Heaven Hooked Us Up 
 Colorful, fun way to introduce Map and Globe reading and understanding. It covers the history of maps, and uses. Advanced concepts like debth and elevatons are discussed. It looks at different uses maps have, and leaves  the student wanting to discover more on their own. A very usful tool in  teaching basic geography 
 Those who have read history about the Vietnam War are kidding themselves if they don't include "A Life in a Year--."  This is the war as seen through the eyes of the lowest common denominator--the "grunt."  Having served in the infantry in Vietnam and trusting Ebert's editing of what was individual braggadocio by some interviewees, I think this is an accurate portrayal of what Vietnam was like for thousands of soldiers and marines.  Nothing fancy, nothing cute, nothing outlandish--just like really being there day in and day out.  Straight shooting from basic to the freedom bird.  If this was required reading before Vietnam I am not so sure the volunteer rate would have been as high as it was--but then we had to live Vietnam so such a book could be written 
 I am a Teacher Assistant and work with Special Need students. The Teacher and myself use tools in this book everyday. It offers fantastic ideas and strategies for the classroom, no matter what age group. I work with 7yr old to 12 yr olds. They all benefit from the activities in this book. It is a good idea to have it with you in the classroom and to use it spontaneously when an incident may arise. It is a very user fiendly book. I highly recommend it 
 I can quibble over what I perceive as certain flaws in the book.  The male characters are generally bland, some of the key scenes are cut too short, and the waxing poetic goes on a little too long for my tastes in some parts.  But as I said, this is quibbling.  What was most significant for me was the unbelievable emotions this book stirred and it's going to take me a while to get why that is (I just finished it a couple of hours ago as I write this).  Sadness mixed with joy mixed with grief mixed with wonderment - often all together.  Alice Sebold is a touching and gifted writer who has created an unbelievably moving experience in this book.  It's magical 
 It's probably the best resource out there for preparation for the Advanced Placement Chemistry exam. It tells you what to expect, gives a study schedule, gives you practice exams with explanations, and is very up-to-date. It's not a must-have though, because there are plenty of other good resources out there. 
 Reviewed by Debra Gaynor for Reader Views (9/06)  When the narrator, a sixteen-year-old goes to Paranoid Park to skateboard, he never expects to be responsible for someone's death.  Paranoid Park "is an underground street park, which means there are no rules, nobody owns it, and you don't have to pay to skate.... It's also kind of a street-kid hangout.... It has that dangerous, sketchy vibe to it."  On that fateful evening the narrator meets a fellow skateboarder, Scratch, and the two decide to hop a train just for the fun of it.  They didn't plan to go far, just a quarter mile.  When a security guard spots the two, the ride no longer seemed like such a good idea.  The guard comes at them with "his black nightstick in his hands."  The guard was vicious and brutally swung the stick at Scratch with all his might, the frightened narrator fights for his and Scratch's life by slamming his skateboard into the back of the guard's head, the guard stumbled and fell underneath the train.  Scratch runs and the narrator struggles with what to do.  His mind is bombarded with thoughts of fear, does he call 911, his uncle, just hope nobody connects him with the body or should he go to the police and confess.    "I had a revelation then, lying in bed in the dark:  I was a bad person."  "In my mind I went through every bad thing I had ever done.  I'd lied to people, I'd stolen stuff, I beat up Howie Zimmerman in fourth grade, I threw a shopping cart in the Clackamas River my freshman year.  I kicked the side mirror off a car once when I'd crashed skateboarding.  The list was endless.  It covered every stage of my life.  I had just that weekend had sex with a girl I didn't even like."  While the narrator is suffering guilt and fear, those around him are living life as usual. His friends seem to think his parent's recent separation is why he's acting weird.  No one realizes how close to suicide this young man is walking.  "Paranoid Park" is a well-written book, the story flows smoothly, and the plot could have been taken out of the headlines.  The characters come to life and seem to jump off the pages.  These are characters that you truly care about.  You want to help the narrator in some way.  You want to shout that it was self-defense.  Blake Nelson has the unique ability to reach inside the mind of a teen and understand what they are living and thinking.  This book is a dark look into the life of a teen.  I highly recommend this book to young adults 13 and over. 
 This is one of the finest miniseries DC has done in years--it's debts to Alan Moore's and Dave Gibbons's WATCHMEN are clear, but it's also a work all of its own. Except for a few minor errors (the Black Canary is addressed as "Diana" not "Dinah"; the Sportsmaster is apparently killed at the end when we know he goes on to live for decades later), this work actually could fit perfectly with the previous work done on the JSA and the DC Universe and their continuity. The story involves several members of the Justice Society of America (the Atom, Green Lantern, Hourman), several members of Roy Thomas's All-Star Squadron (Liberty Belle, Johnny Quick) and several obscure 40s DC/National heroes (the Tarantula, Miss America, Manhunter) after the Second World War. A minor hero, Mr. America, has been credited with the deaths overseas of Adolf Hitler and several other Nazi supervillains; based on this fame, he runs successfully for Senate and starts an anti-Red Menace program involving the recruiting of superhumans, while most of the other heroes languish in misery, either forgotten by the public or involved in HUAC hearings. The ending is very dramatic and worth the slow unravelling of narrative surprises, and the art of Paul Smith has never been more beautifully employed than here. Most remarkable is James Robinson's surprising evocation of genuine patriotism: the courageous heroine Miss America, Joan Dale, makes a speech at the climax of the story that it is almost impossible not to feel moved after reading, as corny as that may sound. This is really DC at its finest 
 Taylor provides an extensive - 526 pages including bibliography and index - overview of European colonial initiatives in the Atlantic, North America and parts of the Caribbean from the early 1400s - when Portuguese and Spanish proto-colonists got their feet wet, so to speak, by colonizing the Azores, Canaries and Medeiras - through Spanish and Russian efforts on the West Coast in the early 1800s.  Substantial space is given to colonial efforts of the French, Dutch, and Spanish as well as English settlement in the eastern Caribbean and the east coast of what eventually became the United States.  A tragic theme throughout the book is the encounter between Europeans and Native Americans that decimated the latter, primarily through inadvertent introduction of diseases but also through warfare, slavery, appropriation of their land and destruction of the environment on which the Indians relied.  Taylor also describes how the Indians repeatedly collaborated with or benefited from European traders and colonists when they perceived - often erroneously - that the Europeans' actions benefited their own economic and strategic interests.  And, yes, the Indians traded in slaves - either other Indians or Africans - as well.  The role and some of the impact of enslaved Africans on Colonial development is also described throughout the book.  Regarding the English colonies that became the original thirteen United States it's helpful for Taylor to remind that most of the colonies had unique beginnings that influenced their cultures and economies and politics for many years after the American revolution.  For example, South Carolina essentially began as a colony of the fabulously wealthy colony of Barbados, and initiated use of enslaved Africans on a scale that dwarfed the Chesapeake tobacco plantations.  And Pennsylvania started relatively late but grew quickly and prosperously as the initial English Quakers were quickly outnumbered by industrious German family farmers as opposed to indentures servants or slaves.  I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Euro-American settlement, the formative history of the United States and the interaction of Europeans with Native Americans.     
 "Iron Jawed Angels" takes you back in time to the 1920s time period in a film about women getting the right to vote under President Woodrow Wilson. This women suffrage film gives the viewer a look at what actually went on with the suffragist and how hard they worked for women's rights.   I was inspired by this film and everyone I know who has seen  it agrees. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves to know about historical events and who are curious about women's political movements in history 
 William Strunk's first publication of The Elements Of Style was in use at Cornell University in 1919. It was published in the New Yorker in 1957. It has been republished in a variety of forms, including editions with E.B. White.   Why has this book survived almost a century? The answer is simple. This is the best book on composition. You need no other. There are paperback, hardback and pdf file versions. The original is available online at bartleby dot come. However you choose to acquire this book, just do it 
 This is a fascinating book that combines brilliant legal scholarship with cultural studies and social theory. Rollins has done something wonderful here. His argument about the ironies and silences within legal discourse on AIDS is provocative and convincing. I highly recommend this book 
 I have always loved the story of The Crippled Lamb by Max Lucado, even before I became a mother to a child much like "little Joshua".  How I love to read this book with my son and confirm the hope which exists for his purpose in life 
 The two "negative" reviews of this book are peculiar. This is the paperback version of a hardcover book, published with a different title -- not an uncommon practice in publishing. The complaint of the reviewers is that the contents are the same as the hardcover original! Well, yes, that's the point of a reprint.   More substantively, the author has earned a hearing through his decades-long reporting from Japan and his stubborn, well-documented contrarian outlook. For instance, he shows beyond question that during the long years of Japan's "collapse," its advanced manufacturing sector continued to grow -- in technological sophistication, and in world market share.  Judge for yourself after reading, but look past the negative reviews.  DISCLOSURE: I am a friend of the author's but am writing because I feel he deserves a hearing 
 It was a fantasy adventure and wonderful family coming together in one.  I hope that there will be more of these books from Haan 
 I was not going in bathrooms looking for dudes when I was younger. But I certainly was in the same predictment. I'm a 20 year old gay male, and I still have problems talking to my parents about it. I will say this movie is an accurate depiction of my own life. I was not exactly a geek, but I was not very popular in high school. People knew about my sexuality and pushed me around. I found my first love in one of the most hottest, handsome guy in school. And he told me that he too was gay and it went on from there.  I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was beautiful and so was the storyline. It is just what I love in a movie. I also recommend Beautiful Thing for others.. those brits really produce great coming out movies... 
 The "Back to the Future" trilogy was excellent.  The item was in perfect condition and arrived quickly.  My husband, who owns a DeLorean, was happy to get the whole story and we have enjoyed watching the old movies.  
 The friendly, oversized dinosaur from Dinosaur on Hanukkah and Dinosaur on Passover,  returns to celebrate Shabbat with a young boy and his contemporary family.  In silly, rhyming text, Dino tries to help with Shabbat preparations: setting the table, lighting the candles, pouring the wine, and blessing the challah.  He also joins the family in the synagogue on Shabbat morning and participates in Havdalah.  As in the past, his size, enthusiasm, and clumsiness create havoc, but "when Shabbat is over Dino leaves without a fuss.  But I know next Friday he'll be back to share Shabbat with us."  The illustrations complement the fun and cheery mood of the text, but are a bit inconsistent.  For example, the text refers to a white tablecloth while the illustration appears in blue, and Dino sometimes wears a baseball cap but at other times (like in synagogue) his head is bare.  A brief end note explains Shabbat, however, there would be added value if it included the lyrics and music to "The Dinosaur Song" (There's a dinosaur knocking at my door, knocking one, two, three . . . there's a dinosaur knocking at my door and he wants to spend Shabbat with me . . .) - a natural pairing for a pre-school storytime program.  For ages 3 - 5.  Reviewed by Rachel Kami

 I love finding a children's book with a true story. Kids are bombarded with fiction and silliness all day long (which is wonderful in its own right), but it's such a treat to share a true story with children. Bentley's passion for something so child-friendly as snow inspires great feeling in children and adults alike. The book's detailed woodcut illustrations are beautiful in their own right. Buy this and then go out and buy Bentley's book of Snow Crystals 
 This colorful picture book would delight any young child. Wonderful illustrations accent the sweet story of a young fish  and his adventures when mother sends him out to play 
 The Soviettes come out swinging and deliver a dazzling and dizzying combination to kick off on their third full-length CD. The ebullient and brash "Multiply and Divide" simply explodes with sheer punk goodness and just the right amount of cocksure, X-Ray Spex-style new wave. The lone male in the group, drummer Danny, belts out backups on this track (and others), funneling his snide and snotty vocals through, what sounds like an old bull-horn, a perfect complement to the potent main vocals. It is quickly followed by another brilliant burner, "Paranoia Cha Cha Cha!" Within a minute, you'll be chanting the chorus, "They say you're gonna be shut down," along with the gals while jumping out of your chair, pumping your fists and looking for a riot to join. The Minneapolis quartet throws in some tasty and tantalizing curves like the pensive "Gotta Decide" and the raucous girl-vs-boy exchange "How Do You Like That?" And look out Macarena and Lambada, "(Do) The Stagger" should be the next big dance craze. 
 I'm not sure what book some other reviewers read who posted less than favorable comments, but this book was easily one of the top 5 books I've ever read.  Given that I have multiple large containers of books, you will understand that I've read quite a lot.  With this book, I never wanted to set it down, but I started reading on a business trip and unfortunately work kept interfering with my reading!  I did; however, recommend it to some of the people I was working with while only part way through the book. I was ready to read it again as soon as I finished!  The characters De Lint develops are extremely engaging as is the storyline he pursues.  As someone who is interested in Native American folklore, as well as mythology and folklore in general, the ideas presented in this book were very intriguing.  I found this book genuine enough, and realistic enough, that I was ready to start looking for animal people around me. The story may have shifted to different viewpoints throughout, but I had no trouble keeping up and had no confusion as to view or place while reading.  My only disappointment is that I do not believe that there are any additional books with these characters as I would love to read more about their lives and their adventures. As it is, I went out and bought 4 or 5 more De Lint books to read. Enjoy 
 This particular translation of the Analects is wonderful.  The author begins the book by introducing some terms that are difficult to translate or have multiple implications.  In the text itself, these words are frequently left untranslated so that the reader can fully appreciate the diversity of the meaning.  The english text is presented side by side with the classical chinese text, allowing the linguistically inclined one to compare the two.  A great book alltogether 
 Im so excited there making a 10th Anniversary edition, but why for psp?? it doesn't ever have bonus features! I would not be able to watch 'THAT' movie on the psp. I think its a mistake to be putting it on the PSP, they should just stick to the DVD on this one 
 I have a simple test for any book that purports to be funny: Will it make me laugh out loud?  Something that simply causes the corners of my mouth to turn up in a smile won't do the job.  This collection of humorous essays,  however--- brightly contemporary,impressively varied, occasionally  political--- met the test handsomely.  This is an anthology, and not every  piece succeeds; Christopher Buckley's brittle faux-sophistication, for  example, left this reader with a hollow feeling; he's too determined to  impress; he seems to try too hard.  For the most part, however, the pieces  in this collection are dependably funny.  Ian Frazier's collection of rules  for children--- expressed in the high rhetoric of the King James Bible---  not only made me laugh out loud; I woke up my wife and read the piece aloud  to her, with tears of mirth running down my cheeks; she laughed out loud,  too.  This collection is not only well worth the price; it will cheer you  up for days, and bring you back to read the short pieces again and again 
 I am very satisfied with my purchase, now I just have to find the time to use the product on a regular basis 
 Excellent resource for learning how to draw trees, vegetation and other elements for architectural presentation drawings.  Many of the drawings can be photocopied and pasted on your own drawings and the author encourages you to do so if you are sketch-ability-deficient.  Very good value 
 I found this film very entertaining! I loved the subtle pokes at suburbia and all the headaches that comes with it. Adults will enjoy the story as well as younsters. It's always fun to hear some of your favorite actors' voices in animated character form. But besides the fun, I feel this film had some good underlying lessons too. When we 'overindulge', we often cause ourselves trouble. One overindulgent racoon gets himself, and his friends, into a pickle by being greedy and self-serving.

  Like "lighten up already 2" said in the review of this DVD, I want historical accruacy. I wrote my opinions of the colorized versions of vintage B&W shows in a review of Bewitched the Complete Second Season, which is available in a colorized version. To summarize that review, would an antique dealer ruin a valuable, antique, mahogany, piece of furniture by painting it a bright red ?   
 Ever since I got this book, I have enjoyed its healthy and tasty recipes. What comes across powerfully is the spiritual undercurrent. The author has produced a monumental work moved by spirituality. If you have to own just one book on South Asian cookery, own this one 
 opeth always has good stuff to offer. their music shifts from being brutal, with death grunts and all a la "when" (my arms, your hearse), to nice quiet acoustic pieces like "patterns in the ivy part 2" (blackwater park). no matter which album or song opeth throws out, it's always a gem, shifting your emotions from tense and on edge, to relaxed and dreamy. but this time, in spite of all the diamonds opeth has been releasing, i wholeheartedly confess that "damnation" is a ruby.   generally, opeth is known for a variety of things, such as songs that span for well over 10 minutes, mikael akerfeldt's proficiency in both clean vocals and death grunts, martin lopez's drumming, etc. i know them best for making absolutely stunning songs, particularly the quieter, slower ones where the guitars aren't overdriven, where akerfeldt's vocals are clean and conjure up a sense of longing, and such. simply put, opeth made this album beautiful.  when listening to "in my time of need," you can imagine yourself treading slowly through a big city on a traffic-less night, a light rain falling as you contemplate over the meaning of life after a broken relationship. "closure" brings about images of folk music in a forest, in a moor, or in a traditional european/celtic setting. "weakness" makes you feel as if you're in an empty cathedral, ready to make a confession, with per wilberg's haunting, flow-and-eb keyboard/mellotron/organ background.   when all's said and done, "damnation" is definitely one of the best slower, quieter albums out there. despite the fact that it's totally underrated, like i said before, it's that one ruby in a world full of coal. 
 This, to me, is Altan's finest CD. The vocals are excellent, as always.  The song arrangement makes it flow very well. Island Girl is a highlight,  along with Green Grow the Rushes. But I especially like Mairead's beautiful  singing on Eoghainin O' Ragadain. What a wonderful voice! If you like  Altan, you will definitely love this CD 
 One of Alan Moore's most celebrated comic masterpieces, the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a treat for comic fans and literary buffs alike.  In 1898, the mysterious M recruits adventurer Allan Quartermain, Miss Mina Murray, Captain Nemo, Invisible Man Hawley Griffin, and cowardly Dr. Henry Jekyll, and of course, his devilish alter ego, the Hulk-ish Mr. Hyde.  Moore's love of classic, English literature is so apparent throughout this first volume, with his deep and rich characterizations and twisting storyline.  Kevin O'Neil's artwork is masterful as well, and his vivid drawings bring Moore's lush world to life that hasn't done his work justice since David Lloyd and Dave Gibbons.  If there's any real nitpicking that can be done with this book, it's that Mr. Hyde isn't so much brutish as he is much like an insane Hulk, which is nice for a change of pace for the character, but seems like a bit of a predictable idea for Moore.  That aside, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is a masterwork of comic and literary fiction, and believe it or not, it only gets better from this point on

 This is the BEST eating plan ever. A friend and I went on it together, and by the end of five days, we were both hooked. It's not just a diet, it's a way to live your entire life. It provides fantastic information, although the organization is a bit confusing. Not only does it teach you HOW to eat for life, but how to shop for food, how to stay on the plan and eat in restaurants, on vacation, at special events, etc. You will be amazed at how quickly and steadily you lose weight and feel so much better. Stabilizing your blood sugar helps to improve your mood, so aside from looking & feeling great due to the weight loss, you really FEEL HEALTHY, have lots of energy, etc. I have suggested this book to several friends and family members. Everyone who has done it has had immediate success with it. I will continue to recommend it to everyone I know who is ready to change his or her life for the better!

 `nobu now' is Nobuyuki Matsuhisa's second cookbook which seems to have all the same virtues of the first, and most of the annoyances of the first as well.  For starters, the book is even more the coffee table ornament than the first, `Nobu: The Cookbook'. The first symptom is the higher than average price for a celebrity chef's cookbook. It lists for $45, almost as much as Thomas Keller's much larger (and much more interesting) `Bouchon'. For this price, it has but 110 recipes and lots of full-page color photographs. I thought it was telling that when Nobu appeared on `The Today Show', the interviewer spent most of their comments salivating over the high photographic quality and saying little about the recipes.  There is no question that the quality of the photography is first rate. Unfortunately, so much space was lavished on the pics, that the book designers made no effort to place the recipes and photos on facing pages in many cases. They even went to the trouble of showing in the table of contents where recipe and pic were not on the same page.  The book is also filled with recipes using lots of hard-to-find ingredients. In comparing high end fish restaurant cookbooks, I find Bob Kinkead's book and Eric Ripert's book on `Le Bernardin' to be much better sources of seafood recipes for the rest of us, even though both have reputations as good or better than nobu for seafood cooking.  I am relieved to find no great litany of celebrity endorsements on this book. I guess Nobu called in all his favors on the first book.  There is no question that this book is really interesting to the professional seafood specialist and even the amateur who likes to create seafood recipes and who has access to a wide variety of fresh seafood ingredients. But, to the average cook who likes seafood, get one of the books mentioned above or even better, Mark Bittman's book, `Fish' or James Peterson's book `Fish and Shellfish'.  I will put in one plug for the last chapter, which is a collection of simple recipes for sauces, salsas, and dressings. For the die-hard foodie, this chapter may be worth the price of the book. 
 Mark Plotkin in his new book, Medicine Quest, has provided us with convincing and compelling evidence that pharmacognosy, the study of nature-based medicines, can yield many solutions to our collective human  ills.        This is a book that should be required reading for all high  school and college biology students. As a result, many may be inspired to  pursue creative research into the biochemistry of natural products. Such  study will foster a more refined view of the importance of ecological  balance, and the essential nature of biodiversity. Every creature, no  matter how lowly, may provide insight into our own physiology and potential  cures for human pathology 
   I bought this c.d. after hearing it on NPR.  I really enjoy the music, which is soulful and exotic.  A very good c.d. to have some nice dreams to.  A few music videos accompany the c.d. and there are lyrics inside for those of us who can't speak the languages.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes world music or is looking to try out world music.  Track 4 is definitely a highlight.  Idan is supremely talented at mixing these different artists together and making a seamless, beautiful blend.  
 A bright, energetic album, Embrace's best since The Good Will Out.  No slow, plodding songs, rather a collection of lively, epic songs like "Target" and "Nature's Law."  Look for the special edition version with "World at Your Feet" as a bonus track, and for crying out loud, TELL PEOPLE ABOUT EMBRACE.  This music is simply too brillant to be ignored in the U.S. and to be denied a stateside release 
 With this one book Sue Miller has become my favorite author.  She has in this book "The World Below" created one of those rare books that makes you sad it's over.  You know you will miss the character, for a loss for the place.  In the beginning of the book Ms Miller's main character talks about how here Grandmother Georgia could tell a good story, and what a gift that is.  That is so true of this book.  There are several stories lines going on in this book, wrapped around many lives, and happening in different times.  Quite often a book like this can become confusing, but not here.  Here it is seamless.  Within a few pages you find out about George as a young woman falling in love while in a TB sanitarium, over laid with Granddaughter Cath's second failed marriage.  All stories inter-connected, and yet never confused.  Ms Miller created character so real and so a live, that you can't help but feel sadness at a death or your heart race to find that Cath's daughter baby was born prematurely.  True test for me, is if the character seem to come to life, and her's do.  She even nails the small town real estate agent, pushy and yet neighborly enough to bring you soup when she hear your sick.  The true test for me came when Cath moved to her Grandmother's old house in Vermont.  Would Ms Miller understand Vermont, or would she make it that hokey Hollywood place.  The Vermont you will find in "The World Below" is real.  When she tells you about the long ride from Barstow to Rutland, because that's where you have to go to shop, that's life here.  There is a reference about Cath seeing the state in broad circle while she is covering the local high school football team's season, that is the way sports are in Vermont.  The title of the book come from a fishing trip Cath took with her Grandfather when she was teen, I knew where the Lake was, knew what just by the description, and was glad to find that I was right, several chapters later.  Don't miss out on this book; it is a really good read. 
 As soon as I found out I was pregnant with a boy, I checked this book out of our local library.  I found it so easy to read and such a great resource that I had to buy a copy for my own.  It offers clear insight to the various stages of a boy's life into manhood.  The metaphors for the various types of discipline can get to be a little much but the point is well made.  Although I grew up with a younger brother, this book has already given me so much more sensitivity to the needs of a young boy that I look forward to raising my 11-week old son into manhood.  I've quoted it incessantly to friends and can't help but shake my head at the parents of unruly teenage boys on talk shows, thinking they should have read the book again and again while their sons were growing up.  An invaluable resource for any woman faced with the daunting task of raising a child to be a man, especially if she has never been able to understand men 
 Do not drive when listening to this very "DANGEROUS! your focus will be on the energetic beat that some of the tracks have and the others kinda bossa novaish, so your feet will want to bossa instead of breakish! I really have enjoyed this 
 More concise and hardcore in the critique of capital than later works. Should be in every Marxist/non-Marxist library 
 I use this to connect a PS2 to the Internet and it seems to be working, although it took a bit of setup.  If you're really good with setting up networks you can probably set it up quite fast.  It took me about an hour because the instructions that come with it really aren't adequate.  There are a couple things to look out for when setting it up.  First of all, if your wireless network doesn't use the default SSID and stuff, you have to log in to the device's firmware to change some settings (and you should anyway if you want to configure security settings).  So you have to enable your network card on your computer and connect the G820 to it, and then make sure your computer is set to a static IP in the same range as the G820's default IP of 192.168.0.35 (in other words, 192.168.0.xyz).  Then you can log in to the G820 with the default username "admin" and no password.  At that point the setup wizard pretty much walks you through the settings.  One important thing to note is that if you have MAC address filtering on your wireless network, you must add your console's MAC address to your router's whitelist.  As soon as I did that the WLAN indicator on the G820 lit right up.  You do not need to add the MAC address of the actual G820.  By the way, to get your PS2's MAC address, put the Network Adapter Startup disc in and get to the point where you test your connection but do something like disconnect the ethernet cable to make the test fail.  When the notice comes up that the test failed, press Select and it will display the MAC address 
 This book has a wealth of information, for those interested in building dories.  Clear and consise explanations, as well as a great how to build chapter, were excellent.  I have begun building a swampscott dory, and  would be lost without this book.  Anyone interested in building wooden  dories would be wise to have this book in their collection 
 Our own "Wiccan Warrior" presents us with a book on working with energy and the elements in his own style of everyday language and well thought out examples.  The book is broken down into sections dealing with the elements and spirit.  Starting with spirit, the book explores each of these elements in relation to the warrior aspect and interaction with the Wiccan path.  The Wiccan Rede, the Witch's Pyramid, three-fold law and all the aspects of each are carefully explained, discussed and taken in context of being a warrior.  Reading and living the precepts as laid out in this book will place you on the path of the warrior and enable you to work with the energies associated with this aspect of Wicca.  I found Kerr Cuhulain's Warrior Precepts to be a wonderful basis for this book.  Adapted from various writers, philosophers and common sense, these are what constitute the ground work for being a warrior.  These are excellent words to live by.  Add to it Kerr Cuhulain's special ability to explain them all with practical examples and you have a great beginners book that will also speak to those who have been on this path for a while.  Kerr Cuhulain discusses tools, ritual, rites, the elements, working with energy, self discipline, martial arts, the seasons and so much more.  There is a glossary of terms in the back of the book as well as an interesting bibliography and an index.   For those who are considering the path of the warrior, for those who are struggling along their chosen path already or those curious as to how Wicca and the warriors path can be melded into a singular path, or those who are just curious about energy workings, this book can explain much of what you are looking to explore.  This is a great beginner's book as well as a book that those who have been on their path for a while may want to read 
 This is an excellent book for any one from a novice investor though a persistent day-trader. It is very informative on current and future use of the internet and its uses to making security trading easy for everyone. Great read 
 Many years after it's initial printing, Seven Minutes is still possibly the best book about Lawyers in action ever written. Taking a stand in the face of incredible odds, the main character risks his personal and  professional life to defend a book that has stirred up controversy due to  it's rather titilating subject matter. It's a wonderful story, not only  life affirming but exhilerating in it's twists and turns 
 I read some of the reviews here... and there was a comment in one of them that says: "it's NOT QUITE a sequel to Alice In Wonderland because although Alice is older, she doesn't recall her past experience in wonderland."  Well...  isn't that to be expected?  How many dreams to you remember for the long term?  None?  Alice DID change by the end of the first book -- but she may have forgotten exactly WHY she changed... because dreams just don't stay with people very well.  Also keep in mind that the author was a wierd drugged up stoner.  So -- yeah... on all accounts -- I think this can be expected.   It's a good read. 
 Eighteen-year-old Miranda Lockheart was never what you would call a wild child. She lived in the same small town all of her life - Barton, Texas - and never ventured out to the city. She had grown up with her friends, and had been with her boyfriend, Denny Callahan, since freshman year. But after graduation, everything changed. Miranda received a scholarship to Lone Star State College in Austin, Texas, and jumped at the chance to get a taste of the city. Oddly enough, it suits her perfectly. Suddenly, Miranda is sharing an apartment with two outrageous girls - one, a punk; the other, a "loose" girl - and taking up the drums. Miranda has no previous experience with the drums, but she picks them up instantly, and suddenly finds herself dragged up into a whirlwind rollercoaster ride, complete with hot guys, gigs, and band practice. The only downfall is that the one guy she's crushing on doesn't seem to know that she exists.  I'm a HUGE fan of Nancy Krulik, and, due to the fact that I've just started playing the guitar, I'm super interested in reading different teen fiction about female musicians, so SHE'S GOT THE BEAT caught my eye, and captured my heart in no time. Miranda is a fabulous character, whose sweet personality, and rocker chick persona are fun to read about. Her adventures - or, rather, misadventures - in the dating world, and guy encounters are hilarious, and add a fun, relatable aspect for readers. Overall, this was a fabulous addition to the SIMON PULSE ROMANTIC COMEDY series.  Erika Sorocco Book Review Columnist for The Community Bugle Newspape 
 As a correspondant for Newsweek, Hackworth has the savy to keep the reader interested, even at times when he is mundane.  A great first person take on military events of the past three decades.  Hackworth definitely captures the mediocraty involved with politicos in "greatest military on the face of the earth". Hackworth can be compared to Richard Marcinko, who yearns for the truth be told with today's military.  A definite read for both military and non-military folk 
 Yo he leido varias revistas o magazines como tambien les llaman tales como,Seventeen, Cosmopolitan, Vogue, Self, Glamour, Mademoiselle, Teen, Lucky, Teen Vogue, Marie Claire, por mencionar algunas,tanto las versiones en ingles como en espaol y definitivamente me quedo con Elle.Es superior a las demas, primera tiene excelente fotografia  y muy buenas impresiones, su moda es cosmopolita y global, ademas de que presenta diseadores nuevos que aun todavia no son conocidos pero gracias a esta revista sus carreras son impulsadas rapidamente a la fama, sus propuestas y reviews sobre cine, musica, libros y teatro tambien son muy buenos,tiene cultura pop pero no es del tipo teenybopper como en otras revistas que se obsesionan con ciertas actrices o cantantes y de ahi no salen. Sus paginas de moda son preciosas aunque es cierto que muchas de las modelos que salen posando en estas paginas se ve que son anorexicas o le entran a las drogas, tampoco me gusta el precio de muchas de estas ropas y accesorios ya que por lo general van de 2000 a 1 millon de dolares, por favor pongan algo mas accesible y economico.Tambien tiene articulos de interes para todos, ya sea de salud,relaciones,sexo,belleza,politica,cultura o decoracion, estos son variados algunos son muy buenos, otros aburridos, otros son superficiales o estupidos, y otros son solo trivialidades. Pero en definitiva esta revista es muy buena, pero eso si es muy elitista, esta hecha para mujeres con estilo propio, que tienen educacion de colegio o universidad, que se visten para ellas mismas no para los demas, a diferencia de Cosmo, Glamour, y Marie Claire que claman ser feministas y en lugar de eso son antifeministas o pseudo feministas, Elle si les da un buen lugar a sus lectoras, en lugar de llenarles el cerebro con puro sexo y tarugadas de como contentar a tu hombre, amigo o lo que sea, y convertirte en una Barbie para el como dicen estas revistas que acabo de mencionar 
 Seth Mnookin has written a sensational book regarding the downfall of two employees of the New York Times in 2003 and the sullied reputation for which the Times has fought hard to atone. The story revolves around an aspiring reporter, Jayson Blair, who finally got caught plagiarizing many columns while inventing others, and Howell Raines, the Darth Vader of the journalism world. If there ever was a boss one wouldn't want to have, Mnookin shows us that Raines was that man.  The larger element is the world of the Times, the most important and influential newspaper in the world. Mnookin has a way with narrative and for those of us who have grown up with the Times he reveals the underside of a finished product. Like the old saying, "the two things no one wants to see made are laws and sausages", the author spins a chilling tale of how the incidents with Blair and the heavy-handedness of Raines brought the Times to its knees. When you read the Times on a daily basis it's sometimes hard to believe what goes on behind their closed doors. Mnookin takes us inside that world and reveals a site of petty politics, bruised egos, ambitious reporters and a workplace that often borders on the chaotic. There are good and bad people in this book.   I highly recommend "Hard News". It's so good that once you get into it, you'll find it hard to put down 
 I liked this as much as "To Kill a Mockingbird" (the baseline of "books anyone would like"). WHY? Though EXTREMELY different in EVERY aspect, it has the same *plain* intrinsic honesty.   Reads well too. Sent a copy to my Mom & she stayed up all night reading it.  Normally, I'm a Jane-ite and fond of other 19th century English writers as well as a fan of "good" mysteries (latter being very enjoyable mental gum chewing) but this book - on its lonesome - got me VERY enthused about Indian literature.  Extremely well written. And I've read a bunch o' other Indian novels since & I'm wondering why Indian authors are sooo much better than current US writers.  
 I am Eric Haney's wife. I put my name and bias on the table.  If only that were the case with those retired Delta men.   For the record, it should be noted that the only legitimate dispute those men have with the book (all others being verifiable with research) is whether or not Logan Fitch was punched in the nose at Desert One. Fitch says not; that he would have killed any civilian who did that -- despite orders from President Carter not to harm civilians.   In Mark Bowden's book, "Guests of the Ayatollah," Fitch explains the bloody nose he was sporting that night like this: He was attempting to make an Iranian civilian outside the bus stand up. The man refused, so Fitch fired a shot into the ground. When the man stood up and made a move as if to run, Fitch swung his weapon at the man to clobber him with its butt and in the process, raked his own nose with his own gun sight.   Oh. Well.   Haney wrote that the nose punch happened, in the context of a highly complimentary sentence about Fitch's  "leading from the front" (rare for a Delta officer). I've heard that story from other Desert One veterans. Be that as it may, Fitch remembers it differently. But Fitch doesn't dispute Haney's crediting him for saving his life that night by pulling him on board the last C-130 leaving the ground. The other commanders -- including Bucky Burruss -- left on the first plane out, before they knew for sure who was alive or dead from B. Squadron.  There are a number of good books, both academic and personal, on the subject of Desert One. Beckwith's Delta Force; Kyle's The Guts to Try; Bill Daugherty's (CIA hostage in Iran); and now Mark Bowden's.   Neither Beckwith, Kyle, nor Fitch were called traitor for writing their books and articles on Desert One. Fitch's article in Penthouse was merciless on Col. Beckwith. Warranted or not, it had to be heartbreaking for the Colonel at the time.   Nor was Bucky Burruss called a traitor for his chock-full-of-opsec fiction published in 1990, "Mission for Delta." Any person wanting to know how Delta sets up satellite commo or infiltrates a nation or conducts covert snatch ops need only read that book. Interestingly, the main plot of Burruss' book centers around the very mission he has accused Haney of fabricating and denied  ever took place: A 1983 CIA sanctioned covert op into Honduras to take out an American Green Beret turned defector. In Burruss' book, the defector/guerilla leader trained at Bragg and was a former friend of the tall, blond, Delta team leader who volunteers for the mission to take him out. Even some of the key names are the same.   Back to Desert One.   Each book on the subject agrees, even Beckwith's, that there was heated discussion about the possibility that the helo pilots didn't have the fortitude to go forward. Beckwith admitted in his book "maybe" having called them cowards that night (p. 313). He also used the term towards B Squadron, for not bringing their weapons out of the inferno. To his credit, Beckwith admitted in his book that he was wrong on all counts, helo and B Squadron, and apologized. For a man like Beckwith, that was an enormous thing. Others should be so gracious.  One smart thing that came out of that tragedy was the realization that Delta needed its own specially trained, specially equipped helo team. The helos DID fail because of the sandstorms and had Beckwith insisted on taking the mission forward, he would have killed the men he had worked so hard to find. Some commanders might have done that anyway. Not Beckwith. God bless him for that. My husband would never have come home.   Another result was the understanding that had B Squadron burned to death, the institutional knowledge they had created would have died with them. So Delta began codifying what they created and learned. Eric Haney was among the original operators who helped create that body of knowledge. It was not handed down to Delta from previous generations in the Army, as is so much else in the military. It was, for the most part, a completely new world explored and developed by those men.   Delta was founded only by Charlie Beckwith and midwifed by the small group of men around him, including Bucky Burruss. Burruss authored a paper justifying to DOD why it would take at least two years to select enough men to bring Delta to operational strength.   One reason it took that long was the kibosh put on recruting from the Rangers by  commanders protecting their best men. Beckwith had to fight tooth and nail up the chain of command to get access to the Rangers. (This is from Beckwith's book.) And even after he got formal cooperation,  commanders such as Joe Stringham, by then with the Rangers, issued the unofficial dictum that if his soldiers tried out and failed, they would not be welcome back. For many potential candidates, that was a showstopper. Haney took the chance and succeeded. That's Stringham's mad-on with Haney right there. Had Stringham not interceded, Haney and others could have entered Delta selection in April of 78 instead of in September of 78.   Interesting history. When you put Beckwith's book next to Haney's, a more vivid picture of Delta Force comes together. With Beckwith, you get the 100,000 foot perspective of the political infighting in the Army and just how bitterly some factions in the Army truly wanted Delta to fail. You see just how hard Beckwith really had to work to pull the whole thing off and how many people stood against it.   And  then with Haney's, you get a personal view of one man's journey through selection and training and the development of strategy and tactics and his love for his comrades. You also see why Haney said that "no other man in the Army" could have done what Charlie Beckwith did in founding Delta Force.  What you do not get from Haney's book is any sense of sniping, jealousy,  bitterness, or chest beating. IDF is very much a tribute to comradeship.  We have seen the other side of that story, sadly, from others in Delta.    When writing a personal memoir, one does not have to read the history of others. Desert One is both literally and figuratively burned into Eric Haney's memory. He still carries the scars of that night in the desert on his body. Burns that could have killed him as that inferno did kill other brave men. Haney's book is the first book or article to mention the names of the men who died that night. Beckwith's book didn't. And although Fitch's article was titled, "Death at Desert One," his article didn't mention the names of the dead, either.   When Beckwith wrote his book, he had access to Delta's files. I suppose because his book was more historical in nature. Eric's is personal and that is what makes it such a refreshing perspective. It isn't about HIM, though.   Eric loved some of his comrades and respected all of them. Even the ones who have given him a hard time. Living and dying together in Delta Force creates a bond that spans time, no matter what. That's what we see in his book. That's what the book is truly about.  Thanks again to Logan Fitch. Not for the nose punch debate. For saving Eric's life. 
  They started out by taking the abridged audio cassette (that I also have) and spliced in with a new voices the missed sections to make it unabridged. What ever is cheap and easy. 
 I saw this movie in the theatre and was a bit disappointed in the way it was accelerated at the end. There should be a Star Wars 3.5 
 This book was recommended as a Father's Day gift in a magazine and being that my Dad LOVES golf, I thought it was a sure thing.  It ended up being way more than that.  The book is beautiful!  Don't tell anyone but it is way underpriced.  It looks like a $50 coffee table book.  My mom thought I had paid $80 to $100 for it.  My Dad loves it so much that he displayed it on top of tv in the living room. He was giddy to find many courses in the book that he had played.  The only downside I could see was that my Dad may find numerous golf courses around the world that he now feels he has to go and play 
 If you are looking for some great secret to a better attitude you are NOT going to find it in this book.  What you are going to find is a very well laid out plan to do what you need to do (and you already Know you need to do) to make your life better.  That starts with improving your attitude.    I think most of these types of books say the same thing just in different ways.  Jeff Keller does it without coming accross as pompous or or promotional.  I don't know if this will be the book that turns on the light bulb for you, but it certainly has helped me 
 A previous reviewer stated there is no zipper so you cannot take the cover off. The statement is INCORRECT.   We have EIGHT dogs and 4 various dog beds around the house and this one is very high quality and a great bargain. The reason the previous reviewer could not find the zipper is because this bed is so well made you have to carefully LOOK for the zipper latch. It matched the color of the bed perfectly.   I fully expect this bed to last for many years. The cover is gorgeous and will readily clean. AND the "hidden" zipper keeps the dogs from chewing on it. Well done as usual Amazon. 
 This is the most comfortable shoe I've ever bought. As soon as the shoes arrived, I put them on and went and stood on my patio and it felt like I was standing bare foot on my carpet! Eventhough it looks like a work shoe, the leather is very flexable so it breaks in a lot eaiser then any other shoe or boot I've ever bought.The shoe is also not as tight as other shoes I buy. It is roomy enough the first time that even with a heavy shoe my feet don't sweat as much because they can breathe. Overall I love the shoe and it feels great. I think Dr. Marten has a life long customer 
 I loved this book.  Very well written with actual site plans which helped you understand how the circumstances got so out of control.  I gave this to my mother to read when I was done and she finished it in 2 days.  She was a teenager when this happened and thought it was an excellent depiction also 
 El texto es muy claro, con una gran profusión de gráficos y ejemplos. Lástima que no lo haya en castellan 
 A good size that fits easily in my bag, so that I can whip it out on the tube and scribble the journey away 
 I was a fan of 98 degrees. But with this cd - I am truly a fan of Nick Lachey. You can hear all the emotions he seems to be going through with the making of the cd.  Excellent songs to reflect what is going with him.    I don't believe there is one song on this album that I do not care for. That is rare. Excellent work! 
 You don't have to agree with Dalton Trumbo's pascifism to enjoy Johnny Got His Gun. (I am in the military myself.) Anyone who enjoys deep thinking or perhaps wants to examine their own views about war ought to make reading this book a top priority.  The book tells the story of Joe Bentham, a WWI soldier who is left as a conscious human vegetable after a shell landed nearby. The book is told in third person but from his perpective as he thinks over his life from his own world that is not quite death and not quite life.   This book could have done what many other anti-war books have done and simply described the brutality of war. While there are certainly gorey details in this book, it does not rely on violence as much as you might think. It is much more psychological in nature.   Even the most avid war hawk will come away with a shaken faith in mottoes like "death before dishonor" and "these colors don't run. 
 "The Passion Of The Christ: Songs" is excellent! All of the songs are excellent and brilliant in their own ways. "I See Love" by Third Day / Steven Curtis Chapman / MercyMe is powerfully brilliant. "Relearn Love" by Scott Stapp is stunningly brilliant. "Truly Amazing" by P.O.D. is superb and excellent. "New Again" by Brad Paisley & Sara Evans is powerfully stunning and brilliantly enchanting. "Rainy Day" by Big Dismal is powerfully excellent and superb. "The Passion" by Lauryn Hill is brilliant and stunning. "How Many Lashes" by Kirk Franklin feat. Yolanda Adams is superb. "The Empire" by MxPx feat. Mark Hoppus is brilliantly excellent and powerful. "Finding My Own Way" by Charlotte Church is heartwarming and brilliant. "Miracle Of Love" by Bebe Winans & Angie Stone is thoughtfully brilliant and superb. "To Give Love" by Dan Lavery is brilliantly powerful and stunning. "Reason I Live" by Big Dismal is powerfully superb and excellent. This is an brilliant addition to add to your collection of "The Passion Of The Christ" memorabilia 
 Three things that make 'Influence' more useful than 95% of marketing books: - It is based upon observation and experiment, not just the author's opinions. - Cialdini uses examples from marketing, advertising, cartoons, and the real world to illustrate his points. - The book is not a new business pitch from an ad agency or a front for a consulting group. Cialdini is not out to sell you anything (other than this book). He just wants to share these fascinating things he's learned.  Each chapter covers one specific 'Weapon of Influence'. It's easy to read in bite-size chunks, and Cialdini's insights are broadly applicable in marketing whatever you've got. 'Influence' is perhaps the most useful book on advertising and marketing I've come across since Luke Sullivan's 'Hey Whipple!' 
 I have been hunting for an inexpensive guidebook to use with my methods and materials in special education class.  I have students teaching everything from pre-k through 22 year olds covering every topic from life skills, to traditional academics, to art.  This means that a traditional textbook doesn't do me much good.  However the others I looked at were too general to help.  Then I found Accessing.  Just reading made me exclaim in agreement.  I like the format, the content and language used.  So far my students have given it a thumbs up too- both for price, size and content 
 In Seal of Approval (The History of the Comics Code), Amy Kiste Nyberg takes the reader through a narrowly focused but essential part of the history of comic books and, therefore, part of the greater history of popular culture in general.  Much of the basic story will be familiar from other histories of comic books but this author provides new insights into the foundation for the movement to censor comic books as well as providing a run down of the evolution of the comics code after the mid-fifites Senate hearings, an evolution very rarely discussed.  The author also makes valuable use of sources little used by other authors such as the minutes of the Comics Magazine Association of America.  All in all, a nice piece of research and a valuable contribution to the history of pop culture 
 Power of Failing is a 5 and this is a 4.9...Mineral is so great I cannot believe it. I've never called an album beautiful before but this and power of failing are that. Buy it if you want something to change your life 
 I bought this edition as a teaching supplement, not realizing that it is the folio version of the play.  The words "quarto" and "folio" refer to the size of the pages in the two editions. Many secondary schools and universities use the quarto edition and a lot is left out of the folio--this version cuts out three hundred lines and adds one hundred new ones.  The effect is that it alters the way the characters are shown.  If you are reading the play with a class and they have a quarto version, while you are using your trusty teacher's Cambridge, chances are there will be a lot of blank expressions and confusion on their faces.  The lines they see will not jibe with yours.  The extra articles and class activities are great though--just make sure that if you use the Cambridge, you have your students buy only folio editions 
 The Dance of Fear is the book formerly known as Fear and Other Uninvited Guests. The name change most likely came as the result of author Harriet Lerner's other Dance book titles - Dance of Anger, Dance of Intimacy, Dance of Deception and so on.   Lerner uses her experiences, patients' experiences, and other people's experiences - a valuable way to teach what fear is as it has many meanings and situations that bring it on. She doesn't throw, "Do this..." out there or make claims you'll get past your fear in one day. Instead, she shares the stories of several patients who had to deal with a challenge over a period of time.  Lerner covers rejection, anxiety, change, the workplace, looks, and when things fall apart. When it comes to addressing fear, only one thing is guaranteed - one solution does not fit all. What helped Anne Morrow Lindbergh cope with the loss of her infant son won't necessarily work for someone else.  The message is that we all face fear in spite of our education, knowledge, courage, or any other characteristic that supposedly makes a person fearless. When we accept fear as a natural occurrence in our lives, we learn to deal with it better than if we didn't accept that.  Some who see a book classified as psychology or self-help run away. It's understandable as such books can be too sugary sweet, too philosophical, full of annoying affirmations, or full of exercises. This one has none of these characteristics. Heck, it makes you laugh. It doesn't even mention OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) and it has a drop of panic attacks, but not from someone who is dealing with panic / anxiety disorder. It's about the fear all humans experience, not just those with an illness.  As a result of this book, I walk away with a better understanding of fear and its cousins, shame and anxiety. I'm not cured of anything. Instead I have gained insight into this strong emotion and should have a better handle on it the next time I dance with it.  The Dance of Fear has none of the big words that Lerner learned in medical school. Instead of quoting complex theories, she uses meaningful quotes you may have come across. The outcome is a book that reads like a friend wrote it and who happens to be knowledgeable on this topic. 
 It's a classic. We buy every season as it comes out, and seeing it in order in its entirety for the first time only makes it better.  The extras on this dvd are pretty sparse, but then again, I didn't buy it for the extras.  While it's best to start with Season 1, anyone could jump in in the middle and still enjoy it. 
 It is Lucy!  What can you say?  The best in the world 
 Hank Aaron tells it like it is...this is an amazing story.  He is, hands-down, the best NATURAL home run hitter ever.  His story is captivating, but also a bit sad.  The persecution he underwent while chasing the record was horrific.  He at times sounds hurt, angry, and bitter as he tells his story.  I don't blame him...what courage 
 This is one of the chessbooks that can inspire you to play differently. I already had that experience once with Watson's book on the Chigorin Defence which indeed taught me that "offbeat" does not have to be bad.  In this new book Watson reduces his philosophical considerations somehow, which does the reading very good. Still, he does not let us get away without the insight that Adolf Albin who lived from 1847 - 1920 (!) "was not a modern player" (by the way, the Albin Counter Gambit is a positional pawn sacrifice in the modern spirit, which unfortunately  happens to be weak). But that is bearable.  The examples are excellently chosen and there are real "eye-openers" among them. (I was particularly struck by one strategy - an early black attack with g5! against a castled white kingside which has been weakened by h3: Haven't I seen this before? Indeed, in my edition of Tarrasch's "Das Schachspiel", the old German teacher recommended for Black not to castle and instead to attack with g5 in case White castles and plays h3 prematurely in the Giuco Piano! This info just for you folks who think that they could not play chess in the old times.)  If you are looking for an entertaining and instructive game collection, this one is for you 
 A friend of mine recommended this book and he could not have been more right. It is one of the most underrated books out there. It's a good read for my commute once in a while and it never gets old. The real life examples in the book are a great way to learn and shape our lives. One of the best aspects of this book is its simplicity. Buy it, read it and pass along to your friends and family.   
 First, let's ignore the oxymoron of the "ultimate" guide's fourth edition - if that first edition was so "ultimate," how come three (so far) came after?  The format is straightforward: two or four pages per winery, with glorious photos of the vineyards, buildings, or other distinguishing features of each winery. The tourist's basics are spelled out on the first of that winery's pages: address and contact information  hours of operation, tour arrangements, typical offerings in the tasting room, and tasting fees. A brief, enthusiastic description follows, often with a sound bite or two from the owners.  It's a great help in planning your wine country vacation, or reminder of the good times you had in the Napa valley. Don't expect serious criticism or comparison of the wines - that's for a different book. Do check the information presented, since it's been at least three years (as of this writing) since the most recent edition came out. But dig in and enjoy, since that's what wine and travel are all about.  //wiredweir 
 While the definitive overall Brontes biography is Juliet Barker's 'The Brontes', and the various Bronte-related works of Edward Chitham are invaluable in their own right, this still stands as an important contribution to understanding the Brontes, and Charlotte above all.  Despite its flaws, and I agree with other reviewers, that this is a rather dark picture of events, Elizabeth wrote a detailed and very sympathetic account of Charlotte's life and her relationship to her family. Her inclusion of letter content, epecially in relation to Ellen Nussey, was somewhat self-edited, and the lack of references to the romantic friendship that so clearly existed between the two women, was probably Elizabeth's attempt to protect them.   For anyone who is interested in the truth of their passionate relationship, I highly recommend Elaine Miller's detailed essay 'Through All Changes and Through All Chances' from the book Not A Passing Phase, compiled by the Lesbian History Group. The letter excerpts that Elaine includes clearly indicate that Charlotte and Ellen not only loved each other, but that they jointly expressed a long-term desire to live together 'until Death'.  When Ellen Nussey wanted to publish her own 'The Story of the Brontes' which would have included many excerpts from the hundreds of letters that Charlotte had sent her, Arthur Nicholls blocked permission, as he owned copyright to the contents of the letters, even though Ellen owned the letters themselves. Nicholls - Charlotte's husband of only nine months - also destroyed all of the literally hundreds of letters from Ellen to Charlotte, and even tried to insist that Ellen destroy all of Charlotte's letters to her, during Charlotte's lifetime.  Elizabeth is clearly no fan of Nicholls, but that is hardly surprising in view of his destruction of so much of Charlotte's personal writing material.   For an insight into the lives of Charlotte and her family and the Haworth area in that time period, this is still and always will be an important book 
 I didn't get much done once I started reading this book.  I highly recommend it.  In response to the people picking it apart, read the prologue.  The author specifically says he had to fill in a lot of the gaps as memories degrade over time.  I'm sure the interviews were very specific as to the horrible things witnessed during the war but vague as to where units went at which time.  One thing is for sure....sniping hasn't changed a lot, except the distances have grown as the equipment has risen to the task.  There are many lessons in here for the modern military sniper.  I'm sure Herr Allerberger and Carlos Hathcock could have swapped many war stories.  Fantastic read 
 Seeing/hearing a movie such as this in the German language adds another layer which makes the movie ultra realistic.  Furthermore the actors who play the key roles, especially Hitler, but also Goebbels, Speer, Himler are so alike to the actual historical figures it really is eerie.  What sets the film apart from other WWII/Hitler films is that the characters are portrayed as human beings -- NOT stereotypical Hollywood caricatures.  What makes it chilling is that these human beings can be charming and yet a split second carry out the most horrific acts one can imagine.  Furthermore the the director avoids melodrama.  The events unfold on the screen naturally drawing the the viewer into the events as if one were actually in the bunker witnessing the horrifying events before the fall of Berlin.  As good as Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan were, this film by comparision makes the them seem too contrived and over-acted.  This is a milestone in WWII genre of film-making 
 buyer beware: there are 2 types of sun ra recordings. 1. great colorful big band music featuring the great saxophone work of john gilmore. (which is the category super-sonic jazz certainly falls into). and 2. experimental free-form jazz. i, personally, cannot stand the pretentious free-form stuff, but when the sun ra outfit is focused on compositions (as they are on this cd) they make jazz about as good to listen to as anybody. this is a perfect cd to introduce yourself to the best kind of sun ra. yes, sir 
 Few writers have the ability to truly capture Batman's essence. But Judd Winick pulls it off with little effort. The art work here is nothing short of great, but it's not quite as good as Jim Lee's work in "Hush." Still, if you're looking for some great art and one of the best interpretations of The Joker, this is a book you shouldn't miss. The story picks up shortly after War Games and Identity Crisis and leads directly into Infinite Crisis, if you read both volumes. This first volume really concentrates on where Batman is as a hero and as a person.  During War Games Stephanie Brown, The Spoiler and Robin IV, is killed. For those who didn't know, Tim Drake quit soon after Identity Crisis due to the death of his father. It was very tragic, I suggest you read it before reading this. War Games lacks as a story but it's important to understand the events of this story. Here we get the re-introduction of a character known as The Red Hood. He's out to take over the crime in Gotham City and sees both Black Mask and Batman as problems. However, his efforts are more concentrated on taking out Black Mask. For those who remember, The Red Hood was the original identity used by The Joker before his chemical bath. This is a clue to Red Hood's actual identity, which most people figured out long before it was revealed in volume two. Winick deserves a lot of credit for getting inside each of the characters he chose to focus on. Here he demonstrates a deep love and understanding of what makes Batman who he is.  The only person who probably understands Batman better than Winick is Jeph Loeb. However, given where this story eventually winds up, even Loeb might not have been able to pull this piece off with as much grace and style as Winick. The problems with this book are few but they are there. Some people will complain that this story undoes years of history and that it violates the character of Jason Todd and Batman and that Infinite Crisis was used as a cheap way of bringing Jason Todd back to life. Maybe, but Jason Todd has played an intricate role in Batman's life ever since his death and it stands to reason that he would eventually make another appearance. Especially given that his death was caused by a 1-900 number instead of an editorial decision. His death was a clear example of why fans should not be allowed to determine the outcome of a story arc. Given the choice between killing someone and letting them live, fans always seem to want death. Probably because they didn't actually believe DC would go that far. Jason Todd really has made for a great villain and, in the hands of such good writers and artists, he's really making the most of his new lease on life. Another thing Winick does better than most other writers is working humor into his stories. The dialogue Black Mask has with Mr. Freeze and The Red Hood is simply hilarious. I never knew just how funny his character could be until this story. This story ends with a nice cliffhanger so you'll have to get the second volume to find out what happens. I suggest you do so and ignore the unjustifiable criticism, judge it for yourself 
 I did enjoy this book. I did think that maybe they were going to do something a bit more exciting, but this book did prove to be entertaining none the less.   I do agree that Miss Julia was a bit not like herself, but I think that also proves that sometimes acting so aggressive is not the way to act. I think her and Sam make a wonderful couple and although the droning on and on about Sam and Etta Mae did drive me a bit bonkers, I love the story.  I wish the book would have gone more into what would happen with the "preacher" but oh well!!  Well executed, wholesome book. Good enough to sit on my shelves for a few years that the kids will want to read one day 
 "The New York Trilogy" isn't a novel. As the name would imply, it's a trilogy of novella length short stories, each revolving around a similar theme. While externally, each is pinned to a common geography - namely the city of New York - internally, they tackle the more complicated issue of self-identity and self-worth.   The building blocks Auster uses to create these stories hinges on the concept of creating a setting where the protagonist is pulled into a mystery and forced to take the role of detective:   In "City of Glass," our narrator is an author who gets a call from someone looking for a detective, and he decides to play along. The unfolding mystery turns the city itself into an antagonist, while carrying our hero into an ever-devolving exploration of self.   In "Ghosts," our narrator isn't playing at being a detective, but is in fact an actual detective. He is, however, cajoled into performing an investigation similar to City of Glass, which takes him out of the traditional realm of detective work, and sets him up to essentially spy on his own reality.   Finally, "The Locked Room" sees a return to the author as protagonist, as he begins a literary (and eventually physical) search for his one-time childhood friend. With a few nods to the first story, Auster attempts to tie the trio together in a fairly loose bundle.   As with many post-modern stories, "The New York Trilogy" is grounded in the psyches of its protagonists and to a certain extent its author. It would probably be impractical, if not impossible, to discuss these stories in terms of plot, as the action that moves them isn't what's happening in the ebb and flow of each story's structure, but what each character is forced to face mentally.   If there's any shortcoming to Auster's writing, it's in the way he attempts to immerses his readers in his character's search for self through a fairly transparent mechanism of repetition. This is most noticeable in "Ghosts," where he essentially covers the same ground for twenty or thirty pages.   Even so, Auster's writing is unbelievably dense and enjoyable to read, and his stories are uniquely reflective of our society and culture. For this reason, I can see "The New York Trilogy" slipping into the canon of college literature courses over the next couple of decades. 
 A lone man from the eastern parts of the United States is in a strange and unusual land when he arrives in a small town called Medicine Bow, in the Wyoming Territory. In this hostile and lonely place, he meets a shady character, only known as the Virginian throughout the novel, who is there to take him to a friend named Henry, who happens to be a judge. Throughout the novel, the Virginian shows more and more of his behavior and his compassion, especially when he sees something that attracts his eye. A young schoolteacher from Vermont, Mary Wood, is saved by the Virginian when he grabs her from an overturned stagecoach that falls into a creek. The two steadily develop an interest for each other, until they fall completely in love. All things are not perfect in Medicine Bow, however, for it is still a Western town. Along with saloon fights and duels, the Virginian has a nemesis known as Trampas, a local cowhand. As there is no officer or deputy, the now infuriated Virginian takes matters into his own hands, silencing Trampas once and for all and capturing his one true love. The Virginian, written by Owen Wister, is an excting historical-fiction novel because of three main points: its excellent historical descriptions, its shocking action, and also because of its romance.   The Virginian is an excellent novel in its description of an old Western town and its people. Medicine Bow, in the Wyoming Territory, is a typical small village that has no authority. Because of that, fights are constantly breaking out in saloons, and people are always being murdered. However, being raised as a southern gentleman before the Civil War, the Virginian remains calm under constant pressure, until he finally snaps, and fights the cowhander, Trampas. This is just to prove that a small town such as Medicine Bow isn't the prime place to go to while on vacation.  Also, the action of this novel is another reason why it should be read. When the Virginian enters the Medicine Bow saloon for the first time, there was a point of conflict in the saloon where several people were seriously injured, partly due to the Virgianian. Although this excerpt of the novel was extemely intense, the final showdown between Trampas and the Virgianian is the most shocking with amazing results, in which the suspense will knock the reader off his or her feet.  Romance is the third key factor in why the Virginian, written by Owen Wister, should be read. In the beginning of the story, The Virginian is often described as a lonely person, who's seldom seen with anyone. However, after he rescues the damsal in distress from the overturned stagecoach, his luck begins to change. This goes the same way for Mary Wood, who is actually a bit embarrased over the incident in how frightful she was, clinging fiercely onto the Virginian's back. Even with this, they eventually become quite entangled at the end, proving that love triumphs over every obstacle.  Overall, the Virginian is a great historical fiction novel because of its accurate and adequate history, its great and stunning thrills, and because it is a great love story for all to read. Speaking of love, that's the most important reason why this book is different from most. It teaches a lesson that if you are compassionate to other people, other people will be compassionate to you. When the Virginian first picks up a visitor from the east, he doesn't know what to do with his life. Afterwards, however, he finds that life is worth living. I rate this novel five stars out of five.  A. Chappell 
 Let me start by saying that Neil Young owes me nothing.I consider myself a true fan because I`m willing to take the good with the bad and it has made for some serious head scratching at times but now we have the first installment from the archives with songs from the imfamous Fillmore East shows from 1970.6 songs and 47 or so minutes later I still can`t understand why he never released this before now. Each song is played with an abandon and glee that underscores just how good the original Horse was - Danny Whitten,Ralph Molina and Billy Talbot are Crazy Horse...remnants of the L.A band the Rockets and they were the ultimate garage band and for Neils` music and the direction he was heading,they were the perfect choice. For this particular tour Neil added Jack Nitzsche on electric piano giving all the material just the right shades of color and helped round out the bands admittedly rough edges.Danny was instrumental in pushing Neil beyond his capabilities with his sympathetic guitar playing and outstanding vocals....remember that these guys started out as a vocal group before they even knew how to play their intstruments. Definitive versions of Down By the River and a vicious reading of Cowgirl in the Sand are the conerstones of the disc,Winterlong,Wonderin,Everybody Knows and then there is Dannys` Come on Baby Lets Go Downtown - a song about heroin - round out the disc. Incredible music and an essential artifact from a band that is no more,Neil Young has once again proved that in order to stay in the game you have to hold back and in this case I guess he was right.Rock and Roll never sounded better.  
 You should be aware that this book is heavily religous and gets quite preachy at times.  Also, it is an extremely small/short book.  That all being said--although I am an atheist, I found its general message inspirational, and much of its practical advice very useful 
 It's great to know that women have the same fantasies as men.  I loved this book and continue to savor it as the years go by.  Wish she would write another one 
 I loved this book.  The journey, while inspirational, is secondary to the moving relationship between Nick and his father 
 The plans, photos, patterns and details in this book can be used as a step-by-step guide to building a New England hall-and-parlor house. It's also a designer's guide, a history book and a great introduction to the craft and art of timber framing 
 If you've read all the others, it's a must read.  Really getting anxious to read Rapture now.  Couldn't put it down 
 Being that the TV reception coming out of my VCR is always crappy, the first thing I did after getting my Monster Cable SV1/100-M A/V cable (to test is out) was plug one end it into my cable box's A/V output jack, then plug the other end into one of my VCR's A/V input jacks.  The result?  The TV reception coming through the VCR wasn't crappy anymore!!  I ended up getting two of these A/V cables to hook up my Sony DVD player to my TV via a Terk VS-4 switch.  The picture is phenomenal!!  I plan to get two more soon to improve the reception from my VCR & my cable box.  These A/V cable are worth EVERY penny that you spend on them!!  You can't go wrong with Monster Cable!

 I read veryyyyyy few books. I can't remember the last.  I read this one while at a convention in las vegas. I skipped going out at night to stay in my room and read it. Thats how much it took me by storm.  All I can say is that it was like reading my autobiography.  I just beg you. If the issue of ADD, your knowledge of it at this point, or your suspicions that you or someone you care about may have it. READ this book. I cried many night for hours in the hotel room by myself begging for help 
 This is a well-written, carefully organized book that belongs on desks across America!  Topics covered include organizing before writing, overcoming writer's block, suiting letters to complex situations, and using  grammar and punctuation properly.  If I had to provide one criticism, it  would only be that the book is too short!  As a reader, I didn't tire of  the useful sample letters and would have happily read more and more.  A  great reference for the tentative writer and a good refresher for seasoned  writers, as well 
 Just in a few words: this is a great soundtrack. I bought it for the gnr song as I'm a die hard fan but I have to say I absolutely love the other songs. I'm also a great Anne Rice fan and I think this soundtrack captures the atmosphere of her novels and its characters. Before dissing the GNR track you guys better read Interview With The Vampire and The Vampire Lestat. That way learn more about Lestat himself. You might still not like the song after that but you'll sure understand why it's on the album. Otherwise enjoy! 
 In my opinion, reading historical fiction is all about seeing the world and life through the culture and values of a different society.  In this book, Renault does an excellent job of putting one in the character's life.  The reader gets a well developed sense of the values and society of the time period through the eyes of a potentially typical youth.  Renault writes very well and researches quite thoroughly.  Socrates is a supporting character of the novel.  Her portrayal of that historic celebrity is elegantly done, yet still very human.  All in all, a superior story 
 This is an impressive collection of early and now scarce Noir novels. "The Big Clock" and "Nightmare Alley" are particularly hard to find outside of this volume.  Cain's "The Postman Always Rings Twice" was probably the first crime novel I ever really got into, and it's a stunning departure from Agatha Christie-style mysteries. So much happens in this short book (as turns of plot, but also development of character) that it compares favorably to the first half Camus' "The Stranger." The drifter plumbs the depths of his desperation in a brutal attachment to another man's wife: it's not greed or lust that drives him, but a base need for someone to whom he can anchor himself. A raw and amazing experience, unmatched by anything else of Cain's.  McCoy's "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" is impressively vivid. I had no idea these dance-hall marathons took place before reading this story. This circus of exploitation of young and apparently desperate people certainly makes for excellent Noir. One of these benefits of reading these novels is the unearthing of buried episodes in America's past.  "Thieves Like Us" has been reviewed here as the weaker end of the collection, and I have to agree. It's still a very capable story of outlaws; and the stoicism of the young people caught up in the criminal's lives is admirably depicted here. I recommend reading Andersen's novel before the others (it's still definitive Noir), so one can more easily avoid expectations built up by the Cain and McCoy.  "The Big Clock" is interesting in the depiction of power relationships between employer and employee, and the shifting first-person style of telling the story works here. I never heard of Fearing before reading this novel, but he evidently had a deep understanding of the motivations of very different kinds of people. This novel has the most suspense of the collection, and is a great and sophisticated read.  The most surprising and bizzare novel is "Nightmare Alley," a strange and memorable journey of an aspiring carnival charlatan. It defines Sleaze. The longest and most complex novel, it feels like a long-lost classic that's been hidden away because of its disturbing content. Some may think of it as too long, but the twisting journey through sweaty farming towns, railroad stations and addled big-city martiarchs required time to establish some crediblity: by the end, I was convinced that such a grotesque collection of stunts actually belonged in the story of this country. "Nightmare Alley" alone is worth the price of the book. Fans of Tarot might be a little offended, but this is especially recommended for understanding fans of Ray Bradbury.  Finally, "I Married a Dead Man" by Woolrich is a suspense novel set up by a tragic accident. The protagonist, literally and figuratively hungry, siezes the opportunity to substitute herself into a more fortunate woman's life. Excellently done, and more grounded in comparison to "Nightmare Alley."  Overall, there's no legitimately weak entry in this collection. The variety of content in these novels is enormous, and acquiring this book will allow the reader to experience the different flavors of American Noir. Most modern crime/suspense movies will seem ridiculous by comparison 
 Into the Woods, Sweeney Todd, and A Little Night Music are Sondheim's masterpiece.  The book by Hugh Wheeler is a masterpiece in itself, intelligent and very humurous. You should buy it if you can (it helps give you background).  But what I truly love about A Little Night Music is the truth that is in it, songs like Every Day A Little Death and Sondheim's famed Send in the Clowns speak a lot about human nature and relationships.  In the end, I think this musical is up with Sweeney Todd in caliber of musical. A little bit of advice if you are new to Sondheim however, one must listen to Sondheim music several times before they like it, do not put it on as background music 
 I have read a lot of getting organized books but this is definitely the best one.  It has so much in it that I have read through it many times. I have also underlined important info as well as writing the main points down on my computer.  This is helpful for the home as well as the office.  I highly recommend it 
 I liked this book has great color pictures and can really understand what they are trying to teach and show you about crochet.Worth every penny 
 This movie is wonderful. Although it didn't exactly make me cry, it did touch me in a sentimental way. I fell in love with Morrie. He is such a sweet guy, and his story is an inspiration to everyone. I was greatly impressed by how he chose to make the most of his life, even though fate had handed him a death sentence. He made up his mind that he wasn't going to sit around and feel sorry for himself; he was going to make his final days as happy and pleasant as is entirely possible, and I really admire that.   I was also pleased with the effect Morrie had on his old college student, Mitch. Mitch learns to appreciate life's little surprises, and to not be in such a big rush all the time. He learns to relax and smell the roses, to let go of old grudges, to value the people in his life, and he even learns to allow himself to cry.   My most favorite scene is where Mitch actually breaks down and bawls, and Morrie takes him in his arms and the two men embrace each other. This scene is without a doubt the most moving one in the entire film. Although it's the last time that Mitch ever sees Morrie alive, it's still very sweet and poignant. The ending is pretty sad, but it's also happy at the same time. Morrie is gone, yet his legacy lives on.   I recommend this movie to anyone, of any gender, of any age. 
 Hilarious mix of art world satire and plagiarism of antique English porn and street punk fiction. Home realises that the leading characteristic of pulp fiction is repetition, and he just perfects the method, with highly amusing results. The book is populated with fictional versions of some of Home's own 'real-world' avant garde provocations, although with Home one is never sure what is original and what is a copy; what is 'real' and what is fiction 
 i read this years after i'd read catcher in the rye and nine stories and it was cool to be reading salinger again but it wasn't as rewarding as the first two books were. maybe i let too much time pass and outgrew his style. i dunno. i felt as if i was reading a magazine story and not a book story. i still would read everything he wrote tho if he released all new stuff, j.d. salinger's the man 
 This commentary on Acts offers a great deal of historical background on the people, places, and events of the 1st century Christian church.  In some places it gets a little bogged down with the names of all the people, but quite often Bruce offers interesting insights into the climate of the times.  Taking the time to slow down and review some of the accounts in Acts really opens your eyes to details that are easily missed, or left out in the translation.  There could have been more discussion of theological issues in the commentary, but Bruce seemed to be content in describing historical aspects. The commentary did convey a respect for the book of Acts as the Word of God, and would be a good place for a reader to get some additional insight into Acts 
 This book has adrenaline written all over it! Michael Crighton did an excellent job of keeping readers on their seats. I was blown away. Not only did his novel have adrenaline, but it also had horror, which kept you waiting for your hand to turn the next page 
 After seeing the author on "Your World with Neil Caputo" on Fox News, I read her book, ROCKET MOM! I would highly recommend it to any parent, but especially to mothers.  Not only will you learn very practical ideas for raising great kids, you will also be inspired to become a better parent. Carolina's strategies are all designed to bring excellence into the parenting equation. The author does something that few other parenting experts do: she lays out the research and then spins it through the filter as only a mom with four kids and nearly twenty years of "in the trenches" parenting can do. Exquisitely written, it's a must-read for parents of all ages. Do yourself a favor and buy this book.  
 its been a long week for Arthur Penhaligan and unfortunatly for him, its not getting easier. only a few days after the defeat of Sir Thursday and Arthur gets a message from Lady Friday, ruler of the Middle House. it appears that she has left her domain and is seemingly handing it over, her domain, the key, and the Will. but Arthur is not alone, Superior Saturday and the Piper have received the same message and now it is a fight to the finish. meanwhile, Leaf has problems of her own. taken by Lady Friday, she must now escape from the Denizen's evil intentions and find her way back to Arthur before its to late. once again, Nix provides another enjoyable read. the characters are originall and the settings are as exotic as ever. i just hate that i'll have to wait another year for the next installment in the series. so if you love the Keys to the Kingdom series, Lady Friday will not dissapoint 
 This beautiful paperback is just over a hundred pages, but it packs a punch with the gorgeous black and white photo illustrations.  Each is accompanied by text in both Italian and English explaining the technical aspects and the nuances of each gesture.  This timeless guide was first published in 1958, and the 2005 re-release is a must-have for anyone studying Italian language and culture.  (No vulgar gestures included. 
       The Library Card by Jerry Spinelli is an interesting book. Mongoose, he just turned 12, he's bad and mean. Just because Mongoose turned 12, he ditches school and spray paints property. He also doesn't listen to mom.         Brenda, she's weird, she also watches too much TV. Her goal is not to watch T.V. for one hundred and sixty-eight hours.        Sonseray, he travels around the country with his Uncle Jack, he also has a dead mother.          April Mendez is upset about her parents move to the Pennsylvania Farm. She also was high jacked by a bookmobile.         This story is about a kind of magical card. It's a passport to somewhere unknown or even forbidden. The magic card ends up with four children: Mongoose, Brenda, Sonseray, and April Mendez. They all get the card when they need it most.         I like this book because it's exciting and weird at the same time. I like the part when Brenda didn't watch TV for one hundred and sixty eight hours. She was so miserable, because she always watched TV. The part that I didn't like was when Mongoose spray painted on the wall, but I recommend all kids to read The Library Card  by Jerry Spinelli.      
 A great magazine for those guys who want to be entertained and look at hot looking women.  
 As much as one would prefer complete cycle recordings, very few pianists find so much afinity with a single composer as to offer a compelling account of a complete cycle.  Gilels or Richter never played Beethoven complete sonata cycles, Ashkenazy's Chopin cycle is full of great performances as the ballades and others were he seems to fall out of the love with the music as in the polonaises.  So the point being that rarely can a pianist do justice to complete sets, why is it that i am giving a 5 star rating to this set?  Well, to me it seems that Kempff had all the ideal atributes for Schubert playing as are solid technique and expansive rhythms, concentration in touch and a singing line, but most important is that you feel all throughout these recordings that he loves every detail of the music.  Simply put, it seems that he was enjoying himself here and all details considered, his Schubert playing is perfectly balanced.  Get it - soundwise Uchida's and Schiff's cycles have now the advantages of modern recordings, but both of them lack the heart Kempff has bestowed here 
  If I were to describe Meshel NdegeoCello's masterpiece "Peace Beyond Passion" in one word, I would use the word divine. It is a reflective record on life and deals with issues that come up in daily lives. The subjects she speaks of are subjects that nearly everyone can relate to. NdegeoCello shows her multi talent throughout the record exposing us to her singing, rapping and an assortment of unusual and beautiful instruments.   1. "The Womb"- A short instrumental that works nicely as an intro to the album. Complex instrumentation and a good beat!  2. "The Way"- an excellent song with really good contraversial lyrics. She raises some really relevent points in the song and speaks her mind. Her voice is beautiful.  3. "Deutoronomy: Niggerman"- A completely different song to anything else. It sounds quite dark yet has a hip-hop and jazz influence. Very good!  4. "Ecclesiastes: Free My Heart"- A beautiful song with great lyrics. NdegeoCello's voice sounds sincere and exposed. Beautiful.  5. "Leviticus: Faggot"- Great instrumentation and lyrics. The vibe is just right for the song. It deals with homophobia and is taken from the viewpoint of a homophobe. Many people have accused NdegeoCello of being homophobic because of this although she is clearly not as she is bi-sexual herself!  6. "Mary Magdalene"- A beautiful song about NdegeoCello's infatuation with a prostetute. The instruments work well as usual as does NdegeoCello's voice.  7. "God Shiva"- I would consider this the weakest song on the album, which says a lot about the album as it is not weak at all. The instrumentation is good and the vocals are done well. My only problem is that the chorus is repeated too often.  8. "Who Is He And What Is He To You"- Funky song that is just amazing. NdegeoCello works this remake and makes it her own.  9. "Stay"- A perfect song to hear at this point of time on the record. It is a song about infatuation and wanting her lover to stay which works nicely after all the political and spiritual songs. Excellent.  10. "Bittersweet"- Another funky song. You can't help dancing while this song is on.  11. "A Tear And A Smile"- A beautiful masterpiece of a song. The instrumentation is excellent.  12. "Make Me Wanna Holler"- Sounds like an autobiographical song. It is a really pleasant way to close the album and doesn't sound too loud or forcedly angry. The length is perfect too.   Overall this is one of my favourite albums of all time if not my favourite. I think it surpasses anything NdegeoCello has done since and surpassses her debut "Plantation Lullabies". I would recommend it to anyone who is into R&B, soul, neo soul, hip-hop, alternative or pretty much any genre! It really is an amazing record!  MARK- 10/10 
 As opposed to A Year in Provence (to which it is sometimes compared), this book doesn't inspire you to pull up stakes and transfer to the South of France or anywhere else, except maybe to the nearest musty, possibly treasure-laden bookstore, and deepen your appreciation of books.  A visit to the California Antiquarian Book Fair a few years back taught me that there are basically two kinds of people -- those who love books for what they are and those that love books for what they do.  Collins seems to be that rare bird -- a dweller in both camps.  Every booklover knows the joy in finding something they didn't know they'd wanted in the first place.  But he includes historical bits, usually hilarious, he's gleaned from his lifelong pursuit of the obscure and quirky.  His sidetrips are also wonderfully funny and informative.  For instance, while giving an account of what it's like to be in the publishing his own first effort, he segues into a description of, say, dust covers, giving a brief history of their development and what they may tell a prospective buyer, proving you CAN judge a book by its cover.  The avid reader will recognize, also, Collins' predilection for making a beeline for bookcases when visiting someone's home.  This practice is a shortcut to getting to know a person.  Along the same lines, I try to see books on shelves behind people who are being interviewed on camera.  The writing is full of humor, the biographical episodes lively enough to convey a sense of place.  But the real joy is in finding there is still much to learn about books as objects rather than books as providers of knowledge and enjoyment 
 I initially borrowed this from a friend when I was an enlisted Soldier.  Afterwards, I had to buy a copy for myself.  This book, arguably Heinlein's best, is about the military exploits of Juan Rico.  Naively enlisting in the military during the far future, Rico deals with both defeat and victory during his journey from private to officer.  The book is totally different from the monstrous movie made during the 1990's.  The movie, primarily concerned with sex and violence, has almost none of the book's plot.  On the other hand, the book has more than just sci-fi action.  "Starship Troopers" also discusses the tenets of military leadership, along with Heinlein's ideals of politics and morality.   In the utopian or dystopian future, depending on the reader's perspective, the military is all-volunteer, but political rights are limited to veterans.  While controversial, it does give food for thought in this current era of an all-volunteer military, but with near universal political rights for all.     If you enjoy military books, buy this.  If you like science fiction books, buy this.  If you enjoy philisophical books, buy this.  It is not for everyone, but it is an excellent story 
 Anyone interested in Sophia and Gnostic literature will be enthralled by this treatise.  Compelling, fascinating, and engrossing.  Buy this book.  It is an absolute must-have 
 Jeanne Dobie's book is well deserved for all the praise given by other reviewers.It teaches you not only pallette selection as most other books but goes deeper into techniques such as glazing which is important for a trasparent medium like water color.I am sure this book would also be very valuable for acrylic painters who often attempt water-color effects with acrylics.I learnt a lot about  'seeing colors' after going through this book.This is indeed original in approach compared to dozens of 'run of the mill' books. 
 My hair was very frizzy, VERY frizzy. It became curly right after I washed it. I disliked it, that was untill I bought this. The VS straightener heats up in 1 minute! It has 25 heat settings, so even if your hair is almost straight you can still use it. It works pretty quickly too, in about 10-20 minutes, my frizzy hair becomes sleek, shiny, and beautiful. Plus, because it is a ceramic straightener, it barely damages my hair. At the ends, they have tabs, so you can close it without burning yourself! There is also a light that tells you if the straightener is on. I gave it 4 stars because sometimes, it snags your hair. Other than that, it is a very good straightener. I reccomend purchasing it 
 I was suffering from a severe case of writer's block before picking up "The Songwriter's Workshop: Harmony". I have picked up new techniques from modifing harmonies to learning popular chord progressions. The play-along CD has been instrumental in my development as a writer. I highly recommend this book if you are suffering from writer's block and want to learn great techniques to creating hit songs. 
 This novel is no less than an epic minus the length. The potency of the novel will stir even the most insipid soul. It revolves around the central character Bazarov, a nihilst, who stands in sharp contrast with the traditional values of Russian society. Bazarov views everything with his scientific lens this draws a duel between him and the other characters, mostly the elders. As the novel progresses the gaps between the characters widens but beneath this there is a torrent of emotions that binds them together.   Also, the characters are explored in detail which creates a sense of intimacy and a feeling of sympathy. Again Turgenev is a master here with his impeccable narration.  In short, 'Fathers and sons' captures the generational gap that exists and will continue to exist between the younger and the older generations. 
 If you are serious about learning how to live with your dog, this book is an excellent investment. I'd purchased it years ago when it was first published. I currently teach advanced obedience classes and recommend this book for all my students.  There is something in there for everyone at all stages of dog training. 
 This tour de force historical perspective of nature  leads the reader into a provocative search for understanding the human role on Earth. Not for the narrow-minded and/or Jerry Falwell 
 It must be really strange for a child of immigrants to understand what their parents are feeling about their other country and culture.  Some may or may not understand their parents first language.  I am eager to share this book with my students and see what they think 
 As stated before in another review, the only thing that qualifies me to review is the fact that I am a very particular life long reader of multiple genre's. The reviews I have read before mine consist of two types.  One set of reviews are from Major publications like Publishers Weekly and Booklist. The other reviews are from people like me.  People who are every day "Joe's" who like to read and enjoy a book based on it's inherant qualities.  I get the feeling that the major reviewers feel a need to critisize this book simply because it is not written by Stephen King or Dean Koontz (both of whom I have read)and is written by a Christian author.  I have news for the reviewers, Dekker is not King or Koontz but he is a well established author in his own right.  I have tried Christian authors many times and felt the quality lacking. This is not so with Ted Dekker.  This being said I will go on with my review.  Others have given an outline of the book, I will forgo doing this.  This was a fast paced hair raising page turner that had me guessing intill nearly the end.  I read it in two days because I could not put it down.  Dekker has the ability to capture your imagination and make you hold your breath.  He brings home truths about human nature that we would rather shove under the rug.  He is insightfull and will make you think.  I really liked this one.  It is better than House. It is better than Showdown. It is better that n Saint. And I really liked those books.  As others have stated I still love the circle trilogy best, but this one is on a par with any of his best and with any other writer out there today.  So the readers of these reviews have a choice.  Take for granted that what the Big boy reviewers say is true, or believe what the majority of people just like you have written in there reviews.   If you love to read. If you like to be challenged. If you crave a suspencefull page turner that will keep you guessing till the end. Then read Skin because....  Dekker Delivers. 
 The first thing you notice about this retrospective is that Randy Newman's voice has really grown quite gutteral and craggy, more so than usual. That's not to say that it takes away from the music, but it certainly gives a sense of looking back on a great career - Newman has been writing songs for 40 years now and has achieved the position of a real statesman in the business. For a Newman fan like myself, this release has a kind of 'photo album' feel to it. Newman revisits most of his classics, just him at the piano, and intersperses the songs with short instrumental selections from 'Awakenings', 'Parenthood', 'Avalon' and 'Ragtime'. It is a laid back and beautiful listen 
 Schaeffer's book was a godsend to me, answering and echoing the questions that rang in my mind when trying to figure out what it really means to be a follower of Christ, and whether or not being one entails leaving reason behind in favor of revelation. This work goes a long way in answering the questions of HOW I know what I know; and exposing presuppositions about the nature of the universe that shape our thinking. It prepared me for many onslaughts against a reasonable faith, showing that there is another way other than accepting either the dissolution of absolute truth in postmodernism or the anti-reason/anti intellectualism of certain branches in fundamentalism. This is an excellent help to anyone experiencing a personal paradigm shift in Jesus' direction, or as a primer to exploring and examining competing worldviews. 
 Several centuries from now humanity is busily settling far-off planets and contacting alien beings.  Those on the frontline of this effort are the Explorers.  Explorers are those individuals are have been deemed to be of normal or above-normal intelligence but have a crucial flaw...they are, in one form or another, disfigured.  As such they are deemed Expending Crew Members (ECMs) and are the vanguard of humanity's effort to contact alien life...in other words, they get sent into all the really dangerous first-contact situations.  Festina Ramos is an Explorer (and an ECM), she has a large red birthmark covering an entire side of her face.  Along with her partner Yarrun, she has been assigned to lead a mission escorting the flamboyant Admiral Chee to the planet Melaquin.  Over the course of the last 50 years dozens of Explorers have disappeared on Melaquin and Ramos (along with Yarrun and Chee) has been sent to figure out why.  After a fairly slow, start, Expendable picks up its pace.  The natives on Melaquin are...a very interesting idea.  I'd hate to spoil anything here...so let me just say the natives have unique properties that make them a really creative idea on Mr. Gardner's part.  As for what happened to the previous Explorers that were sent to Melaquin, that was kind of formulaic...but I enjoyed the story nonetheless.  Also, I'd really like another book with much more detail given on the League of Peoples...the background alien federation/conglomeration that gave humanity much of its sophisticated technology with which they now use to explore the stars.  Overall, I'd definitely read more of Mr. Gardner's works...while Expendable hardly falls into the category of great literature, it is an enjoyable story with some really interesting ideas 
 I cannot believe I finally found Ferlin and his "GONE".   Even harder to believe is that I actually remember most of the words.  This needs to be rereleased. The much younger generations might just go crazy  over his wonderfully "Husky" voice 
 The narrative is fascinating reading, both in terms of the history revealed in the words of Mary Jemison and in terms of James Seaver who gives us his own version of her story. The effect is a layering of historical periods. With the help of the editing, you can peer through and see not only the period of Mary Jemison's captivity, but also the prejudices of the following time. An interesting example of the simultaneous respect and loathing with which the early settlers viewed the native inhabitants. I first read the narrative in high school, and would recommend it for young and old readers alike. 
 Imagine Charlotte Bronte writing a children's book, and you have a pretty good idea of what The Wolves of Willoughby Chase is like. This moody, atmospheric tale of two young cousins on the run from their evil governess is a must-read for anyone remotely interested in the genre of children's literature. First published in 1961, it has since become a classic. From its opening pages, the novel strikes a gothic tone that hovers over the story and draws the reader into its spell. We see the great Willoughby Manor in the dead of winter, buried beneath an incomprehensible amount of snow. From a distance packs of starved wolves are howling as they circle the place, looking for human prey. Sir Willoughby Green is about to take his wife to Spain, where it is hoped the climate will improve her drastically ailing health. He has appointed a distant cousin, the evil Miss Slighcarp, to look after the Manor and take care of his daughter and his neice while he is away. What he doesn't know is that Miss Slighcarp has plans of her own, plans of taking the Manor away from Sir Willoughby. But first she'll have to get rid of these two troublesome girls, who represent a hindrance to her scheme. What follows is a chilling tale of suspenseful intrigue that will have you racing to get to the end. Don't say I didn't warn you!  
 The life of a samurai is often considered a noble and respected one, but reading Musui's story will show you that there are always exceptions. This autobiography offers a unique glimpse into what would be a other wise unheard of life. Katsu Kokichi (Musui's younger name) wrote a biography of his life, but not as a work of literature. HE wrote this as a guide to his children, a guide on how not to live one's life. And considering how his son Rintaro turned out, it may have worked.   Early on in the book you get a sharp look at what kind of person Kokichi is. This made for a quite entertaining read due to the fact that Kokich led quite and interesting and perilous life. Hitting other kids with rocks, running away from home, and stealing money from family made up a substantial part of Kokich life.   It got so bad that at one point his family was forced to lock him in a cage for three years - some timeout. Aside from all the fighting and mischief, I found the most interesting part of this book was the times during which Kokich had run away from home. It was interesting to see the interaction Kokich had with the people he met during his travel and the measures that he took to stay alive and fed.   Overall I found the book enjoyable and easy to read. Being that it was an autobiography, I really enjoyed the perspective and insight on Kokichi's life that it offered. 
 This baby has helped me track my heart through all the highs and lows and ultimately allowed me to assist my doctor in verifying that something is seriously wrong with my blood pressure. We're yet to verify what the culprit is... but this little guy helps me know when to slow down or kick it up a notch.  I would highly recommend this guy if you're looking for a wrist-inflatable blood pressure monitor. It's been consistant, reliable, and informative for both myself and my doctor 
 I read this book, and it is an excellent study of McVeigh. However, let me point out that I read the hardcover version, which was published before Tim's execution. Still, Tim had many ups and downs of his life. I'm sure that many people, myself included, have some sort of disrespect for the government, and the authors present Tim's case remarkably presented. But instead of using letters to congressmen urging them to change the system, McVeigh decided to take human life to make his case. This shows how extreme hatred of the government can become if one's twisted mind believes that killing is the only way to be heard. Second, I kind of sympathize with some periods of McVeigh's life that I've pretty much led myself, such as isolation from the social world (except for, in McVeigh's case, gun enthisiasts). This is a must read and an alert that any crazy American can fight for rights by selfishly ending promising lives 
 I loved it! Emily is this new girl in town and is lonely but doesn't mind as her mom is a vet so spends most of her time with animals. As she gets adjusted to the town one day this sick animal comes with these brutal green gashes that everybody thinks is pioson. Not just that but dogs are soon found dead by the wildlife perserve. Emily decides to explore until she finds a stone that later turns beautiful like in all differnet rainbow colours. She later meets a girl Adriane and becomes fast friends. They learn to except the magic that entered their lives and most of all they learn that magic is strongest when your friends are there to help, and not to mention a magical world with evil lurking everywhere.   
 Not quite as good as I expected, but some good material.  He does point up some good illustrations of not understanding what numbers mean.  Some v ery good info on coincidence, happenstance, chances of things happening, etc. Worth the read 
 There are a lot of props needed for this workout, but well worth the time.  I have constant lower back pain and have tried various things.  This video gave me the stretch I needed for some relief.  If you are after results, this is the video for pain relief.  If changing props interfers with your workout or stresses you, then you don't want this 
 An encouraging book for young children who have a mother prone to angry outbursts. This book was created to be read by children whose mother's have some sort of emotional disability, dependence or life circumstance, which can affect their children. It is gently encouraging and could easily be incorporated into any classroom or crises center. It has a very touching ending 
 These young, hip, classically trained wonders have definitely shown that their first album was only the beginning. Brilliant playing by all individually (or in duet form) and unbelievable sync-ness when armed with five pianos and 50 fingers. If you're looking for something different in the classical realm, look no further. A great introduction to classical music for the younger set 
 I'm not actually a Manager however, this book gives great information on relating to individual people and how to handle difficult situations.    It gives view points from many different sides and helps you learn how to see things from anothers point of view.  I love the "story" format as you go on a great journey with Sam.  Overall an excellent book for anyone who interacts with people 
 Great Seller - This is one of my favorite cd's - Too, Too Cool! 
 This is a great book to read to even the youngest readers.  My daughter is almost 2 and LOVES this book.  We read it three or four times each time we sit down to read.  And from other reviews, it will continue to be a great book for when she is learning to read 
 I have gleaned a few books on procrastination, but most of them spend too much time  dwelving into the 'causes of' instead of offering tangible solutions.  Although understanding the underlying casuses of the problem is important, a few of us want to get started quickly on how to stop it.  This book is a welcome change in this respect, because it mixes and matches the different reasons why people procrastinate with useful strategies to minimize it or stop it altogether.   When I picked-up this book, I was struck by its 'lets get right to it' approach and sometimes funny anecdotal quirks.  The book is organized in six sections, 10 1-2 page useful tips per section (to make the total of 60 tips).  The author advocates that the book can be started from anywhere, as a pick-up refreseher while you are in the P act or read in order.  I read it back to back in a couple of hours and found it full of interesting and useful information.  There is some logical progression starting from practical tips, progressing into more in-depth tips,  and then hammering some important tips at the end.  However, the structure of the book is loose making it a great reference.  Although there is some information repeated throughout the book, this might be intentional to leave you with clear messages at the end.  Some of the tips are outrageous (like Put Money in Escrow) others are far out there (Tap the Power of Scents) but most of them are insightful and practical.  I recommend this book to anybody having a hard time getting things done at home or work and looking to minimize their procrastinatig habits. It has inspired me to write this review, which I would usually procrastinate 
 Shoes came in super fast, and they were in brand new condition. The transaction went very smoothly 
 I remember the movie on Sky some weeks back, and as with all well written books, it knocks spots off the big screen version. Grisham's portrayal of the eleven year old kid is masterful as he jumps into the kids head in every chapter. Absolutely gripping and highly believable. 
 The Principle Centered Leadership was in fact an excellent choice for me and I understood fully the content. The delivery of the book was fast and I love Amazon.Co 
 If there is one childhood book that I always loved and will never forget, it is Morris Goes To School.  Having a moose that walks, talks, and goes to school is entertaining in itself, but his need-to-learn personality is even  more neat.  Morris first tries to buy candy at a candy store but first goes  to the fish store and then counted his money wrong.  Luckily, he got to go  to school where he learned the alphabet, the difference between the words  "boys" and "girls", how to spell, how to hoof-paint,  and how to count.  During this time, the children and the teacher had a lot  of fun having a moose for a classmate.  They sang songs together and played  games together.  At the end, Morris was able to find the candy store with  no problem and buy the candy without trouble.  I would recomend this book  to any young child beginning to read.  It is cute, fun, and educational 
 This is one of those books you think initially think would intimidate and overwhelm you; but from the first word it actually reads like a novel you can't put down.  We are all fortunate that the Ravitch team writes so accessibly and engagingly.  This book has already become part of my nightly bedtime routine; I look forward to reading a selection every night.  "The English Reader" should be in everyone's library -- or at everyone's bedside.  It's a lively treasure.  
 The best way to make my point is by saying that I've had this CD for two weeks now, one in my car and one in my home, and it's about all I've been listening to since I got it. It's that addictive. If you are an opera lover, if you are a fan of vocal art, if you have admired Villazon's earlier work, if you just love great music wonderfully, earnestly, generously, passionately performed, then you absolutely must own this CD. There's not a false note in these gorgeously rendered numbers.  The music itself, mostly new to my ears, is sun-drenched Latin throughout--pulsating with life, hypnotic, captivating, sensual and, under Domingo's magic wand, magnificently, charmingly idiomatic. Villazon's singing is beautiful, full-throated, subtle, free and fully alive to every word in the text and will pull you back for repeated listening, I guarantee it. 
 Far too often, the thoughts of Black youth are presented to us through well meaning, but biased sociologists or historians. It's refreshing to catch a glimpse of childhood memories from memoirs and autobiographies,  rather than from the pages of yet another treatise on the plight of Black  America.  One section incudes the memoirs of William Holtzclaw, founder of  the Utica Normal and Industrial Institute. It includes a description of an  arrangement between Holtzclaw's uneducated father and the landowner for  whom they all sharecropped. The father had an agreement to keep one quarter  of the crops the family grew, but at the end of each season the landowner  would calmly explain that Holtzclaw's family "ate" their share of  the cotton harvest during the year. This young child's introduction to  political powerlessness, interest rates and creative bookkeeping has far  more impact than anything that you're likely to find in every financial  self-help book ever published.  The book also contains the childhood  memories of Malcolm X., Angela Davis, Booker T. Washington, Maya Angelou  and more. But it is merely a series of excerpts and it lacks the editorial  voice that could connect these stories. That's either good or bad,  depending upon what you're looking for. If you're looking for a  comprehennsive understanding of Black youth, this isn't it. But if you're  looking to connect with the stories of a culture that you already know,  this book is a must have 
 A book full of deep emotional journeys and social introspections, The Light in the Forest is a coming of age story that also possesses the complications inherent in cross-culural contact.  It serves both the functions of providing children with great literature and providing children with strong emotional and social lessons so that they can more fully understand the world in which they live.  Children find it hard to resist given its sense of mystery, adventure, and unpredictabilty.  It gives a human shape to a time which fostered many of the early issues that would eventually become important to an infant country trying to find its way through the wilderness 
 While I have enjoyed seeing Tris get herself into trouble and work on getting herself out of it, it's definitely nice to see that there is someone out there who is worse tempered than she is. It's also refreshing to see her in a different light than before. She has perhaps grown more, and can relate to the Glaki, which is nice to see 
 My Fair Lady film version is my favorite of all movies I could pick from. The casting of Audrey Hepburn was magnificent. Born in Brussels, Audrey would live briefly in England during the second world war. But from all her performances begining in her debut on American Film in Roman Holiday in 1953 which won her first Oscar, she continued to light up the screen. Many actresses are dubbed, its all part of the industry and anyone who tries to critize the performance of Hepburn because of that one reason, doesn't necessarily appreciate great art. Her portrayal is so elegant, and by far the best she had done up to that point. And unlike many actresses who are stereotyped as being "Hollywood", Audrey was never like that at all. Maybe that's why she has been embraced for so many generations. Just a damn good musical with a damn good cast. 
 I thought it was a pretty funny movie.  It defintely brought me a flashback from the 80's.  I loved it then and I still love it now.  Thats why I absolutely had to add it to my 80's collection! 
 This book detailed the Black Plague of the 14th century.  It discusses it's effects on primarily Europe, but briefly talks about the possible origins of the disease and its migration west 
 Report to the Principal's Office by Jerry Spinelli is a detailed, well-thought out book.  The main characters are Sunny Wyler, Salem Brownmiller, Pickles Johnson, Eddie Mott, and Charles T. Brimlow.  The story takes place at Plumstead Middle School.  The book gives you very detailed character traits and visual traits of characters in your mind.  Every character has their own unusual personality.  You don't need pictures to see what's going on in this book because of the detailed descriptions of the settings and the characters' actions on every page of the book.  It also describes the characters' thoughts, and there are plenty of characters you meet in this story.  I would give this book a 5-star rating and recommend it to anyone looking for a detailed book to read.  
 Reid's book is great. I read it, and tried the Breathing exercises....WHAM! I felt so energetic since! FUll of vitality! I applied his advice on diet & food too, and my past digestive disorder and stomach bloats and aches are history! I listened to him and start  conserving my 'jing' if you know what i am talking about, and I feel on top  of the world! READ THIS BOOK 
 Unbelievable.  I was a skeptical, heavy smoker for more than 20 years, and I've been quit now for more than two months.  I tried and did not quit with many other methods.    Allen's way WAS EASY.  I swear.  I've NEVER written a book review before, but felt compelled to share with others.  In fact, I've even bought four other copies for friends.    I had no withdrawals, no regrets and no cravings.  I kept the ideas he said to keep in mind, and like magic, I quit and loved every moment of it.  He tought me how to be and think like a non-smoker again (as we all are born).  It does feel more natural.  The key?  Knowing, feeling and believing (which I found out was true) that being and feeling like a non-smoker, is waaaaaaaaaaay better than how I 'though' smoking made me feel (good).  I can't explain any more than that, but it did change my thinking dramatically.  He takes the way we all as smokers 'think' about ourselves and our smoking, and turns quitting into a positive.  Not the negative that most smokers who want to quit, think of it as.  By the time you're half way through the book, you are joyful at the excitement you have at how great you're going to feel when you quit.  And it just continues!  AND I DO FEEL GREAT.  HE HELPS YOU TO THINK DIFFERENTLY ABOUT QUITTING AND TAKES AWAY THE FEAR.  Go ahead, buy it. You will be elated that you did!  
 one of the really good wwII movies. unknown to most. lee marvin is great

 Melvyn, Lord Bragg, whose native language was not Standard English, but rather a North-of-England Fenland dialect that he says has lots of Saxon, Danish and even Romany words in it, has written a paean to the English language.  "English doesn't borrow from other languages... English sneaks up on other languages in dark alleys, beats other languages over the head, and pulls extra words out of the other language's pockets."  I can't remember who said that, but I think it was George Bernard Shaw. Whoever said it illustrates Bragg's thesis...English is a proud language that is not too proud to borrow, from Norman French, from Latin, from Spanish, from American Indians, and from the cowboys of the wild west.  If you ever wonder where the words you say everyday came from, read this book...written more like an adventure novel than a philologist's screed...and then you'll know.

 Mickey Z is a dissenting American radical who deeply admires diverse forms of passionate dissent.  He is mainstream enough to cite legislation passed as a result of radical protest as a vindication of that protest, but his general vision of government is that of a passive agent, awaiting the next protest demonstration to get a sense of direction.  The theme of this book is best stated in a quotation from Barbra Ehreneich.  "Dissent, rebellion, and all-around hell-raising remain the true duty of patriots," she says.  This a book for the age of soundbites and hyperlinks. It provides an introduction to many diverse individuals and social movements, so that virtually everyone will learn something from it.  And it deals with Bob Dylan's complaint about history: "I've never seen a history book that tells me how anybody feels," he said.  One of the few Presidents in this book to earn a mention--and perhaps the only President to be praised for an action taken--is Chester A. Arthur who--it turns out--at age 24 was a pioneering civil rights attorney representing Lizzie Jennings, the Rosa Parks of 1854, who sued and won after being denied admission to a New York City horse drawn carriage.  Arthur's representation of Jennings is called a "classic 'who knew' situation. "  It certainly justifies taking another look at Arthur.  Another surprising fact--for me, at least--was the deep passion and antagonisms resulting from Jack Johnson, an African-American, being named heavywieght champion of the world in 1908: an uproar that perhaps slowed down black admission to other professional sports.   And then, in a section on Daniel Ellsberg's release of the Pentagon Papers, there is this cogent political analysis from key Richard Nixon Presidential aide H.R. Haldeman on June 14, 1969:       To the ordinary guy, all this is a bunch of gobbledygook. But out of      all the gobbledygook comes a very clear thing: you can't trust the       government; you can't believe what they say; and you can't rely on      their judgement.  And the implicit infallibility of Presidents, which      has been an accepted thing in America, is badly hurt by this, because      it shows that people do things the President wants to do even though      it is wrong, and the President can be wrong.  I also like Martin Luther King's telegram to farmworker's leader Cesar Chavez,after a United Farmworker organizing victory,  which puts King's eloquence, profundity, and coalition building on display all at once:         The fight for equality must be fought on many fronts--in urban       slums, in the sweatshops of the factories and fields.  Our separate      struggles are really one--a struggle for freedom, for dignity, and       for humanity.  You and your valiant fellow workers have demonstrated      your commitment to righting grievous wrongs froced upon exploited       people.  We are together with you in spirit and it determination       that our dreams for a better tomorrow will be realized.  In summary, this is a provocative and stimulating little book which should encourage interest in American history, provide new insights to many readers, and provide no shortage of inspirational material.  Because of ideological biases, which give violent protests a stature they do not deserve, it is less than the sum of its parts.  But many of the parts are very, very good.  Politicians seeking to keep the attention of audiences, columnists seeking to say memorable things, and teachers seeking to counter student apathy all can find useful material here 
 This is not a case with frills.  The camera fits snugly inside but there's no room for anything else such as the battery charger or even the case for the memory card.  It feels flimsier than I expected but so far I have had no problems with workmanship, so that attribute may just be my interpretation.

 The Marvelettes deserve a great amount of credit for the pioneering work they did for Motown, as is indicated in the other reviews.  They really helped put Motown on the map with it's very first #1 pop hit, "Please Mr. Postman."  Thus, they were the first Motown act to have a pop #1, their only one, as a matter of fact.   In the beginning, the Marvelettes were more of a rock and roll group.  Their sound was closer to another Motown girl-group, the Velvelettes, primarily because lead singer Glady Horton's voice was similar to Cal Gill's of the Velvelettes.  In fact, on one of the Marvelettes few early albums, and a great one at that [simply titled THE MARVELETTES], they cover "He Was Really Saying Something," a big cult classic for the Velvelettes, where one can more closely see the similarities.  I believe Robert Bateman was one of the primary producers of Marvelettes tunes in those early years.  It really is quite interesting, in fact and through this collection, to see the progession of musical styles.  In the mid '60s, the focus was shifted more and more to Wanda Young Roger's more kittenish or sultry lead vocals, and a more soulful sound.  Some people attribute this shift to the fact that Wanda married Bobby Rogers of the Miracles.  Since more and more of their records were being produced by Smokey Robinson, he simply preferred her voice.  In fact, Wanda's voice WAS more distinctive that Gladys', though certainly not stronger or better.  Gladys, in fact, left the group in '67 or '68, very likely a result of this shift of focus.  One might say that Wanda was the Billie Holiday of Motown, in more ways than vocally.  [You can read all about it in Marc Taylor's 2004 book, THE ORIGINAL MARVELETTES: MOTOWN'S MYSTERY GIRL GROUP, which includes extensive input from original and long-time group member Katherine Schaffner.  Compelling reading!]  The Marvelettes, however, as the '60s progressed, and as the Vandellas and the Supremes ascended, really became a Motown "B"-list group.  That's not to say that there weren't some marvelous records.  Were it not for Smokey's continuing interest, the group might have faded earlier and more quickly.  Perhaps this is also attributable to these factors: Motown had such an over-abundance of talent and product in the mid '60s, the public's interest in the group ebbed-and-flowed over the years, and their chart success was a bit sporadic.  Still, the MUSIC is definitely worth having for any Motown fan, as it exemplifies the developing and ever-maturing sound and playing by all concerned: writers, musicians and singers.  To the casual Motown fan, however, there will be several tunes on this collection which will be unfamiliar.  That doesn't mean that the tunes are unworthy.  Also, it is a more than adequate representation, on once disc, of the Marvelettes output.  For the record, this "ultimate collection" series aims to include all of the charting singles, in their original mono format, where available.  The idea was to capture, as closely as possible, the sound that came out of your car radio, if you were around in the '60s.  That doesn't mean that the collection sounds bad when played on current equipment.  It just needs to be noted.  As a side note, and to correct another reviewer, the wonderful Gladys Horton does not sing lead on "The Hunter Gets Captured.."  It absolutely is lead-sung by Wanda Young Rogers!   In this collection, all of the Smokey Robinson penned/produced tunes are especially tasty, "The Hunter Gets Captured..." and "Don't Mess With Bill," being the big standouts.  These definitely rank with Motown's finest.  
 I use this for hand-tossed pizzas and it works quite well. It takes about 11 minutes to cook in a grill that has been pre-heated about 15 minutes. The pizza cooks evenly and the crust is perfectly done. My only gripe is that I wish you could get a bigger pan so that one could cook a larger (14-17") pizza. 
 It's pretty impressive to think that a book like "Hiroshima" was written, and appreciated, less than a year after the atomic bomb was dropped.  John Hersey took a bold step in investigating the lives and experiences of those who were on the receiving end of the birth of the Atomic Age.  Interviewing six survivors, Hersey assembled a snapshot of what it was like have an atomic bomb dropped on your city.  Pure luck and circumstances determine if you survive or not.  The color of your clothing means everything.  White clothes reflect the heat, while dark clothing absorbs it.  Even if you survive the initial blast, what you see next might make you wish you hadn't.  But human beings are stubborn creatures, and seem to keep going even in the most hellish circumstances.  I have been to the Hiroshima Peace Park several times, and have seen the human face of the atomic bomb up close and personal.  It is a humbling experience, and one that forever changed my opinions on war as a means of settling disputes.  Hersey's book has a similar impact, being told in such a clinical, observational writing style that you can't help but be moved by the reality of it all.  My one criticism of "Hiroshima" is the cast of characters that Hersey chose to showcase.  For some reason, they seem to be largely Christian, including a German Jesuit priest and a Japanese Methodist minister.   With Christians being such a tiny percentage of the Japanese population, considerably less than 1%, the choice to interview Japanese Christians seems a deliberate one.  Hersey is telling the largely-Christian US readers, "See? They aren't heathen devils.  They are Christians, just like you and me.  That's who we dropped the bomb on. That's who we killed."   This puts in question the journalistic neutrality of the book, and has Hersey in the light of putting across an agenda instead of simpling reporting what was 
 I rented this when it was first released on DVD, and it gets better each time I watch it. The fact that the British actors (Beckinsale and Bale) play Americans and the American actor (Nivola) plays a Brit is cool and they're utterly convinving. All the performances are uniformly excellent, but Frances McDormand...is beyond brilliant. She's so convincing that I showed this to a friend, and not until the end of the film did I tell him this was the same woman who played Marge Gunderson in _Fargo_...needless to say, he was shocked. This woman can do anything. I'd watch her read the phone book. Why isn't she the lead in more movies, "independent" or otherwise 
 This is a must read for all women. Men should also read this book. It was very insightful. I found myself underling and highlighting all through this book and I bought it for pure entertainment. It's an educational tool to make it through life 
 Having first experienced John Adams' 'El nio' a couple of years ago fully staged by Peter Sellars and heard/seen more as a spectacle of video and quasi-choreography with the performers on the stage and the orchestra in the pit, this listener came away humming the visuals of bonfires on the beach with a Latino Holy Family: impressive evening but filler for a seemingly slight musical work. So why buy the CD set? Because I am a strong admirer of John Adams' work and felt I should give it more of a chance than a casual witness to a Christmas spectacle.  Now a few years later and with the CD studied, the next exposure to the work was in concert form and surprisingly 'El nio' works better without the distractions!  The admixture of Spanish, Latin and English texts, using some wondrous poetry, the clarity of the vocal lines as sung to perfection by Upshaw, Hunt Lieberson and White, and above all the chance to really hear the brilliant orchestral details result in an oratorio that begins to work some magic.  Adams creates a universality of message about birth and brotherhood that will help this rather overlong work sustain.  The recording is quite fine and fortunately does not bear the stigmata of Adams' insistence of using mikes for the singers during live performance.  Knowing this is one of his 'traits' forces devotees of his music to accept amplification as an instrument: even in his newest work 'Doctor Atomic' the singers are miked when they are all completely capable of filling a large house with their well-supported voices.  But ah, this is the 21st century and amplification is too much with us everywhere we go.  So one can only shrug and say 'get over it.' It looks like 'El nio' has staying power: give it a chance.  Not Adams' greatest work, but it ages well.  Grady Harp, December 05  
 This isn't my favorite genre, though for some reason I've found myself reading a lot of spy books of late. McCarry does smashing by comparison- I liked him much more than Ludlum, for example, and found his writing flowed so well at times it seemed musical. He did a good job of coming up with a plot that was plenty exotic without making you roll your eyes. A former CIA man, Horace, gets a bunch of his retired CIA guys to try and find out if his cousin is still alive, and if he has a mysterious scroll with him. The characters are likeable and interesting and even a little multi-dimensional. The dialogue is believable and well written, and everything proceeds nicely to a valid conclusion. I'd give it 4.5 stars, only missing 5 because the theology, albeit vicarious theology, was a bit cockeyed. A very good read 
 A very good comedy, one that had me laughing throughout and actually holding my sides because the jokes kept coming so fast 
 Dr. Daniel Baxter's chronicle of his daily routine as a physician in an AIDS ward at Saint Clare's Hospital in New York City, one of the poorest broken down and inadequate facilities truly serving the "dregs of  humanity" is one of the richest, most spiritual and compelling books I  have read in recent years. I finished this book and have kept it in my mind  in many weeks going over the truly profound truths and challenges Baxter  presents in his own story. The Least of My Brethren is a multifaceted,  complex chronicle that teaches far more than the most readers expect as  they begin any new non-fiction book. I was captivated by The Least of My  Brethren from the very start; awed by Baxter's ability to present an entire  range of issues, at times separately and yet, all at once in other  instances -- from the seemingly simple and unimportant  issue of how to get  a room cleaned up or a light bulb changed in a hospital with only the  leanest of support services, and in the next breath, to be speaking quite  articulately on issues such as AIDS, poverty, the tragedy and loneliness of  human beings who have no one left in life who have not abandoned them, to  the entire spectrum of human sexuality, to questions of philosophy of life  and the meaning of death and back again to the more mundane insignificance  of individuals, almost all terminally ill, breaking rules on smoking in  hospitals and in public places. Baxter presents a story that is as much  philosophy as it is medical science; as much sociology as it is gender  studies, as much psychology as it is political science. As one individual  reader, above everything else, Daniel Baxter's story was a moving, yet at  times, an inadvertently hysterically funny portrait of how little the  latest buildings and equipment really mean to medicine in comparison to the  need for a much rarer and seemingly more easily attainable achievement, the  enlistment of truly caring human beings. When Baxter speaks of caring  people, he is not referring to those who show their care by donations to  charity or participation in clothing drives for the poor -- but "down  and dirty" caring in the midst of stink, the odor of death and the  scarcity of hope! This, one can conclude in reading Baxter's chronicle, is  a truly rare and precious giver of life -- not easily found. In some ways I  was shocked that truly caring human beings  are a preciously rare  commodity, yet the more I thought about the issue, I was able to  acknowledge how few people there are who are willing to transcend  themselves and give to others unconditionally -- while at the same time  having the courage to face the demon of hopeless straight in the eye and  prevail with hope. What Baxter brought squarely home to me were many  personal questions and issues I have need to address in my own life.  Whether it was Baxter indirectly asking me how much I appreciate the life I  have, for whatever time it is given to me, to his ability to bring me to  the realization that I have only marginally and clinically considered my  own mortality. Baxter keeps going with questions and challenges on the  importance of doing meaningful work in our lives to challenging me to  examine my own willingness to place myself in the midst of dirt and filth  and to be unaffected by it because the other person, far more needy than I,  needs my help in the midst of that personally discomforting squalor.  Finally, Daniel Baxter offers -- not by preaching -- but by his own  personal example, the very real and comprehensible answer as to why our  human behavior is so often paradoxical: that in order to conquer our fear,  in order to gain anything worthwhile, in order to truly transcend ourselves  for the good of others, we must become fearless, courageous, spirit-filled  and hopeful persons ourselves. And, how do we get to such a place? The  answer so obvious that we all actually know it, kept very close to our  human consciousness, but often within far enough a safety zone that we do  not have to necessarily respond: that is, in order to become stronger and  better persons, we must face down, touch and truly look, often for the very  first time, at what we find ourselves most afraid. In so doing, we become  stronger, more courageous and grace-filled persons. Indeed there seems to  be truth to the adage that what doesn't kill us, makes us stronger; for  it is proven out in the daily lives of many committed persons like Daniel  Baxter, Sister Pascal or the drag queens in ...Brethren, who come to  minister their sick friend up by decorating his room and applying his  make-up and dressing him in all his finery, in order to help him feel more  hopeful and comfortable. I finished Baxters book more fully understanding  myself,  my  own strengths, fears and weaknesses and biases. In addition, I  came away with new role models to help me to at least try to make some  changes for myself and to better understand the meaning of truly caring for  all with whom my path crosses in the course of this mysterious journey we  call life.A singular and outstanding read which should deserves much  attention 
 This is a great product and price is fair.  It has everything I wanted: 5 disc changer, sleep, clock, timer (so you can use it as an alarm clock) and more.  One thing that came as a surprise is the Eco-Power feature. So it's also good for the environment.  I recommend

 Being a good example is the best way to parent that is what this book is about 
 Noting other reviewers here, I was surprised that many did not find this an engaging read. Confession time - my preferred method is audiobook, preferably while cooking- and on audio, this is an amazing journey. Retrospectively, Gorky Park (1993) was a bit too heavy on the KGB angle for me. Further, William Hurt's leaden transmission of the character on film, Joanna Pecula's implausibility and constrained acting coupled with attendant excess publicity and overselling made the whole mess horribly repellent. Further, at the time the movie aired, such a bleak portrayal of the grey Soviet state was no longer in keeping with current events-it was instantly dated. Havana Bay (1999) is more in keeping with Wolves Eat Dogs in terms of style, detail and background on Cuba, and the emotional resonance- and as such, it was a marvelous find on audio, wooing me back to Cruz Smith.  By way of comparison, a word on Polar Star, since some here seem to find it engaging- that book's plot is stark and unpopulated- easily divined and far less intricate. Those who can handle the complexity of a master story teller, read on. In Wolves Eat Dogs, Smith tangles together multiple threads of plot in a fascinating weave; the post-Chernobyl landscape is vivid and offers a near sci-fi experience wrapped inside a great detective story wrapped inside an adventure travel yarn. Where else can do you get all that, bundled along with sidelights of the Russian mafia, Perestroika excesses, homeless waifs- and Cruz Smith makes it all work.  I'm all for Renko's  lack of emotional affect-have readers forgotten that he is a widower, sucked dry by the pain of his wife's senseless death? Besides, all experienced (good) investigators are emotionally remote. For those paying attention, Renko's pathos and omnipresent sense of humanity surface in an inferential way. His all-too perceptive questions and intuitive grasp of other characters betrays an emotional sensibility that is entirely tuned in. I liken his character to Ian Rankin's Inspector Rebus, another fav of mine. Don't pass this one up if you can handle it 
 Having spent time negotiating sports sponsorship contracts, I have a new found love for negotiating.  In reading this book, the authors have laid out a clear and concise program in which to begin, work through and close negotiatings.  A great book for beginners and a good brush up for intermediates and pros 
 This book is difficult - not in an academic sense - but emotionally and intellectually.  While Jensen's prose style is immensely readable, the substance of Language Older Than Words is challenging stuff!  It becomes necessary for the reader to abandon judgement and trust in Jensen's sincerity if she hopes to wrap her mind around what are oftentimes strange concepts and horrifying experiences.  I found it impossible to read this work without stopping every other page to evaluate the world and my own life and compare that experience with the world Jensen describes.  What I found is  that Jensen, when he is not wandering away in emotional diatribe, is dead-on.  
 The Mysteries of Harris Burdick is one of my favorite titles for teaching creative writing! My students cannot put this book aside. It's a must-read! 
 this book started off intense and full of political emotion and it never backed down.  if you would like a real and emotional story of who workers are, the opression they face, and the breaking point for them, then i  suggest this book.  i remember being outraged, shocked, disgusted  throughout the book.....and then the ending...well it's full of sweet  vengenace.  real people, real life, real solutions....that's what this book  is about 
 Yes, this is a compilation album (a collection of tracks from different albums rather than one issued complete by the artist), but who cares.  This is a collection of fine Christmas tunes by great artists from the era of the big bands, jazz, and swing.  Besides, anytime you can hear Louis Armstrong make music is a time to be happy and that seems particularly appropriate to the Christmas season.  On this album, the tracks given to Mr. Armstrong are "Christmas in New Orleans", "White Christmas", "Christmas Night in Harlem", "Cool Yule" (particularly fun!), "'Zat You, Santa Claus" (yes, the tune covered by Buster Poindexter), and "Winter Wonderland.  You also get to hear a young Mel Torme in a live performance of his now standard "The Christmas Song" (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire).  Particularly worthwhile.  And we get Christmas songs by Dinah Washington, Peggy Lee, Eartha Kitt, and Lena Horne.  The other friends are tracks by Lionel Hampton, Duke Ellington (a rousing big band instrumental of Jingle Bells), and Louis Jordan.  This is a great album to have filling your house over the Christmas Season 
 This book is so beautiful and touching, it brings tears to our eyes.  We have been reading it to our son since he was 1 1/2 years of age and he has greatly enjoyed it.  Its illustrations, rhythm, 'repetion' and strong  message make it ideal reading for children and adults of all ages 
 While this wasn't the first book written in the series it is officially the first book and tells you how Narnia began, how the lamp post in the Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe got there in the first place and background on the witch as well.   Digory (I agree with Polly, this IS a funny name!) and his neighbour Polly stumble into Digory's Uncle Andrew's study quite by accident one wet afternoon while trying to explore their row of houses via the attics. Uncle Andrew is a scary figure and frightens them, especially when Polly puts on a beautiful ring he gives her and vanishes into thin air!   Digory goes to get her but they unwittingly return with the witch, who wreaks havoc in their world before they are able to get her back again.   They go to Narnia, which hasn't yet begun but while there Aslan the lion creates Narnia. This really is just the beginning, the book is an important part of the series and I enjoyed reading it.   Highly recommended. 
 I REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK. SHE TELLS US ALOT ABOUT HOW SHE GREW UP AND ABOUT HER FAMILY. SHE MAKES ME REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW SHE NEEDED THE ATTENTION OF PLAYBOY AND THE FATHER FIGURE IN HEF. SHE TALKS HUMBLY ABOUT HERSELF AND REMAINED CONSISTENT ABOUT HER BELIEFS THROUGHOUT THE BOOK. SHE OPENLY TALKS ABOUT WHAT COSMETIC PROCEDURES SHE HAD DONE AND SHE TELLS ABOUT ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE ALWAYS WONDERED ABOUT AT THE PLAYBOY MANSION...DOES HEF REALLY SLEEP WITH ALL THE GIRLS?...DO THEY GET PAID?...HOW MANY HAVE PLASTIC SURGERY?...SECRET BOYFRIENDS ON THE SIDE?...HOW MANY HAVE EATING DISORDERS?...ALL THE CATFIGHTS...WHAT REALLY GOES ON AT THE PARTIES? ...ETC. SHE SEEMS VERY GENUINE AND EDUCATED AND DOES NOT COMPROMISE WHO SHE IS TO PLEASE ANYONE. I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT HEF LIKED ABOUT HER. I'M SURE THE "GIRLS NEXT DOOR" WERE NOT EXACTLY THRILLED WITH ALL THE DETAILS AND PORTRAILS SHE GAVE OF THEM, BUT YOU'VE GET TO GIVE HER CREDIT-SHE CALLED IT LIKE SHE SAW IT. I THINK EVEN HEF WOULD RESPECT THAT, AS DO I 
 I saw this movie simply because I've been a big fan of Tom Waits (who plays Jack in the movie)for a few years now, and I finally had to see this. What kept me from seeing this is it is extremely expensive, but I finally forket out the money. Tom Waits, Robert Lurie, and Roberto have great chemistry, and the movie is shot in New Orleans in black and white. That's all you need to know to buy this movie. 
 I'm still looking through this book but I mainly like the styles to play with. (I didn't have to pay for this book, it was given to me but I don't normally buy these "instant effects" things....I have to know how an effect is created and why)  In my opinion, this is a "fun" type of book to have especially if you want to get right to doing fun/cool things without having to do any hardcore thinking...it's for those who don't really need to know "how"...just that they "can".  It's fun = 
 Great read... more of text book and history than a how to but is very good info to help in dealing with people and making friends and possible relationships.  Excellent selle 
 Good basic set of inexpensive filters.  Nice case.  Great for a beginner/starting set.  If you're willing to spend more money on filters, getting B+W or Hoya will suit you better.  
 This book requires a lot of thought and produces a lot of revelations about today's generation of Church-goers.  An interesting read to say the least, even if you do not agree with everything, you must respect Smith's opinions.  Smith married my wife & I, so I picked this book up just for that reason, and am glad I did, because it was a great read.  
 Volume One of _The Life of Mammals_, hosted by David Attenborough, contained the first three episodes of this truly excellent BBC series.    	_A Winning Design_ opened with a general overview of the series, a beautiful montage of the rich variety of mammals that are present in the world and that will be covered later. Also in the general opening segment was Attenborough on location in the frozen Arctic observing an Arctic fox at work. This was the first of many such segments of Attenborough on location with the animals he discussed in the series, generally not too obtrusive as he discussed at a distance various animals, not picking them up or handling them as they often do in other series.   	The bulk of _A Winning Design_ focused on the monotremes (egg-laying mammals) and the marsupials, featuring beautiful, high quality footage of a variety of animals, always filmed in their natural habitat. Several minutes were spent on the echidna as well as on the platypus, with wonderful film of it hunting for prey underwater. The viewer is also treated to footage of life inside the platypus's burrow and of its young.  	After a segment on some of the fossil life of Australia (focusing on the Riversleigh fauna and using CGI), the viewer is treated to a variety of marsupials. One sees a kangaroo giving birth, koalas, wombats (shown foraging in the snow in the mountains of Australia), numbats (with astonishingly long tongues), pygmy opossums, and striped possums. Then one sees more footage of kangaroos, of red kangaroos in the desert, rock wallabies, and gray kangaroos in the grassland. The show then switched focus to South America, home to the yapok or water opossum, shown with a special camera foraging in the complete darkness of its riverside home. It is the only aquatic marsupial in the world, though most South American marsupials are arboreal (such as the woolly opossum, which was shown) and in some areas are the most abundant treetop mammal in South America.  	This episode closed with some notes on what are placental mammals, what makes them different from marsupials, and notes that most of the mammals in the world are placental.  	_Insect Hunters_ as one might guess dealt with those animals who consume insects. Attenborough in the opening segment noted that the first mammals to evolve, back in the time of the dinosaurs, were likely insect eaters. He spent several moments discussing the demands of such a lifestyle, noting the high metabolic requirements of such animals as the shrew, which is shown foraging, fighting over territory, and in some truly remarkable footage a female leading her young out for food, one youngster holding on to her fur at her backside with his teeth, the next one doing the same, and so forth, looking like a big furry train snaking its way through the forest floor litter.   	Next one sees the water shrew, the golden mole (which swims through the sand of the Namib desert), the star-nosed mole, and the elephant shrew, a remarkable animal that darts along cleared out trails at high speed, a fastidious animal that cannot afford to trip over unwanted debris in it is little roads. Next animals shown are the hedgehog (in Attenborough's own London garden, filmed while mating), the armadillo, the pangolin (which I was surprised to learn is essentially a biped, its front clawed feet useless for walking), and the giant anteater, an animal due to its not very nutritious diet sleeps 15 hours a day to conserve energy, covered by its great bushy tail.   	After a segment on the 50 million year old Messel fauna of Germany, which included fossils of a tree anteater, a pangolin, and a bat, Attenborough used that as a segue way into the rest of the program, which focused on bats. Many aspects of bat biology were discussed, including hibernation (with some excellent thermal imaging of bats at rest and stirring in a cave in Canada) and echolocation (with coverage of the continual conflict between insects and bats in the night skies, with countermeasures and counter-countermeasures). I liked the radar imagery of the massive clouds of bats rising into the night from Carlsbad Cavern, looking like storm front as they rose. The last segment was on a bat species in New Zealand, one that forages on the forest floor like its shrew-like ancestors, hunting in squabbling packs as they tackled giant flightless crickets and other prey.  	_Plant Predators_ dealt with herbivores, animals that preyed upon plants. Attenborough stressed that plants are hardly defenseless, as many of them are barely edible, low in nutrition, posses sharp spines, and can be quite poisonous. Just because they don't move doesn't make them easy prey.   	After a brief segment on the African elephant, the show covered the sloth, the tapir (shown with nighttime cameras eating clay alongside a river to combat the poisons from the leaves it ingested), and the pika, a mammal that basically creates hay to feed on in the long winter months. Next elephants are revisited, which along with other mammals are shown going underground in pitch darkness to eat salt-laden soil in a cave in Africa.   	As one might expect much of the show focused on Africa. After showing how ruminants function, ones learns about animal migrations (both African and caribou migrations in North America), and the hierarchy of predators on acacia trees, with different animals feeding at different levels, ranging from tiny antelope feeding on the lowest branches to giraffes and elephants (the latter shown knocking down whole trees). Much attention is spent on mating rituals and the varieties, styles, and uses of horns and antlers. There was truly amazing footage of males battling it out as well as herbivores avoiding beaten eaten. The nimbleness of antelope being chased was astounding, though equally surprising was the downside of not having good forward vision (one antelope was shown that ran into a tree while being pursued).   	An excellent natural history program, very worthwhile.  
 If you are enthusiastic about inline skating, you probably want to read everything about it you can get your hands on.  I have read 3 or 4 books so far.  I have learned at least something good-to-know from each one -- this one included.  It's cheap enough -- order it and read it 
 This is a great clipper for small jobs.  We have a dog that has really heavy and thick hair.  The clipper had to work fairly hard to cut the hair.  Wahl makes a heavier duty one that may have served our purpose better.  Overall it is an O.K. product 
 It is simple to use even without an instruction manual. But who needs more paper to store 
 I think this is one of the best novels ever written. People who say Algren romanticizes the poor have clearly not read the book properly, all he does is say they are human just as you. But describing them as low-lifes like some reviewers did, just shows that Algren's message did not come across. This book is about love for humanity. And that is ALL humanity, not just the part that's nicely educated and has a good job and doesn't rob you at night. One reviewer said that Frankie Machine should of just quit taking drugs and sought himself a nice job and everything would of turned out fine. How? Would Frankie be loved then, would his crippled wife be able to walk, would there be no loneliness and desperation. would it stop raining? Would it stop the El from going round and round? I'm sick and tired of people romanticizin' the rich 
 Gladiator may be the best middle eastern score ever written. The Duduk was incredible!   The first CD was amazing as well, however, I believe this disc to have a few advantages.  First of all, "The Gladiator Waltz." This song TOTALLY improves upon "The Battle" from disc 1. The original stopped way before the new track. The synth sounds are very good, and don't take away from the beauty at all!  Another highlight is "Homecoming" this is a sad, angry song that will have your blood pumping. If you've seen the movie, you remember the scene where Maximus escapes execution, and rides home like a mad man, only to find his wife and son Crucified. A truly angry and intense song.  "Secrets" is a sneaky evil track, portraying the violent insanity of Commodus.  I have mentioned the highlights, but all the rest are great too! A must have CD, even if you own the first 
 This is, as far as I'm concerned, one of the best contemporary romances ever written.  The heroine isn't a flake like most of Krentz's heroines, but is smart and very feisty.  The hero, Nick, is what's special, though:   Instead of her usual man of mystery or engineer with frozen emotions,  Krentz has created a vibrant hero who's loving, humorous, and strong but  not pushy; he's a masterpiece, and the tenderness of the relationship  between him and the heroine, Philadelphia, is deeply moving.  Among my  all-time favorites 
 I am the author of two books, "Collecting Fluorescent Minerals" and "The World of Fluorescent Minerals" and needed additional resources for non-fluorescent minerals. This book was nicely done - good illustrations, lots of variety, clearly written - but the information covering fluorescent minerals in this book was not very accurate. Every mineral collector needs several sources to get a good idea of what he or she has and this is one that I will continue to use. This should not be your only book, but it is worth having among your library. 
 The true-life tale of Christy Browne, the Irish playwrite and artist portrayed by the impeccable Daniel Day-Lewis. Day-Lewis' portrayal of the artist afflicted with Cerebal-palsy is truely astounding and must go down as one of the best acting performances ever. Both Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker (long-suffering mother), deserved their oscars on this one. Jim Sheridan (director) has done a magical job in bringing this movie to life. Heart-Breaking, uplifting tale of surviving and conquering against the odds. A Definite must-see movie 
 My wife and I have owned the Smooth (Keys Fitness) 5.15 Treadmill for over 2 years.  We have not owned another treadmill, but before committing to this one, we tested many other brands in this price range.  The Smooth brand is definitely the smoothest ride you can get without paying significantly more.  Each of us runs about 2-5 miles daily, and when maintained as prescribed in the owners' manual (occasional lubrication and belt realignment), the 5.15 handles it easily.  The ride is very comfortable, compared to other treadmills and running outdoors), and we have no doubt that this treadmill would handle more vigorous running with ease.  We have had a few problems with the 5.15.  Within the first year, some of the soft-touch buttons on the control panel stopped working, and the circuit board had to be replaced twice.  This involved working with about 25 screws each time.  Then, about a year later, the arm-mounted toggle switches stopped working.  These are small auxilliary switches for incline and speed levels, so they weren't vital.  They were easy to replace without tools.    Then, at about two years, the belt tore slightly at the seam, along one edge.  The treadmill was still usable, but the loose piece of belt smacked against the plastic housing loudly on each revolution.  This wasn't terribly difficult to replace, but it certainly wasn't fun, requiring disassembly of the entire platform.  Service Notes:  Outside of the 'parts and labor' warranty period, when only parts are covered, customers pay for shipping the parts to and from Keys Fitness.  Most Keys' service technicians are knowledgeable, and are perfectly willing to guide you through a long repair process, providing frank and helpful advice along the way.  Today, the 5.15 still works as it did when it was new, over two years ago.  Nothing else has been diminished, and nothing else has shown wear.  When things have gone wrong, Keys has provided us with good customer service.  Overall, we're happy with our experience, and we'll probably buy a Smooth treadmill next time. 
 If you enjoyed the first novel in the series, "The Rising," then "City of the Dead" becomes a manadatory read of sorts for those interested in seeing how Brian Keene fleshes out the character developments of his protagonists and how he brings his epic, savage, post-apocalpytic Zombie saga to a close.  Needless to say, this book is every bit as gory and fast-paced as the first although not quite up to par in terms of overall story-arc.  Very much recommended for fans of the genre and especially those who enjoyed the first book in the series.  
 It's simply unbelievable to think that the years 1973 and 1974, years after the progress of the civil rights movement, saw Hank Aaron come under fire of severe racial hatred and prejudice. His crime? He went after the "sacred" all-time home run record of Babe Ruth. Death threats, tinged with racial slurs, to himself and his family followed him as he slowly approached home run number 715. Some ugly undercurrents of American society simultaneously emerged.  This book recounts Aaron's journey from an underrated baseball star of the 1950s and 1960s to an undisputed baseball legend. It even harkens back to Babe Ruth's days of fast and reckless living as he slammed 714 home runs throughout the 1920s and 1930s. This record was thought by many to be completely untouchable (and termed "The Mountain"). So who was this Henry "Hank" Aaron, a not so celebrated but extremely well-rounded player, from the Braves to suddenly come out of almost nowhere to challenge the sport's demi-god? People finally began to notice as Aaron snuck up on the all-time record. By the time he reached number 700 a country-wide media craze exploded. Aaron found himself caught in the middle complete with body guards, a private secretary, appearances on television shows, magazines, hordes of fan mail, and, most significantly, horrific hate mail. Even Babe Ruth's widow didn't seem too enthusiastic about Aaron's increasing home run numbers. Even more unbeliveable, the baseball commissioner at the time, Bowie Kuhn, didn't personally congratulate Aaron on #700. And on top of that, the book even records that, as Aaron went for the big record, Atlanta fans showed up in increasingly smaller numbers to home games. But eventually they redeemed themselves. And we all know how the story ends, but this book provides many details for those of us who weren't, or couldn't be, there.  This book will interest not only baseball fans, but fans of popular culture in general. After all, Aaron's record represents one of the biggest pop culture events of the past 40 years (which has resurfaced with Barry Bonds). The ugly underneath and Aaron's eventual triumph in the face of this adversity will inspire anyone.  This book represents one of those great sports books that goes beyond sports to show its impact on society in general. By his perserverance, Hank Aaron opened roads for many people in popular culture. This fact has gone underappreciated for too long. And this book attempts to fill this gap by showcasing the accomplishments of Hank Aaron that will likely outlast even his incredible baseball records 
 Karger reveals what he accurately terms the "fringe economy". Something possibly unknown to those safely enscounced in the American middle class. This fringe is inhabited by working class people, which might have experienced a bout of bad luck. This can come in the form of losing a job, or having a very low paying one. Or perhaps a chronic illness, that severely restricts what types of jobs one can get.  Within the fringe economy, the book shows a range of companies that might be accurately described as predatory. Offering short term payroll loans that amount to over 100% interest on an annualised basis. Or for those unable to buy furniture, these are made available on a rental basis. Again, typically at an annual rate of over 100%. Such techniques might perhaps be aimed at those who exhibit poor personal money management. The deservedly imprudent, if you will. But the techniques also take aim at those who carefully count every dollar, and who do not squander what little they have 
 This is a wonderful book that goes strictly out of the Bible on how we are supposed to eat!  I would highly recommend this book to anyone!! 
 C.S. Lewis tells us that reading is a pleasure and it is good, and then he suggests why. He even goes so far as claim this "good" is, in itself, a hedonistic value. Then he dissects that value by telling us that it does not have to be logical or what we may believe to be true, to be good.   In the first chapter he compares buying a book to someone who buys a picture. One person might buy the picture to cover a bare spot on the wall and then after a week or two the pictures become mostly invisible to them. Another person would buy a picture, live with it, and actually feed off of it, for years. The book helps to understand what it might mean to "feed off" of what the book said. He suggests that to do this with your reading allows you to become what you had not been before. He likens this condition to a Greek poem saying, "I see with a myriad of eyes, but it is still I who see".  The book has eleven chapters and an epilogue. Many of these chapters deal with the types of things men read and then in the final chapter the question of judging literary tastes by the type of books read is discussed. The approach is normally to judge by what a person reads. This is reversed.  We are asked to judge literature by the "way" men read it.   If it is how we read rather than what we read, then we are free to really become, as he suggests, "a thousand men and yet remain myself".  Rather than pushing a point of view, something it could be assumed that a Christian writer would do, this book pushes the idea of real agency of reading choice. He then shows how pleasurable the experience can be.    
 This book is an excellent survey of the Old Testament.  Baylis traces each book of the Old Testament in its own theological development of how Jesus is to be the coming Messiah.        I highly recommend From The Cross To Creation for college students looking to understand the Old Testament because Baylis' writing style is smooth and easy to read.  I also recommend this book to seminary students as a scholarly work because Baylis' footnotes are extensive and provides for wide-ranging supplemental research.        As such this book makes a wonderful Bible study.  I have used Baylis' work in such a fashion with a college group and his insights were well received.  I believe this book is worthy of a five star rating 
 Needing to replace my really ancient Visioneer scanner for importing 35mm slides and negatives into CS2 at a higher quality, I settled on the buying either the Canon 8600F or the 4400F.  As I see it, the 8600F is an industrial-strength version of the lightweight 4400F, but costs about $70 more.  The 8600 is somewhat bigger and weighs 50% more than the 4400F, but otherwise they're pretty much identical in capabilities and operation.  In fact, Canon's website shows identical sales blurb for both the 4400F and the 8600F.  The supplied software (CanoScan Toolbox, ArcSoft PhotoStudio, NewSoft Presto PageManager,  ScanSoft OmniPage SE) are identical for both the 4400F & the 8600F.  The PS Elements 5.0 included with the 8600F was not important since I use CS2.   The only unknown is what exactly is the difference between the 8600F's "built-in FARE Level 3 retouching technology" and the 4400F's "built-in retouching technology."  I suspect it's nearly the same.   So I bought the 4400F from Amazon (best price).  Installation was a snap and the first scan came out as expected.  A bit slow, but all decent resolution scans are slow regardless of who makes the scanner unless you want to spend big bucks.  The only negative is the lack of a power button on the 4400F (if you're like me, you'll always forget to pull the plug when you've finished scanning).  Although it'd be easy to put a switch on the power cord, the switch would have to be located near the plug socket, so a switch really wouldn't be all that much helpful.  The net of all of this is that if you plan to do some really heavy-duty scanning and also would like to utilize Photoshop Elements 5.0 for image enhancing, go with the 8600F.  Otherwise, use the 4400F.   My crude comparison of Canon's 8600F and the 4400F:  -----------------------------8600F---------4400F Weight:--------------------	9.3 pounds---6.2 pounds Height:---------------------	4.9 inches---3.3 inches Width:---------------------	11.3 inches--10.2 inches Depth:---------------------	18.6 inches--18.7 inches On/off button-------------	yes------------no  Photoshop Elements 5.0-	yes------------no ($43 @Vio) Built-in FARE Level 3-----	yes-------------?      retouching technology Cost:----------------------	$160--------- $92 
 I own a number of christian rock cds but this one really is the best. I only got into christian rock because of kutless "sea of faces" cd, and after listening to that I bought this one too. Since then I've bought a number of other group's cds but I always come back to this one. All kutless cds are great, but if you like christian rock you will love this cd. It just shouldn't be passed up. This cd is amazing 
 This is a novel to read and re-read. Yes, it requires a dedicated reader and I wouldn't call it a light read or a lightning read. Emotional, sad, gripping, all the things a great novel should be. The alternating timelines, fluidness and povs work here. It is hard to imagine why this novel wasn't rated unanimous 5 stars. Oh well. Every review seems to talk about Virginia Woolf, and I suppose that makes sense, but this is Cunningham and he's his own voice, a wondrous prose-master. The weaving of three disparate character stories into one is enchanting. More important, this is a novel you'll never forget. It will haunt you. Even the simple, disturbing burial of the bird. I have no idea as to the accuracy of the "historical" throughline focused on Virginia Woolf, but it doesn't matter because it feels dead-on real. I believed it. From my readings of Woolf, it felt like this was her. This is, perhaps, my favorite book read in the last year. 
 I absolutely recommend this book to all readers.  Walter Dean Myers does a fabulous job in showing Jimmy's varied perspectives towards his father.  This was a well-written, realistic fiction book that had a perfect mix of action and emotion.  This book had plenty of surprises, too.  One example is when the police caught Crab and Jimmy.  As I was reading this book, I couldn't wait to discover the content of the following page, due to the fact that Jimmy and Crab are always looking over their shoulder for a dangerous finish.  For all of those who enjoy an exciting quick-read, this book is for you 
 This book is a wonderful introduction to great poems.  Each page has a vivid photograph of an object depicted in the poem on the facing page.  Below the photo are two questions to provoke discussion.  Very young children like my daughter will like to turn the pages and look at the pictures, and you may only be able to say what the object is.  However, as the attention span gets longer you'll be able to read the poems to your child more often, and eventually you can even discuss the questions.  We are really enjoying this book 
 THE PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN is a bit of a dichotomy. It starts off extremely humorous with a base in some form of reality. However, as the film progresses its drifts into the world of the surreal. This film does contain some extremely good scenes but it almost comes off as a very strange dream. Herbert  Lom really comes into his own in this film. He is outrageously funny and steals this film. Mancini's theme and score is once again on target and extremely innovative. This is a fun outing in all. 
 The only word that comes to mind: AWESOME!!  Especially CD 2...Not only is he the best DJ live, he puts out the best CDs too....buy it!!!  Dont burn it!  This guy deserves the support! Thanks again Abel for some awesome tribal beats 
 This book was very helpful to me. I am a professional animator and storyboard/layout artist, even though I have a very good grasp of drawing, this book helped me improve my composition(balance, contrast, flow, etc) and cinematography skills. The illustrations are from great old time classics like Battleship Potemkin (which is frequently used as examples in top film schools across the world) and an numerous other examples. The simplicity of some of the drawings illustrates how you don't have to be the best artist to draw a good storyboard, other drawings show how you can do pretty psimple but photorealistic renderings in a few minutes. Although this is not the all in one stop for storyboarding, it is a must have for aspiring storyboard artists. The one thing that could use improvement is the discussion on perspective drawing, but this book helped me improve so much that I still give it 5 stars. Note: This is not a how to draw book, If you have a solid foundation in drawing, you will benefit more from this and similar books 
 One of the most helpful books I have ever used when battling with making the graphs look just the way I need them. It's amazing what you can do with the help of John's expertise 
 The book was shipped out the day after I purchased it.  It took a few days to arrive and was in perfect condition.  I will definitely buy from this seller again 
 Every mother will recognice all the feelings, if not the actual incidents, described in this book.  We've all had them, but only Ms Newman had the skill and wit to write them all down, validate our collective hysteria in those early years, and make us roar with laughter at it all.  There are twenty years of this madness ahead of her and I'm looking forward to reading about it (hopefully!) in her future writing 
 VERY ENJOYABLE AND THOUGHT PROVOKING 
 Great variety of fast and easy recipes. Delicious for vegetarians and anyone who is interested in some new recipe ideas 
 I started genealogy research for our family this summer.  Our ancestors hail from the Hammond and West Hammond areas featured in the book.  The author does far more than merely focusing on the housing designs.  He provides an interesting look back at the social, political, and economical climate the immigrants / early settlers lived in.  The Notes section is packed with references and has proved to be invaluable as I continue my family history and local history research.  I can only hope the author chooses to pick up where this book left off 
 Mostly laid back music - but very talented musicians.  Unreal versions of H.O.G / Oldman / Needle - plus great bonus info - if you are a N.Y. fan, then buy it. t 
 I read "Bloodline of the Holy Grail" and found familiar family names published in the geneology charts. That awakened a deep curiosity that led to a lifelong quest for the truth about my own heritage, and this changed my life forever. My journey led me to Kashmir to do an in-depth study of "Jesus in India." Now, having read "The Magdalene Legacy" I still want to know more. Mr. Gardner is a powerful writer who does extensive research, and his books will alter many more lives well into the future. Few books can have such powerful impact on history and on changing lives. His may be the books that actually change yours too. What greater testament to an author's impact than this? 
 oh yeah, these guys rock, man. funk legends. every other song is a ballad, but we don't mind that because after the intense FUNK of the funky ones, we need a break. buy it buy it buy it. clear enough for you? Tracks 1, 3, 5,  6, and 8 are my five favourite songs in the world ever ever ever. there you  go 
 I bought the three Wolfgang's Books, Now you're talking! the General Class and the Extra Class License Manuals, I took my Techenician and Morse code Exams in October, 2002 and I had a Perfect score, and on the 15th of December 2002 I took both the General as well as the Extra and in both exams I had a Perfect score 100%. I think the results speak for themselves! 
 Lehane is a master of his genre and this offering is one of his best.  The story moves with riptide speed, and each page brings new surprises and plot twists.  Lehane is good because he goes the extra mile to spin for his readers a yarn that keeps them reading and doesn't insult their intelligence -- at least most of the time.  Bubba, for example, is a caricature and totally unbelieveable but what the heck, Lehane couldn't resolve some of the plot situations without a guy like Bubba.  A plot so rich and full could easily spin out of control but Lehane is a journeyman and keeps things focused.  That's why I like him and intend to read all his books 
 This book really stayed with me long after reading it (during a trip to Hawaii). It represents the "real" people of Hawaii (in this case, on the island of Molokai) who live on the financial brink but have their own rich resources -- of family, friendship and culture -- to make it through. Although I hated this book at the beginning -- such terrible things happen to these kids -- it's worth sticking with it for the beautiful moments that come later in the story. P.S. I loved the island "pidgin" language the story is told in, and it resonated as we traveled around Hawaii and met people 
 Like many of Hauerwas's other collections of essays, this one boasts a wide variety of themes and topic, al of which are imporant for the church to consider as we go about attempting to find out what it means to live as God's people.  Readers of Hauerwas are certain to find this book essential to understanding many of his oft-misunderstood positions on critical issues, particularly the issue of sectarianism.    The forword to this book is an extended reply to James Gustafson's clumsy accusation of sectarianism against Hauerwas and other postliberal thinkers.  Hauerwas deftly counters and, in my opinion shatters Gustafson's liberal bumblings and shows how his ecclesial position does not require the church to withdraw from the world, but rather to learn that the church serves the world best when it strives to fully be the church - living in light of God's peacable kingdom.  There are other important gems in this book, particularly the essay, "The Church as God's New Language."  This is a very important and fascinating essay by Hauerwas on the nature of the church and narrative theology.  Otehr essays of note include "A Christian Critique of Christian America" and "On Taking Time for Peace: The Ethical Significance of the Trivial."  Like his other collections, this books is a great resource for those who care about the church and its faithfulness.  It will be of great use to students, pastors and laypersons 
 Mark Hitchcock has flown under the radar as today's foremost authority on Bible prophecy.  He does'nt predict the future or name dates, he just compares what the Bible says to what is happening today and everyday.  This reveals some startling information for the scholarly as well as the layman 
 Despite having been written in the mid 20th century, this book is even more important today than when it was published. Every politician in the country should have to memorize the first chapter, as it explains the basic problems with almost every piece of legislation passed in the last 100 years 
 Good read for anyone who is thinking about sailing offshore or life on the seven seas.  Balanced, witty and well written 
 Tired of chasing mammom and the treats of this world that won't survive your death?  Malcolm Muggeridge gives an outstanding review of the daily life of Mother Teresa and the sisters who serve in the Missionaries of  Charity and why they are such peaceful and joyful women.  Mother Teresa and  her work are a fresh breeze in a world that is increasingly populated at  all levels with naval-gazers.  She makes it clear that you don't turn  inward and find ways to indulge yourself in ever increasing amounts but, to  be truly happy, you must serve others.  Why should you do this?

 Richard Widmark plays cerebral and hypochondriacal Alec Stiles, boss of a crime syndicate in metropolitan Centre City.  Stiles, an up and comer in the world of crime has orchestrated two capers that have resulted in two deaths using the same pistol as the murder weapon.  FBI investigator George Briggs played by a no nonsense Lloyd Nolan, recruits agent Gene Cordell played by Mark Stevens to infiltrate Widmark's gang.  Stevens eventually gains Widmark's confidence and becomes a member of the gang.  He soon learns that Widmark has a stoolie in the local police who is able to access FBI reports making life dangerous for Stevens.  Director William Keighley in dramatic documentary style proceeds to chronicle the effort put forth by the FBI and local law enforcement to prosecute Widmark and his ruthless gang.  Of course we learn that crime doesn't pa 
 As I sit here going on my 10th hour of work (more accurately, I'm waiting for some people to perform their jobs so I can finish mine), I'm wondering why I don't just keep my copy of this book in my desk.  The Onion's acerbic wit and sarcastic humor never fail to raise a fit of laughter out of me, and to have several hundred pages of it in one convenient parcel is one of God's little gifts to mankind.  This book is worth the full cover price for one moment. The often-hilarious left-column bullets (this is newspaper speak, people) provide much of the humor, and one in particular is an instant classic.  Writing of the death of Jerry Garcia, the clever and near-palindromic line "Head Dead-Head Dead" initiated instant bits of laughter from me, especially because I realize what many people do not: The Grateful Dead were never that good.  This book is kind of like watching the tripe "news" stories Geraldo files incessantly, if only Geraldo didn't believe that he'd someday win a Pulitzer or Nobel Prize.  Every page yields multiple high points and for anyone who has ever chuckled at so-called legitimate news, this book is a must-have 
 "Jack Webster will, more than likely, die tomorrow. In the hot Cuban morning, his life will be eaten away by bullets from a firing squad, punishment for the murder of a teenage boy. Late at night, alone in his cell in a decaying Havana prison, the young American begins to write a letter. In impassioned fragments, he struggles with his own memories to create an accounting for his young Cuban lover that will cut through the lies the two have been forced to tell about each other, and that will help Jack himself reach a state of clarity, if not peace. As his final night slides with terrifying speed towards morning and death, Jack's letter becomes a longer and longer search, as much to find vindication as to explain how a passionate and spontaneous love--begun with such promise in an embassy party in New York and brought to full realization in the complex mix of tensions, repression, and celebrations of Castro's Cuba--devolved so completely into a stew of obsession, jealousy, violence, and death. As Jack struggles to justify himself to his beloved Garcia, a realization breaks simultaneously with the dawn, a realization that might allow him a measure of final peace, if he only had the time to understand it more fully. Rich in language and vibrantly evocative, Webster's remarkable narrative as imagined by first time novelist Brendan Lemon captures with aching clarity and sensuality the universal drama of love won and lost."--© zebra 
 This movie was terrific but I have to agree with the other reviewer who said that the features weren't all that great.  If you're a Half Baked fan, you might want the full DVD, but if you're just someone, like me, who likes the movie then no need for the top notch edition 
 Authentic scenery, tribal dance, and so on, and the best version of the great story I have personally seen.  However, the omission of Gagool, the evil witchy 'witch finder'was a huge disappoinment.  
 I just picked up this book and have enjoyed it greatly.  Thieves' World and the city of Sanctuary are such rich settings, and these authors explore that setting to great effect.  I've only read about half the volume thus far, but highly recommend it based on what I have read.  You'll enjoy this especially if you enjoy the whole 'shared world' concept (like I do).  The stories are solid and the characters well-written.  I strongly recommend the stories by Jody Lynn Nye, Robin Wayne Bailey, the 2 by CJ Cherryh & Jane Fancher, and Selina Rosen.  And by all means, if you enjoy these stories, check out these authors' other works.  Each one has a unique and entertaining style.  Congratulations and a hearty 'thank you' to Lynn Abbey for reviving the wonderful and engaging Thieves' World 
 Creating a World That Works For All is one of the best books I have ever read. The author brings up many good points and questions that causes the reader to actually pause and think. If you're looking for a great book to challenge your mind, this is the choice 
 Great up until the end. Even the end, indeed was very good, huge twist, massive climax; but the writers were blinded by their own prejudices, and wrote it wrong.   Basically, the script was fine, except for who had the lines. If you have the last fifteen minutes of the film, with Derrick and Beau reading each other's lines; the film makes moral and physical sense. It sticks to the point, that gossip is dangerous, and also, bad. And also, you'd have an ironic enlightening enlightenment at the end, what with Cathy and Travis being forced to come forward, and fight through an image of hypocracy that would be forced upon them, due to their actions.   The writers could then have ended the film with a whole righting of wrongs, especially the wrongs of the past. Seeing as the film was largely about digging up the secret past, to discover the truth that is affecting the present, it would have been fitting that the past could have been laid to rest. As the ending currently stands, Cathy and Travis seem to get off scot free, appearing to be angels, while the Truth of the past is still uncertain, as is that of the present, Derrick takes the fall for the second time, although it's not clear if this is or not, simply his second victimisation, and Beau, and Joshua Jackson go unchecked to the finale, maintaining the victim status that, at the outset of the film, is set up to be questioned, due to the character of their characters.   All in all, fantastic characters, fantastic direction, fantastic locations, shots, music, art, fan-bloody-tastic.   But the writers ballsed up the script!!!   Meh, no matter, whenever I watch the film, I just pretend that all the emotion is the same, but that it's all the other way round.   Sort of like watching Cruel Intentions, which is all about INTENTIONS, and feeling cheated when Sebastian gets hit by a car. HIT BY A CAR. WHY OH WHY wasn't he MURDERED? THAT WOULD HAVE MADE SENSE. Murdered by anyone, Kathryn, the black dude, the mother of Cecile. Hit by a car is bloody lame, and pointless, completely devoid of INTENTION of any kind. And that's the way Gossip went.   Anyway, for those of you who don't mind having to stop watching cruel intentions just before Sebastian is killed, you won't mind having to imagine the ending to Gossip in a different way.   
 It's great when one of your best friends just happens to own a book shop. I found this trilogy of Nora's in the book shop and got a great deal on it. I think my favorite was Finding The Dream, with Laura Templeton & Michael Fury, probably because he's the handsome, dangerous type of guy that every woman wants to fall in love with.  And he struggled to be good enough for where he  finally ended up. And she was so level-headed in so many ways, except the creep of a husband she was married to. Laura struggles with her two daughters after she divorces their father, with the oldest blaming Laura for his departure. Kids can be so cruel when they don't understand. The story just took me to tears at times. Then too, I really enjoyed Daring to Dream with Margo and Josh Templeton. She finds out about her mother's one and only love, Margo's father, and Margo regains a relationship with her mother that she'd felt was lost. Margo is the beautiful, well-built woman that every man dreams about, but she's a wild child that Josh Templeton has long been waiting for to return home. The dialogue is great, both witty and warm at the same time. Margo is nearly bankrupt when she returns to Templeton House, but finds her roots again, not only with starting a new business, but also with her mother. Josh was my second favorite of the men in this trilogy. He's so cool. And then there's Holding The Dream with Kate and Byron. This story was okay, but not nearly the page-turner that the other two were. But Kate is an altogether different type of woman than Laura and Margo. It's the bond that holds them together as sisters, even though they aren't, that I really found endearing. This trilogy was great. I'm glad I found it 
 This book is a comprehensive work on how Satanic forces have been involved in the history of America and Great Britian from their inception. Starting from the beginning of time it traces the desendants of Noah through their untimate destination and the formation of "great" countries. The author has created a factually documented and thought provoking piece, albeit a large one,which points out America's place in the world, the reason for it, and the sad end. I don't know how Stewart MacLean could write a negative review of this book as it is a great read for christians and non-christians alike. Grady's scholarship is unquestioned and his direct "tell it like it is" approach leaves no stone unturned or name unspoken. 
 Hey all... I just came back from the testing center and I passed The Server+ exam with 83 out of 100...This book is really good, well organized according to exam objectives, but there is a lack of some information such as SCSI320, Fiber optic channel, LUN, Bus architecture...The practice exams on the CD-ROM are good and so is the 100 question exam at the end of the book. But I think that one study resource is not enough. Therefore, I think that using some other study materials will do. Regarding to practice exams I think that TEST KING questions are great.. 
 This book is a natural for anyone who needs or wants to hone their skills using C++ Templates.  Anyone with 15-minutes to spend can immediately pick up the book and begin writing their own templates in C++ even though this is not a traditional "step-by-step" learn-everything-in-a-day kind of book.  The authors are recognized as experts on the topic in the C++ world.  More importantly, they convey templates without the complexity perceived by the syntax that seems to scare people away from templates early on...while presenting templates in their full syntactic glory albeit with an easy, thorough and thoughful introduction that appropriately paces rather than brain-dumps.  I bought this book for the community bookshelf of our C++ programming department, but particularly for one colleague who struggled with the notion of using templates at all, much less, effectively.  After a couple of hours, he was pestering everyone about all of the bits of code that we should be converting to templates.  Viola, a success story!  The book very quickly gets to the point of dealing with templates.  The first few chapters do away with unnecessary fluff and give you the tools to understand and implement templates.  The book is amazingly concise without compromising the shared benefit of years of experience contained within by its authors.  Getting past the basics, the authors give us their insight into more details regarding templates and their use--both in code and even by convention in discourse regarding templates.  One easily sees that their intent is in sharing the truth of templates in this book.  This is undoubtedly going to be the defacto-standard for books on the topic of C++ Templates. 
 A funny thing about digital signals, is that they are either a 1 or a 0. Unlike analogue, where quality can degrade or time or distance, in digital you either get the signal or you don't. That being said, this is a great cable, it works well, and it's drastically less expensive than MONSTER cables. I'm sure someone will argue my logic, as they can't believe that less expensive cables could ever do the same job, but this product works and you'll be happy with it. 
  The books are indeed a masterpiece collection of sorts. Very racy and laced with black humor and the sort of a plot which you can put into a perspective, for instance, the reference to mob psychology harks about to blacks burned/lynched in 1930's America, to many such instances in third world countries like India and Pakistan where many a woman, child and man have been victimc of such outbursts born out of sheer greed or religious intolerance. For instance there is a Muslim Religious leader in Australia saying that women invite rape by exposing their body parts. WOW! Count Olaf, indeed!  The writer is not shedding tears for the children here or is presenting a bleak picture for us to salivate on but is really afraid for us and trying to make us careful in our decisions and largely he is trying, most explicitly, to say that a family should bond well together - for all other relationships are transitory. A very practical one! Should I say!   
 Since the beginning of the year, my partner and I have been "taking Salsa classes" nightly via the SalsaCrazy Learn to Dance Salsa DVD series. It has been a wonderful experience. We have danced together before doing ballroom style dancing and thought that picking up Salsa dancing would be fun as well. We were right. The DVDs took us from the basics that focused primarily on technique-the focus of the first three DVDs in the series-to this one that has allowed us to focus more on style. From the first DVD which we breezed through learning Salsa basics to this one which took us a bit longer to conquer, we've seen great improvement. It has helped us discover a new passion, for dancing and our relationship 
 I love that Dr. Laura tell's it like it is. Every bit of her advice caused me to step back and take a look at myself and how I can better support and love my husband 
 I have been searching for a book all over the Internet on all Egyptian pharaohs from the beginning to the end.  However, it was quite hard until I came to Amazon and found this book.   I tell you Amazon has every book you are looking for!   I read the reviews, and "looked" in the book.   I bought it, and I tell you that this is one of the best comprehensive book ever!  It is in great detail and has many colored pictures.   I would suggest anyone to get this book because it makes a great detail reference and information on the pharaohs 
 I first viewed this film with a friend, in my home.  He and I are both lovers of beautiful music and art.  This film satisfies both categories.  The score is absolutely magnificent and the views of Venice, beautiful.  The acting (by main character Dirk Bogard)is subtle but effective.  We found this film to be a totally soul-satisfying experience.       
 The Circuit, one of my favorite books, is written by Francisco Jimenez. The Circuit is about a family that lived in El Rancho Blanco, Guadalajara. Francisco and his family moved to the United States crossing the border illegally. When they get to the United States in California they look for work and they work in the fields picking cotton. Francisco's family is always hiding from the border patrol which they call it "la migra." As they go on they move to different places. The reason I read this story is because it held my interest , because I wondered how it would be crossing the border illegally. Also, because some of the story reminds me about when I got here from Mexico.  I really recommend this book.  It's exciting and it taught me to eat all my food and not throw it away because Francisco's family did't have anything to eat sometimes. I would give this book a ten, and I really loved it a lot and I think you should try it.  
 I had seen these clics years ago in sunglasses and thought they were great, now I found them in reading glasses and they are great.  My work occationally has me looking at things sideways and my glasses use to fly off my face.  Now they stay put and I can see what I am doing, great!  Fashion wise people laugh at me, but do think that they are functional

 We have four cats and four cat litter boxes in a small, enclosed space.  We placed one Smellkiller next to the cat boxes in the enclosed space, and one right outside the enclosed space.  I was amazed, but it really works--and without flowery-smelling chemicals that are not good for humans or felines.  The product is well made, consisting of heavy rubber with a little pocket to hold the sponge.  The only downside is that it is heavy and the velcro tape included in the packaging to attach the unit to the wall did not hold.  We ended up propping the Smellkiller up against the wall.  I can't vouch for how well this unit would work in a large room, but it solved our cat litter box odor problems even when a large venting fan did not.  I'd buy again 
 this is one of the most gripping, involving books I've ever read...Sebastian Junger writes with the details and accuracy of an investigative journalist and the excitement and anticipation of a great mystery writer..highly recommmended..one of my favorite books of all-time 
 One of the most creatively told stories I've ever read.   Groundbreaking, inspiring, and extremely intelligent. When it was recommended to me, I was told that it "will change my life". This book will definitely leave a mark 
 This book is wonderful. My daughter and I read it every night at bedtime, and I never get tired of it. Now, I am on a mission to collect ALL of PK Hallinan's books. I think they all have a great message, they are well written, have beautiful pictures and are just all around the best kids' books I have encountered. Definitely a must have for all toddler moms-- and moms with young kids 
 Both bags that I received were quite tender and had great flavor.  Not too sweet and not too spicy.  I will definately be ordering some more.  My dog "Mr Doodles" also loves it 
 book was cheap, but brand new and in perfect condition. received it within the estimated time span, but of course would have liked it sooner/on the earlier side of the time span ;) 
 The subtitle says it all: "An Illustrated Guide to Pioneer Life in America, Including Log Cabins, Furniture, Tools, Clothing, and More."  From about 1725 to the closing of the frontier, Tunis examines dozens of aspects of American frontier life in this sequel to his "Colonial Living," and even touches on history (the little-known Black Hawk War, the Santa Fe trade, etc.).  His clear, detailed pen-and-ink sketches provide a perfect visual accompaniment to written commentary.  (Check out the household articles on pp. 24-5, the tub mill on p. 40, the spinning wheels and loom on pp. 46-8, and--my favorite--the elementary prairie well-drilling rig on p. 157, to take just a few examples.)  As is often the case with juvenile social histories, he manages to touch on things you don't learn in books written for an adult audience, so the volume should be useful to researchers of every age.  My one complaint is the positioning of the page numbers, which are buried in the crack of the binding!  This is a book I was delighted to add to my collection, and I recommend it to everyone who has an interest in pre-1900 America 
 It was in very good condition. None of the pages were written on or the cover was not bent. It was as if the book was new 
 I have read a book covering this same subject and this book adds real life to what can become very boring at times. While the words are fiction, the main events are true. It was a good read 
 I love this product. I got it after taking a shopping trip during cold weather and struggling all day long to keep my baby warm with a blanket. Since I got this, shopping in cold weather is a breeze. The only thing is, as soon as you get inside anywhere, you'll need to unzip the top and take it off, or your baby will get way too hot.  I also use it on my stroller during walks, and even in 40 degree weather, my son is able to take a cozy nap while I get my exercise.  It's really easy to take on and off your carseat. They make one for toddlers, also, so I may get another when my son outgrows this one 
 This book, like many of Harris's, is anthropological popcorn: It is delicious stuff that you can quickly devour.  This collection of essays is very important and interesting.  It includes his very influential expanation of the sacred cow in India, as well as analysis of European witchraft, cargo cults, and more.  The most amazing thing in the book is his argument that Jesus was one of many messianic revolutionaries running around Israel during the Roman occupation.  Read this section, and then watch "The Life of Brian."  Monty Python got it right on the nose.  The parallels are amazing, rival bands of revolutionaries all seeking a messianic figure...really great stuff 
 Although a slower read than most popular books, with its many graphs and charts, it gives a unique perspective on the energy "crisis" in our country. Who could ever think that the all-concerned "greens" could have the wrong solutions to our energy needs and that fossil fuels and nuclear energy are the actual keys to our problems.  Others should read this book to learn how they arrive at that

 This arrived in a Christmas stocking at our house We played it over and over all vacation long, and it hasn't gotten old or boring.  Yes, we had to read the instructions, but they weren't too hard to grasp and everyone at our house from 7 to 40+ has enjoyed playing it.  We are now huge Gamewright fans 
 I have two of her productivity books, and recently saw her speak. I can only say this- she knows her stuff! Her systems are lifesavers and best of all she lives by the systems she teaches. Her books are the most fun read of any 'organizer'type books I have found (I have shelves of them that I started but never finished because they bored me or made no sense).  Recently I had the opportunity to be at a training where Laura spoke on organization and finding more time, I attended two of her sessions and they were incredible. She has a terrific sense of humor and so many great examples. And unlike those speakers who spend their time selling their merchandise or systems, you really know she is there because she wants to help people enhance their ability to get organized. I highly reccomend her as a speaker for any event you have 
 I saw this movie when it was first on video, maybe 15 years ago.  My sister-in-law had rented it for us to watch as she had seen it and thought I would enjoy it.  It was during the Thanksgiving holidays, and I'll never forget how this little film practically ruined my Thanksgiving!  I was so terribly depressed after watching it, I couldn't get it out of my mind. No other film has ever struck me that way.  Word to the wise:  don't see this if you are a mother with young kids (my youngest two, a boy & a girl, were little at the time).  You won't be able to get Sophie's "Choice" out of your head.  Otherwise, it was a great film, no doubt.  Superb acting, writing, cinematography, you name it.  Just terribly, horribly sad.  Period 
 Habermas' work, though written more than four decades ago, still retains most of its original relevance for the study of the public sphere. If you are interested in this subject, and if you are into critical thinking, then this book is certainly worth reading. Why? Well, if you take in consideration the fact that no other book has been written so far on the subject that has been able to surpass Habermas' account both in depth and originality, then you begin to get my point. As to a critical reading of the argument put forth by Habermas, one should read "Habermas and the Public Sphere", edited by Craig Calhoun. This book includes an appendix by Habermas where he revises some of his original positions 
 This book outlines Mr. Schilit's seven financial shenanigans with various subcategories.  Though thorough and useful for an institutional investor, this analysis goes beyond what a typical individual investor would be able or willing to use

 How wonderful you are, O Love, 	how much sweeter 	than all other pleasures!  But to try to quote from the Song is like hunting for a rabbit's foot.  Or trying to cook only a spoonful of soup.  The lovers are stoked with the such desperate passion, that no matter the circumstance, the politic, or the law, they bestow on themselves and, now, thanks to the translation, on us, a profound innocence.  In that split moment before tears begin to well.  Before pain is translated into reaction.  Or desire hits the brain.  No wonder the Song flaunts such a pure animal presence.  The lovers living between the heartbeats.  I can see the Shulamite stealthing around the city at night.  Silent, almost rolling, footsteps.  The lovers collision always in the softlight of dawn.  The air cold.   	 	Hurry, my love! Run away, 	my gazelle, my wild stag 	on the hills of cinnamon 
 My nine-year-old son's teacher read this book to his class last Halloween, and he didn't stop asking for it. We finally got it this spring, and he's loving every moment again and again. It's about a boy and a monster, but it's not too scary for my four-year-old. And, it does wrap up with a happy ending and lesson about bullying 
 Like every other book in the O'Malley series that I have read, The Protector was an excellent read. Cassie's story will tug on your heartstrings. The balance between suspense and romance is perfect. Cassie's ability to trust again provide encouragement for those whose loved ones are going through the same issues. I would recommend The Protector to any Christian romance-lover 
 Only 8 songs.  Average song length would be close to 7 minutes.  The compositions are dynamic, leading from symphonic strings and bells into some of the best speed-metal riffs in existence.  Jari uses a 6 string attack, and he sticks to normal tuning--no dropped playing here.  These songs have a very classical feel... his vocals are much better than traditional "death metal."  He sounds closest on his growls to Dark Tranquillity.  There is all sorts of singing as well, he goes from power metal and death metal at perfect times, as someone else stated, his concept of timing on this is perfect for the passage at hand.  It's been a very difficult record for me to stop playing, but you can't listen to it on short car trips... you won't have enough time to listen to it all.  Impeccable, impressive, the best death metal I've heard and a very refreshing interpretation at that. 
 My son first listened to this book on CD while we were staying in a hotel.  To our surprise, we were all hooked after the first CD- even my five year old.  It's a very good story and the narration is fantastic.  I highly recommend this CD set to anyone 
 This is a wonderful book that is great for clubs.  In the tradition of southern story tellers River Jordan has earned her place at the table.  Compelling story of good versus evil (and let's face it y'all....if it happened anywhere it would happen here.)  Her words lead you irresistably to Shibboleth and into the hearts and minds of the citizens.  It is an adventure that you will take in your mind and your heart 
 My husband and I are in the process of reading this book together, and are thoroughly enjoying it.  Wong tells her story with candor and humor, never neglecting to describe the horrors and failings of the revolution while also making sure to relate the positive, uplifting, and sometimes humorous aspects of the system.  An enlightening read with unique perspective 
 This is one of the best books I have ever read.  This is a must read for anyone who is looking to go into business and/or real estate. It helps you begin thinking like the rich.  You can't lose with this book.  
 An timelesss classic. In my opinion the author brings American men back to basics.  Anyone can confront a rude patron in a movie theater whose talking on the their cellphone, however by simply applying one of the book's principles you can solve the problem in a non-confrontational manner and enjoy the rest of the movie.  Highly recommended 
 I've read Swan Song many times over the years and urge readers to grab this book.  You will read it again in a few years. This was my first McCammon book.  With his vast imagination, the world is blown to hell and nuclear fallout is everywhere.  Small groups of fascinating characters are drawn to a little girl with a crucial power to bring the earth back.  Meanwhile, an evil is searching to crush that power. This is not science fiction but adventure and a deep story of good vs evil. Each character is rich in personality and their interaction is so well written.  This is one of the most moving, exciting books written 
 WHEN I RECEIVED MY BIBLE I WAS SO EXCITED AND IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.  I SAVED APPROXMATELY $30.00 ON AMAZON AND THE SERVICE WAS GREAT. THIS BIBLE HAS SO MUCH FOR TEACHING AND SOLID LEARNING OF SCRIPTURE. I HAVE THE 1ST SPIRIT FILLED BIBLE WHICH IS WORN OUT. THE KINGDOM DYNAMICS AND THE STRONGS INTERPRETATION IS TERRIFIC, THEN THE UNDERSTANDING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE. MY PASTOR'S WIFE SAID SHE PREACHES FROM THIS BIBLE AND I CAN SEE WHY 
 A life told in pastiche, favoring small moments of telling quietness over the Big Events that feature in most memoirs.  Divorces and births are passed over with little comment, but scenes from marriages and parenthood and the friendships that persist after marriage ends are beautifully rendered.    Thomas shifts point of view, sometimes telling a piece in first person, sometimes in third.  Her sister makes occasional appearances in the book, "correcting" Thomas and questioning her motives.  The book jumps back and forth in time, and part of the pleasure of reading it is encountering the life in the order that makes most sense to its author, and piecing together the chronology as you go along.    Very short sections, nicely managed.  Almost a collection of prose poems. 
  This is a very good cd with excellent songs included on this cd. They are a very good doo woop group and very enjoyable to listen to.     John from Palmdale 
 i think its great book,it has potential that can bring poeple more respective and succes toward their dream.. you will be more likeable and famous among your friend after you read this boo 
 This is a lovely version of the classic Rumpelstiltskin. I enjoyed reading it with my third graders. The illustrations are beautiful and spark the imagination. A good story demonstrates struggle and challenges the students to compare present day expectations with the past 
 I bought this case because I wanted to keep my ipod and earplugs in my purse without the earplugs being tangled or my ipod screen being scratched. This case is compact enough that it does not take up much purse real estate but provides protection for my treasured ipod. I liked it so much that I have purchased another one to give as a gift  If you are considering this product, read the seller reviews. The first seller took forever to send. When I contacted them, they told me that they were having difficulty filling my order and that I could cancel. Amazon would not let me cancel until more than 30 days after the order was placed. On the very day I was allowed to cancel. The celler decided to send the case. For the second order, I went with the seller who charged more money, but at least I will receive it within my lifetime 
 The title of this concise book says it all. Coming from an evangelical orientation, the collection of essays in this book on the family focus on (no pun intended) the depiction of the family in the varied times and contexts of the biblical canon. While the book itself is not organized thematically-there are, logically, two parts: Part 1: Family in the Old Testament, and Part 2: Family in the New Testament-some of the contributing writers do approach their treatment thematically. The chapters provide responsible reviews of the biblical content when it pertains to families, describing, but also interpreting, the ways that the family is understood in the section of the Bible under review. The family, as a social unit, is presented in the cultural contexts of the grand scope of the ever-evolving biblical worldviews in the canon. The writing is impressively tight, consistently so, allowing for a rich biblical background resource in a short 175 pages.   	Some will undoubtedly be disappointed at a lack of an overall definitive statement about what the Bible has to say about families today-in social, political, ecclesial, or theological contexts. Only one contributor to the volume strays long enough from the biblical evidence to address at any length issues related to, for example, feminist interpretations of the family in scripture. In fact, in the one chapter that a contributor attempted to provide implications for the contemporary family, the statements come across as an overreach of the text and its message. The editors seem content to allow the treatment on the family to remain focused in the text and its context. As such, the conclusions offered in most chapters are short on interpretation and implications for the contemporary family. For those needing more, this may lead to an assumption that the Bible has nothing to say about families for the contemporary world. But that would be a misunderstanding of both the intent and message of this book.   	This is a worthy contribution to both biblical studies and fields whose main concern is the family and its place and role in society. The editorial light touch has ensured that the contributors' personal voices contribute to the uniqueness and richness of this work. This is important, given the varied backgrounds of the writers, including England, Canada, Costa Rica, Japan, as well as the United States. This will become a standard work for every academic library.  
 I was just saying to a fellow music lover and friend of mine that the BEST Incognito album... is whichever one you happen to be listening to at that moment in time. True to form, "Eleven" is EXCELLENT!!! With 11 STRONG songs, Bluey takes us on a another musical adventure through the world of Acid Jazz at its' finest.   The supporting cast is stellar as usual, with Incognito regulars Richard Bailey, Dominic "Ski" Oakenfull, Graham Harvey, Dominic Glover, Nichol Thompson, Andy Ross, and Ed Jones backing Blueys guitar work on the Drums, Keys, and horns. Newcommers Shawn Lee, Tony Remy, Francis Hylton, Jim Hunt, and Bosco De Oliveira provide reilef on drums, guitar, bass, sax, and percussion. Throw in vocals from standout singers Maysa, Tony Momrelle, Imaani, Gail Evans, and Tyrone Harvey and the potential for a GREAT album is firmly established. This ensemble is EXCELLENT, and as usual, the performance and execution is flawless.  With "Eleven" Bluey is continuing the 70s' retro sound he developed on the Incognito "Spin-off" group Inner Shades' only release "Four Corners of the World." On this CD we are treated to SOME synthesizer work (playing vintage analog sounds from the 70s') but mostly processed guitar, Clavinet, Fender Rhodes, piano, and plenty of acoustic instruments. This is GOOD music that doesn't rely on gimics or tricks to entertain.   "Let The Mystery Be" is a medium tempo instrumental showcasing the horn section. "We Got Music" is an up tempo body shaker that is destined to be a dance hall anthem. "Come Away With Me" is another club/house music special, with a sparkling vocal performance by Maysa. "Baby It's Alright" is a medium tempo song with a lovely intro reminiscent of Chaka Kahn and Rufus' 70's hit "Sweet Thing". A nice guitar solo mid-way trough by Tony Remy puncuates Inaanis vocal performance. "When Tomorrow Gets You Down" is an R&B cut featuring Maysa and some nice backing harmony.  "Jacaranda" is a horn-funk instrumental featuring some nice interplay and complicated melodic lines in the end. "Show Me Love" is another dance tune that sounds like it could have been recorded on the Cogs 2nd CD, "Inside Life". "Will I Ever Learn?" is a medium tempo torch song sung with feeling by Maysa. "I'll Get By" is a pure funk effort featuring the soulful voice of Tony Momrelle. "It's Just One Of Those Things" is a feel good up tempo tune with a moody lyric. You find yourself humming this song long after its off. "As Long As It's You" is another torch song with Imaani doing the honors.  This is an EXCELLENT collection of songs; good music to say the least. If you are an Incognito fan, you'll enjoy each and every cut on this CD. If you are new to the Cogs, you'll quickly become a fan.  
 This book was someone else's bookclub selection, and I think having no expectations when I picked it up really helped in my having that WOW experience that some folks report with this book and others miss. Yes, the prose needed much better editing: overuse of repetition, "stock" phrases, and "hanging" assertions that should have been cleaned up.  However, I found the discussions of brain development/evolution, similarities between certain animal behaviors and human behaviors, development of language in different animals, and the coevolution of humans and dogs to be facinating (oops, just gave away the ending!).  I found the side discussion of outcome-based audits interesting and enlightening.  I also liked Dr. Temple's recommendation that people with autism be hired for baggage checking positions.  Great idea! Although the book really goes all over the place, I found it a wonderful opportunity to engage my "seeking/hunting" motivation (you'll have to read the book for that one), and worth wading through the flaws to pick up the nuggets of gold 
 This frying pan by Calphalon is superb, easy to clean, perfectly shaped and stays evenly heated.  It is perfect for omelettes, as well as one-dish meals, pan frying fish or chicken, etc.  Very well priced, too 
 This as most of you will know is the story of a half man, half god Hercules but with a unique twist that only Disney can provide for the whole family to enjoy.  For the Disney movie Hercules is the born son of Zeus who is kidnapped by the henchmen of Hades lord of the underworld to remove Hercules god powers, making him mortal and then killing Hercules but the henchmen don't do the job properly and instead of killing Herc they just remove his god like immortality but Herc still keeps his god like strength and as a young baby he fights off the henchmen.  Because Hercules loses his immortality he is no longer a full god and cannot return to the heavens with his real parents so Hercules is adopted by a family on Earth.  The adventure begins from there and i don't wanna spoil anything for you so i'll just say that this is an incredible Disney favourite of mine and that is down to the superb animation, fun script and great music inbetween.  Get this movie it is truly great 
 Great book for one who wants to learn about Hinduism and the feminine within the Indian traditions. Scholarship is excellent, but it isn't for those who have more New Age beliefs in general on goddeses such as Kali or Hindu/eastern concepts in general. I would suggest it for those who are actually into learning about the Hindu religion and not the Western idea of Indian culture and religion 
 I first played at a friend's house, and was skeptical b/c I'm not a huge board game fan. But when I realized how simple it was, I caught the fever really quickly. For months I would ask friends if they had heard of the game, looked in several toy stores, Walmart, Target, Kmart...to no avail. Finally realized the only place I'd realistically get it from was Amazon. By this time I figured I must be nuts. Totally worth the wait, though.   I've played this solo with my husband as well as with friends and family. It never ceases to amuse us. Variations to the game are SO helpful. This game is SO much fun. 
 Though access to the founders of Google seems to be lacking, the story and insight of Google's rise in the world of technology, business and culture have been very well documented.  If you are fond of the stories of American Business, this one belongs on your bookshelf 
 I have no idea or any great interest in how this record impacted listeners in 1982. the point is that the good tunes still hold up today as vital and thoroughly engaging. Their early albums were a bit inconsistent (maybe this one less so) but right from the off when they hit it they really hit it. My favourite track by a landslide is "West of the Fields". The drum and base find a groove that is mesmerising; as far as i'm concerned one of their absolute best tracks; just so good - although I must confess to having no idea as to what the song is about (laughs). I suspect the clue is in the album cover. The other tracks I still really get off on after many years are sitting still, 9-9 and shaking through. They carry interesting beats and melody with delightful vocals that still sound fresh today. Talented bunch

 I am a professional hypnotherapist in private practice.  This book was one of my first purchases when I began studying hypnosis.  It is essential to anyone interested in the field of hypnotism - from the beginner to the advanced.  5 years of private practice and I still refer to it often 
 I have loved the Sharpe series but most of the recent ones have dealt with his early days in India instead of the Peninsular campaign which is where most of the story takes place. This book represents a return to the "older" stories and it is a welcome return.  The story is of the siege of Cadiz and the battle of Barossa. It takes place shortly after the Talavera story in which Sharpe captured a French eagle. In Sharpe's Eagle, Sharpe was credited with the first capture of a French standard. This story tells the story of the real first capture.   While tasked to help blow up a bridge, a bumbling brigadier gets himself, Sharpe and his riflemen stuck on one of the pontoons drifting towards the sea. They make their way to Cadiz where the rump of the Spanish government is located. There, feelings are running high. Though the Spanish are now allied with the English, they are still bitter about their defeats when they were in opposition and mad about matters of Britain's foreign policy. There is a faction that wants to come to a settlement with Napoleon and that faction is doing anything to discredit the British. In particular, they have their sights set on the British Ambassador, the brother of Gen. Wellington. They have some of his letters and are threatening to publish them and embarrass the government. Sharpe is detailed to help buy them back from the blackmailers or steal them if he must.  Other matters are brewing as well. The British garrison is preparing to sally forth to hit the French in company with their Spanish allies. The problem is that the Spanish contingent is larger so the Spanish general is in overall command. He is a coward and an inept one at that. He manages to get his forces cut off and then, when battle is joined, refuses to fight. He lets the Brits and Portuguese do the fighting. It is a desperate fight which the allies have no hope of winning but then history, and this book, tell a different story.  This is a good story and well worth reading. 
 I really enjoyed this book because it wasn't just a bunch of impersonal historical facts piled into one book. These are writings and historical accounts from those who were present at the time the history was being made. This book gives a unique perspective about the Roman Empire that most history books don't. 
 Once again, Cary and Dave did an outstanding job of taking on the complex subject of self-employment and breaking it down to a level that readers can grasp and move forward toward self-employment opportunities for people with disabilities! You two are amazing 
 A great story written by a great pen and a great heart 
 This is a must have for all Celestron Nexstar owners.  The book is very well written, including plain English descriptions of many astronomy terms and concepts.  The book covers a lot, and includes information for all models.  Its an excellent reference guide and provides a very complete set of instructions for many of the difficulties that a user is likely to encounter while using their scope.  It looks like a lot of research went into writing it, and has the potential of saving the reader hours and hours of time researching how to get the most out of their telescope 
 Overall these shoes fit fairly well, are stylish in appearance, and the price is right. The only concern I have is that they seem to run a little short in length (odd for NB). I have been buying NB shoes for as long as I can remember, and this is the first time my toes were obviously at the very end of the toe box. They look good though, and provide the great arch support New Balance is famous for.  It's always a good idea to try on shoes before you buy them, but the online price is so seductive, it's difficult to pass up the "deal". If possible, try to find some at your local shoe store before you purchase these, as the pictures don't show you all angles of this shoe, and parts of the trim are (in my opinion) "goofy" looking.  Overall, I'd recommend these shoes for walking/jogging/going to the gym. If you want some serious running shoes, spring for the higher-end Asics, NB's, Saucony's, etc. 
 This album is a must buy for all Commissioned fans. Even the ones who miss Fred in the group. This group has lost nothing in regards to production work. The harmony is tight as ever. The only thing that I miss on this album is another powerful voice like you know who. The blend, of course, is out of this world. Montrell fits in nicely on this album. Only thing I'm trying to figure out is why he didn't make the album cover. What's up with that Montrell?! "I Can Love Again" and "More Than I" are my favorite songs on this album 
 This book is long but every page is worth the length. It really makes you want to find out more about the people and places that make Alaska the wonderful place it is. The characters are well developed and the places well described. This is easily one of Michener's best books.  You'll visit Russia, the Yukon, The Aleutian Islands and even Hawaii. You'll meet mystic Shamans, Canadian Mounties, Gold Prospecters and Whale Hunters. This is one book that will leave you with stories of American folklore that'll you'll never forget. 
 I ordered a number of copies of this book -- the New Folger Library edition of Richard II -- for use by members of a Shakespeare reaeding group in Tbilisi, Georgia (that's the country, not the state), most of whose members are not native speakers of English. For this purpose the Foger edition, with notes on the page facing each page of text, was very useful -- more useful, I think, than the Arden edition, whose critical apparatus is very copious but often gets in the way. And in a few cases I found the Folger's notes more accurate and informative. Harry Berger's concluding essay, however, is not so good. It argues a thesis that I find somewhat implausible and one-sided in its reading of the play, so especially for the new student it is not very useful. But coming at the end of the text it is easy to ignore 
 Stan and Jan Berenstain turned out some of their finest books during the early 1980s, and The Berenstain Bears In the Dark is certainly one of their best.  A best-seller since its release (now almost 20 years ago) there is a simple reason for its success: the book tells a wonderfully beautiful and fun story but one that is also very true to life.  In the book, a night light is placed in the cubs' bedroom because of Sister's fear of the dark.  By the end of the book, though, the reader sees that Brother (who argued against the "babyish" light) actually is in need of the night light as much or more than his sister.  It is a fun story for kids and one that can be very useful for parents.  The story is great and the illustrations are classic Berenstain Bears.  This is a personal favorite that I remember from my own childhood and one I will continue to read for years to come! If you have not read it or do not own a copy, get one today, YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED 
 I can't believe someone would not enjoy this CD. My 2 kids ( ages 1 and 2 1/2) love this CD. Sometimes it is the only thing that will keep them happy. I will admit, if you are new to Laurie Berkner, it seems a little boring at first. But, after listening to it a couple of times, it is incredible. the words are so easy to learn and the tunes are catchy. I don't even mind if they are trapped in my head all day (unlike the other kid songs we have). We also have We Are the Dinosaurs, and love that one, too. I can't wait to get Laurie's other 2 CDs. I tell everyone about Laurie Berkner, she is a true gem 
 While the supernatural senses is consistent throughout each book, the story, theme and/or plot are so different you never solve the mystery til the end.  Suspense, and literally heartpounding spookiness 
 Hi. These headsets deliver amazing sound at all volume levels with great bass boost and no distortion. Very comfortable to wear for long periods. The mic really amplifies your voice and the noice cancelling on the mic is really good. Build quality overall is true to what plantronics claim. An excellent deal overall 
 Another great book from McKillip - a fairytale with a very natural warmth.  The whole turning of the tricks and traps as lost legends move through time on their conquest of the present is handled skillfully.  The pain you feel even for the coming conquerors who have their own sorrows that drive them - McKillip brushed on all details with amazing detail and concern for the characters 
 I have to mark points off because of the weirdness of Nick Bottom's having a wife, but I don't really mind all that much about the change of scene (although the characters might have been better named things like Lorenzo and Antonio, but I don't like to quibble over these things. Much.) Otherwise, it was all very fun. The rustic players were my favorite part. Michelle Pfeiffer was okay as Titania, but Rupert Everett was better as Oberon. Calista Flockhart was appropriately befuddled as the "painted maypole." She does appear to be tall!  The other reviewer who posted about the eyebrow-raising range of accents was right. Sheeeesh. The actress who played 'Ermia was the worst, but thankfully, the Cockney twang had sort of faded by the end of the movie.  All in all, very enjoyable 
 Well, first of all the viewers of this movie should not take it seriously.  Its not that type of movie. Its more of a campy/spunky type action film.  Yeah, it is a lot like Indiana Jones, and isnt Van Dammes best, but still has many high points to it.....at least I think. If you want Van Dammes best acting DONT start here, go to In Hell, Wake of Death, Lionheart, or maybe Timecop for that.  For his action/martial arts skills this isnt a bad place to go.  It has quite a few good action scenes in it. Van Damme is always cool as hell and has some good lines.  The ending is also pretty good as well. With the ending you get Van Dammes best kick(jumps and glides) out of all his movies he has ever done,even at his older age. The movie as a whole isnt nowhere near as bad as a lot of people think. Its just another action film that fans and MAYBE action fans should love.  But like I said its NOT TO BE TAKEN REALLY SERIOUSLY 
 If you need to decide which college to attend, or are the parent of a future college student, this book is a must have reference book.  Don't just use the College Board online school finder as I found it seems to sometimes give strange results.  This book provides the "whole picture" of a school 
 Dance-punk seems to be the new trend in England these days, and Maximo Park is one of the better bands coming out (sonically it sounds like a new-wave influenced Gang Of Four). As opposed to fellow post-punk-mates Kaiser Chiefs, Maximo Park turns down the cheesiness in favor of more accessible tunes (which more or less works). The first six tracks on this CD are VERY good, but after that the album arguably loses its spark. The rest are good, don't get me wrong, but the energy and catchiness of the first five songs isn't as pravelent in the last half of the album. Singer Paul Smith is very good as he fits the post-punk style of the band perfectly. Lyrically the album is very very good - it's pretty much all about the wonders and dreams of a young man in a small town - they're all very well-written, catchy and fun to pay attention to. The band basically sounds like a contemporary Gang Of Four but with a LOT more energy and less emphasis on politics (plus way more dancy). You can definitely hear that they were influenced heavily by that band. Overall it's just a high quality album through and through, and although it might not be as influential as, say, Gang Of Four, it's still very much worth your time to check out. Absolutely recommended!  Highlights include:  "Signal & Sign"  "Apply Some Pressure"  "Graffiti"  "Postcard Of A Painting"  "Going Missing"  "I Want You To Stay"  "The Coast Is Always Changing" (parts of 
 This book provides introductions to a wide variety of topics in Australian history. It has been edited by three of the most eminent Australian academic historians and many of the entries have been written by experts in  their respective fields. The entries themselves deal with events, people,  noted historians and current issues in Australian historiography 
 Marilyn literally takes you aboard with her and her family.  I almost got sea sick.  LOL  Marilyn is articulate and tells it like it is.  She doesn't sugar coat the unfortunate happenings.  You will laugh, you will cry and you will get angry at certain characters.  All in all a wonderful read 
 Why was one locust cleaner than the other?  Man, I had no idea either till I picked up this book.  In fact, I had no idea that Jewish dietary laws made any distinctions at all on the locust front. (I mean, as far as I'm concerned, you could leave the locusts off the menu altogether and it's a fair bet I wouldn't even notice.)  Mary Douglas, extensively supported by a gaggle of other similarly academically endowed individuals in quote form, however, delves right into the whole locust conundrum and she does it in a truly fascinating manner.  What begins as a graceful though predictable swan dive assessment of profanity as disruption of cultural order jack knifes thrillingly there in the middle to talk about physical creatures as metaphoric representations of religious and cultural values.   The book starts out talking about dirt and ends up in a fascinating examination of how we as humans, both "primative" and "civilized", twist our concrete world to become metaphor for psychological and spiritual experience  Cool, huh. Also, as an added treat, Douglas spends A LOT of time talking about the South American Lele cult of the pangolin.  (For laypeople, that's that funny armadillo/anteater thing that looks quite alot like a pinecone.)  Douglas takes some fairly weighty theories of cultural anthropology and turns them into an entertaining and infinitely readable piece.  A nice trick.  Oh, and did I mention the anteater?  What's not to love 
 It's pretty :) it makes my kitchen lovely!!!! Amazon did good on delivery :) : 
 In this tale, we have the classic spoiled brat who has the good fortune to discover that food and friends have to be earned. The slowness of his education is important, for it really does take grinding misery to blast an over-inflated ego. And yet, the reward is entry into the human race 
 The article "The Balanced Scorecard-Measures that Drive Performance" was written in the HBR in 1992 but is still very powerful, relevant and useful today in guiding managers not to only rely on financial measures but to also include a balanced set of operational measures in the performance measurement system. This allows managers to look at an organization from several perspectives at the same time.  Complementing financial measures with operational measures of internal business processes, customers and learning and growth, enables an organization to translate strategy into operational terms, thereby facilitating strategy implementation. As the authors point out, "What you measure is what you get", therefore measuring say customer satisfaction enables a company to ensure that it meets customer needs, which is very critical in the current highly competitive operating environment. A company also needs to know what it excels at (internal perspective) so that it can use its strengths top exploit opportunities whilst minimizing the impact of its weaknesses and threats.  The book does not attempt to downplay the importance of financial measures but only to emphasize the need to have a balanced set of measures. The emphasis is on a few critical balanced set of measures and not a proliferation of measures. The balanced scorecard forces managers to look at the essential operational measures together thus avoid the situation where success in one area is at the expense of other areas.  The authors used simple language, charts to illustrate the concepts and mini cases to reinforce the practical application of the concept.  The article is comprehensive enough that it is ideal for the busy executive who may not have the time to read other related articles or the book on the same topic by the authors "The Balanced Scorecard: Turning Strategy into Action". I, however, strongly recommend one to also read this very interesting and ground-breaking book especially those studying management or doing an MBA. 
 What The Bleep Do We Know has become a groundbreaking film that has inspired a growing exploration of spiritual, philosophical, and social issues raised by the film.  Alexandra Bruce is a rather unconventional writer/journalist, who once produced music videos, prior to her writing career in which she has focused on underground and sub-culture phenomena.  This is the 2nd book I've read by the author, the 1st being The Philadelphia Experiment Murder: Parallel Universes & The Physics of Insanity.  So Alexandra continues here in Beyond the Bleep with the theme of challenges to conventional ideas about the nature of reality.  In this case, she offers a whimsical tour of the personalities involved in the What The Bleep project, giving a fairly even-handed account of their theories and their professional histories.  She does not hide her personal feelings, as she seems to appreciate what the film producers have created and at times gripes against right wing politics and religious fundamentalism in the USA. This book is small and compact but contains lots of information.  I personally find Alexandra Bruce's style pleasant, as she is able to shift gears easily, going from scientific discussions to humorous commentaries.  Alexandra is insightful and I tend to agree with a lot of her thoughts.  She provides a useful glossary in the book and a list of resources for further study.  I find it interesting that she refers to a website associated with a woman named Laura Knight-Jadczyk and her husband Ark Jadczyk, who just so happens to be a quantum physicist -and thus my prime suspect for Alexandra's anonymous physicist commentator. Alexandra Bruce is quite knowledgeable and familiar with occult and esoteric topics, and she sometimes makes references in this book that could be lost on people who just want to read about the people and science of What The Bleep.  Considering all the topics referred to, I was impressed that I only found one that didn't sit well with me - "peak oil," which is alluded to in a bit of social commentary.  My problem with that reference involves my conclusion that a supposed peak in oil production is not natural but is an artifically crafted situation serving the interests of oil industry profiteers and global government orchestrators.  Anyway, things often become more interesting and complex when you look beyond the surface; and this look "Beyond the Bleep" offers interesting ideas and information underlying the inspiring What The Bleep film.  This book is not affiliated with the film producers or anyone connected to the film, and thus looks into some issues that I suspect those involved in the film would rather see ignored, even though this author displays appreication for What The Bleep and the discussions it has fostered.  I highly recommend this book for those who want to learn more about the issues raised in the film and who would like to se a level-headed discussion of controversies associated with the film 
 I believe this book is the perfect companion to the movie, because they compliment each other very well. There were scenes that were cut from the movie that are explained here; there's scenes that are expanded here when compared to the movie.  Mr. Stover stayed true to the movie, while adding very interesting insights into the different characters and situations, specially Anakin Skywalker. By the end of the book, you deffinetly get inside Anakin's head a lot deeper than the movie showed.  I recommend this book enthusiastically to any Star Wars fan out there or just anyone in particular who enjoyed the movie Revenge of the Sith. I dont think you will be dissapointed 
   These essays are collected from Berkshire's annual letter to shareholders, which are available for free on Berkshire Hathaway's website. The essays Lawrence Cunningham selected provide a good synopsis of Warren's investment philosophies and cut through to the point of some very important concepts. Both Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger are the clearest-minded, sharpest, to-the-point thinkers when it comes to investments and their openness in sharing their true beliefs is an unbelievable blessing for those wise enough to pay attention and study. I doubt there is any other billionaire who would share his innermost thoughts, beliefs and secrets to success in the fashion that Buffett does.   OK enough praise, I could go on and on about his successes but here are a few tidbits from the book:  "Inactivity strikes us as intelligent behavior. Neither we nor most business managers would dream of feverishly trading highly-profitable subsidiaries because a small move in the Federal Reserve's discount rate or because some Wall Street pundit had reversed his views on the market."  "Obviously many companies in high-tech businesses or embryonic industries will grow much faster in percentage terms than will `The Inevitables- Coke, Gillette and his latest perchase BUD'.  But I would rather certain of a good result than hopeful of a great one."   "In our view, though, investment students need only two well-tought courses-How to Value a Business, and How to Think about Market Prices. Your goal as an investor should simply be to purchase, at a rational price, a part interest in an easily-understandable business who's earnings are virtually certain to be materially higher five, ten and twenty years from now."  "In the final chapter of The Intelligent Investor, Ben Graham points our: `Confronted with a challenge to distill the secret of sound investment into three words, we venture the motto, Margin of Safety.' Forty-two years after reading that, I still think those are the right three words."  "Beware of past-performance `proofs' in finance: If history books were the key to riches, the Forbes 400 would consist of librarians."   "Market commentators and investment managers who glibly refer to `growth' and `value' styles as contrasting approaches to investment are displaying their ignorance, not their sophistication."

 THEY is a thoughtful story with page-turning quality which is well-crafted. I loved the story and how David Morrell brought together the different pieces of a high drama. It kept my attention. Would-be fiction authors (which seems to be plentiful at least in my circles) can learn great lessons in pacing and storytelling from careful study of this Amazon Short. I highly recommend it 
 I got my copy last night and I had to stop about 1/4 of the way through because I was hurting from laughing so hard.  Some of the combinations of pics and captions are priceless!! Definitely a worthwhile pick-up 
 It is perplexing to read Ayittey's book and still be aware that some have called him a sell-out.  His love for Africa is apparent in this book.  His description of the "low level" efficiencies that make Africa work is lovely to read.  What he calls the "astonishing degree of functionality, participatory form of democracy, rule of customary law and accountability of the traditional African society," is respectful and easy to applaud.  These are words of facts as well as love.  He cannot be the Afro-pessimist his detractors sometimes call him.  Otherwise, how could he put so much faith in the simple African peasant he calls "Atingah"?  E. Ablorh-Odjidja www.thisweekghana.co 
 This book is a delightful investment!  It's fun to read to yourkids and even more fun to listen to your kids "read" it backto you.  Mr.  Arnold's illustrations will leave you "bug-eyed" and his rhyme provides for a "hopping" good time.  The audio cassette is humorous and perfectly narrated by the nasally Alice Playten 
 Fast shippment, no problems, book was exactly as described. Recommend to other buyers and I would definitely do business with them again. Thanks 
 This was a great movie.  I watch it over and over and over.  I don't understand why it did not draw more public attention 
  Although it might seem like an odd starting point, the first time I heard of Kurosawa's Rashomon was when I read Iris Chang's Rape of Nanking for the first time a few years ago. Within this book she alluded to the film because of the various stories detailing the atrocities committed in Nanking differed greatly depending on the source of information. Anyway, a couple of years after that I read Akutagawa Ryuunosuke's short story "Rashomon" and noticed that it really did not fit Chang's brief description of the movie and it was not until I read a later short story in the collection, "In the Grove", did I find the actual short story the film was based on.  The film Rashomon was Western film audiences' first real exposure to the films of Kurosawa Akira and it ignited the flame of interest in Kurosawa's films for decades to come. And with good reason, because Rashomon is truly an excellent film and it still tops best films ever made lists constantly.  During a terrible rainfall three men, a priest, a woodcutter, and a bandit, duck into the ruins of the Rashomon gate to escape the massive downpour. The priest and the woodcutter have just returned from a court case detailing the murder of a samurai by the bandit Tajomaru. Listening to Tajomaru's testimony it seems like a pretty cut and dry case. He wanted the samurai's wife for his own and after raping her he killed her husband as she asked him to do. However, after listening to the wife's story and even the dead husband's story through a medium, it is hard to say what the truth...is  The old saying goes "History is written by the victors" and Rashomon definitely displays not only how different people view the same events, but how lies thread their way into the truth and corrupt it. Kurosawa depicts the scene with the samurai, his wife, and the bandit Tajomaru four times within the film's 88 minutes, and the resulting juxtaposition is quite enjoyable.    
 These monologues are brief (under 5 minutes?) and capture the flavor of the Bible characters.  They are great to use as part of a church service to add a little Christmas or Easter flavor, for example.  I or others have simply read them (sometimes in costume) and they went over well.  Churches with extensive drama teams will probably not find these useful.  But small and medium churches with small or no drama groups could find these a great way to demonstrate the value of drama.  If you are looking for another "layer" for church services, this is a great place to start.  Also useful for camp presentations, as a short devotional, etc.  From a Biblical viewpoint, the author takes few liberties but adheres pretty closely to Biblical information 
 The classification of temperament is as at least two millenia old. Some of this effort falls decidely in the the half-baked side of the pan. Yet much of it is decidely helpful in understanding 'the way we are wired' and 'the way we process things', to use two very modern metaphors of personality typing.  Maybe you've never thought of it like that.   Linda Berens and Dario Nardi want you to think again, and to discover yourself in the profiles they've developed and invited you to try on. Their paradigm is the well-known Myers-Briggs assignment of four letters to a temperament, each of them a choice between two options. If you run the math, you'll quickly discover that there are sixteen possibilities, thus the title of this book. (Full disclosure: I'm an INTJ, so I'm really enjoying systematically reporting on this book, gentle reader.)  Berens and Nardi have made this guide user friendly and it is not necessary to have taken the Myers-Briggs 'test' in order to use it. In my opinion, the reader will greatly benefit from having done so. There are so many 'hooks' that one finds to hang one's temperament on in just about any prose description, that I find the M-B system is almost necessary in order to inject some element of objectivity into the process.  The great value of Berens' and Nardi's work is their trademarked (yes) two-word description of each of the sixteen types (INTJ: 'Conceptualizer Director') *and* the one-page 'Self-Portrait: What's it like to be you?'.  The latter is distilled from interviews with individuals belonging to each personality type. I have checked this against a number of friends in the presence of family and peers and found an extraordinary degree of confirmation that this is how the typed individuals actually feel about the world and their selves in it.  This book could serve as good introduction to the modern practice of temperament/personality classification. I also find it helpful in a business/organization context, where mutual understanding (without the touchy-feely excesses that lead so predictably to the gag reflex) is often essential to accomplishing shared goals and avoiding hallway assassinations 
 In the beginning singers used to sing and dancers used to dance and there was no guitar in flamenco. The guitar was added later as accompaniment. This flamenco CD is a true flamenco and Sabicas is great on the guitar as always. Those who toss CDs over the balcony because of flamenco singers, in my opinion still do not get flamenco. Great flamenco music 
 Unbelievable in the amount of information presented, it's been on my bedside table for just over 10 years now and I still have not come across every page. It is not just a type of encyclopedia, rather it comes across as a sort of dictionary about certain aspects of history that is actually fun to read. And that is in part of what I must stress to the future reader; it is immense, and enjoyable reading 
 I thought this was a good book. One of the many that keeps you turning the page due to suspense. Ralph Roberts had no clue that his Insomnia would lead him to heroism and he would finally get to "sleep". Stephen King's one of a kind creativity definitely comes to play here. I would recommend this book to anyone. I think anyone would enjoy the suprise ending in finding out about the "promise" 
 I got the book today and am through the first 100 pages, and I love it.  I find myself laughing out loud at her familiar stories of being overweight . .I would cry if I didn't laugh.  I think she has the most realistic approach to weight loss that I have come across in a long time.  Fad diets don't work.  And how uncomfortable it can be to be overweight and working with/socializing with the thin, fabulous and sometimes famous.  Her discomfort with her sexuality during her teens also strikes a cord.  She is simply spot on with all her remarks.  I advise this book if you are thinking about dieting or actually dieting, or even if you just know someone who struggles with overweight 
 While The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a timeless tale that has endured the ages and countless retellings from Disney to Tim Burton, the original work contains a rather large error in tone - a blatant one. The story is told in third person as though it's a journal - the sketch book of Diedrich Knickerbocker, in fact. This is fine, except for the climax scene in which Ichabod journeys home through the hollow from Van Tassel's house, and is confronted by the Headless Horseman. This scene is written with all the detailed minutia that characterizes Irving's style, but the obvious problem is that, of course, nobody was there to witness what happened to Ichabod Crane while he was alone in the wilderness, so therefore it could not possibly be communicated by means of somebody's journal - this person would never have known what actually happened in the Hollow since nobody was there to witness it, and apparently Ichabod never survived or stuck around to tell anyone. Irving never deals with this obvious problem in the text (a simple "This is what we think happened..." would've sufficed). The story probably would've worked much better with a traditional "God-perspective" narrator rather than a fictional character's journal. It is nonetheless, a classic work of American literature and should be read by everyone.   This is a fine edition and also includes Rip Van Winkle, another story of paranormal experience and also of the Knickerbocker sketch book. It's a similar tone to Sleepy Hollow, but the characters aren't as memorable 
 Thanks to those that have rated the book.  As the author I've created a website that has an author bio, preview of some chapters and more.  Goto designfirstfor3d.com to see more. -Thank 
 I recieved this book about a month ago and read it in on day. I just couldn't put it down. I LOVE behind the scenes things that they (now) show on DVD and this book was just great!  One thing I didn't realise when I bought it was the book was published in 1989. This doesn't really affect anything...except for when it talks about the book Scarlett which was in the process of being written at the time.   After reading this book it did give me a newfound respect for the book "Scarlett" (which, it is a good work...on it's OWN, but no comparison to "Gone with the Wind" and I think the author was not true to Scarlett) But after reading this book, I am no longer as "resentful" (for lack of a better word) towards that novel. I think the Mitchell estate did the right thing.  There were also so many interesting things...I had NO idea it took all that work and that they had THAT much trouble in making the movie.  All in all...A very good and interesting book well worth reading for any GWTW fan, be they a "Windy" or not 
 I am not very coordinated and really hated other aerobic workouts I had tried.  This one is fairly easy to follow, Kathy is very encouraging AND there is a plus size woman in the workout who dropped out at different levels - so I didn't feel so bad when I couldn't do the whole thing at first.  I like the way it's broken up because you can do 20 or 30 min on different days and still get a great workout.  I was doing this one before I got pregnant again and this is my video of choice for getting back in shape 
 As a military officer I always felt like TR's actions with the Rough Riders were more to gain publicity than as a professional soldier.  I visited the Rough Rider Museum in Las Vegas, NM in 1995 and that only underscored my belief.  (The only error I found in the book was a reference to the first of many reunions of the Rough Riders being held at Las Vegas, NV rather than NM)  Furthermore, I always thought his actions regarding the great outdoors was a faade of the poor little rich kid that ventured into the wilderness with numerous man-servants at the ready.  After reading this book I realize how wrong I was on all accounts.  Nathan Miller takes us from before TR's birth all the way through his life and does it in a very readable and accurate manner.  Thankfully, Teede, as he was called as a child, kept a detailed diary from the earliest age and wrote numerous letters throughout his life.  These serve to provide a vivid portrayal of a sickly youngster that collected and stuffed hundreds of birds and small animals for his father's Roosevelt Natural Museum.  With his asthmatic condition, coke-bottle glasses (he didn't know he could hardly see until 13) and high-pitched voice he constantly was working to fit-in.  Of course, having inherited sufficient capital to do as he pleased was very helpful.  When I started reading this book I thought I'd read a few pages and before I knew it was well into the book.  Miller does a nice job of tying history together in a way that makes the characters come alive.  Time and again Miller makes a series of observations about TR and then substantiates it with quotes from TR's letters or books.  A very delightful book that's guaranteed to provide you with new in-sights into a leader that would defend our Nation during any time or trouble 
 Koreans honor their greatest military hero in this epic drama which takes place in the late 1500s. The career and tactics of this Admiral are still studied at the U.S. Naval Academy, and doubtless those of other nations. The screenplay is based on a couple of novels, so there is some fiction, but the life of Yi Soon Shin was well documented, so there's plenty of fact supporting the story.   If you are not familiar with Korean Drama, it's good to keep in mind that  this is not a Hollywood product, but they do very well with special effects and such considering the non-Hollywood budgets involved, and it's easy to see past all that and enjoy the tale being told.   It's a long series, but presents an epic with power, depth and dimension and well worth watching it unfold through each and every episode.  It would be great also to see KBS make other dramas available for viewing through Amazon, such as "Seoul 1945".       
 I have not been this excited about a CD since Kem's first CD, "Kemistry". AND THIS JUST MIGHT BE BETTER!!! This CD is nothing but SOUL-ACOUSTIC TRUTH!  I bought it about six months ago, and I am still "wearing it out".  I applaud Alan Thicke for his emotional vulnerability in "Lost Without You" and his musical honesty in "2 the Sky". When he and Faith Evans sing "We've Got to Get It Together," the listener has no choice but to believe that they really mean it.   I bought two of these CDs when I first heard it, just so that I could help to spread the TRUTH.  If you suffer a broken heart, a bereavement, a physical ailment (or if you just don't like rainy days), go online and get Robin Thicke's "Evolution...". For this CD very well could be the musical therapy that might get you cured 
 This is one of the oldies but goodies. I enjoyed this movie as a child and I still enjoy it today with my kids 
 I have used this book repeatedly for my personal studies of  Irish Gaelic. It is the definitive work on the subject. It goes so far as to indicate modern (often shortened) Gaelic spellings alongside of the originals so  that a name's devivation is evidant. So too are inventions (ie.  late-Norman) and borrow-names (ie. Nordic or English) indicated. What did  not make it here, appears in the suppliment More Irish Names. Definately  not for researchers of their family history (try McLoughlin), but rather  the study of the nominclature, the Irish language, or entomology 
 This well-illustrated book is by one of my favorite art historians.  The book is a great overview of Grant Wood's life followed by interesting commentaries on many of his paintings.  Illustrations are very good with most in color.  The book also includes a good selection of parodies of American Gothic.  A great book for Grant Wood fans (at great used book prices. 
 I cannot really say what made me read the Aeneid, except that it jumped off the shelf at me.  The way books do!  Just before, I had read the Odyssey and the Iliad (both were the Robert Fitzgerald translations).  Allen Mandlebaum's translation of the Aeneid was excellent.  I appreciated the glossary, as I referred to it many times.  I also had an old copy of Monarch's notes for the Aeneid and this helped, too 
 This is the best Arabic dictionary I have found so far, but I still have a couple complaints about it. There are a few things missing, like the names of countries, and sometimes the print is small and hard to read. The Al-Mawrid dictionary is more complete, but can be overwhelming, especially for new students, becuase when you look up an English word, it lists a whole bunch of Arabic words and it is hard to figure out which on is the right word. This dictionary, however, has very clear explaination on when to use what word. I would give it five stars if it were a little bit more comprehensive. For the serious Arabic student, this is the best English-Arabic dictionary out there.   For a companion to this, I suggest the Hans-Wehr. Someone complained that this dictionary only included English-Arabic, but that is common for serious acedemic dictionaries though, because it would be huge dictionary if both were included in one volume 
 Well not much to say, and not many to disagree. Good-spirited fun jazz. If you are a music fan looking to get into the oldies a bit, jazz/blues/big-band/swing whatever this is a good starting point. 
 I read this book so frequently when I was a child that my copy literally fell apart.  I've now purchased a copy to read to my own son and am sure that he will enjoy the story of the determined fox family that consistently outwits the greedy farmers just as much as I did.  I always liked Roald Dahl's books because they were not the usual sunshine and teddy bear genre of most children's books.  Instead, the focus is on overcoming adversity with a bit of humor and a lot of sass 
 Wendy has a unique gift of clarifying critical social and cultural questions and at the same time being funny, and entertaining without be flippant or disrespectful.  This book is an absolute treat.     What is very important is that she points out the historical roots of the variety of self-help movements that emerged in the 1980s out of AA and talk shows and non-scientific for profit authors writing books.  They are in right-wing politics, conservative religious attitudes, and documents like Napoleon Hill's 1920s masterpiece of get rich quick hokum "Think and Grow Rich."      While they are trivializing real problems, the essential thrust of these criticisms is to remove the social content of mass pathology and emotional problems.  If I have a problem, well, that is my problem. If sixty million Americans and a similar portion of the population of other advanced nations have a problem, the pathology is not just personal, but in social conditions that produce it.        Yet, the self-help movement and the various attempts to extend the ideas of the 12-step religion launched by Alcoholics Anonymous, deflect pressure and attention from what there is about society that produces these pathologies as well as the need of society to provide care, assistance, and understanding for victims.      Wendy wrote this book about 12 or 15 years ago, but I am sure she would add what the natural successors of this crap is. An immediate one is the circuses of the Jerry Springer show variety, where people with such problems are seen as sport, as unfortunate persons whose entertainment value is prime.  Rather than understanding, we can sit, look gloat, trivalize, and pretend to be separated with people with such problems.      Another problem is the growing "spiritualization" of social and pyschological problems.  "Faith based initiatives" and the retreat from providing social services, support for meaningful psychological research, and the extreme difficulty in obtaining support for good pyschotherapy even for those of us with insurance are not caused by the self-help group, christian conservatives or anyone, but by big business's desires to take resources from the social wages and advantages of all of us.  Yet this self-health confusion undermining the great discoveries of Freud and other early pyschologists that mental health flows from social structure, helps the 
 It's a pity that such a well reknown writer of the Victorian era is so erased and forgotten in our days.  Read Trollope, he's an equal unto Forster and Austen 
 It took a bit longer than I had hoped to receive my study guide but it did arrive well packaged and in good shape 
 As an international music teacher we need to give all theencouragement we can give to keep the music programs alive in ourschools.  Not just in the states but in the world.  This short story relates to the young hopeful musican who hopes to be a contributor to the music world - Keep the dream 
 Havana Police Lieutenant Mario Conde just wants to do the right thing on the job though the Party makes that difficult.  However, he is irate and bitter over the forced replacement of his professional supervisor by a party hack; he deems the job is not worth the political correctness that previously was overwhelming, but now is impossible to navigate without connections.  This Conde decides to join many other professionals by hiding behind rum and cigarettes, preferably imported from another Caribbean island or the States.  However, a fascinating case comes his way so he agrees to put aside the rum, but not the cigarettes to investigate the homicide of a former minister whose job was to seize pre-revolutionary art.  The victim was castrated before he had his head smashed to smithereens.  Besides the violence, Conde wonders why someone living safely in a relatively luxurious lifestyle in Florida would return to Cuba where he had many enemies.  Conde assumes if he can learn that he can figure out the motivation and consequently identify the culprit though a Communist hack accompanies him to insure he investigates in accordance with State policy as the unwritten ones arehe most dangerous all before a hurricane hits.  HAVANA BLACK, the sequel to the superb HAVANA RED, is an excellent Cuban police procedural that provides readers with a terrific investigation while guiding the audience around Havana three decades after the Communist revolution.  The case is top rate as it provides insight into the Florida exile community, the impoverish masses left behind on the island, and the Party hacks.  Few writers can paint a picture of optimism and pessimism with the same stroke as Leonard Padura does through his hero.  The Two colorful Havana tales are winners worth reading unless you are an exile or a Fidel-phile.  Harriet Klausner 
 I remember seeing this movie in the theatre and being moved by this true story.  The message of living your dreams and sometimes having to fight what is expected even when it comes from people who love you is something everyone can relate to.  This is a feel good movie that hammers home that you can become anything your heart desires 
 This is a very well written book about the life and times of a Catholic Parish priest in the late 1800's.  The stories of all the persons in and around his life give one a keen appreciation of all the hard work that this man put into his parish, his community, and the world.  Its amazing how a single young and determined cleric could change the face of society and the Catholic Church in America.  I highly recommend this book for those interested in the life of an ambiguous american hero 
 for all who are faced with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, this book is invaluable.  a scary prospect, a sense of being alone.  this book helps the reader to not feel so alone.  it expertly discusses fatigue, pain, healthcare and insurance, coping, money, and social / familial relations, among many other topics.  more than just a simple discussion book, it really is an exercise booklet.  it helps you to think through, work through, conclude, and deal with various issues that you likely will face at some time or another following your diagnosis with multiple sclerosis.  i'd give it 6 stars if i could.  an outstanding resource for clinicians who work with patients with m.s. as well as for those who have m.s.  certainly worth the price 
 This is the first in what will eventually be a quadrilogy of books, but be warned. There were around 12 years between books 2 and 3 being published so don't hold your breath for book 4.That aside, these are lightweight stories but still entertaining and worth reading. Elvenbane is a tale of the struggle between 'half bloods' and Elves. The lordly elves rule the land with savage brutality. Humans are their slaves and viewed as little better than animals. Occasionally half bloods (a mixture of elf and human) are born. These are feared by the elves due to their strong magical powers, and are usually destroyed as soon as they are born. Shana, the heroine of the tale, is one such half blood. Born in the desert to a mother who died giving birth, Shana is found and fostered by a dragon. No one knows dragons exist until Shana, following her fate as the 'Elvenbane' calls on them for help in the battle against Elves. The last such 'Wizard war' almost wiped out humanity; will it be different this time? Enjoyable story for anyone wanting a quick read 
 Touching poem with striking illustrations! Love it 
 Smith and Fingar take Carr's assertions to task, and tear them to shreds. With clever observation after clever observation, they show how and why Carr is extremely misguided -- and how and why the corporate landscape is and should be changing from IT-heavy to business process management-focused. Smith and Fingar are truly onto something: a means being adopted by many companies to help them become agile, customer-centric, real-time enterprises, with business users, not IT staffers, leading the way. Read this and catch the BPM wave (make that Third Wave, as Smith and Fingar discuss in another work) 
     I found this volume to be extremely interesting, even fascinating at times.  It focuses upon the writing of Winston Churchill's epic "The Second World War," whose six volumes were a major publishing event around the world, and eventually earned Churchill a Nobel Prize for literature. It is really several different books in one.      First, much like Ashley's "Churchill as Historian," the author discusses the actual mechanics of writing so massive a project when Churchill had plenty of other things to keep him busy.  The "syndicate" of experts who assisted him, including even the Parliamentary Cabinet Office, is analyzed in great detail. According to the author, the "three D's" were the core of Churchill's method.  That is, first he had set in type the key documents which he had collected during his wartime service as Prime Minister. Then he tied the documents together with dictated reminiscenses.  Finally, the third "D" consisted of a very large number of drafts whereby the documents were edited down and the connecting narrative supplemented with WC's own recollections or papers drafted by syndicate members. Ironically, it is Churchill's heavy reliance upon documents that at once has yielded much praise from other historical researchers (since otherwise they would not have been made public for as much as 50 years after the war's conclusion),but also generated negative reactions from lay readers, especially in the U.S.       Next, the really interesting issues are tackled.  For example, how candid and accurate was WC regarding his actions during the war?  The author extremely well documents how WC would edit documents, or even modify them, in order to (not surprisingly) put himself in the best historical light.  Also, he was duty bound not to reveal the existence of "Ultra," which was the designation for breaking the German code during the war. Given the fact that in the postwar period, others were also writing books (e.g., Ike with his "Crusade in Europe" and Sherwood's "Roosevelt and Hopkins"), WC would frequently modify his drafts in order to obviate any possible taint regarding his decisions and actions while PM in a stab at vindication.  One good example was the dispute that arose over whether WC had favored or retarded the "Overlord" invasion of France in 1944. Churchill also faced the practical constraints of the Cold War being on-going and also acting as head of the Conservative Party and ultimately PM for a second time.  These factors too influenced how he structured the text.       Of course a most intriguing question is did WC really write the work given the extensive assistance he received?  The author suggests a useful analogy: WC was like a master chef at a large restaurant who designs and directs the menu, while others do much of the actual food preparation.  He also likens it to a group project in science, where a number of folks collaborate on a paper which is attributed to the lead author. Clearly, it is Churchill's book even though he did not write all of it himself--but he reviewed every sentence and corrected or struck out that with which he disagreed.       Finally, in a most interesting discussion, the author recounts the arguments that arose during the 1955-1965 period as other historians, military figures, and the leaders of other countries (such as De Gaulle) took aim on Churchill's analysis.  Not quite as challenging as fighting Hitler, but still quite a nice war of its own.  The author, Professor of International History at Cambridge, has done just a superior job.  Be warned, it is a long book (over 600 pages) and the Penguin edition is set in very small type.  But the rewards of the book more than compensate for these problems, especially for those of us interested in Churchill. The stream of Churchill volumes continues unabated and has even increased recently--but this book should be singled out for the unique perspective it affords us on "the great man."  
 Since I began studying Spanish, Isabel Allende has become one of my favorite authors. In this dazzling novel she does it again. Ines Suarez, the protagonist, an old lady, is trying to set down the tumultuous story of her life, a life which is intimately entwined with the history of her country. Born in a rural town in a backward part of Spain, she journeys to the New World in search of her missing husband, traces his steps to Peru, learns of his death, and manages to survive as one of the few Spanish women in the new land.  Later she enters into a tumultuous relationship with the ambitious and brilliant Pedro de Valdivia, and follows him in his singleminded pursuit--the conquest of Chile. It's a story of endurance, daring, survival, unimaginable cruelty and horror, miraculous survival, a clash of peoples which can have no happy ending, the building of cities, passionate love, and unbearable, tragic losses. I'll say no more. You just have to read the book.  Author Allende writes in her inimitable style--lucid and flowing--that draws the reader in with an unusual sense of intimacy. I found it easy to follow in spite of many words that aren't in my Spanish dictionary. The character of Ines is compelling--a powerful, gifted woman who refused to abide by the stereotyped roles of her time. Amazingly, Allende is able to convey the sweep of history, a story that extends over more than fifty years, without losing that sense of personal connection. I don't know how she does it. Sometimes the feminist message of this book is almost overdone--almost, but not quite. A genius like Allende gets some latitude. I recommend this book highly. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber.    
 Since 1999 I have used the Moosewood Restaurant Book of Desserts for holidays, birthdays, potlucks and recreational cooking with the same result everytime- Absolutely BEAUTIFUL desserts with flavors and textures consistantly worth 5+ stars.  The one exception in the flavor department is perhaps the Red Devil Chocolate cake- a chocolate cake with beets- but every other recipe, from cookies to trifles to poundcakes to meringues is unique and impossible to stop eating once you've tasted the first bite. The book is very well organized and the index and tips/recipe lists are user friendly and helpful.  Its wide variety of recipes will accomodate even the most eclectic array of kitchen ingredients.  To top it all off, cooking with this Moosewood book is just plain fun.   Enjoy! 
 This is a great book covering Fourier Series and Fourier Integrals.  The author makes the material very accessible and I'd recommend this book to anyone currently studying or having studied the subject of Fourier Series/Integrals.  I found the chapters covering pure math to be pure joy since the author's way of presenting the material is so pedagogical.  If you enjoy books on the history of math and are keen on following along intersting derivations on the way to beautiful results, then this book is for you.   
 A must read. America is doomed. Oligarch puppets like the Bush dynasty are facilitating that process of doom. International financiers--the same ones who financed the Nazis--run this nation, and amoral devils, dressed up as "points of light" are taking us down the road to perdition and total collapse. Chaitkin and Tarpley's research is thorough and compelling. If only more Americans knew this stuff; if only more Americans would read instead of watch the idiot box. I leave you with Hosea: "My people perish from lack of knowledge. 
 Somewhere I heard one track from this album and decided to buy it. I would not normally say that I have one favorite album in my collection but now I do. Its awesome, every single song, not a bad one in there. Alison and band found me, now I want to hear everything put out by them 
 Patrick Swayze + Meatloaf + Randy Travis + Trucks = Pure unadulterated awesomeness 
 This is an excellent book.  The anecdotal stories that the author includes make the book much more readable when compared to other parrot guides.  The authors book on Senegal parrots and their family is also full of information. 
 This book was very enjoyable.  I enjoyed the characters.  I am looking for more of the same 
 This novel will not only entertain you, it will inspire you to work hard and do great things.  In fact, the Survey of Lifetime Reading Habits found Atlas Shrugged to be the second most influential book in America (second to the Bible).  Atlas Shrugged draws a myriad of parallels between the characters and situations in the novel to those in the real world.  You will constantly find yourself picking up on these similarities, even after you finish the book.  Ultimately, Atlas Shrugged is a demonstration of Rand's Objectivism, but whether or not you agree with the tenets of her philosophy, you will enjoy this book 
 Paulina Perez's 2nd Edition of The Nurturing Touch at Birth, A Labor Support Handbook is a comprehensive guide for anyone wishing to excel at providing labor support. After several background chapters on the current state of affairs in the childbirth arena, the book delves into the how-tos of providing labor support. Hints, tips, and tricks run the gamut from relaxation techniques, affirmations, scriptures, and suggestions for audio CD's to use in labor, to aromatherapy, reflexology, therapeutic touch, massage, and mental activity techniques. Where this book shines is in its coverage of various positions and explanations of which positions work best for certain situations (such as with back labor or asynclitism). Included are at least 16 different positions, including some this nurse-midwife had never heard of before (the Stomp Squat and Walcher's position)! Black and white photos accompany some of the described techniques and positions. It would have been nice for the others to have at least a simple line drawing to aid in the accurate performance of such positions.  This book is appropriate for any birth setting whether home, free-standing birthing center, or hospital and is useful to labor nurses, doulas, montrices, and midwives. Ms. Perez includes implementation strategies for nurses working in highly technical, low touch environment who may encounter frustration as they attempt to buck the system. Throughout the book, the author offers encouragement and inspiration to those whose work with mothers is needed now more that ever before- the work of humanizing the birthing process.  
 "The Blob," is a very good horror film. When I first viewed the film I figured that this was just going to be another teenager-versus-monster type of film, but I was wrong. The remake of the original is an incredibly well done film. The horror and suspense in the film keeps you on the edge of your seat. Now if you are like me, and have seen a lot of horror films, you might think this is another silly film, and the story and plot a little derivative. Not so! This film is intelligently done, and the acting is excellent.   Not only that, but the film takes a detour from the original: Making the Blob a man-made-viral-eating-unstoppable-monster that is as scary [if not more] than many so-called horror monsters. The cast, which includes (Kevin Dillon) as the main protagonist is very good. With the military and biological warfare scientist's battling the evil that they created, this  makes for a very fun, scary and enjoyable flick. The film went beyond my expectations. More importantly it is a very good horror flick. I would recommend if you have not seen the film to do so, especially since Halloween is right around the corner. And it does belong in your horror collection if you have one. Highly recommmended. [Stars: 4.5]   
 I agree with the other reviews, and only wanted to add to one of them that in regard to examples of chern classes, I believe they also use the whitney formula to derive the chern classes of a hypersurface from that of projective space, which really expands the realm of examples significantly.  This was all I needed in writing my notes on the Riemann Roch theorem for hypersurfaces in 3 and 4 space, for instance.  I felt I knew little about concrete chern classes, but I was able to take the presentation in this book and use it for my purposes immediately 
 I loved this book! Ms. Tsukiyama is such a wonderful story teller. Her talent is so evident in how she beautifully describes her characters and scenary. I fully recommend this book to everyone who enjoys the art of story telling. I am currently reading the part two of Women of the Silk. I am so glad that I didn't listen to a few of the negative customer reviews on this book within this service on Amazon! Boy were those people way off 
 This book is both interesting and informative.  Stephen King provides insight and advice on writing, plus he includes a personal history of his childhood which helped shape the stories he tells.   He also includes a chapter about a horrific experience that he had while walking near his home in Bangor, Maine.   During that walk, an old man driving a van ran into him crushing the lower half of his body.   It took months of recovery time and many surgeries before he was able to start functioning and writing again 
 With a cable modem, took about 1 hour and 15 minutes to download Unbox, install the program and download the episode.  It's a great download speed considering the file is 803 mb.  I was able to still use my computer, IE 7.0 and RealPlayer, so the download is not a resource hog.  The menu bar includes a link to shop for more Unbox titles, which I found very convenient.    The quality is great, but the video stutters in Unbox.  Maybe because it uses 3 applications when playing video?  I chose to watch the episode on Windows Media Player 11 and I had no problems at all.  I've bought and watched 3 episodes, all with the same results.  Fast and unobstrusive download, great quality and low price.  Just use WMP, or another player that can handle wma files, to watch.

 This treatise constitutes a touchstone document in the theory of European art music, especially, that from ca. 1600-1850.  It is a great tool, not only for historians of the music and music theory of the 17th- and 18th- centuries, but also, for  historians of science interested in acoustics.  Definite recommendation 
 This record feels like a quietly spoken, frank, unexpected comment from a friend.  Wilco really has a unique sound, and an individual way of experimenting with different tonal palettes.  At the end of the day, this batch of songs also has enough going on on the melodic surface to leave you whistling a little piece of a song when you're torn away from your listening foray by the world 
 We call him Seizure Dog because the color scheme is, frankly, almost nauseating to grown-up eyes.  But babies react to this little guy like no other toy I've seen.  It was really the first thing that my daughter ever responded to outside of food and people.  She used to fall asleep holding some part of Seizure Dog's anatomy and would wake up playing with one of the various dangly bits.  The high-contrast and bright primary color scheme really draws infants' eyes, especially from generally (and appropriately!) sedate and relaxing nurseries.  We now buy Seizure Dogs for all of our friends with babies.  The next one we get will be the 6th one of these we've purchased, so I'd have to say we highly recommend it 
 ... the basic plot's the work of a genius. Roland and his Tet are carriors of the task to save a "Calla" village from an attack of so - called wolves. The task is fulfilled perfectly, so the newly grown Tet's about to move on which they'd love to do - BUT...  As I said above, the basical happenings are chosen and mostly also narrated afantastically, if the author would only have kept it a LITTLE shorter. E.G. the new Tet member's self - told biography shows some details which don't really wanna fit into the actual Tower story at all; all they show is how the guy came into this world, still Midworld, of course.  Most of the rest, however, is told fantastically, as I said above. When Eddie comes to talk to Calvin Tower about the house ground with the Rose on it ("Waste Lands" readers will know what I mean) or Susannah's mind is caught by another person, differently said: Detta and Odetta receive company, those facts are told GREAT!! 
 It was as great  as I expected and reccomend this series to anyone who wants to feel there is a better place to be comin 
 Gibson's portrayal of a rogue pilot out to make some money above all else sheds light on an all-too-familiar situation that befalls war-torn countries;  Gibson puts on a good performance and is, as always, reason enough to buy the DVD;   recommended  
 I bought this CD back in '91 because both TooShort and D Nice plugged it. I was surprised at how bad ass this white dude was from Michagan. Unfortunatly making music you love doesnt always make money, for instance this album NEVER made any money. Id probably sell out too if it ment a few nights with Pam. Kid isnt the only guy who went pop, Everlast had a pretty funky sound and was down with Big Daddy Kane and he went guitar hillbilly just like Kid. So I cant hate on him too bad.   If you like Kids current stuff , this isn't your album, if you dig old school rap, the golden age of rap when I was rockin tapes like, Life is TooShort, Power, and Straight Outta Compton, in my pull out deck with auto reverse, then you will like this C

 While this is not the best of JAK's Harmony books -- the flower-named novels in the beginning were more intriguing, with their psi energy battles -- it is nevertheless a worthy addition to her earlier work.  I find Harmony to be an absolutely fascinating place (and I particularly liked Rose, the guard dust bunny) and only wish that JAK would produce books in this series more frequently.  As usual, the characters and plotting are excellent, and I hope JAK returns to Harmony very soon. 
 When the Jim Steinmeyer (the inventor genius behind the scenes of today's great magic acts) of 75 years ago, Guy Jarrett, wrote a book on magic he advertised it as 'Terse, pithy, no prolixity, no pictures of magi and bla bla / Read my book and cease being just a "drug store magician" with an apologetic delivery "doing at tricks" and get sense into your head ...' By contrast, Steinmeyer is sober, calm, methodical - but just as good an example of how refreshing it can be to read an author without literary ambition. Everything in Hiding the Elephant is as meticulously thought-out as any of his stage effects. The subject matter is fascinating, and Steinmeyer truly makes it read like a lost world. Of course it is not an instruction manual, but contrary to what others have let on Steinmeyer does explain the tricks. For all these reasons, what we have is a real page-turner, ladies and gen-tle-men 
 In this well thought out and researched book,  Barry Downing provides  evidence that extraterrestrials might have been behind the  "miracles" of "God".  Surprisingly,  this book is  written by a theologian,  though most theologians oppose the Ancient  Astronaunt theory.  You should pick up this book even if you criticize  UFOs 
 This book is a marvel of paper engineering.  After my daughter fell in love with Zelinsky's wonderful "Wheels on the Bus", we had to get her this one.  She adores it, and will choose it most of the time we ask her to get a book.  However, unlike "Wheels", the mechanisms are too delicate for a toddler.  This morning she yanked on one of the tabs, and although nothing tore, one of the little men will no longer go back into his hiding place.  The damage appears permanent.    Highly recommended either for slightly older children or those who will be content to let their parents pull all the tabs for them 
 I ask nothing more of a film than to be able to connect with it, which I did with this film. The other film I have seen from this director is Happiness - I must say I like his style, the way he presents extremely dark subject matter with a sugary-sweet aesthetic.Another pleasing element to this film is the way the characters seem to fall into their predicaments and are unable to resolve their problems, too often we see characters in films tying up all the loose ends in their lives, the director acknowledges the randomness of life in this film.    
 Covered just about any topic concerning sex that you could think of. Very informative and helpful 
 SUMMARY: Her stalker/assailant now safely in jail, antiquities-expert Amanda Crosby has put her life back together and, in the process, has discovered an independence heretofore unknown: she has earned her black belt in tae kwon do, publicly speaks about the necessity of stalker awareness, and even has a column in the local newspaper.  As her life is coming together, her business partner and best friend, Derek England, makes a move that could potentially destroy their antiques shop.  Angry and frustrated, Amanda makes some innocuous threats...and is later horrified when they come true.  Amanda find herself the primary suspect, but as the bodies continue to drop, it becomes apparent that Amanda herself is the real target.  WHY YOU'LL LIKE IT: Amanda Crosby is the most well-rounded and believable heroine of Stewart's trilogy.  She's smart, independent, and decisive, but also vulnerable and thoughtful.  Chief Sean Mercer is an admirable love interest, with his own tragic past.  Two people alone in the world, finding each other in a time of great peril...trite, but extremely effective.  Villainous Vince Giordano is also the most frightening criminal of this trilogy in that there is no real etiology ascribed to his evil; he just is evil.  WHY YOU WON'T: Honestly, I can't think of any real reason why you won't enjoy this novel, assuming you enjoy this genre.  The action sequences are able, as are the romance sequences.  The characters are well-written and enjoyable.  The conclusion is very satisfactory.  BOTTOM LINE: The second and best installment in Stewart's trilogy.  Highly recommended. 
 The Inimitable Jeeves was my introduction to Wodehouse and the colorful world of Bertie Wooster; I loved it! As a matter of fact, I'm now a die-hard fan of Wodehouse. When Bertie becomes engaged to Honoria Glossop, quite by accident and due entirely to Bingo Little, Honoria's father, Sir Roderick Glossop, becomes concerned. Sir Roderick deals with people who are mentally unstable, or, as Bertie phrases it, 'looney.' Unfortunately or, if you know anything of Honoria Glossop, fortunately, Bertie's dead Uncle Henry was 'looney'; Henry kept eleven pet rabbits in his bedroom! Well, due to old Uncle Henry, Sir Roderick wants to meet with Bertie so that he may ascertain whether Bertie is or is not 'looney.' Fortunately for Bertie, Claude and Eustace, Bertie's younger cousins, come to London. Unbeknownst to Bertie, they are in London to steal items so that they may become members of a club at Oxford. When Sir Roderick comes to Bertie's home for luncheon and, of course, to ascertain Bertie's mental stability, or lack thereof, the items stolen by Claude and Eustace cause quite a ruckus! I won't ruin the hilarity of that chapter by describing anymore of the events. Suffice it to say that chapter 8 is HILARIOUS!! All in all, I couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised by this enjoyable book. 
 Going over complete games covering all parts of chess has been my most useful and favorite way of improving my ability to play chess. The planning ahead part of chess using "general rules" which is covered throughout Unbeatable Chess Lessons for Juniors teaches you what is important to know. You also learn when and why there are exceptions to the general rules, making this book much different than the other books I have seen that tell you about every move in the games. I have also improved my openings. The games are arranged by type of opening and there are 24 entire games. The important variations of the openings in the games are told. I counted three very helpful endgames. The Bishop of opposite color with doubled pawns endgame was the best. I also learned a bunch of stuff about sacrificing on weak squares and how to attack against the castled and the uncastled king. One of my favorite lessons was the first one where the king was chased around the board. It was helpful because it teaches about how to attack and how to defend all in one game. I will be getting the second book after this one called More Unbeatable Chess for Juniors for christmas 
 Sex, Intrigue, Adventure . A thriller that has everything! Great reading by him 
 this is one of those bluegrass albums. you cant be without, i love everysong from this album not a bad one at all. bluegrass albums are my favorites by him i was raised on bluegrass music. and i know alot about ricky skaggs, from my dad who is also a mandolin picker and singer and he had the great joy of meeting ricky's sister at a studio once... would love to meet the man himself someday if your a bluesgrass or a rickyskaggs fan then get the album you'll be glad you did 
 Alex Rider is by far the thriftiest boy I know! Horowitz is a great writer and can make the best descriptions! I enjoy reading his books very much. 
 If you or someone you knows has knee problems this is one of the only books you may need. It goes into detail about all different areas from how MRIs can read false positive to what to look for in a Dr. and how to pick one out.   When to look at surgery and when to run from it. He talks to us (the people) who do not know anterior from medial to flexion) he uses plain english and makes some amazing points. An amazing book. 
    In certain ways, this book has been both a bane and a boon to my career as a computational mathematician.  Way back in 1989, I had the mixed experience of taking a course in Numerical Analysis from Brian Smith at the University of New Mexico.  Prof. Smith taught that course exclusively from this book (actually, from the 2nd edition).  As a college sophomore, I was terribly out of my depth, but I managed to do okay.  Later, I had the opportunity to study under Gene Golub at Stanford, although I was certainly not one of his better students :)  Naturally, Prof. Golub also taught pretty much exclusively from this book, by the way, he is a gifted mathematician and wonderful instructor, and a real gentleman.  Between these experiences, I'd say I became extremely familar with the contents of this book.    Okay, back to the actual book.  If you've got a numerical linear algebra problem to solve, and you don't know which NAG or Matlab routine to use, or simiarly can't figure out why your Numerical Recipes ripped-off code is blowing up on a certain matrix, well, you'll find the reason in this book.  The main issue is that you've got to know what you're looking for in order to find it, and that's kind of the kernel of the problem.  Some reviewers have stated that the writing is terse, that it is too rigorous, etc.  I don't really agree with these reviews, but I agree that it is not for the casual reader who wants a quick answer to the question of "how do I invert this thing".  The book spends a lot of time with subtle details such as convergence and stability, and in my experience, these excellent treatments are wasted on most would-be users who are really just looking for a numerical silver bullet, which, of course, just doesn't exist.  I find that the book is an invaluable reference, when I have a problem like this "okay, I've got a small Vandermonde matrix that may or may not be singular.  What's the quickest algorithm to get a stable result?"  Usually what happens is I read this book to understand the method, and then go looking for an existing implementation, usually in Matlab or NAG.  I guess the bottom line is that if you're looking for a "recipe" you won't find them here.  If you're looking for insight and understanding into a numerical method, you will find it here, but you'll have to work to eek out an implementation if you really feel that you need to write one 
 The Spirit Of '94: Version 9.0 is a remix of his 2003 release (Spirit Of '94).  For me, getting this album was a no brainer because 1994 was one of the best years for hip hop releases, so I hopped on this one in hopes that he would rhyme with the same hunger that the emcees back then had.  I must admit that the results are pretty good.  There are tight tracks all throughout the album.  Kaze (pronounced Kah - Zee) rips track after track with a hunger that is rarely heard nowadays.  The production is handled by 9th Wonder and he does a great job of keeping his sound fresh here.  These are some of the best beats I've heard from 9th in a while.    Even though there are so many good songs on the album, there are still a few songs that fall short.  "On" is a bonus track that suffers from some suspect production and it's kind of boring.  The same could be said about "Last Laugh" and "Soul Dojo (Enemy Of The State Mix)" as well.  "50/50" isn't boring at all, but it's one of those songs that I have to be in the mood for or I'll skip it.  Really, the fact that some tracks are boring is the only issue that I have with this album.  The Spirit Of '94 is still a tight album.  9th does an excellent job on the boards and Kaze rips track after track in that old school fashion that's reminiscent of hip hop of '94.  I'll definitely be checking for Kaze on his next go around.  If he continues on like this, he won't be a secret for much longer.  This would make an excellent addition to any music collection.  Highly reccomended.  Standout Tracks: Soul Dojo feat. AK Slaughter, Spirit Of '94, Move Over feat. Nature, Should've Been Here (My Favorite), Stay A Customer, For The Record, & What's Goo 
 If you're intimidated by Tolstoy or Dostoevsky's long masterpieces, consider starting instead with Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons."  This book is of course a masterpiece of Russian literature.  It's characters and themes are timeless and absolutely relatable to our modern culture.  This is a story of family relationships, romance, and philosophy.  Highly recommended.    p.s. When you're done here, try "War and Peace" or at least "Crime and Punishment. 
 Fiona Rosenbloom's You Are So Not Invited To My Bat Mitzvah! (0786856165, $15.99) is both hilarious and revealing, telling of one Stacy Friedman, getting ready for the highlight of her life, her bat mitzvah. She plans for success, friendships and romance, but when she struggles with her mother's idea of fashion, difficulty with the mitzvahs, and conflicts, her bat mitzvah begins to look like more of a disaster than a success. A wide audience, even non-Jewish readers, will appreciate Stacy's realistic dilemmas. 
 How wonderful and unique is this?  I cannot stop buying this series...when is a new one coming?   Just got this again for my neice and her new baby and she is addicted to it.  I have given this CD to 12 people now and BEG you all to try it.  Heartfelt and oh so cute.  Like a fairytale in song.. 
 I LOVE my new Steve Maddens!  They are brand new as described and I received them verrrry quickly 
 This is one of the funniest books I've read. Great characters and excellent dialogue 
 I bought the book after listening to one of Gary Null's guests speak on magnets for healing.  I thought the book was very informative and offered the kind of information that is not yet in abundance as it should be.  I  began using magnets on my achellies tendon which sometimes gets very sore  after playing basketball.  It works.  The only suggestion I have for  improving the book is to provide some typical parameters on magnetic  strength and magnet type for various applications, e.g., for the knee,  foot, neck, elbow, etc.  Specifics of these parameters were not mentioned  in the book and could have been helpful 
 I believe this book would be worth the price if it was just a pamphlet on how to do your own alignment. And on this point it does an excellent job of explaining the process to a shadetree mechanic. It explains in detail, step by step, how to measure and set up a four wheel alignment, as well as how to check your chassis for square. You will be able to set camber and toe at all four wheels using simple tools. I bought a camber guage from Racer Wholesale to confirm the settings but you will only need masons string or fishing line, a jack, a carpenters tape measurer and the patience to follow directions and measure with extreme exactness. The rest of the book is excellent reading too, especially for 70's hot rodding and sports car modifications. A very handy reference that comes off my shelf quite often 
 I believe we have more than one epiphany in our lives, and this book was  at the center of one of my greatest.  I was given a burden which I believe  is one of the heaviest God asks any of His children to carry, and this book  helped set me on a spiritual path which ultimately saved my life and my  sanity.  This is not an easy or sweet look at God's messengers.  It  explores angels in history, in literature, in religions and throughout most  cultures.  I grew up in a religion which was very narrow and which didn't  place emphasis on angels except as they ministered to great people.  This  book changed my mind and opened whole new doors and avenues for  exploration.  I've been on that journey of encouragement and hope for four  years now, and because of it, I see traditional theology differently and  MORE POSITIVELY. I believe the writing of this book was inspired and I  can't thank Ms. Burnham enough for giving me this stepping stone.  I've had  many unexpected and beautiful experiences in the midst of a grief so  profound it's at times physically painful, and this is one of the books  which helped me accept those experiences and know that reality is much more  than the confines of the world we see 
 I would definitely recommend this book to any reader! It is magical and enthralling. During the first page, you will be drawn into Marc's cafe off of the Interstate in Flowers, Kansas and when the last chapter rolls around, you will be crying for more. "The Van Gogh Cafe" makes a great gift for people of all ages. You don't have to be a fan of fantasy and magic to enjoy this 
 This new line of grills is everything you could ask of in a grill.  High BTU output, large cooking surface and good looking.  I was able to maintain constant temperatures with no problem at all.  I am very happy with this descision 
 A wonderful book, with very interesting stories about the subjects. Like EVERYTHING that David McCullough writes, it is wonderful. He is truly one of the Great American Treasures; certainly my favorite historical author. You will enjoy this book 
 This cookbook is exactly what it sounds like- a cookbook about eating more with less. It is not all about eating hamburger but it is about saving money, eating nutritious meals that are cost effective and delicious.   Every recipe calls for normal ingredients that you would typically have on hand in your kitchen. The recipes we have tried have been a hit in my family and have been easy to prepre. The directions are clear and easy to read.   Enjoy. Well worth the money. 
 This book is primarily a book on the art of selling, which you probably already guessed from the title.  It is also much more than that.    If you are in sales, going into sales, or might ever go into sales, you should read this book.    If you think you are not in sales, think again.  Almost every aspect of dealing with other people, is sales.  Want your kids to clean their room?  Sell them on why they should.  Want a raise at work?  You have to sell your boss on why you are worth it.  Want some lovin from your wife?  Once again, you gotta sell her on the idea.  Obviously some things are much easier to sell than others.  I started looking into the field of selling after reading many psychology/trading/improvement books.  Many times I read examples that related a particular topic to the field of selling.  It made sense to me.  Then I started thinking about how almost every interaction with others that I had throughout the day was related to "selling".  I started using many of the techniques I read about and they worked in most situations even though I was not trying to get someone to buy a product from me.  Its still sales!  This book has a lot to offer even if you are not in the sales field.  After reading it I realized I may need to switch careers and start selling.  I am sure I would be good at it 
 I have read alot of WWII history books, so therefore I am very familiar with Ambrose's work.  While it may be hard to say which one is his best because he always did a fantastic job of telling "the story", maybe this is just one of the best stories he had the chance to tell.  This book is a personal inspiration; I have given it to many friends to read and they are always in awe when they return it.  While this book has obvious appeal to any WWII buff, it is such an amazing story that anyone can enjoy it.  Then I saw the HBO series, and oh boy did the story ever "come to life".  Read the book, watch the series, and just be prepared to deal with the overcoming urge to drive to the recruiting center 
 Waiting for Godot was dubbed a "tragicomedy" and there doesn't seem to be any other word better suited to describe this play.  The random and wandering personalities of Vladimir and Estragon, the main characters, lend an amusing air to the entire work.  However, their inability to accomplish anything or even grasp what is really going on around them inspires some sympathy (and irritation), though it may be weaker or stronger depending on how strange the book strikes the you.  Unless one goes into Waiting for Godot expecting the existentialism it can be somewhat confusing, and may seem a bit more pointless than it is meant to be.  Knowing a little bit about Beckett and his beliefs will probably make it more enjoyable, but it is interesting and well written enough to stand on its own.  What I love the most about this book is Beckett's ability to make the absurd seem so close to reality.  Vladimir and Estragon are most certainly not your average Joe, but a lot of what they say seems familiar and most of the time rather humorous.  Waiting for Gogot is really what you make it, because while at its core it is a just a story of two confused homeless men, it is also a meaningful and slightly endearing tale.  Go in looking for a meaning, and knowing how Beckett means to get things across, and I think that this play will end up reading much better than if one goes in just cold.  A short read, and worthwhile, I would say, at least for its originality and humor 
 It's great.  Good folk songs with some humor thrown in 
 As I had just got my first bulldog puppy this was a really informative and helpful book to start off with 
 I like alt history very much. I got burnt out on Turtledove (as many of us have) This story is fresh enough, nearly beleiveable (the 2 russians pilots was too much for me) Better than Fatherland (by a little) nearly as good as How Few Remain. The best thing about R Day is the fresh subject, the Cuban Missle Crissis. Unlike WW2 or USA Civil War, Cuban missle crissis is fresh. I hope Dubois tries his hand at alt history agai 
 Vollmann was always long on both pages and talent, but in his other works he often lost a reader's focus by over-investing in an image or metaphor that wasn't worth its weight, rendering his prose less satisfying than it should have been.  In short, he needed to take the art of revision seriously, as someone like Tolstoy did.  With Europe Central, he's done just that.  By cutting some of the denser moments in the prose, Vollmann has crafted a novel that is, if not sparse, clean and clear in its lushness.  Vollmann creates some beautiful moments and is capable of startlingly apt and original metaphors and images, but he does not overindulge in them as he did in the past, which largely accounts for the success of this novel.  Bravo!  Well deserving of the NBE and a wonderful example of anti-minimalism coming back into vogue (this reviewer hopes) 
 I have had this book for at least 3 years and I got it because like lots of other girls, I liked ballet and it has always been a dream for me, another dream for me is mac'n cheese so, girls if you know nothing about ballet and can't even do a split dont worry, this book is perfect. You can go at your own pace and pick out the excercises that target your undesireable areas but dont pass up the ones that dont look hard, you dont work up a sweat but every one of the stretches does something good, pretty soon people will start to notice you because, you will start walking different, I sometimes do one or two of the balancing excercises before I go out and I have to say that this book will have you striking a pose without even knowing it. There is one thing that I think can be done to make this book perfect. I have literally worn out my book and I would purchase it again if it were smaller and wire bound and use it for travel.  The pictures are lovely and even if you are a "couch potato" this book will do wonders for your posture and personally, the Complete Spinal Stretch has worked out crooks in my back like magic. This is the kind of book that becomes like a big secret because it does not take much for you to feel a difference, the change will be gradual but lasting 
 Truly a classic in compassion.  A great book for budding naturalists as well.  Ever since I first read it, I can't pass a patch of green in the garden without wondering how many little creatures think of that straight line of salad-to-be as their forest and homes... 
 For a novel without much action, intrigue or romance, "One True Thing" catches your attention and holds it until you turn the last page.  This skillfully woven drama tells of the evolving relationship between a young woman, her ailing mother and emotionally detached father.  Ellen Gulden unwillingly gives up her life and career to return home to look after her mother, and finds that there are many things she never knew about the deceptively strong and proud woman.  During the caring and bonding process, Ellen learns to cook, craft, and generally take over her mother's role in the house, while her cynical and sharp edges are unobtrusively smoothed away.  The death of her mother brings a new set of problems, and while Ellen insists on her innocence, she is accused of a terrible crime. During this trying period, her relationships with the people closest to her change considerably, leading to an unexpected ending.     Amanda Richards, December 26, 2005 
 I couldn't disagree more with "a student's" review of this outstanding book. This book serves a purpose that no other book, in my experience as a manager, does. Ms. Straus offers easy-to-understand rules, clear examples, and practice quizzes. I've taken her seminar so I know that she is an expert in this field, a highly sought-after trainer, and generous besides. She has offered the entire contents of this book on her website free to help those who cannot afford to purchase the book as well as to let everyone know exactly what they will get when they do purchase it. I have much more confidence in my writing skills because of this book and am very grateful for it and for Ms. Straus's efforts.  
 The Sources of Normativity is an admirably well written and inspiring book. Korsgaard's style will capture the reader right from the beginning of the Prologue.  In this book Christine Korsgaard is mainly concerned with justifying morality. Her aim is not to tell us what to do, i.e. which moral obligations we have, but rather to show that we do indeed have moral obligations, that we are in fact bound by morality. Korsgaard, having discussed various accounts of the sources of normativity and shown them to be inadequate, gives her own Kantian answer to the question, focusing on the roles we play and our role as human beings. I won't go into details here.  I myself am inclined to disagree with Korsgaard's theory, but it doesn't matter, I still love this book. It is both thought provoking and inspiring, and it's just so beautifully written. It is truly a pleasure to read.  Korsgaard sets out her theory in four lectures (in addition to the Prologue) which are then followed by responses from four distinguished philosophers: G.A. Cohen, Raymond Geuss, Thomas Nagel and Bernard Williams. Korgaard then gives her reply in a final chapter. There is also a very short introduction by Onora O'Neill.  I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in philosophy, and especially if you're interested in moral philosophy 
 I have personally read this book, and ( as a 13 year old), it has drasticly changed my life. There are passages in this book that told me things about myself I never knew. Like this " I'f who I am, is what I have, and what I have is lost, who am I ?" I no longer feal that money or impotance should matter in my life. I should live it accourding to my life, and not by the will of others 
 Our small group studied this book as an intro to the year. It worked well to cover many topics in a short time. Interesting concepts. Easy to read and enjoyable writting style 
 Much of what Cardinal Ratzinger has said here has been said in other works (by him or by others).  However, the given text functions as a thoughtful synthesis of these movements of thought.  It is not an attempt to completely answer the question of pluralism or of the Christian-Jewish relationship.  Instead, this text lays a basic framework for considering Christ's role in fulfilling the Jewish faith, the nature of Covenant as God's self-communication, the nature of the New Covenant, and religious dialogue.  I suggest this text to all but not lightly.  While it is not very esoteric, it is weighty enough to require quiet reflection.  The fruits of reading it are great and also give one a starting point for further thought on the subject material.  I suggest it to all open minds 
 ...you won't find all of it here. But Frey's "Solo Collection" is a great place for casual fans to get "Smuggler's Blues", "The Heat Is On" and "Part Of Me, Part Of You" (from the 'Thelma & Louise' soundtrack).  Almost all of Frey's top 20 hits are here, alongside three previously unreleased songs, and while "Sexy Girl" has dated pretty badly, most of these numbers hold up very well. And the new songs are actually among the best of the lot. Don't expect this to be "The Heat Is On" times 16, though; that one was far from Frey's usual style. After the breakup of the Eagles, Glenn Frey turned himself into a smooth AOR singer with a pinch of R&B and quite a lot of soul in his music, writing most of his songs with fellow musician Jack Tempchin.  That partnership resulted in hit singles like "You Belong To The City", the blue-eyed soul of "The One You Love" and the hard-rocking "Smuggler's Blues", as well as numerous other great songs which would have been nice to have on this album.   The Eagles occationally play some of Frey's songs in concert, stuff like the ballads "Lovers' Moon" and "Let's Go Home", and that low-key side of Glenn Frey is not really represented here...but check out his live album, which is simply called "Live", and then, if your're hooked, his four studio albums "No Fun Aloud", "The Allnighter", "Soul Searchin'" and "Strange Weather". Besides - a CD can only hold so much, and the "Solo Collection" is a very consistent album and a fine introduction to founding Eagle Frey's years out on his own 
 This is a must have for any student taking French. It not only contains the most comprehensive list of Verb conjugations, but also has expressions and vocabulary that goes with the verbs. 
 This three inch thick paperback book is the gold standard in explaining in an historical, logical basis of investigative research of the planned Coup of Cuba and the death of President Kennedy. This book provides documentation of the events that led to JFK's death and who did it!  An excellent history book that is very thoughly researched, with the photocopied secret files to prove it.  Finally an answer to all of those lingering questions of why the Government tried so hard to cover up the factual evidence in this Presidential assassination.  This book is not like Oliver Stone's made up movie about Kennedy's death, but rather the rest of the story that is stranger than fiction.  Until all of the Goverment secret files are released many years from now, this book should correct the innacurate record of American history during this period. Period! 
 This book is definitely good for the little trainer to the little older trainer.  Both of my daughters (13 mos. apart) enjoy this book.  Each have requested on several occasions that I read it to them.  Typically, it is read several times, at least, by repeat request.  The good thing for me, the adult, is that there is still entertainment in the story, the pictures, and the interaction with my little ones.  I am sure that everyone who has or had little ones knows the pain or repetition of what seems quite mindless after the 50th time.  This book is not painful to adults and enjoyable to children 
 Jenel Virden, the author, is my aunt.   I have read the book twice.  The most enjoyable parts are the quotes from my late grandmother, Peggy (Hunt) Virden.   When I read them, I can hear her voice, and the quotes sound exactly like what she would have said.  It's almost as good as a recording.   I can only imagine it's the same for the other children and grandchildren of the women she interviewed and quoted.    I may be a little biased, but I think that my aunt did a very good job of bringing together a variety of voices.  It's also well written.     
 After a 3 year brake are the singer-.songwriter trinity of Blake, McGinley and Love back with their sixth studio album. And of course, they don`t disappoint. It all starts with the imminent first single "I need direction" with ba-ba-ba backing and the airy composition we have missed on the last couple of albums. It goes on with Raymond Mcginley compositions like the acoustic "Happiness" and feel good melodys like "I Can`t Find My Way Home" and "The Sun It Shines From You". This is different from all the sad, insensitive, cynisme, that has stamped weight to much of british pop music after "Ok, Computer." Howdy is Beach Boys, Beatles, Bigstar and Byrds, but most of all it`s Teenage Fanclub 
 I think that the guys who are complaining about this book should understand that it's important to have some atractive devices to people that are interested in jazz but are afraid of so many different opinions, groups, tendencies... In this sense, I believe that this book is important. To many people, specially outside US, jazz looks like a kind of hermetic tradition. It's a nice introduction, though I am sure it's not sufficient once you have already started hearing jazz 
 I bought this for my brother who is a die-hard Homer fan. I wouldn't really consider it a toy but a collectible. I really liked the retro feature of the set going all the way back to the style of the original Simpson shorts (probably only appreciated by adult fans, not kids).   I would not say it is really "fun" as it is more of a display item and certainly not educational but overall it is a really cool item for any fan to own. 
 I'll be the first to admit that it took me a solid 4 or 5 times of listening too it before I really liked it.  This album is very much "80's" and is quite different from Wonder's previous masterpieces.  It took me a while to get used to this new style Stevie was using, but after that it stands in my mind as a truly great album.  One thing about any of his albums is that they do not lack any depth lyrically, Hotter than July is no exception.  He's on point as ever with "Rocket Love" & "Cash In Your Face".  Musically this album is more fast paced and jams more so than his previous efforts.  "Did I Hear You Say You Love Me", is a great groove and "I Ain't Gonna Stand For It" is a quite impressive track with the inclusion of country elements.  "Do Like You" is a solid track, and perhaps the only one I skip is "As if You Read My Mind" (You might not though). What makes this album work more than any other factor is musical gems found on here.  "All I Do" & "Master Blaster" are both classics in his catalogue & of course "Lately" is one of his finest (both musically and lyrically).  "Happy Birthday" is also essential if only because of its historical value.  Despite the strength of some individual tracks it does lack the overall as an album that we've previously come to expect with Wonder.  But, what you have is a 45 min run time album that is just full of solid tracks.  It's truly a testament to Stevie Wonder that, while many great artists of the 70's collapsed when they tried to adapt to the 80's style (look no further than Led Zeppelin), he was able to still convey his musical genius.  This album is definitely not a masterpiece, nor close to touching the genius of his previous albums.  Perhaps it's not his best, but does that take away from it?  Are we just too spoiled by his previous efforts?  Bottom line:  It's still simply a great album and only further adds on to Wonder's legacy.  One of the best albums released from the 80's era 
 I read "Slant of the Sun" and immediately had to read more of Beth Kephart's prose. She is amazing. This book, while not as emotionally grabbing as the first, is lovely. Kephart makes writing looking effortless -- it's so lyrical, and her stories are everyone's stories. If you've ever pondered friendship and stuggled to understand its heart, this is the book for you and your friends 
 DD found this book at the library and wanted it read to her CONSTANTLY, around the time she seemed to be getting interested/willing to try the potty. She liked it so much I went and bought her her own copy.  She enjoyed other potty books/videos, especially "Once Upon a Potty", but for some reason this one seemed to be the one that did it for her and made the whole idea click.  I think it's well-written and nicely illustrated. Kids can easily identify with the pictures and with the few false starts that Ashley has on the potty, and the questions asked help draw them into the story as it's being read.  DD is 4 now and has been potty-trained for over a year, but still likes to re-read the book on occasion.  I've given it to friends who are going through the potty-training stage, and they've all been happy with it too 
 Gale Pryor is passionate about her subject and very serious (but not too). This is not a self-help style book full of lists and happy quotes. She provides lots of background information about breastfeeding and mothers working outside the home that is much more encouraging than, for instance, The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding, which treats going back to work as a choice we make for "extra money." And yet this book has the same (and more) practical detail about all sorts of breastfeeding concerns, from mastitis (ouch!) to how long to store breastmilk that's been pumped during work hours. Really helpful. Good attitude. Of course the La Leche League book is also worth having, it's just a little hard on working (outside the home) moms, in my opinion 
 The music is fuel that is pulling you and pushing you to emotionally tag along! Fun and somehow soul searching at times... but always the laugh at the end! The blend of voices both touch the inner heart - almost mournfull at times... and then the booming joyfull sounds that bring the full on shine out of you!  YOU WILL JOIN IN!!!  GREAT BIG LISTEN! 
 This is a very good version of Verdi's Don Carlo. Its quite good to see the orignal 1st act that usually is taken (in a  live performance meybe is better skip to act 2). All the singers make a real good job, from Quilico, who is pretty old in the reconrding, but still has the heart (but the voice sound a little tired on the high notes) to Furlanetto (who looks very funny with all the makeup, in that recording he must be about 30 i think). The comparison between this version and the Karajan one (with doenst have the first act) is inevitable. I preffer the Don Carlo of Domingo over the Carreras (Carreras is very good in the karajan version, dont get me wrong, but when you have two good voices, the one that can act wins), the Rodrigo is better sung by Capuccilli, but Quilico has something special abut him... Both Elizabetha are impresive, and also the Eboli's. Ghiaurov is amazing, but Furlanetto has a deeper voice (i mean Furlanetto as Phillip). The Inquisitors are very good in both versions, but Salminem is my favourite over Furlanetto (also because haring the duo between Phillip and the Inquisitor of the Karajan version in high volumen can really sacre you). I slightly preffer the Karajan version (because of karajan too) but this is also worth the buck 
 This book, called the 12 & 12 around here, is the best available source for studying the Steps in more detail. Of course, the Big Book ("Alcoholics Anonymous") is the place to start and it contains the program of action required to attain and maintain sobriety. What I have found to be an effective way to work the Steps is to use the 12&12 as a reference as I go along, with the Big Book as my primary text, and discussing all of this with a sponsor (an alcoholic who has made some progress working the Steps who shares his/her experience, strength, and hope with a newcomer on an ongoing basis). Some have found it possible to get sober using just the book(s) and/or meetings, but my observation is that most of these people end up working the Steps in a confused way, or worse, don't really work them at all. Sobriety is about a new way of life free of alcohol, and this life is meant to be happy, joyous and free, not merely "dry" and miserable. The best way to achieve this is to get a sponsor and make use of that sponsor, which will likely involve reading these books and considerable other action as well. See you at a meeting 
 There are many pictorial histories of flight available (I can't imagine an all-text history of the same subject), but this one has to be the jewel in the crown.  True, there is not much on the pre-flight days of Leonardo and baloons and weird contraptions that crashed into the marshes.  But the rest is a sheer delight for the eyes and compiles enough information to make it more than just a collection of pictures.  Pretty much anything DK Publishing does is first rate, sometimes a bit too polished for my taste.  But this is a perfect vehicle for the DK Publishing magic touch, and they pull it off extremely well. And that paper!  Great gift material 
 This is an absolutely incredible disc. There is not a stagnant number on the CD. All these cats can PLAY! One gets the sense they are really having fun doing this stuff. They need your support so get out there and support  this music before its gone 
 I saw these guys open for the Counting Crows/Goo Goo Dolls show a few weeks ago and wanted to hear more. This album gets better and better each time you listen.  It's now on constant play in my car.  I would also say it is much better then their live stage show, at this point.  
 I read this book a few months back and I'm still not decided on whether I 'loved' this book or not.  I did like the book.  It provided a lot of information I wasn't aware of, but I'm not sure I really liked the set-up of the book or some of the content.  The main focus of this book is basically what hidden aspects of growing up stress a child out, and how that stress affects a childs development.  He touches on some of the basic aspects like divorce, and death, but most of the book focus's on things that force a child to grow up too quickly.  The main conclusion of every single argument in the book is anything that forces a child to grow up too quickly or puts pressure on a child beyond their natural capabilites is stressful for a child.  The first half of the book is kind of a summary of the second half of the book, which almost makes the first half pointless.  The whole time I was reading it I was getting a lot of interesting information/opinions with very little proof of the points he was making. But the authors points and the information he was providing was interesting.  The best chapter of the first half of the book is the chapter on Lapware (computerized learning devices).  He provided great arguments, and very valid proof to back up his claims.  His information would be great to base future lapware studies on.  I don't want to blow this chapter for you, but his basic point is that lapware doesn't teach a child anything that he/she doesn't already know.  The second half of this book is extremely well organized, and perfect for parents, or anyone with basic knowledge of child-development.  I study child development and I don't know that I've read a better book or text-book that puts Piagets development periods or Erikksons theories into better context than this book does.  The way he was able to use those theories in connection with his own research, and other research was excellent.  It almost makes me wish this book had a broader range of topic.  I could apply the information in this book to pretty much every child I know.  If you have a child that shows any self-confidence problems this book will be very helpful to you.  There's nothing mentioned in the title or the description about self-confidence, but after reading the book it's easy to see how the demands put on your child affect their confidence.  There is a lot of basic information on various topics from the basic biological reactions of stress, to how schools operate.  He makes very compelling arguments against the idea of "early is better" in education.  He also provides good evidence in favor of keeping the arts in schools by showing that activities like gym, music, and art help children relieve stress which helps them focus more on academics (in addition to their artistic values).  At times I found some of the information in the book repetitive.  He touches on certain subjects like divorce, drugs, and education numerous times.  It's all good information, but I would have liked to have read more on media effects and social aspects with other peers than was offered.  Perhaps the best thing about this book is that it provides a good balance between statistical data based research without being so dense it's not readable by an average parent.  The writing style is very basic, and his research is based on stats just as much as his own experiences as a therapist.  So he backs up any technical data with a personal example to explain it and back it up.  It's somewhat of a perfect book for parents looking to understand more about their children, and people looking for an easy book to read with solid research 
 Agatha Christie began her series of Hercule Poirot mysteries in 1920 with THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES.  As the novel opens, it is 1917; the Great War is on, and Lieutenant Arthur Hastings, the novel's genial narrator, has been wounded.  To recuperate he goes to the country estate of a friend, John Cavendish, who lives with his wife, Mary, his younger brother, Lawrence, and a girl, Cynthia, who is the ward of his stepmother, Emily Agnes Inglethorp, who owns the estate.  Mrs. Inglethorp has recently married a man twenty years her junior, whom no one else in the household likes - least of all her paid companion, Evelyn Howard.  Hastings' restful sojourn at Styles is interrupted when Mrs. Inglethorp is poisoned, in a classic locked-room scenario.  Hastings then joins forces with Hercule Poirot, a Belgian refugee and former police inspector living in the village, to hunt down the murderer...and a partnership is born. The story's quaint country-house setting and its depiction of the beginnings of Poirot's English career are its most memorable features.  The intricate murder-plot is great fun, and in developing it the author uses a technique for misleading the reader which she would repeat in later stories.  I can't explain what the technique is without revealing the novel's ending, so I'll just say that THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES is a detective story that should prove just as enjoyable for longtime fans of the charming Poirot as for those new to the character and his creator, Agatha Christie.  Also highly recommended, for those who have finished the novel:  the superb made-for-TV version of THE MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR AT STYLES, starring David Suchet as Poirot and Hugh Fraser as Hastings, and available on DVD from Amazon.com.          
 This is a very helpful book for dealing with cancer and grief.  The author makes it easy to read; the sections are short and meaningful.

 This book, lavishly populated with some grand illustrations, gives the reader a good historical perspective on an ancient brotherhood (and more recently quasi-sisterhood).  It serves as a repository and historical overview of freemasonry around the world, its possible origins and written history since the early 18th century.  Without going into too much detail, the book offers an overview of some of freemasonry's more famous members in Europe and in North and South America respectively.  I would recommend this book for anyone interested in a general working knowledge of the Craft, although there are a couple of historical citations that may or may not be completely accurate 
 First off let me say that I found Jason Falkner through my love of Jellyfish. I doubt anyone listening to this CD hasn't heard of Jellyfish-but if you haven't stop right now and pick up they're two CDs. That said, Falkner is a genius in his own right. His first album "Author Unknown" was steller (to say the least!) "Can You Still Feel" is almost just as good-however I was a bit dissapointed with a few of the songs.  For one thing the songs seem to be longer. 'The Plan' and 'Revelation' stand out as being too long (especially 'Revelation' which, I'm sad to say I skip). 'Revelation' is a song about how wonderful and alive the world is...that's great. In the execution, however, Falkner ends up sounding like a High School aged poet (I know I've written at least one poem very much like 'Revelation').  In fact, this one song is probably what knocks down an otherwise solid album. 'My Lucky Day' kicks total ass-with it's groovy keyboards and torid lust story.  'Eloquence' reminds me of 'Afraid of Himself' from "Author Unknown" though I'm not sure why. 'Honey' and 'See You Again' are lovely pop songs (about love, of course). The second track 'Author Unknown' shines brightly as well...but some of the magic from the first album seems a bit gone.  Falkner still plays all of his instuments, and does all of the singing-maybe he needs to inject some new blood into his records. Granted, both of his albums stand head and shoulders over everything on MTV (one and two)and whatever's on the radio.  I love his music, but I think he'd lighten up a little if he had a few bandmates again. Perhaps as a music fan I'm the one who needs to 'lighten up' and just bask in Falkners artistic glow.  If you like Pop that's not for kids, give Falkner a listen 
 You don't get much of M.F.K. Fisher's colorful history, any deeply revealed gossip or scandal.  And you leave the book knowing that's exactly what makes this a great read.  It's a chronicle of an always loving,  sometimes difficult friendship, where the subject has definite boundaries  you just do not cross.  A lovely, if light memoir 
 This Cd is a classic. To this day (as was the case at a cousin's wedding reception recently in Charlotte, NC), the likes of "Children's Story" and "The Moment I Feared" can still pack dance floors nearly 20 years later.  Overall, this is one of the best rap Cds of all time. Ricky "Slick Rick" Walters was/is the UNCROWNED KING (well, since he was also known as "Rick the Ruler", maybe he WAS crowned) of rap storytelling. This is one of the few rap Cds that are as much fun to listen to as well as dance from. He was a brilliant, creative, and imaginative lyricist and rhymester with his unique style, and no two songs on this Cd are lyrically or musically alike. He was one of the few who took full advantage of the format of rap to tell some really interesting stories that took listeners to another level.  The one downnote is that Rick sends some really mixed messages here. While "Children's Story" and the lovely "Hey Young World" as well as "Teenage Love" has our hero laying down some pretty positive stuff for his younger fans, there's also the negativity and misogyny of "Treat Her Like a Prostitute","Indian Girl," and "Lick The (you get the idea)" that foreshadowed the lows that NWA and future rappers would take along this dark line. In another ugly sign of things to come, Rick's publicized imprisonment (from a case eerily similar to "Children's Story")stifled his future output and stalled a great career (as would be the case with many future, albeit less talented, rappers)  It would be nice if he were to record with his onetime partner and fellow storyteller Dana Dane of the unrecorded Kangol Krew of the early 80s. Now THAT would be an amazing record (they appeared together only once in recent years to my knowledge in a film perfroming with Rick's later partner Doug E. Fresh).  But we can be thankful for what's here and enjoy it for what it is. The title fits. Good night 
 'The Unofficial Guide to Starting a Small Business' is a well-written manual for the entrepreneur whose corporate ambition is focused closer to Everest's base than to its summit. When I recently showed this book to my good friend Donald Trump, he said, "Schwarz, you're right. This is a terrific book, but there's another way to start a small business that just can't fail. Acquire a large business and instal Enron's ex-chairman Kenneth Lay as CEO.&quot 
 I have been working in MRI for 8 years and I think this is the best book I've ever read. This edition is well made than last edition. The figures and images are very useful. 
 Amateur gardeners often associate vegetable production with labor-intensive work - but it doesn't have to be that way, if you use self-watering containers to grow veggies in pots. Ed Smith has been vegetable gardening for over fifty years, teaching courses on the topic: his INCREDIBLE VEGETABLES FROM SELF-WATERING CONTAINERS USING ED'S AMAZING POTS SYSTEM emphasizes organic yet trouble-free growing techniques.

 Crichton is one of my authors I have to be in the mood for. I tend towards his early medical stuff, just as I tende towards the earlier versions of ER (actually quit watching it years ago). Chrichton is an intelligent writer, and as this is one of his earliest books you can see for yourself how he has developed as a writer.  In some ways, I think he earlier stuff is better, partly because he is writing closer to his 'area of observation?'   The book is about a touchy subject, abortion during the sixties before Roe V Wade. It was known to be done, both inside and outside of hospitals, and though I am personally not pro-abortion...I would not want to go back to the era before that when women died having abortions. This is a personal choice area, and Crichton was obviously working his way through his own feelings on this subject. This whole area doesn't just start with the abortion; it starts with parents teaching children responsibility, families that act as families, the whole thing. To debate here or in one book would be senseless.  Crichton mystery had me going in several wrong directions before I finally understood what was going on...which is good. I don't like knowing 'who done it' three pages into the book.  Interesting, older read for summertime reading...  Karen Sadle 
 If you're the type of person who's constantly asking your computer-savvy kid for assistance, this is not the book for you. On the other hand, if you are that computer-savvy kid, this book will get you up to speed with Access.  I've been using relational databases for a very long time, but I never really used Access. Sure, I created a few small Access databases for some VB programs. But that's about as far as I ever got with Access. Then I recently wanted to create a database application for my own personal use, and I thought: "why not use Access?"   Well, I quickly found out that not everything in Access is all that obvious to an old database pro. But, Ms. Balter's book helped me to get going. She has a knack for just touching on the essential basics and then covering the more advanced topics in greater detail.  The book is very well organized. It's easy to find what you're looking for. But it's also organized in the sense that, if you think you know something, you can safely skip that chapter without feeling as if you missed something important in the next. And for a book with some 1400 pages, that's pretty important. Especially if your goal is to finish a project and not to read a five pound book 
 This is a must read for anyone interested in management, albeit written 40 years ago, many of the things in this book is part of today's B-School's curriculum 
 Great item.  Rec'd it in wonderful shape.  Packaged well to withstand droppage and anything else that might have happened to it.  
 I purchased this book for a college course on American social history.  It was nice to open a book with tons of pictures and interesting, but not too intellectually stimulating, text.  Kasson's book was a welcomed change from most of the books required in my college classes.  The basic theme of the book is that, during the turn of the twentieth century, the American social fabric was changing with industrialization, urbanization, and immigration.  These well-known changes seeped down into leisure society as well.  The rigid Victorian weekend activities of museum and symphonies was giving way to less "genteel" forms of entertainment such as movies, prize fighting and amusement parks.  Coney Island was "a harbinger of modernity."  The book covers the history of the park including specific attractions like the Steeplechase and Luna Park as well as its demise, losing "its distinctiveness by the very triumphs of its values."  What's even more valuable than the text is the wonderful photographs that really capture the joy visitors experienced.  It is only 112 pages and full of these photos, so it definitely makes a light, fun introduction to early 20th century American culture in general or, specifically, to Coney Island history 
 This novel is intricate and unforgettable. The now common phrase Dead Man Walking does not begin to capture the tense, sensitive life of an unfairly doomed man and a woman who takes such chances to love him. Challenges all our ideas about bearing fair witness, justice, and goes on for years.  Rich character development, rich writing.  A rare find 
 Seu Jorge is a natural performer - his performance in City of God shows you what it's like to be righteous at all costs, his performance in A Life Aquatic shows you what it's like to sing even if no one gets it, and his performance on Cru does both of these and much more.  He's truly a unique performer.  He reconstructs samba, batucada & hip-hop with a flare that is truly Brazilian.  
 We chose to give copies of this book as gifts for Christmas and the responses from our friends and family have been unanimously positive.  I would recommend it for all of the wanna-be pirates in your life 
 I got some good tips from the book. It helped me get familar with the layout of the area. In short, the top things I learned from the book were:  1) At the Puerto Vallarta airport keep your head down and don't talk to anyone. They're all trying to sell you something.   2) Use the pedestrian walk to cross over the highway and get a cheaper cab than from the airport. (We bargained and got a $13 USD ride to Nuevo Vallarta)  3) Vallarta Adventures is a reputable tour group in the area. We booked all our tours through them in advance on their website. www.vallarta-adventures.co

 Inherently entertaining and informative, Art By Committee: A Guide To Advanced Improvisation offers its readers an inspired and inspiring understanding of the philosophy and visual outlook of life through the wisdom and guidance of Charna Halpern. As a long-term improvisational co-creator and comically creative mind, Charna presents Art By Committee as her most informative and constructive guide to date through the incredible art of improv acting and performance. Art By Committee is very strongly recommended for all students of acting and improvisational comedy, as well as those searching for a personal history of Del Close and Charna Halperns. 
 The book was delivered to me within 5 days and was in excellent condition when I received it. The book is excellent.  It provides some great ideas for hockey fitness.  The only draw-back is that a good portion of the book deals with on ice fitness exercises and unless you're a professional hockey player, it is very difficult to have a clean sheet of ice to yourself to work on conditioning.  However, there is enough to keep you busy 
 William Brown  July 6, 2006 Blue Group 		This is a review about The White Mountains. It was amazing!  The author of this book is John Christopher and this book is a science fiction novel. I think this book is recommended to 10-16 year olds, but if you think this book will interest you should read it. In my opinion I really liked the book.  There was this one main character in the story that really fascinated me his name was Beanpole. It all began in a little village and this boy named Will who was 13 years old. He ran away from his village so he wouldn't  be capped. Will doesn't want to be capped because Caps are mind controlling devices that the Tripods use on humans to make them their minions. When the Tripods cap the humans they have no control for their actions. I think you should read this book because this novel is interesting and exciting! The narrator of this novel is Will. Will tells all about the story he tells when he meets new people on his journey. I hope I persuaded you to read this book because it is a really cool book with all the action and the adventurous journey. Now you know a little about The White Mountains. 
 This 2-in-1 is amazing.  The scent is wonderful...too bad they don't make it for adults :)  A very gentle cleanser that can be used for babies and toddlers alike.  It actually cleans the skin and leaves it soft and smelling beautifully.  I love Mustela products so much that I got rid of every other product that I had that wasn't Mustela.  Fifteen donated bottles later the only products that still remain in our home are these products.  Try them and you'll see why 
 we love the bear series and cannot wait for the new one in september!  terrific books for toddlers.  my 3 yr old recites in along with me 
 Americans need to understand the horror of the Saudi Arabian government and this book provides it.  The Saudi 'Royals' (euphamism for dictators for life) are nearly identical to the recently defeated Taliban government of Afghanistan. All thoughtful and freedom loving people of the world would be alarmed by the expose of this book: There is no democracy in Saudi Arabia, no free speech or freedom of religion.  Censorship of media is extreme: All newspapers, magazines and books are strictly controlled by the government. Minority religions are brutally dealt with. Women are not allowed to drive, to appear in public without an abaya, to travel without permission from a husband or father, to work, to mix with any men outside their family. The justice system is the most barbaric and capricious form imaginable: routine torture, beheadings, amputations.  There are thousands of 'disappeareds' every year. (Even such things as 'pets' are prohibited by the government!)  This book provides an in depth look into the corruption of the Saudi Government--King and Company spend the BILLIONs in oil wealth and we all know those stories! The reader is left with an enlightened understanding of the price America pays for turning a blind eye to the Saudi Kings abhorrent abuse of power in return for our low oil prices. A must read 
 "As President of an Austin, Texas "early-stage" company, I find myself utilizing "A Good Hard Kick in the Ass" on a very regular basis.

 While most American schoolchildren in the U.S. are taught of the American Revolution as a glorious struggle of backwoods colonials fighting for their freedom and independence against the world's most powerful empire, few, if any, are taught of the great tragedy experienced by African-Americans, many of them former slaves, who fought with or sided with the British in the hopes that they would secure their individual freedoms.  I was one of those many schoolchildren inculcated in the myth of the Revolution, but I have since expanded my knowledge of the Revolution beyond the history texts.  Despite this, I was not aware of the globe-circling stories of former slaves of the American Revolution as carefully documented and researched by Cassandra Pybus in "Epic Journeys of Freedom".  But now that I am, I hope these stories become more widely known as examples of not only the failure of the American Revolution to live up to its ideals, but more important, as examples of the unquenchable human desire for freedom and the extent to which brave men and women will go to find it.  I cannot do justice to any of the individual stories in "Epic Journeys of Freedom" in this or any review, and much of the immediacy and drama of the stories come from the first-hand sources of the era that Pybus has collected and orchestrated into compelling narratives.  By retelling the history of individual lives set within the context of the American Revolution and its aftermath, Pybus reduces a mythic, seminal event in America's founding to a personal level.  The eyes through which we see the Revolution, however, belong not to the victors, but to the disenfranchised and dehumanized; America's victory meant their enslavement, so they fled the land of liberty to seek their own freedom across distant borders and oceans.  Some may ask why bring up more stories of America's past injustices when we have come so far in addressing them.  We read these stories and remember their lives because they remind us why men and women have risked all and died for their freedom.  They remind us of both our worse and better natures, and offer hope for a more just and free world 
 This book is not very simple, so I don't recomend it to the beginners. But for advanced programmers for c++ this is must-have book 
 A CHILD'S CELEBRATION OF DANCE MUSIC is a wonderful collection of music put out by the Music for Little People label.  There aren't very many people familiar with the albums released by Music for Little People, but thier label produces some of the best collections of popular music suitable for families that I have ever come across. Most of their albums are centered around a theme or type of music (Country, Rock and Roll, etc.) and it's all good stuff sung by the original artists.  No Britney Spears or boy band songs here. Instead, songs that at one time were fairly popular, but that are now somewhat obscure are brought together with a few better known hits.  This collection includes songs that are fun to dance to.  Some of my favorites include:  "Twist" by Chubby Checker  "Disco Duck" by Rick Dee and His Cast of Idiots  "I Want You Back" by the Jackson 5  "Palisades Park" by Freddy Cannon  "Wooly Bully" by Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs  Children and adults will both delight these songs. I can attest that I've used the album for small dance parties I've had with my friends, as major music for a 50s theme meal at a summer camp, and played it many times on the children's radio show I once djed and produced and on the webradio show I currently host. So, "Come on baby, let's do the twist. 
 This book is for anyone with an interest in psychedelics (for or against), not only ketamine.  In addition to a wealth of information concerning K (touching upon both its light side and its dark side) the author presents intelligent views on broader issues such as the demonization of drugs in modern industrial society and whether psychedelic  experience is entirely brain-generated or is more like tuning in to information coming from somewhere else. This is a very readable book written by someone at the  cutting edge of modern consciousness research and is  highly recommended 
 Right from the very beginning of this information-packed, meticulously researched and documented primer on the thinking, tactics, and training methods of today's terrorist threats, I repeatedly asked myself, "Why have we not heard more about this book, and why is it not required reading for all members of the Defense Department?"  Poole very clearly described the adaptive and holistic nature of the challenges posed by our adversaries in our ongoing global war on terrorism.  Through historical analysis and his experienced infantryman's perspectives, Poole was able to show how low-tech, determined and fanatical small units can neutralize or defeat modern firepower-dependent high-tech forces when they combine social, tactical, cultural, societal, political, spiritual, and psychological norms and methods into an integrated strategy.  Poole made a very compelling case that failure to understand this holistic strategy and a failure to appreciate the strategic value of exceptionally-trained, autonomous, light-infantry forces to combat that strategy is the perfect breeding ground for terrorists and the initial steps down the path to ultimate defeat.  Provocative and thought-provoking, Poole's questions and observations about the present state of our ground combat forces relative to our main threats are certainly relevant in any discussion of how to approach today's style of warfare (fourth-generation warfare) that has been evolving for generations:  *"In a world where unconventional warfare has become the state of the art, firepower no longer ensures victory." *"How could Muslim guerrillas with hand-held weaponry have defeated Soviet and Israeli regulars with "state-of-the-art" aircraft, artillery, and tanks?  Did those guerrillas enjoy a tactical advantage at short range?  If so, will American troops fare any better against them in close terrain?" * "...[O]ne wonders what will now happen to tactical reformers in the United States.  Will their constructive criticism be construed as providing comfort to the enemy?  Without admitting to an occasional battlefield loss, the U.S. military would have no reason to take corrective action.  Its "top-down" bureaucracy prevents it from rapidly adjusting to guerrilla initiatives." *"America Must Not Respond in Kind to Evil" (section title) *"Tactics and Morality Are Not Mutually Exclusive" (section title)   If you truly want a new perspective of what is going on inside and behind today's headlines, read this book.  You may not agree with Poole's perspectives, but I guarantee he will challenge and stimulate your thinking about how our military and our coalition partners are doing in the global war on terrorism, and how we can possibly do better in the years to come.    
 "Daisy Miller" is one Herny James's biggest successes, and it can be read as a rehearsal for his masterpiece "A Portrait of a Lady" that was the book we published after this one. A little longer than a short story, this book is a quick read and one of the most accessible works from this writer.   One highlight of this book is the descriptions of characters and places. Although "Daisy Miller" is not long, James found a way of thoroughly depict the main characters and the settings. Paragraphs are constructed only to show the reader how Daisy is. Contrary to what one may think, it is not boring -- actually it is very pleasant, since the descriptions are so vivid and organically incorporated to the narrative.  The plot has much in common with "A Portrait of a Lady" and the main theme is James's favorite: the culture clash between Americans and Europeans. Daisy is a free spirited American girl spending some time with his family in Europe, when she meets Winterbourne, a young American `student', in Geneva. The girl's behavior has scandalized local society. And she's been punished for that. As Isabel, the main character of "A Portrait...", Daisy will have to assume the consequences of her acts.   James has created an enchanting character in Daisy Miller. She is a little naïve, a little mischievous but, above all, she wants to follow only her will. And, probably, this is her major sin, in those times when people were forced to follow society's strict rules. 
 I'm just like you.  I check the reviews on Amazon when I'm shopping an item, to get a realistic cross-section of opinions. Throw out the really good ones, as well as the really bad ones, and you get a good idea. It's been pretty dependable for me so far.  I did a ton of research before I bought this unit. I was going to be backing up my home movie collection (about 100 great movies), and I needed this machines ability to make case sleeves and disc covers that were not obvious copies. A mall investment in a Type C tray, available from a few on EBay, and you're good to go.  5 stars in that regard, alone!  Yes, if you ask for excellent quality in your copies, this machine will use a fair share of ink. What's fair? Who knows. With all the options available nowadays, those that stroll into department stores (yes...even Walmart), and pay full price for replacement cartridges are missing the boat. EBay....Amazon....Continuous Ink Supply (CSI) Systems....you name it....ink cost should NOT be a factor when deciding whether to buy a copier.  Ability. Dependability. Smart design. This machine is a winner.  Simple as that 
 A 12 year old boy wishes to have one of Old Three Toes' wolflings. When  Bubs, one of his schoolmates finds the den he hopes to get the wolfling  before Bubs and his father smoke out the wolves 
 In Jig and Reels, author Joanne Harris (most famous for her magical realism novel Chocolat) treats her readers to a selection of twenty-two stories, only one previously published.  Some, such as the playfully defiant "Faith and Hope Go Shopping" are surprisingly realistic while others embrace Harris's trademark fascination with fairy-tale lore and magic realism.  "Gastronomicon" unfolds as a young wife decides to experiment with recipes near the end of the ancient cookbook given to her by her mysterious mother-in-law.  "Ugly Sister" and "The Little Mermaid" re-tell fairy tales in a more modern, more twisted way.  "Class of 1981" explores, as Harris says, "what happens when the magic runs out . . ."  Some stories are little more than conceits - in the final story "Eau de Toilette" we meet a parfumier of another time who just happens to be someone famous.  This uneven collection remains an exhilarating read, mostly because Harris seems prepared to try anything, to slyly poke fun at expectations and cultural traditions.    I wish that Harris had not chosen to preface each story with a short explanation of why she wrote it; it takes the magic out of the illusion.  Once the reader gets into these stories, however, he'll find them witty and much more vibrant than the bland introductions.   Even those stories which cry out for greater development, or a less-than-rushed ending, will charm readers with their originality

 This little book is an excellent way for beginners to learn the  relationships between common constellations and star groups, and the price  is right!  It has basic iformation on the legends associated with the  constellations, and thus would be a good choice for a teacher who wanted to  introduce the sky to students 
 If you can only get one Raw Food book--this is it! It includes sprouting charts, drying times for dried foods, Lists of every vitamin and mineral with the corresponding foods--even an alkaline/acidity chart. The recipes are simple. If you wnat more gourmet type stuff, I suggest Juliano's RAW. But this book is a must for every Raw kitchen--the most accessible Raw food book I've come across, and Thank You Brigette Mars for including research on uncooked foods--good research--there's a lot of hocus-pocus, magical thinking out there in the Raw Food World, and this is a breath of fresh air, because it's smart and straight forward 
 Hofstede gives you a deep understanding of deep influence has culture on organization functioning. 
 This was Durrell's first major novel, & anticipates many of the ideas which would dominate his later works.  While the book is slightly derivative in regard to Henry Miller's 'Tropic of Cancer', it goes far  beyond Miller's idea of the Western death-consciousness, and is wonderfully  inventive and energetic.  As a response to James Joyce, it is a portrait of  the artist as an  ANGRY young man.  Well worth the time and cost 
 Great resource book for nutrition. Covers everything 
 Years ago I had a LP of "The Hawk Talks".  I was more into rock & roll back then, but I remembered Hawkin's amazing rich tone years after I ditched my turntable and records for a CD player.  Naturally, as I started listening to more jazz, I wanted some Hawk for my collection.  If there is a better record out there, I have yet to hear it. The warmth, richness & elegance of Hawkin's playing hardly seem like something of this world.  The supporting cast is stellar.  Another reviewer put it well, there is not a wrong note on this album.  Buy it, turn the lights down, and enjoy the work of a master at the top of his game 
 This book had me from the humorous opening paragraph. Easy read.  The dialogue between characters flowed well.  I am now a fan.  Recommend this book highly.  
 Free at last, free at last :) YES, this is Glenn Hughes at his very core and an album I've been waiting on from him for a very long time - it has everything! Soul, funk, rock and so much more - all delivered with the highest quality vocals and musicianship we've all come to enjoy.  With nods to his musical heroes, as well as his own humble beginnings, right through to the modern day "sure fire" hits - Music For The Divine - has every element that should make this epic stand out from the crowd.  You quickly get a sense of what is to come with the opener, The Valiant Denial, with JJ Marsh and Chad Smith's epic opening chords and hard rockin' drums, it sets us up for what must surely be the opening live number - a masterpiece if ever there was one. The chorus gets your blood pumping and what with the rousing string arrangement, it's final sonic-laden moments bring us down and you're left wondering what just hit you!!  We're then thrown head over heels into Steppin' On, with the first of the hard funk moments which are scattered throughout the album and the welcomed introduction to the "green goblin". You won't be able to get the chorus out of your head and with the tip of the hat to Zeppelin and Purple MK.III; it won't go by, without leaving a smile on your face. This is of course, a "must play live" song. No questions asked, ok!   Next up, Monkey Man, kicks straight in with a funk laden riff that get's those dancin' shoes dusted off and ready for some action!! With the chorus in full swing, you'll be jumpin' around before you know it. Awesome performances by all involved with JJ and Chad getting a well deserved airing, while Glenn commands the helm to perfection, right through to the final moments.  We're given a breather with This House, even with it's Beatles-esque qualities, you still walk away in sheer breathlessness with the vocal delivery. At the halfway mark, the string section kicks in and Glenn and JJ deliver stellar guitar performances throughout.  Ok, time to get off you seat! You Got Soul gives us a nod & wink to Trapeze with a harder funk rock edge, which I'm digging more and more on every listen! This song has it all, hard rock, funk, wailing guitars, passionate hard rockin' vocals - 10 out of 10 - it would be a crime not to play this one live ;)   Next up, Frail, brings us down to earth and with it's soaring and melancholic mood, it brings to the forefront Glenn's vocal and lyrical abilities. The string section really sets the mood, both celebratory and mournful at the same time. Perfection!  To get us back in the groove, Black Light kicks your butt back in gear! Again, an absolute "must play live" song - the green goblin is in full effect again here and with a fantastic vocal bridge to boot - this should really be considered as a "single" release - it's got everything. Glenn pulls out all the stops and JJ and Chad shine through with big Cheshire cat grins, at least I did! Again....perfection :)   Things slow slightly with Nights In White Satin which is up next, but not for long, what with Glenn's thundering vocals keeping you on your toes - this isn't just copied from the Stealth soundtrack or the Australian Soul Mover release - but in fact, a remixed version - you can definitely hear the difference, with the vocals sounding like they were brought forward which definitely improves it overall. John Frusciante is still stellar on this rendition. And yes, it fits in very well with the new songs, which I must admit, pleasantly surprised me.  No, not a Stevie Wonder cover! Too High is next and that's where you want to be on this one - up and rockin' out! From introductory drum chops and thundering bass line, this one kicks you in the face - fantastic guitar and drums from JJ and Chad, with another sonically delivered chorus from Glenn - his bass playing is just perfection! There's going to be lots of sweat flowing from both the stage and crowds when this one gets going - trust me! Another 10 out of 10 from me! This is the funk rocker that I've been waiting on from Glenn for a long, long time - again, a "must play live" song :)   A change of pace, takes us into a trippy late 60's/early 70's number with This Is How I Feel, which would fit right at home on an early Trapeze album - this is Glenn Hughes at his finest, again it has every element, old and new, with some surprises thrown in. Imagine Hendrix with a sultry splash of early Free and Floyd! John Frusciante is an absolute star on this song - another "must play live" addition.  To close out the album, The Divine, exemplifies Glenn Hughes - a straightforward acoustic & strings based number, with lyrics and a vocal delivery that is everything Glenn - as he pours his heart out, it's like he's standing right next to you as he sings just for YOU! Marvelous.  In summary, this is a very different album from his past releases, but at the same time, it's not! You can definitely feel the personal and honest nature of the songs and as listener you will easily appreciate each one on it's own, but soon afterwards when you stand back, you'll see it's a very cohesive release. Maybe it'll take you a couple of listens to fully appreciate it, but I think in the end, you'll agree me.  Special mention goes to Chad Smith, JJ Marsh, John Frusciante and Mark Kilian. Chad is an animal on the drums, JJ and John make a great team and both give us award winning performances. Mark gives us the string arrangements and oh how he nailed it, creating the perfect atmosphere. 
 Sherman Alexie is one of the best writers of our time.  This book was touching, vivid, intense -- as always, he delivers.  What a great storyteller 
 i think this game is fun and was very enjoyable. i would not recommend any kids under 18 play which u do have. keep up the great work. Thank you 
 The Buddhist Fist traces the lives of two friends, one of whom is a Buddhist monk.  Unwittingly, the monk is framed and must resort to misdeeds to keep from being blackmailed.  His misdeeds put him at odds with his lifelong friend (the same actor who played the villian, White Tiger, in Dreadnaught), and ultimately into a final match of "good vs. evil."  Lots of well choregraphed action.  Note, however, two irritating features of the DVD: (a) for the first half of the film, there is a bothersome, vertical, hairline bar on the left side of the screen; (b) despite providing 5.1 Chinese audio, there are no English subtitles!  Too bad, since I prefer the original language audio, whenever possible.  Chalk it up to another, Tai Seng careless oversight.  In fact, I'd rather get the original Hong Kong release of this film in light of Tai Seng's frequent editing foibles.  5 stars for the production.  Deduct 1 star for the careless transfer.    
 I watched this in my General Physics class my sophomore year of college.  It is simply the best documentary I have ever seen.  It will reshape the way you look at the worlds most powerful weopons 
 I have searched the net high and low for this movie on DVD, I can't understand why it isn't available.....pleeeeeeeeeeese someone put it on DV 
 "Barrio Boy" is an important historical document, as it presents through various aspects of local color the Mexican community as it appeared in the early twentieth century.  It is also important as a chronicle of the  Diaz dictatorship and of the forces that made a family, against bitter  odds, migrate to southwestern California 
 This ia certainly one of the better books on modern philosphy that I have read. It is not the type of book one would simply scan through, but should be read carefully and studied. It is a very psoitive presentation of  material that tends to be negative in today's world. For me it is already a  reference 
 This book has become my all-time favorite book, which is saying something since I avoided it for years and years fearing it would be too depressing.  Depressing it certainly is, but Mr. McCourt knows how to tell a story in a way that draws you in and shuts everything else around you out until you are lost inside the pages.  I literally could not put this book down and the minute I finished it I turned it over and read it again...then ran right out and bought and read 'Tis!  Mr. McCourt's candidness and wry humor about the years of hopelessness and despair captured my heart in a way no other book has ever done.  I recommend it to everyone who asks if I "know of a good book".      
 This is a great way to get acquainted with Bourdieu's work on culture and power. Swartz provides an excellent overview of key concepts such as "symbolic capital", "habitus", "field" and "symbolic violence". This work definitely makes Bourdieu more readable, but it is no mere Cliff Notes -- there is a critical and analytical component to Swartz' treatise that invites the reader to not just take the given theories at face value but examine past criticisms these theories have drawn.    This is essential reading for sociology grad students and anyone looking for a comprehensive and comprehensible introduction to Bourdieu's scholarship. Bourdieu's own work is brilliant but is not easy reading. Swartz eases the reader into Bourdieu's world of thought, and once you are hooked, reading Bourdieu himself becomes worth the trouble 
 I was 'knocked out' by the "Eyre Affair" and very sad when I approached the end. However, I learned of the "Next" installments and immediately ordered them. "Lost in a Good Book" has been a wonderful read and I have been once again immersed in Mr Fforde's wonderful imagination and Quixotic characters. I pray he keeps his health and writes quickly. 
 A.J. Jacobs journey through the Encyclopedia Brittanica is a very entertaining one, and you may learn a few totally useless things as you go through it.  A good number of books have been written recently about people's quests to do some pretty ridiculous things - cooking your way through Julia Child's MTAOFC, riding the Tour De France route by yourself, reading the entire Encyclopedia Brittanica.  This is definitely one of the best in that genre 
 I can't wait to go out and buy this book, which I read in hardcover from the library.  It is very well researched and illustrated and discusses clothes and fashions from long ago up till today. And not just fashions and how they change, but what they MEAN.  For example, did you know....in olden  times, not just elegant clothing, but cloth itself was and admired and  expensive commodity. The more cloth making up one's clothing meant that  person was wealthy. Paintings of the period featured draperies in the  background to indicate a person's wealth, and even today designer clothing  uses more cloth and is cut fuller, carrying on the tradition.  Anyone  interested in not only fashion and clothing but symbols and history should  read this book, it is just fascinating and delicious 
 Easy to read, practical guide covering IRA strategies in depth.   Very helpful 
 In an afterword note, Esther Calvino asks the reader to think of this book as "not something Calvino started and left unfinished but simply as three stories written in different periods of his life." She gives good advice, but the sense that Calvino had something more, something bigger, planned for these stories pervades this tiny book. He definitely wanted to write a book about the five senses and interweave them in some way (as he did with other themes in previous books). In all of these stories the senses mingle sensuously with desire and sensuality (one can only imagine what he had in mind for the sense of touch). Here sense catalyzes desire, hidden desires, nameless primordial desires. But this book only contains a scratching of a surface, a deep misty lake that promises more. Unfortunately Calvino died before wrapping up the project. So here remains a sketch of what might have been. Sadly, stories published posthumously always seem to have a certain "not quite final draft" feel about them. Here sits another example.  Regardless, plenty of good Calvino exists here for ardent fans of his work. 1982's "Under The Jaguar Sun" is a great story about a couple vacationing in Mxico. Taste awakens forbidden desires (the story begins with a very suggestive description of a "love" between a priest and a nun). The couple explore the ruins of ancient Mxico, the local food (now an amalgam of national cuisines), and each other's bodies and psyches as they rip and tear their lusciously spiced food. But forbidden desires arise once again as they explore the history of human sacrifice and realize that eating mingles deeply with the sensual and the forbidden.  "A King Listens", dated 1984, speaks to the reader in second person (sometimes in a manner similar to "If On A Winter's Night A Traveler"). The king sits on his lonely throne trapped by necessity in his own palace. All he knows of the surroundings are sounds. They reverberate, echo, and thud all around him. Paranoid thoughts about the inevitable usurpation stew with the sounds. Suddenly a woman's voice sings out, but he can only hear her. He wants to experience her as a person, not just a voice. Which leads to one of the best lines in the story: "And so, when a desire to be fulfilled presents itself to you at last, you realize that being king is of no use for anything." The senses again awaken desire.  "The Name, the Nose", from 1972, switches contexts abruptly between a French parfumerie (where the saleswomen erotically encircle the cherished patron), the dank smoky aftermath of a rock concert, and a battle between two early humans (this episode evokes "Cosmicomics"). All of the men in the story come to know a woman only by her smell. The singular smell of each woman ignites desires. Strange ineffable and mad desires. The story itself remains a little indescribable.  So taste, hearing, and smell all get represented here as awakening desire or as a source of desire. And desire weaves through this book like a sinuous thread. It interconnects the stories and provides glimpses of a whole. That is mainly why Esther Calvino's advice remains hard to follow. Something more wants to bubble up from beneath this collection. Because of this, thinking of these stories as three disparate entities poses a stiff challenge. So we're faced with a nagging feeling of incompleteness. Here possibly sits the "lost" or "unfinished" Calvino book. Which inevitably leads to lonely abstract thinking about what Calvino had in mind. And so on...  Still, "Under The Jaguar Sun" will doubtlessly please many Calvino fans. It contains plenty of good, not outstanding, examples of Calvino's work. It also unfortunately leaves behind it a sadness of unfulfilled possibilities. Thankfully Calvino stayed around long enough to write numerous masterworks. This probably would have been another one 
 It's hard to find anything Pokemon anymore.  My 7 y/o son loves anything Pokemon.  He read this book Christmas morning and was very excited.  Thanks Amazon !!!! 
 I liked the stories in the book alot. I could understand what several of the characters were going thru almost like a slice of my own life. I highly recommend it for filipino-americans becoming of age and who see a need to understand the boundard between american and filipino cultures 
 I sincerely repent of my previous review which slandered these wondrous tracts. I was foolish and heedless in doing so.  Suffice to say, if you want to get the jist of what Zen is outside of the "Ah, how pretty the trees in Oneness." Buy this book and some of the others by Thomas Cleary. They're all quite nice 
 Moody, atmospheric,versatile and utterly compelling this is one fusion record that will convince even the jazz purists that there's still hope left in the area;the songs are inspired,yet subtle and flowing-great  balance between interplay and the virtuosity of the players allowing for an  incredible result.Not for the musically challenged.. 
 Soothing and peaceful instrumental refrains take you to a place of tranquility. This CD is perfect for a calming background to work, as an aid to meditation or massage, or nice to just relax with at the end of a  stressful day 
 David Limbaugh, with this book, has done the country a great service by detailing the desperate times the Left in this country finds themselves in and he does it by quoting them continuously as they search for a way to become relevant and to return to power.  Out of ideas and out of power are a tough combination for today's Democrats. Their leadership has been diminished by the types of people who have aspired to it, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and their other spokesman on national issues, Charlie Rangel, Dick Durbin, Ted Kennedy, John Kerry, Jack Murtha, Chris Dodd and Charles Schumer, to name a few find it necessary to invent false issues and then talk about them as though they are true.  Their conduct would be disappointing at best if we were not at war. Of course, that seems to be one of the underlying thoughts to much of what they say. They say they believe that the Bush administration has actually ginned up all of this jihadist talk. They ignore the attack on us and focus on our invasion of Iraq. They fret about how we gain intelligence about our enemy and they openly threaten to undermine the efforts in Iraq if they could only take power. They also try to talk the United States into recession at a time when the economy his hitting on all cylanders. America must suffer defeats and despair for their version of how to govern it is to work.  This book, if read thoughtfully will make you very angry. And that is as it should be, because you do not have to accept Mr. Limbaugh's view of things. He uses their own words to hang them and they seem eager to supply him with ammunition.  There was a time when it didn't make that much difference as to which party was in power. You knew what the emphasis of each party was and the nation survived quite nicely so long as people of general good will were in charge.   However, those days appear gone for good as the Democrats try to tear down America in order to advance their cause. It is a losing strategy and a very dangerous game which lies fully exposed in this book. Those that give it one star are just a small part of the Left's effort to discredit the author. They are as transparent in their criticisim as those Mr. Limbaugh writes about. He deserves our thanks for taking them on in such a devistating manner.   
 I thought this book and the rest of the Heartland series was absolutely brilliant. I love the original approach Lauren has taken by having her main characters use join-up and alternative remedies on the horses. I also thought the conflict between Amy and Ashley was dealt with in a very realistic way. I hope Lauren continues with this series because I never want it to end 
 I found this album much better than the movie score album. The original is usually the best, and this album holds true for the songs with vocals, but there are a few sequences from the movie wich are better instrumentally. If you have the money, get both. If not, this album is the one to get 
 Love the bright colors on these bowls.  They are super functional too and the sizes seems to work well for various mixing jobs. 
 Richard Evans has a history of writing touching stories.  His first book The Christmas Box left many of our library patrons touched for weeks, most freely admitting to shedding many tears.  His newest book, Finding Noel, is sure to please those who read The Christmas Box.  The lead character, Mark Smart, is facing perhaps the darkest night of his young life.  His scholarship at the University of Utah has been cancelled.  He's lost his dorm room and part time job at the college.  Just days before he's lost his beloved mother.  Then on a dark, cold, and snowy night his car dies near a small cafe.  Struggling into the warmth of the diner he meets a young woman name Macy and the rest of his live changes.  Interesting characters make this read worthwhile.  Mark's father is a virtual neer-do-well who embarrasses Mark but in the end has one of the more memorable lines in the book.  Macy's mother died when she was only five of cancer leaving her and her infant sister, Noel, to be tended by an unreliable father.  Jo, the unrelated woman who takes in Macy after her mother died works as a waitress in a truck stop.  Yes, there's plenty of tension in Finding Noel.  In addition to the wonderful characters, the story is tightly written and doesn't waste the readers time.  This is the first of many holiday books and may turn out to be one of the best.    
 I hate to say it but I grew up just like the kid in the movie. The most I remember about my childhood was being dropped off at grandma's almost everyday and being rewarded with a new toy for being such a brat towards her. Actually, all the kids in my extended family were taken care by her. I guess its more of a korean thing or i don't know...Our parents slaved away at the their stores as my granny watched over all of us because we didn't know anybody in the U.S. My poor granny had babysat all 10 of us at once!   Anyhow, korean grandmothers (especially the ones who seen the horrors of the Korean War) have this aura about them that grabs a hold of you and makes you want to sit by them while they do everything in their power to embrace you as if you were one of their own and tell you all the stories of the past. They're very spiritual and calm. The most important thing is that they show their feelings through their actions. And as much as the kid in the movie pushed and shouted at his grandmother to go away, she NEVER gave up on him. I don't think I ever cried so much in my life.   I'm glad this movie wasn't like another (sorry to say it) but 'Joy Luck Club' story. This is so real. I'm sure it'll hit home for so many people.   It's definitely a must see for all those kids who are challenged with the meaning of 'unconditional love'. Even if mom and dad don't get along...granny will always ALWAYS have a place for you at home 
 The one issue I have with this otherwise wonderful book is the way the editor writes about popular hits in each author's intro but then doesn't always include the lyrics to those songs!  The hell is up with that??  If you're going to mention a song that everyone knows but then skip the lyrics of that song, it makes for a very frustrating time.  Is there a vol 2 on the way 
 I received this machine for christmas because my wife knows that i usually get one cup of coffee in the middle of the day at work.  This machine is easy to use and works great.  It works using the home cafe pods well, but i tried the Melitta java pods, and i got brown water.  The Melitta pods state that they are designed exclusively for use with "the one:one coffee maker" You can get most coffee flavors using the Home cafe pods though. Pods may not be the most cost effective way to make coffee, but it sure is easy 
 Like most short story collections, the individual stories vary in length and quality.  It is hard to categorize the stories as they cover a range of topics and human emotions.  Some deal with the supernatural and some with people's desires.  The author notes that she finds it hard to write short stories.  I have personally found that writing short stories is easy, but finding editors to publish them is extremely hard.  Perhaps that is why the author has published them as a collection.  Some are longer, complete stories; and some seem to be more in the category of short scenes.  I particularly liked the man contemplating suicide who decided to indulge himself in things he would have never otherwise have done, e.g., two leather-clad blondes in a parked vehicle.  And then their is the story about the ugly sister, and her feelings about Cinderella.  There is the woman trying to use an ancient cookbook who obtains some very, very strange results.  There is the class reunion, but a class from a rather strange school.  Overall, the author is very creative, and has let her mind wander in some strange directions.  But that makes for a collection of good stories 
 I met the author of this book a few years ago, and he is a remarkable treasure trove of information. How lucky we all are that he thought to interview these people when most had forgotten them and their work. If Mr. Brownlow had waited even a few years to do these interviews, much of this information would be lost forever! This was actually used as a textbook when I was in film school 
 This is the first hep c book I have seen that gives guidelines for what to do about my drinking and drug use. The chapter called Prioritzing Lifestyle Changes was exactly what I needed. I also related to the stories that the people in the book told and the list of questions that people with hep C ask. I could have written them myself. These authors really know what it's like to get diagnosed with hep C and they introduce you to all the different treatments out there. the stories made me feel better about interferon, but interferon is not your only choice. There are lots of alternative treatments that are less harsh on your body, and they can make the interferon easier too 
 This is one of the few books that humble me when I contemplate it. Rather, Madam Blavatsky's knowlege and intellect humbles me. Take just about any "newly rediscovered" esoteric topic of any worth and you will most probably find it explained in considerable detail in either this work or _Isis Unveiled_. I am dismayed that so few people, or biliographies, give credit to Madam Blavatsky, or to the Theosophical Society that she founded. I guess we are just too "quaint" and "old-fashion" for the "New Age."   There is just too much encyclopedic knowlege here to simply read through from scratch. You need to work up to it. Try a introductory text like _Ocean of Theosophy_ by William Q. Judge. However, do not be afraid to pick up either volume and simply "browse." I still do this after all these years- and I am still surprised and amazed at what I find.   One further thing, there has been a considerable amount of character assassination against Madam Blavatsky in the last few years. The authors that have penned these attacks have no understanding of the matters that they address. First of all, no one was a stronger critic of seances than Madam Blavatsky. Secondly, the Society has always held that one should never charge money for spiritual matters. As for the ad hominem attacks that she was grossly obese, well, this is the lowest form of slander and doesn't deserve comment. Simply take a look at any of the surviving photographs to see the truth.    Concerning attacks on Theosophical concepts such as  the "seven races" and "seven globes", just keep in mind that the perenial philosophy holds that the highest part of what makes up a person pre-exists on a higher plane- and will return there after we cross over. Just remember the old gnostic concept of "seven heavens." Literalism is a mistake in theosophy, just as it has proven in fundamentalist Christianity 
 Written in 1941, Carson McCullers' second novel probably qualifies as a novella or long short story. Surely it was light years ahead of its time as Ms. McCullers takes on homosexuality-- latent and the other kind, masochism, adultery, voyeurism, self-mutilation, a nervous breakdown and animal cruelty in fewer than a hundred pages. In the hands of a lesser writer, this tale would have degenerated into a trashy detective story. Ms. McCullers, however, manages to make the characters, with all their warts, believable, and for the most part, sympathetic. Captain Penderton, for example, is tormented by his hidden feelings for other men-- he is simultaneously attracted to both Private Williams as well as Major Langdon and hates Williams, even though he ought to despise the Major since he is cuckolding the Captain who, along with everyone else, knows about it. But Penderton is a real person, unhappy, lonely but capable of murder.  Ms. McCullers keeps this story first class with her spare, though poetic language. "An army post [the story is set on a military post in the 1930's in the South] in peacetime is a dull place. Things happen, but then they happen over and over again. . . At the same time things do occasionally happen on an army post that are not likely to re-occur. There is a fort in the South where a few years ago a murder was committed. The participants of this tragedy were: two officers, a soldier, two women, a Filipino, and a horse." With those opening lines, the story begins and never slows down.  I never had an English professor who would give Carson McCullers the time of day. Her novels were too gothic, her plots unbelievable, there were too many kinks in her characters. Could it have been that her stories were too close to home or were they jealous of her popularity with the reading public from the publication of her first novel THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER?   REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE holds up well on a second reading. Made into a movie by John Houston in 1967 starring Marlon Brando-- in one of his best roles-- and Elizabeth Taylor, this novel is ripe for a remake now by someone with the talent of Mike Nichols 
 Just can't say enough about Jeff Lynne. When I first heard the Face The Music album, I was hooked on the ELO sound. When I bought my first serious stereo system, I took Face The Music along with me to the store and played Poker through several amps before making my final choice. On Armchair Theater, you won't find much of the loud ELO of earlier days as Jeff has mellowed with age. The tunes however are mesmerizing. It's one of those rare albums that can be listened to end to end (well, not rare for an ELO album). Jeff is truly a genius and it's an automatic buy for anything he appears on. Two of my more recent purchases with Jeff on them and my two favorite DVD's are the Zoom DVD and the Tribute to George (Harrison) DVD. Jeff is easily the star of both of these gems. On a remotely related note, my 3 favorite bands of all time are ELO, Steely Dan and Alan Parsons Project. When Jeff came out with Zoom a few years ago, I actually knew who Rosie Vela (female singer on Zoom) was as I have an old album of hers called Zazu that was produced by Walter Becker of Steely Dan 
 I read a lot of digital photography books, and most of them I race through in a few hours, looking for nuggets of information I can use.  This book is all nuggets!  Each page has a morsel of helpful knowledge and useful techniques.  It is going to take me weeks to absorb all this book has to offer.  I was particularly enthralled by the do-it-yourself projects scattered throughout the book and concentrated in the final chapter.  Photographers are by nature gadget freaks, always looking for a new way to improve their pictures with a little widget here or there.  There are clear instructions for making tools that every serious photographer has long known about, such as the Bob Harris Shutter, or strap "monopod", but there were lots of new ideas, too.  I'd never thought of making my own IR filter before, and had held off exploring this type of photography because of the expense.  Thanks to the author, I am now happily shooting infrared photos that amaze all my friends.  I thought this book was a pleasing combination of technical detail and practical techniques. It should be on every digital SLR photographer's book shelf 
 I bought one of these extended batteries on e-bay and was really sorry.  It didn't hold a charge.  I was reluctant to try again, but I was glad I did.  This time I got a good quality battery and it holds a charge at least twice as long as my old battery 
 Jeffery swears off sex. Why? Well after an encounter with a guy in which the condom breaks, you could almost see why. Safe sex is portrayed as the not so fun variety of sex and through the eyes of Jeffery, it seems so pointless. Then he meets someone who turns out to have HIV and despite that major calamity, sparks fly. Of course Jeffery manages to come off as cold and shallow at times, but anyone watching this has probably done something similar in their time. "Jeffery" is a top notch movie and features some pretty interesting 'cameo's'. Sigourney Weaver does a veery funny bit as an inspirational speaker who tries to tackle Jefferies issue. The cater waiter scene is just fabulously coreographed and it is one of the funniest, and possibly sexiest, scenes in the movie. And then there is Patrick Stewart who is just hilarious as he plays over the top. You can tell he, as well as the rest of the cast, are having a blast with this movie. That is what makes "Jeffery" fun. Its romantic moments are nice and the oddly interjected moments with Mother Theresa are strange, but a nice touch. This is a good movie with good performances and a very good, detailed plot 
 I bought this as my first set for my daughter to read more. SHe loves Junie B!!! Easy enough for someone who needs help with reading to read. Helps them feel good about reading! 
 The book is like a mystery. The genre of this book is fiction. I will recommand this book to some one who likes mysteries book. The book is about a kid that found aliens in his house. The aliens were scared of them. One of the aliens were pointing a gun at Rod's head. My favorite part of the book is when the other aliens were shooting at Rod. The character is Rod and the aliens 
 This book by William "Skip" Miller, a sales veteran and experienced trainer of sales managers, provides a wealth of information and guidance. Experienced sales managers will find it useful and new sales managers will find it indispensable. Miller covers cultural change, goal setting, recruitment, hiring, firing and more. He pays plenty of attention to day-to-day management, albeit in the context of his "ProActive" sales management program. Use this short, expansive manual as a handbook. For example, when you need to recruit, hire or terminate someone, consult the appropriate chapter. The book is easy to read and full of common sense. We  recommend it highly to its target audience: sales managers.  
 This was the first weight/diet related book I ever read and it had quite an impact on me. This book offers useful information about how to eat and usefull tips on how to control impulses to overeat. I'm not saying that this book is the end-all to diet books but it has many helpfull tips and tidbits that can help anyone learn to eat a little healthier 
 As a Star Trek fan my favorite alien race is the Klingons. This is a superior Trek novel about their warrior culture which is a bit like the Samurai of ancient Japan. John Ford created a complex and believable culture of the type of Klingons which were seen only briefly, in the early motion pictures. For some reason, Krenn is depicted in the cover art as a fusion-style Klingon from the original series, but a careful attention to the physical descriptions in the book reveal the characters to be the ones from The Motion Picture. Lt. Cdr. Kelly is the only Human Fusion in the story. This book is extraordinarily well written, and is an example of truly excellent science fiction. You truly believe these aliens exist! A lot of the concepts in Next Generation were based on Ford's creativity. As are many of the novels inspired by "The Final Reflection" such as Jeffry Hertzler's "The Left Hand Of Destiny" and Kat Ramo's "Citizen Of The Empire". In fact, the whole subculture of the Star Trek Klingon fandom is patterned after "The Final Reflection" 
 This was a strange book. But, the moment that I picked it up, I couldn't put it down.  I found this book to be humorous and a very quick read.  In a nutshell:  Stephanie's marriage of thirteen years is ended by her husband. She finds another love, Peter,  and strange things happen.  Without giving away the plot, I wondered thoughtout this book if she has a disorder, is delusional, if Peter has a twin, if he has a disorder or if he is delusional......it kept me guessing.  The end was not what I had expected and that was part of the fun of the book.  If you are looking for a serious read, an emotional read, a true love story....then save your time and skip this book.  Once again, I'm glad that I did not look at the ratings first or I would not have read this book.  I would imagine that others gave it only one star or slightly more because they were looking for something other than what this book offered. But, if you're looking for a fun, quick, quite different, keep-you-guessing book, I'd recommend this book.  I didn't give the book 5 stars because, although the situations are often quite humorous, there are times when I had had enough of Paul.  
 Oh my goodness... I don't know what I would do without my Spanx! I will never wear a pair of work slacks without them.   A nice pair of trousers will have some polyester involved in it... well this stuff clings to bulges and panty lines. Spanx gets rid of VPL and smoothes out those little areas we don't like to mention. So fabrics that have a little more flow to them, will actually flow and not cling!  You will look more neat and tidy in your clothes and you might even look a few pounds lighter. They are so comfortable and because it is thin nylon material, you can wear them during the warm summer months.  Don't be fooled by imitations! Spanx brand is the only one you want when it comes to quality and doing what it promises!  I recommend the medium control even if you have a little bit of tummy to hide (it still works well on me). The super tends to be a little tighter so size up if you are going to get them 
 I found this book browsing through Barnes and Noble. The synopsis on the back cover sounded very interesting (plague, end of the world stuff) but once I started reading it I had a hard time wanting to finish. I really enjoy sci-fi combined with mystery but I just feel like Jeff Long did not do a great job with this. It was boring through many parts, dragged out way too long and the end of it was just very abrupt. I have been interested in reading some of his other books but am a little skeptical because of my disappointment with this one. 
 I tried this book in an effort to get back on track. There is a diet for each season and a fat flush diet. I lost inches in weeks on the fat flush. Believe me and try it, I have no reason to lie this book truly worked for me 
 I bought this book to learn more about oil infusion recipies.  Not only does it have a good amount of interesting ones to try, but it also has great ones for vinegar infusions as well.  I have made several batches already with fresh herbs from my garden and they have been great.  This books also contains lots of information on how to's and safety as well.  A good little book packed with useful recipies and tips 
 Purchased for a 2 year old girl who loves Jungle Book. She loves 2 as much as the first one. One is on VHS, this one on DVD so she goes back & forth between the tv & portable dvd player frequently 
 If you have younger or older children, this is the book for you! If you have no ideas where to start or need great ideas. This book is wonderful! I needed some different and neat ideas and I found them in this book. I just  can't say enough about this book 
 All of us have a variety of characters that we meet and encounter throughout our lives.  Some of them odd, some of them funny, some of them dull, and I venture to say we have bumped into, on more than one occasion, those whom we might deem as a "social outcast."  Never before had I read a novel that attempted to put into words what it might be like to be one of these lonely outcasts.  Of course the characters in "The Heart is a Lonely Hunter," are not viewed in a way we would think of most outcasts.  They are viewed in the story with a sense of realism and awe that most novels can not generate.  These characters and their lives and thoughts will become more and more real as the novel unfolds.  The novel is told in brilliant, almost poetic third person.  Although I bet if down the road if someone were to ask you about this book, you would swear it was told in first person by each of the characters.  The novel is essentially about a year in time of five very different, very vivid characters.  The characters are all searching for something they can never seem to find.  All of them are as different as night and day, but have so many things in common.  The story switches from one character to another with each passing section.  We gain tremendous insight to their personal lives, oddities, and behavior in a writing style like no other.  If I had to choose who the main character would be, it would have to be Mr. Singer.  Mr. Singer is a mute.  He can understand words that are spoken to him by the movements of others lips.  The story opens beautifully, describing his friendship with another mute friend, Antropulous.  The story describes the poignant feelings Mr. Singer has toward his friend.  Soon into the story, Mr. Singer's friend is put a mental institution by his own brother.  This turn of events wounds and scars the heart of Mr. Singer.  Not soon after, Mr. Singer begins going to a café, which is owned by another one of the stories characters, Biff.  Biff is very strange, and has become even stranger since the death of his wife.  He has one redeeming quality, in that he takes good care of the customers who some into his café.  One of these customers is Jake.  Jake is another outcast.  He is an alcoholic, with a mean streak in him.  He rants and raves about how unequal the country is.  Another character we encounter in the café is Mick.  Mick might be the most fascinating character in the story. She is kind of a tomboy, who loves music, and exploring the streets at night.  The final main character is Mr. Compton, a black doctor, who has hatred in his heart for white men.  McCullers does a superb job of bringing these characters all together.  Mr. Singer finds a new place to stay after his best friend goes to the nut house.  That new place is Mick's house.  One by one, the main characters meet Mr. Singer and become magnetically drawn to them.  They tell him of their frustration, their worries, and how they feel about life.  Mr. Singer just smiles and listens because he can't speak.  Occasionally, he will write down something on a piece of paper if he has something important to say.  Mr. Singer can't figure out why these people are drawn to him.  The fascinating thing is that all the main characters know each other, yet none of them like anyone by Mr. Singer, who seems to be the thread holding all their lives together.  Mick loves him more than her own father, Mr. Compton feels he is the only white man with any worth, Biff just finds him interesting, and Jake considers him the only one who understands.  All along, Mr. Singer has loneliness in his own heart for his friend that has been sent away.  Every so often he gets a chance to visit him, but it is not the same.  These visits are some of the most breathtaking passages in the novel.  There is not time or room to explain all that happens in The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.  I have just given some of the basics.  There is so much more that happens, and so much more that I could say.  I don't know if I have ever enjoyed reading a novel as much as this one.  The language was so alive, so fresh, so beautiful, and so heart wrenching.  This book might have the most interesting characters I have ever read about.  I can't get it out of my head.  It is hard to put into words the reasons that make this book a masterpiece.  One is that it evokes powerful emotions with you.  McCullers is an absolute master at pointing out little observances, oddities, and other things in life that we might just forget about, or not take the time to notice.  The book is filled with these precious little gems scattered throughout the masterful plot and style.    The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is also very entertaining.  Yet it goes past the mediocrity of mindless entertainment, and takes us on a deep, emotional, and unsentimental journey through the lives of people that you will come to know so well.  You will feel that if you met these characters in real life, you would know everything about them.  McCullers puts in the time, and the reader is heavily rewarded.   Even if the characters might not be extremely likable, but we care so much to find out what will happen next in their lives.  I loved this book.  The story and mood has continued to linger on in my mind, compared to other books that fade so quickly.  This story is more felt than read.  I love it even more the way McCullers ends this book.  The ending takes a turn no one could have expected, and makes the novel even more deep and thoughtful that it would have been otherwise.  Why can't every book be this good?  Why can't every book shake my soul to the core with such power as this one did?  These questions, like many others posed by this masterpiece, are left unanswered.  Grade: A 
 When I bought the book, I was looking for some way to lose a few pounds in a hurry.  (I had a reunion coming up that I had decided to attend at basically the last minute.)  Needless to say, with only 3 1/2 weeks until the reunion, I was desperate.  Lo and behold, I followed the Turbocharge Diet and dropped 10 pounds in two weeks.  I exercised and continued to follow the eating guidelines in the book and lost another 5 pounds in the next 10 days.   By the time of the reunion, I had lost two sizes and 15 pounds.  I couldn't have done it without the help of this book. 
 Like Aldo Leopold's "Sand County Almanac",Heinrich has written a  book that I find myself going back to with each changing season. His  descriptions are those of an experienced naturalist who finds immense  pleasure in the diversity and detail of nature. I especially enjoyed the  many passages on bird song and his  observations of the myriad colours and  patterns in Red Maples in the fall. To fully appreciate this book, however,  the reader needs to be knowledgeable about natural history. Whereas some  other reviewers have said that they found the long passages about a  particular plant or animal tiresome, these were the parts of the book that  I enjoyed the most 
 I enjoyed this quick read.  I did skip over a few chapters that I didn't feel were pertinent to me, but still really enjoyed this book.  If you are looking to see if you are on the right path in life, read God Winks.  And then, start paying attention, you'll be surprised at what comes to mind! 
 Brad Stevens, whose successful book on Monte Hellman was released in 2003, tackles another subject who doesn't always get the proper recognition that they so deserve. Through interviews with Ferrara himself (he wrote the brief introduction), correspondence with the main collaborators of the director, and enormous amounts of research, Stevens' book focuses on both the biographical and the theoretical nature of Ferrara's films. It's the most complete book on Ferrara at this time, and one would hope that Stevens would be able to update this text as Ferrara continues his controversial - but always impressive - career. His section on unrealized projects alone makes this worthy of a purchase. 
 Ok, so vampire stories have been barbecued, fried, roasted, fricasseed, and otherwise done-to-death. But none have done what Ms. Butler does here: provide a rational framework for such creatures, an entire history for not just one vampire, but an entire species, with its own culture, laws, and social structures, that provides some explanations for the various legends. And within this structure, she has created not only a reasonable story, but a sharp look at racism, prejudice, free will, and addiction.  The Ina, as they call themselves, are a separate species with written records dating back some ten thousand years, but who cannot live separately from humans; their physiology requires human blood to sustain them. Shori is a genetic experiment by the Ina, a partial cross with humans designed to alleviate the two major problems the Ina face, their inability to withstand sunlight and their need to be comatose during daylight hours. She's black, looks like a ten or eleven year old girl (although she's 53 years old), and starts the story with no memory of who she is due to some severe injuries. The story revolves around her search for who she is and how she sustained those injuries, a story that leads down the paths of killers by compulsion, group `marriage', and courtroom battles, Ina style. The story is not extremely complex, and the situations the heroine finds herself in will be easily recognizable to any reader, but it provides a strong framework for Butler's philosophical expositions:  First, the Ina bond with their human symbionts, a bond that is at least as strong as those formed by human couples, and that both human and Ina receive benefits from the association: for the humans, a much extended disease-free life span; for the Ina, not only a food source but a family. But the humans are also bound, a physical addiction to the chemical compounds in the Ina saliva, leading to ruminations on free will versus happiness. Also investigated here are the benefits and problems of a `group marriage'.   Second, the Ina can impose their will upon a human symbiont, making them do things they would otherwise never consider, and can erase memories or make it impossible for the human to divulge information, which opens up a raft of introspection about who is really responsible for a given action, and who and to what degree someone should be punished for actions outside of the accepted societal norms.  Third, emotions can and often do override any rational thought - and it is within this item that the seeds of prejudice and racism reside, that these items are not rational and cannot be fought purely with reason. Someone who is different in appearance, abilities, or thought patterns is an immediate target for suspicion and fear, as this person is obviously not `one of the tribe' and is therefore a possible enemy. How can this reaction be stopped and when must action be taken against those who cannot accept these differences?  By providing this culture of the Ina, Butler holds up a mirror to our own culture, forcing queries about accepted norms, very typical of Butler's works. But this book is not as powerful as her Kindred or Wild Seed, perhaps because, other than Shori, there is little character development, there are places where the erotic overtones of the relationships overwhelm her more subtle points, and the conclusion of the book feels a little unfinished (perhaps a sequel was planned?). Still, a very different take on the vampire legends, good for much more than just entertainment.  --- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat 
 Very sexy and erotic movie. Harlee McBride is adorable as are the other women in the movie. Though it starts out a bit slow this helps to build the anticpation and the later scenes are worth the wait 
 An essential dub/reggae album...period! Five stars to balance out the other reviewers who gave this AMAZING album a weak rating 
 If you're not into Sting's singles, you're missing out on some of his best work. These outtakes from Mercury Falling might have been left out of the album because of their "uncommercial" appeal, but they are great songs. I'm hopping for a day when a box set of somekind is released with all of the "b sides", side-work, collaborations, soundtrack projects etc. Worth searching for this and more singles like it 
 This movie is definitely one of Chevy Chases better ones. He and Gregory Hines make a cool team, along with Sigorney Weaver. Chevy Chase provided and excellent combination of his physical humor along with his wit. I was  saddened to not see a sequel come from it 
 This is an album of great rock music that I enjoy listening to during my morning jogs or cruising the vast distances of Australia. Each song is a story supported by wonderful music and strong beat. It is just a shame that the "Eddie & the Cruisers" movies and music got little or no exposure in Australia. This is certainly an album to be enjoyed.   
 This is as good a book as I have seen on the psychological aspects of voluntary childlessness.  Ms. Safer digs deep into her own and her subjects' pasts and personalities to explore what factors might lead a woman to choose not to have childre 
 This book is a very comprehensive account of the discovery of a revolutionary drug to treat breast cancer. Very pleasant to read, the author guides you through the process which goes from discovering the drug almost by chance, making the trials (from a very human point of view) to the final approval of the drug. If you want to read a very enjoyable book about science, drug development, Phase III trials and human hope, don not look further...

 My copy of this book is nearly destroyed from all the use it receives.   This book is not just for winter.

 Another reviewer questioned whether Dragonfly in Amber would stand on its own as a read. As someone who picked it up not knowing it was part of a series, I definitely testify that it can! I was horrified to get to the end and find out that I had to read another book to find out what happened! Now I'm glad I did. I went back and read Outlander, which was fantastic, and then went on with her series. There was no problem going backward, and then forward again. Major kudos to Gabaldon for being such a engaging, creative and clear writer 
 A fan of Galloway's first book, I loved this even more. I am horrified to read that the only on-line review here is by a man who think this book is somehow a slight to him! It's not about men at all, it's a book about two  women, and their thoughts on men occur as part of the narrative they have  between themselves. That the two women have an exrtemely funny, leg-pulling  as well as tender relationship with each-other doesn't seem to reach the  over-sensitive British male reader, though it does reach the male reader  with a sense of humour. It's not a "story" (go to the movies for  those), it's a meditation about love, aging, what success might be,  European identity and, above all, companionship. I have taught this book in  high school (Brit Lit) as well as given it to friends and have yet to find  a US male who doesn't find it a hoot (or who didn't learn something from it  about the weaknesses and strengths of women alone). In short, it's a  wonderful, thought-stuffed, gentle yet stimulating book that says it all  about modern Scottish fiction. If Galloway isn't appreciated at home, maybe  she should to the States 
 I had the chance to meet Madeleine Albright in person at a company function. She is not just another politician. She is an amazing woman and person, this lead me to buy and read this book. Her outlook on life is so realistic and simple. If we listened to half of her advice our world would be more peaceful. Great reading......... 
 Again, this writer continues to remind me of William Tapply (in a good way!) And again, like the first book in the series, we are left slightly hanging at the end, without the real bad guy getting his due.  And again, a hint that the villian will get his in the next novel...so I am reading away 
 i first came across cup of clay while doing a book report for my ninth grade class, and was stunned when the story knocked me off my feet. i dug through a million layers of sellers to get the second book, and have written letters to carole nelson douglas begging her to write the third. ms. douglas, if you're reading this - BLACKMAIL YOUR PUBLISHERS! finish the story 
 kozol manages to do in this book, what he wasn't able to do in other books- simply love the children he was surrounded by.  in this work, you can truly feel him love the children of mott haven, and in turn, feel them love him.  you are given the awesome opportunity to appreciate unconditional love through his relationships with a host of characters from the community.  he is so no longer the outsider he seemed to be in AMAZING GRACE.  he has truly become a part of the community he once only studied 
 This mop is amazing. No stinky chemicals and I have REALLY REALLY clean floors. My husband read a bunch of reviews and bought the map based on those reviews. We have gone through several mops in the past few years, because they couldn't hold up to a household with 5 cats. I have had standard mops, the "fancy" kinds from the grocery store, and every other mop out there. But this one works.  I have had this mop for only a few days, but I am so impressed. I am beyond impressed.   
 I had a hunch that this book would be good. Especially from a "practical" standpoint. But I was taken back how the authors were able to weave theology & missionality within the context of The Big Idea. Therefore the book, in my opinion, had an even a deeper impact than I was expecting. I also enjoy the fact that the book was written by men who are actively engaged in the process. It's not a history book about how they built a multi-site mega church and planted multiple churches in some of the least-church cities in America (Boston & NYC) 10 years ago. These boys are living within the mess and complexities of the Jesus mission via the local church. Which I think adds so much power and purpose to the book.  I also really like the "adaptability" of the book. It's more fluid than stoic, and every church can take the ideas and principles and tweak them for their local community and environments. This book can also "cross-pollinate" to various "streams" of church and even the business world. Whether your a mega-church, emerging church, church plant, or traditional/contemporary church, at the end of the day if you do a weekly gathering, then this book can quickly help you process that gathering and be more effective. And if the principles are followed, I think a lot of churches will see an overall improvement that will create a healthy local church culture. Good planning will help cause less stress and conflict, and increase the value of the church in their local community as we (church) strive to truly do our very best to communicate the Jesus story.  I think this book should be apart of every pastors library. Matter-of-fact, I think all church planting organizations should add this text to their "must reads" for future planters, it's that helpful. I also like the fact the The Big Idea calls churches to be more effective, to become good stewards of our time and resources and to put our best foot forward as we try to serve the world and move the mission of Jesus forward.  You can also check out The BIG IDEA Resources & The BIG IDEA Blo 
 I love this swing - my fussy first child could not live without it.  I had my second child two years later and the swing is now really loud. I called Fisher Price and they said that the motor will wear out with use.  So now mine sounds like a metronome - it clicks back and forth.  If I had to do it all over again - I would still buy this swing b/c of the design.  I just wish that FP would build a motor that was more durable and better yet - that plugs into the wall 
 I had no intention of watching this movie, none. There was nothing about it that I thought I would like, but when a friend of mine wanted to rent it, and I had nothing better to do, I watched it with her.  I was wrong.  I should have wanted to watch this one. It was at best understated, and definitely overlooked. There's a few places where it's a bit 'out there' for me, but all in all, I was totally blown away by how much I actually liked this movie.  Not for kids. And in fact, probably not for all adults, but if you like things that are a little out of the ordinary, can truly relate to some of the more basal and darker sides of human nature, this is sure to send a chill or two down your spine.  There is a beautiful image of love unrequited in this movie, almost of a poetic nature, but so obscure that it is hard to grasp it entirely. I consider it like I would a work of art, not everyone is going to understand it, nor is everyone going to get the same things from watching it, but I think that it's worth watching 
 Authors of poker manuals face a bit of a conundrum.  The readers are presumably reading poker books because their poker game is not what it should be.  In other words, the readers have some misconceptions about the game that need to be fixed.  This makes it very hard to write an advanced poker book, because to do so you have to assume your readers already know basic material (or else write a monster book that contains everything) yet you KNOW that the readers are confused on some points.  Perhaps parts of the basic material you're assuming they know.  As a result, VERY few advanced poker manuals are ever written.  It's just too much of a minefield.  This book is one of a half-handful of exceptions.  The book is comprised of a series of columns Ciaffone wrote for magazines, and covers a wide range of topics.  Ciaffone's credentials are respectable - he's been a winning mid-stakes limit player in the past, and is a winning member of the cadre of high stakes pot limit and no limit ring game players that follow the tournament circuit.  In addition, he's had some modest success on the tournament circuit.  The advice presented in this book is by and large of very high quality.  Most of the book focuses on ideas for limit game play (which was what was popular in the US at the time it was written) and most of the advice deals with later street play and sticky situations.  I can say with near-100% statistical confidence that my win rate in limit games (sadly, small Colorado ones) went up almost 1 big bet/hour starting the day after I read this book.  Far too many people recomend poker books saying "It only costs one big bet.  How can it hurt?" which is of course ridiculous since bad (or poorly followed) advice could cost you FAR more than one big bet.  That said, this book worked wonders for me, and I already had a solid, winning game before I read it.  There have been some complaints raised about this book (both legitimate and not) on other boards which I'll address here:  Complaint 1: "What's the point of this?" or some similar dismissal.  Simply put, players without at least an intermediate level of skill in limit holdem and 7-stud are going to be confused by this book.  It assumes you know the basics, and know them well.  If you don't, buy the appropriate 2+2 "advanced player" series book (which are actually about basic play in great detail), and get your game together, then come back to this book.  Complaint 2: "Bob Ciaffone is ridiculously tight and as such his advice is pretty useless"  Hogwash.  You have to play fairly tight to beat most limit games.  The only exception would be situations where you're on the steal.  Ciaffone's advice is both tight and aggressive, and that's what brings home the $$$.  If you want to just keep playing your existing (loose) game, then there's no point in buying the book as you've already decided not to take its advice.  Additionally, as Ciaffone's advice applies primarily to later streets, it can be utilized by players who open more liberally.  They won't get the full benefit, but they still ought to improve somewhat.  Complaint 3: The book is a disorganized collection of columns, not a book.  This one is true.  The book would have been improved by editing it to cross-reference the chapters/columns and remove some obvious tip-offs that it was ripped directly from a magazine.  That said, the odd style didn't prevent me from absorbing any of the meat of the text, so it doesn't really cause any harm.  Complaint 4: Bob's metagame, internet, and tournament info is out of date, inaccurate, etc.  This one is true too.  I recomend you ignore these parts of the book.  Final verdict: I bought it, and I'm richer because of it.  That's more than most books can do for you.  There are some issues, but I can't give anything that's put so much $$$ in my pocket anything less than 5 stars.  It overcomes the flaws.  However, if you're not at least a passable intermediate limit player (say, able to win 1 big bet/hour at 10/20 or similar limits) then you're not going to get on well with this book, and for you I'd give it 2 stars.  Hit up the appropriate 2+2 book first, log a couple hundred winning hours at the tables, then come back 
 This movie is one of the best movies i have  ever seen.From gigantic ninjas to naked ninjas(woman subdued the buddhist priest) to the beautiful girl who killed two guys in less then 3 seconds" Ëye for an Eye" damn she can fight!!!!.But i would have loved to see the buddhist priest fight with the ninja priest 
 ... you should definitely read this book. I read the second and the third edition. Both have some very interesting information about bicycling. Sometimes the content is very technical and if you want to understand everything in detail it helps to have some kind of technical background. But even if you skip the "very" technical parts both, second and third edition, are great books 
 Reed and his wife Janis are heroes.  I wonder what has transpired in the last ten years, since the publication of this book, in their efforts to bring out the truth.  I pray for their family's safety, success, and salvation.    This important book was extremely well-written.  If you care about the future, be sure you read it.  It's frightening to know that the treatment that the Reeds received could happen to anyone, myself included.  Without money, it's almost impossible to come out on top.   The Reeds deserve our admiration for their courage.  If anyone can succeed, they can, as shown by their actions throughout the book.    I also admire and appreciate John Cummings, the co-author, for his expertise in writing, and for his support for the Reeds throughout the latter years of their ordeal 
 Our church's Heart 'n Hand Ministry gives these bibles to newlyweds in our community.  It is our way of getting new couples off to a good start with a solid biblical foundation 
 Fear and Loathing is an amazing book but if you need more convincing about that, it's your own deal.  This edition, in particular, is hard cover but very small - perfect for carrying around.  It seems like you get all the benefits of both.  At this price, it's a great deal 
 Does it have radium so that we can see time in dark during night without turning light ON  
 My 2 year old immediately loved this book. We take it to the bathroom and he looks at it while I brush his teeth and he practices on the pop up pictures. He shows everyone who comes to the house this book and talks about the pop up animals and how to brush. I highly recommend this book to any parent having problems getting their small kids used to brushing and flossing 
 i loved this book, it was really great i could hardely put it down. it's funny how it has history in it and how they play it into the book so that it actually makes some sense. i really liked arthurs character, he was so funny and reminded me a lot of my brother. it had so much suspence in it. it's a great book that people should just read to give it a chance 
 This is a wonderful book that captures aspects of life in Cambodia, life in America, and American life in Cambodia.  It also offers insight into the world of drug addiction.  It's a mesmerizing and elucidating read 
  If you want to get your education and not go into slavery with your student loans. Then get this book ASAP, it covers just about everything one needs to know on how to get your degree. I really think the future of higher education is going this way. But if you want to spend a lot of time, money, grief and get a real ration of manure. Then don't read this book 
 Brown's book is the finest study available on sexuality and the body in the early Church. This book sheds great light on the classical, Jewish , and Christian conceptions of the body and how important those conceptions  were in early Christianity, especially for early Christian asceticism. This  is a must read for anyone interested in gaining a serious appreciation of  the early Church. Many histories focus primarily on the Development of  Christian Doctrine and Ecclesial structures. An understanding of early  Christian spirituality and asceticism illuminates early Christian doctrine  and church structure even more 
 It was one year ago today when this CD was released as many musicgoers were wondering if Madonna could bounce back from her ill-faded slump in record sales. Well, Madonna has proved she can easily find her way back to the dance floor with ease and confidence. She may borrow a few disco grooves here and there with samples of Abba in the lead song, while the opening to "Future Lovers" has an uncanny similarity to Donna Summer's "I Feel Love," but Madonna still makes this album all her own with every kind of dance hook and robotic rhythm that can be created as the songs segue from one to the next without interruption. The best tracks include "Get Together," "Sorry," "Future Lovers," "Let it Will Be," "How High," and "Jump," which unfortunately got ignored by radio. The only flack I'd give this release is the closing song, "Like it or Not," because Madonna should stop trying to convince the world that she remains a staple of controversy. After listening to the song, you might feel an eagerness to tell her "We've moved on," but don't let that stop you from purchasing this CD. Confessions on a Dance Floor is her best release since 1998's Ray of Light 
 "Recommended for visitors who want to research a trip ahead of time and take the book along for repeated reference. Outdoor activities in Bermuda, from coral island hideaways to touring the parishes. Also exhaustive information on hotels and restaurants. An excellent guide." The Bookwatc 
 I never thought TV could be this good or produce anything like this.  I have been ignoring the Sopranos for years, finally saw one episode on HBO in a hotel and bought the first five seasons set.  I am hooked.  These episodes are better than 95% of the movies that are released and are excellent in many dimensions.  It helps that I grew up in North Jersey and am just a little older than Tony and his contemporaries (though not Italian).  Terrific show, terrific DVDs 
 I positively loved this book!  A great story all the way through.  There is just nothing bad to say about this writer.  I liked it so well that I bought all that he had out which was 4 at this time.  I'm anxiously waiting the next one!  I generally get my books from the library but this one is one to share with all my friends and relatives and then keep 
 Polanski explores the mental universe of a young girl who finds any kind of sexual contact most repelent. Catherine Deneuve plays Carole, a young French girl who lives with her older sister in London.She works as a manicurist and sees her sister's sexual life as something extremely repulsive: She can't stand her boyfriend who leaves his toothbrush in her glass,not to mention the fact that he is married.Carole is  left alone in the London flat after her sister leaves for a short holiday in Italy. Soon enough, Carole is the subject of byzarre experiences which eventually lead her to commit atrocious crimes.Polanski masterfuly takes the audience on a strange journey through this girl's mental decay.The acting is great and the story very original and avant garde for its time. Nevertheless, the DVD treatment itself is not worth a dollar.The movie wasn't at all restaured: the image is grainy, blurry at times,jumpy.The sound is terrible.The DVD comes in Fullscreen which is also very annoying, and forget about special features like trailers or subtitles because simple there are none. Hopefully some smart studio will take the time to restaure this cult classic and deliver it in a decently treated DVD in the future.. 
 In Myth America: Democracy vs. Capitalism, William H. Boyer (Professor Emeritus in Philosophy, University of Hawaii) persuasively denounces the very real and alarming growth of corporate power in America, which has increased and proliferated to such an extent that it routinely co-opts the agendas of the media and of public schools in to serve the almighty dollar and the corporate bottom line. From an obvious erosion of democratic fundamentals, to self-righteous "myths" of foreign policy used to justify abusive world dominance, Myth America is resolute in its mission to forewarn society of dangerous present trends and conditions so that an horrific anti-democratic future can be avoided for our children and our grandchildren. A highly recommended and welcome addition to Political Science reading lists, Myth America is also available in a hardcover edition 
 I purchased three of these hearts bracelets for my three daughters for Christmas.  They are very pretty and they loved them.  The quality is good for price. 
 Laura Berquist offers so much help to any Catholic homeschooler, whether you follow her suggestions closely, pick and choose, or just use it to clarify your own ideas.  She gives the reasons for her own preferences and makes several suggestions for alternatives, depending on the strengths and needs of the particular child.  The information is detailed, thorough, and completely Catholic.  I strongly recommend the book to any Catholic family who is now, or is even considering, homeschooling 
 Jennifer Lopez breathes a whole lot of life into Elmore Leonard's powerful DA Karen Sisco.  Worth noting off the top of things is that J.lo's character in this movie was not meant to be a Latina.    Nevertheless, the movie gives is plenty of great shots of J.lo's lower half, usually dressed in one heck of a power suit.    Although the Elmore Novel book was the source material, and the movie stays relatively true to it's origins, the ending was changed a bit and we are treated to a much more intense version of the relationship between the two main characters, played by George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez.   Clooney had just established his "bad ass" credentials with "From Dusk 'Till Dawn" and does a tremendous role as the lovable scumbag in this movie, having us follow along in his misadventures as he is sent to prison for bank robbing, escapes with his Cuban inmate buddies, then spends the rest of his time trying to evade the law AND plan that last great final heist at the same time.    Meanwhile, Karen Sisco is going cross country trying to take this guy down, but is also having to face up to the fact that criminal losers are her type of man.    The movie thus follows the route of our anti-heroes from Florida in December to a wintery Detroit, where a heist, hook up and final climactic confrontation all occur.    This movie features spectacular performances by character actors Ving Rhames (Clooney's sidekick), Don Cheadle (Clooney's rival), and (surprisingly) strong performances by Jennifer Lopez (this is her best role ever) and of course, George Clooney (who is at his sleazeball charming best).    The movie follows the plot of the book incredibly well, save for the ending. Also worth noting was that J.lo's character from this movie proved so likeable, that a TV show based on the character was created.    SO, if you like Elmore Leonard, Jennifer Lopez or think that Clooney is best when he's breaking the law, this is your type of popcorn fare. 
 While copyrighted in 1942, this small book addresses the problems facing performers of Western Art music. Interpretation and Performance Practices is the darling of academia today, and the "experts" in this field demand adherence to their orthodxy. To them, Dorian's effort is viewed as "quaint". But to mere mortals, this book is still an indispensable tool for finding one's way through the wilderness of stylistic practices in art musi 
 From using only two cordless controllers; this one and the XBox 360's controller, I like this one a LOT more. It's comfortable, small enough to not be too big, and just the right weight as to not be too light. I couldn't ask for a better controller- unless Logitech made the wired controller with the leather handles into a wireless one, then I'd find myself that much more pleased :) Buy this one, there isn't a better wireless controller out there 
 This cook book should be in any serious cooks/entertainers collection.  The Shrimp Scampi is simply sublime!!! The Menu Index is Fabulous including ideas for "A Hunter's Feast, Ladies Tea Room Lunch, Comfort Food for the Family," and so many more.  I have thousands of cook books and this is one I go back to time and time again.  The recipes always come out fabulous. Too bad it is no longer in print.  If you can get a used copy consider your self lucky 
 The item is a collection of five untold stories of the Babylon 5 Universe.  Movie 1, The Gathering, seems the same as the separately sold DVD with the same name.  So is Movie 2, In the Beginning.  I happened to have both of them separately, but another watch was still fascinating.  These two constitute the backbone of the five seasons of Babylon 5 TV series.  So never miss them!  One may watch them first, or after watching some episodes of the TV series.  Movie 3, Thirdspace, is about aliens whom even the builders of jump gates feared.  This may be a homage to Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos.  Movie 4, The River of Souls, is about soul hunters that appeared somewhere in the TV series.  These two may seem nonessential, but I think maybe Straczynski wanted to say such powerful godlike beings still err.  Movie 5, A Call to Arms, is a prelude to Crusade series, which is also sold as a DVD boxed set.  Galen and Dureena, regular characters in Crusade, make their first appearances.  We see how they constructed the ship Excalibur, commanded by Captain Guideon in Crusade.  Maybe one should watch this before watching Crusade series, if timeline is considered important.  Movie 3 and 4 did not seem so striking to me, so I am not giving 5 stars.  However, the price for five disc set was so reasonable.  I cannot give less than 4 stars.  
      This is an amazing service! For only 2 bucks i can watch what i like for the moment. In this case it was HG WELLS. Great biography 
 This is a book primarily about the foreign legations in Peking during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, and how they withstood a month or so of siege warfare from the Chinese rebels.   It splashes light on a time and place that I knew very little of, turn of the century China, where the Chinese were begining to throw out the foreigners who had divied up the nation for economic pursuits and started trying to congeal into a nation again. China, once the most advanced Civilization on Earth for a breath in time, had broken apart and been largely subjugated by the time of the Opium wars in the middle 1800's, not coincidentally near the zenith of the British Empire. The Boxer rebellion was not the first internal strife in China, nor the bloodiest, but it was perhaps the most directed at the Foreigners. The previous Taiping Rebellion, which claimed over 20 million lives, set up the system of provincial warlords who in effect ruled a house divided, under the auspices of a very weak Mandarin throne in Beijing. This provides the backdrop for the Boxer rebellion.  The author's writing is fluid, highly enjoyable, and highly interesting. Despite the size of the book I found it to be a particularly quick read. Her descriptions of the atmosphere and environment of China, especially Peking, near the end of the foreigners foray were completely enveloping. She also goes into depth to explain the psyche and situation of each of the major players in the event, from the cowardly and cruel to the brave and honest amongst the foreigners (Herbert Hoover even makes a prominent appearance), and to the rather depraved Empress Dowager. The Empress's Mandarins neither created nor wanted either the Boxers or the Foreigners, and therefore tried, unsucessfully, to play their weak hand by helping to pit the two against each other as much as possible.  The story is mostly told from the Legations viewpoint as an already strange situation -living in an imported slice of Europe in a Chinese mega-city blend of past Imperial grandeur and present poverty and chaos- devolves into the surreal. As the Boxers and a few of the warlords (Kansu Braves in particular) lay siege to the legations they must fight for survival and wait for rescue. The rebellion ends up spurring one of the first truly multi-national alliances, as British, American, French, German, Japanese, Italian, Russian, etc. legation members must band together to survive. These nations also throw together token forces to "rescue" their legations. Necessity forces this units to combine into the first modern allied expedition. This first rescue force itself ends up needing rescue however! One of the most interesting aspects I found was the bravery, ferocity, and skill with which the Japanese legation forces defended the Japanese and Italian legations, which were isolated from the rest. It provided some eery foreshadowing to how the Japanese would fight in WWII, especially since in 1900 the European nations completely discounted Japan as a power. They continued to do so even after their performance in the rebellion.   This is a book that will completely absorb you so that you feel you are in the legations during the siege. The Boxer rebellion story is proof that fact is more amazing than fiction, and although this book tells mostly the story of how the foreign legations reacted to and endured the rebellion -as opposed to being a comprehensive history of the event itself- the author tells the story brilliantly. 
 The is the best movie I have ever seen dealing with the following themes: Friendship, Loyalty and Trust. Even though the movie is about crime, these themes dominate the plot. The girls' commitment to each other and  loyalty to their cause is very impressive. Also the director of the movie deals with these themes in a easy, playful and humourous manner, even though the girls' couse is a risky and dangerous one. This keeps the audience interested. There is no dull moment or lousy scene in this movie 
 This was another good gift for my 4 year old for her birthday.  She learned how to interchange the outfits 
 I LIKE THIS MOVIE IT IS PRETTY GOOD . THIS IS A MOVIE ABOUT LYNN WHITFIELD HAVING A FATAL ATTRACTION FOR MARTIN LAWRENCE  I LIKED IT I THOUGHT IT WAS GOOD. BOBBY BROWN CO-STARRED IN THIS MOVIE ALONGSIDE MARTIN LAWRENCE I LIKED THIS MOVIE IT CONTAINS, DRAMA, ACTION,AND SUSPENSE ALSO, LYNN DID A ATERIFFIC ACTING JOB SHE PLAYED HER ROLE VERY WELL. FIVE THUMBS WAY UP!!!!! 
 My old HP Laserjet 4L gave out after about 10 years, or at least the hinges on the door to the toner compartment broke and it would not print. I ordered this new printer and, as always, Amazon is a great place to shop, I ordered it on a Friday and it came on Monday, which is very good service since I live in Hawaii. The only problem is the printer does not come with a USB cord. So, if you are replacing an older printer and are behind the times, you have to go and buy a USB cord. The printer was very easy to install. 
 This is the first I have read of Jayne Krentz, and overall, I enjoyed the book very well.   Zoe Luce, the main character is an interior designer in Arizona, town of Whispering Springs. She has wonderful talent for re-desigining her clients homes, and helping them to gain a new perspective.   One of her clients though, is scary, and as Zoe enters his mansion of a home the first time, she has a near panic attack, and for good reason. Having the 6th sense she does, she suspects Davis Mason has murdered his wife in cold-blood, and her suspicions are proven to be true after hiring a P.I. , Ethan Truax. He uncovers the facts quickly, but not without a high price of course. And also, sparks fly between Zoe and Ethan, and the two seem 'made for each other.   Well, as the story continues though, there is more danger ahead. Zoe has a past, and Zoe is not her real name to begin with. She has a past as Sara Cleland, a crazy woman who was believed to have murdered her beloved husband Preston. Her family had her committed to this asylum in LA., and she stayed doped up for a long time, until she found a way to escape with her friend Arcadia.   The people Zoe is running from track her down eventually, and Ethan has to find a plan for her escape from them, which he does. The two get married for convenience to put a stop to Zoe losing her money from a big trust fund, until they find out who is behind the killing of Preston for real. And later on, plan to get a divorce when things settle. But as it turns out, plans do change for the better 
 I absolutly loved this book. I think Aethelflaed is an amazing heroine. It was sad in some parts, happy in others, with a great plot. Aethelflaed seems so real, and sort of like me. I hope other people can relate to this book as well as I can 
 Amazon has the best value for this product.  Other vendors wanted nearly twice as much for the product.  It works well for people who travel.  However, 3M should consider pricing this more reasonabally.  It is just a film you put over your screen, which at $45 to $90 is pricy.  I do wish the product came with more adhesive things that hold it on the screen.  Sometime it is necessary to switch laptops 
 This is perhaps the most haunting novel I have read this year so far. I have heard so much about this book from friends that when I scanned my bookcases, I found this one and knew that it was the right time to read it. And I am so glad that I read it.   The quotes interspersed throughout the novel are inspiring and wonderful. The story of the two lovers and Summer (the main character) is beautiful and so real-to-life. Summer is home in Dayton teaching in the local high school ~~ after a broken ankle ruined her dancing career. Summer is also home for the last year of her brother's life. Todd, her brother, is dying of AIDS and is still the strongest creative force in Summer's life, and Jacob, his husband, influence Summer and her dreams in a positive way. They both show Summer that with love nothing is impossible. Not even death can sever those ties. Summer is then forced to look deep within her and find out the truth to her life.   It is a beautiful and moving story. Though I finished it last night, I am still looking for an opportunity to pick this book up and read it again. It is haunting and lyrical. The love found among those pages is just magical and inspiring. And yet, it's not sappy or sentimental. It just is. Love takes all shapes and forms among people and people without love in their souls are missing out on one of life's greatest gifts.   Pick this book up. You won't regret it.  8-21-0 
 This is the most amazing drawing book I have ever purchased. This book is extremely helpful, especially towards the end. It shows characters in different poses to help you learn how to draw them. It does suggest in the beginning to copy some of your favorite artists' work. I copied pictures out of my manga books and then tried to do something original, and I have improved greatly! GET THIS BOOK! 
 This is one of Vonnegut's best novels, an unusual combination of grimness, social critique, and sardonic humor.  There are three main characters.  Dwayne Hoover is a successful car salesman, but also a man that is slipping into madness.  The second character is Vonnegut alter ego Kilgore Trout, the little-known sci-fi writer of interesting ideas and sloppy prose.  The last character is Vonnegut himself.  Vonnegut not only inserts his thoughts into the novel, but towards the end openly debates how to proceed with the story - providing a powerful end to the book.  Naturally, these pages also combine Vonnegut-style philosophy, thoughts about free will, and social critique of the USA circa 1973.   This book doesn't have a strong plot, and falls a bit short of the author's SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE, but it's a powerful read nevertheless.   
 Oscar Wilde. In a perfect world, I'd be able to stop typing with those two words and you'd know what I'm on about. Like the author I just mentioned, Oscar Wilde was gay, and thus very much the outsider, which gave him a special insight into Victorian ethics, which he sent up in his uniquely witty way. I'd say he poured everything he had to say into these 95 little minutes. I've reviewed the recent edition of this play and said very nice things about it. But the 1952 version sticks precisely to Wilde's original script, and thus I think it's superior. The real point, though, is that actors should keep performing it, people should keep filming it, and we should keep watching it. It's brilliant and you will laugh out loud repeatedly. I'll use this in class after the long overdue vacation ends. 
 Ruth's description of the lift of a restaurant critic was both a fascinating read and mouthwatering at the same time. Her descriptions of the disguises and deferring treatments in New York's finest restaurants made for a quick page turner.  Her recipes and reviews scattered in each chapter made me both  want to eat out more often and try to cook some of those dishes myself 
 Gives a great overview of the attraction and is the perfect companion to the book on the Haunted Mansion by the same author - a must have for Disneyland fans' personal library, and it is great timing that it is coming out now in the 50th anniversary year of the park  
 Having purchased this for my kids to use and practice in time for Christmas 2005, I pretested all the music and found it to be a nice starter set of Christmas music for the piano student in their first or second year of training. The arrangements tend to be minimalistic. Caveat: there are at least two obviously wrong notes in The First Nowell and Jingle Bells, so you'd be well advised to correct them once you find them; hopefully they'll fix them by the time a second edition rolls out. Nice features: Each song can be played without turning pages. A charming black-and-white illustration accompanies each song. There's also a list of the songs in order of difficulty for those who want to learn the songs that way 
 This is the perfect resource for anyone looking for a thorough, yet concise, review book for a European history class.  Although I did not sign up for the AP European History class at my school, my teacher recommended that I sign up to take the test.  I did sign up, but due to a lack of self-studying, I felt that I was going to get a 1 or 2 on the exam in May.  In April, I bought this book.  I read it everyday (and everywhere) until the exam.  (I even read the book during other classes!)  By the time I took the exam, I felt I was adequately prepared for it.  I managed to get a 3.  There is no doubt in my mind that if I had used it over a longer period of time and read it without any distractions, I would have gotten a 5.  I highly recommend this book to all European history students, AP or otherwise 
 I was invited over to a fellow Celiac's house and bless her heart, she'd made three different varieties of gluten free baked goods.  By far and away the BEST was the coffee cake recipe from this cook book.  I tried not to make a pig of myself, but it was so good!  It was light and fluffy [not gritty and dense like most GF breads and cakes].  I think I ate half all by myself!  I'm not ashamed.    After a life time of eating gluten [too bad I know what stuff is "supposed" to taste like] I was diagnosed; I've been on the diet for 5 years now and have tried a lot of different avenues to get my dessert fix... this was the closest thing to the real deal.  So if the coffee cake is any indication of the rest of the recipes in this book I'm gonna be one happy camper!  [And my fellow Celiac assures me that this is the best GF cook book out there - we can all be happy for that! 
 Iron Fist is a very good action figure.  I think he's one of the best in this series.  His body sculpt appears to be a new one.  The articulation is great and the joints were tight and well concealed.  The paint job and details for this martial arts master are just fine, too.  I'm sure it wasn't too hard because he doesn't have a real flashy costume or anything.  But, ToyBiz did stay true to his look in the comic books.  I'm very thankful they didn't airbrush this figure to death to color all the light areas with shadows-like they did in the past couple of series.  Iron Fist comes with a copy of Iron Fist #8.  It's very good at giving you a glimpse of him in action and what drives him.  He also has a couple of plastic "flames" to fit on his hands to simulate his power of making his fists impervious (Hence, the name "Iron Fist").  They don't fit that well, but look nice if you can get them to stay on.  My kids don't really use them much, so you can take them or leave them.  This series is called the Apocalypse Series because, as in past series, the 6 figures have a piece of the 7th, larger figure-Apocalypse.  Apocalypse is a 5,000-year-old mutant and an arch nemesis of the X-Men.  He turns out to be 14 inches tall and he looks really, really good when he is all assembled.  He IS the best one in the series.  Most people probably won't consider the character selection in this series to be the best, so it was a good idea for ToyBiz to release these figures in this fashion.  Personally, I love the character selection AND the idea of building another, larger figure.  They should continue it in future releases.    Everyone will want to put together their own Apocalypse since he was very hard to get when he made his 6-inch appearance in Marvel Legends 7.  Iron Fist is pretty well stocked, so if you want him for the Apocalypse piece or not, you're still getting a nice action figure who plays and displays nicely.  There is another version of this figure available, but it is harder to find than this one.  (This is one series that has lots of different versions of the figures)  Iron Fist is in a red costume instead of green and the head sculpt has his mouth opened and a few tears out of his mask.  You're not really missing much at all if you can't find it.  The green version is every bit as good, if not better.  The only thing missing is Power Man a.k.a. Luke Cage to go alongside of him.  Here's hoping that the Heroes For Hire will be teamed up soon in Marvel Legends style 
 I really enjoyed reading this book by Ann Coulter. Her writing style is very much like her talking style. She is very witty and clever in her analogies and gets the point across very clearly. After reading her book, it should be clear to any reader what liberalism is all about and how that philosophy is in direct conflict to anyone who considers himself a conservative or even a moderate. A true liberal can be considered a fanatic in the worst sense of the word 
 This is a great children's book. It is filled with Valentine's Day poems for kids of all ages. The poems are simple and easy to read, and theres pictures for each one, too. This book will surely bring happiness to your next Valentines Day 
 This is a great,simple, fast game that is fun for all ages 
 What I would like to know is if the authors researched and interviewed key sources for the different sections? Did they interview a wine expert? Did they interview fashion experts? Were any surveys conducted as to what their target audience considers a gentleman?   If anyone knows, I would appreciate it 
 Greek History at its best. The author hit the jackpot with this book.I usually hate history books, but this one is very interesting. Rich Kurban and Harry Grivakis would love it. Even the great historian Brent Clef would  enjoy it.Nothing compares to Homer's Odyssy or Illiad, except maybe The  Snake, by Them Fakanegaz 
 Wonderful stuff!!!   I love reading and viewing anything I can get my hands on about this lovely Valley I call home. I'm fascinated by stories about young people starting .com ventures, both those who made it and those who didn't! We can all learn from each other, and most of them have the cool attitude: If at first we don't succeed, we will try and try again!  Silicon Valley is an exciting place to read about, and it's even more exhilarating to live here. As I wrote in my young adult novel, THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY:   "If, as Steven King once wrote, 'Valleys are the dimples on the face of the earth,' then Silicon Valley is undoubtedly the deepest, most sparkling dimple of them all." - Betty Dravis 
 When i first meet PVP webcomic i fell in love with all the staff, i could easily identify myself with every one of them in diferent levels, then i became a complete fanboy of Kurtz's work.  This PVP Volume is as good as the first volume was, and a easy way to own the comics that i in my country would never find in a local store. 
 I loved this book for the glamorous exotic setting of Victorian Egypt.  The hero is extremely sexy and manly, and the whole tale is just very mysterious and glamorous. One of the best of the year 
 This is a very well written and helpful book, for beginners as well as experienced quilters.  I have talked to many quilters who are afraid of choosing their own fabrics for quilts and opt for buying kits instead.  This book helps to explain and shows examples of how to choose the best colors to get the look you want. 
 In the 1970s male bashing was at it's highest, in the 1980s until now, feminist started targeting boys as young as 6 years old who are unfortunate to play or argue with a girl in their class with sexual harassment. Many feminist groups publicly support blatant boy-bashing (i.e. "Boys are Stupid" T-shirts) as well as covert abuse, while vigilantly demanding that girls be protected by any negative influences to protect their self-image.   Men are attacked from every direction: stereotypes emphasize men as evil oppressors and women as victims needing to be rescued by an easily manipulative government who is more than willing to lavish feminist groups with billions in federal and state tax dollars for funding for women's issues only and programs that discriminate against men and boys.  As a woman I see these things happen and feel sorry for boys and men, but I can't defend people who won't defend themselves. As far as my sons go, they will be well educated, as for the rest of you guys. Be men and start standing up for yourselves! 
 Having read and enjoyed LeGuin's previous non-fiction works (particularly DANCING AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD,  THE LANGUAGE OF THE NIGHT,  and her writing book, STEERING THE CRAFT), I expected an interesting and entertaining volume of essays. What I got far exceeded my expectations. I was enchanted from the first words, and I could hardly wait to read as many of these pieces as I could gulp down each night. When I finished, I was unhappy it was all consumed. I wanted more.  The book is a cornucopia of variety. There are serious essays, playful performance pieces, literary commentary, a long and wonderful poem entitled "The Writer on, and at, Her Work," and even some sketches LeGuin has done. The volume is separated into four sections: Personal Matters, Readings, Discussions & Opinions, and On Writing. The first section gives the reader a glimpse of who Ursula LeGuin is. She talks a bit of her family, of her parents' occupations (anthropologist father and biographer mother), and of her love of libraries and islands-imaginary and real. The next two sections cover all sorts of topics. Whether she was discussing awards and gender or the submerged humor of Mark Twain's "Diaries of Adam and Eve" or literacy or rhythm in the works of JRR Tolkien, I felt I was in sure hands. I must admit that I expected the essay, "Stress-Rhythm in Poetry and Prose" to be deadly dull. Instead, I was surprised beyond my wildest imagination to find that for the first time in my entire life, someone had actually explained meter and rhythm so that it made complete sense to me. I had one of those "Aha!" moments, suddenly understanding it in a way that I had never quite managed. (So _that_ is how iambic pentameter works so effectively!) I've been raving ever since about rhythm to all who will listen.  I like the fact that LeGuin does not hesitate to address sexism, homophobia, and unfairness. Her piece entitled "Unquestioned Assumptions" is masterful. She talks about the four common varieties of unquestioned assumption (We're all men, white, straight, and Christian), and then adds a fifth which she explores at length: We're all Young. Her analysis of these issues alone was worth the price of the book.   The final section of the book is about writing and was my favorite section. LeGuin addresses many angles of craft and technique. The name of the book, THE WAVE IN THE MIND, refers to an explanation of style that Virginia Woolf once wrote in a letter. Concerning what rhythm is, Woolf had written, "A sight, an emotion, creates this wave in the mind...and then, as it breaks and tumbles in the mind, it makes words to fit it" (p. xii).  LeGuin obviously agrees with this. She writes that "every novel has its characteristic rhythm. And that if the writer hasn't listened for that rhythm and followed it, the sentences will be lame, the characters will be puppets, the story will be false. And that if the writer can hold to that rhythm, the book will have some beauty. What the writer has to do is listen for that beat, hear it, keep to it, not let anything interfere with it. Then the reader will hear it too, and be carried by it" (p. 183). This is sage advice.  All of LeGuin's ideas and advice-every chapter of it-is wonderful. I loved this: "Trust your story; trust yourself; trust your readers-but wisely. Trust watchfully, not blindly. Trust flexibly, not rigidly. The whole thing, writing a story, is a high-wire act-there you are out in midair walking on a spiderweb line of words, and down in the darkness people are watching. What can you trust but your sense of balance?" (p. 234).   The examples, stories, and allusions throughout are clear and strong and elegant. Her Voice is powerful and wise, humorous and reflective. Ursula LeGuin quite clearly displays true genius. This is a book to savor, to keep, to read again and again over the years. I cannot recommend it highly enough. ~Lori L. Lake, reviewer for Midwest Book Review and author of the "Gun" series 
 As a really under-informed layperson, I found this book enormously useful for its clear explanations of what had been (to me, at least) a completely unknown investment area. But I have to say that I enjoyed this book just as much for the opportunity to peer into the lives of the foreign exchange traders themselves--the hours they keep, the challenges in the field. I enjoyed (funny to say this about a financial book...) Forex Revolution for these good human-interest stories as well as for its valuable insights into what I'd always assumed was a very arcane subject. No more, thanks to Rosenstreich's new book 
 Most sports fans have heard that Jones won the Grand Slam, but few (including myself) realize the temper that Jones had or how the quest to win ate him up. Also the story of his later life was unknown to me as well 
 I am a documentary lover, however when a family member put on this film I was just not in the mood. However, within a short span of minuets I found myself quite engrossed. This film is beautifully done. There is a minimal amount of subtitles provided of the conversation, and I found myself not needing them. This film will capture your heart, and remind you that people, and especially children, are the same the world over. When one of the family's beloved camels rejects her colt, the healing ritual that is performed is astounding. The events captured in their entirety left me agape with wonder. I can quite honestly say it was the most amazing thing I have ever seen. I will never look at the world or the relationships of people and animals the same way again. 
 This is the first Moore book that I have read, and I have to say, I am a fan.  I've read a lot of Tom Robbins (Jitterbug Perfume, Still Life With Woodpecker) and his style is very similar, but more straightforward I think.  And just as funny.  I haven't laughed so hard at a book in a long time. The premise is fairly simple... A young man, Travis, conjurs a demon on accident while cleaning the accolyte candles at a Catholic church.  He is stuck with the demon, who does not have to tell him how he can be sent back to Hell.  He tries various methods of returning his demon friend to the underworld such as reading cantations from spell books and running him over with his car.  The young man wanders the United States in search of a way to be rid of his scaled friend, while the demon Catch proceeds to eat various victims in every place they stop.  They finally come to the unsuspecting town of Pine Cove California.   The story takes off from there, jumping back and forth from different perspectives as the town tries to deal with this demon menace.   Moore has an easy to read, yet very witty and sarcastic writing style. I would recommend this book and the author to anyone who's looking for a good laugh, and I plan to read more Moore in the future.  Heck, I could even see this being made into a movie.. 
 Born confused  pretty much explains my own life. It makes me feel like theres someone out there that knows who I am in some way. It is a book for a bit older people but i find it intreging! Lindsay,11 
 I bought this book for a 3 year old nephew. Not only he loved it but also I did.  The book contains many great crafting ideas for kids.  Most easy to make with no need fo detailed instructions 
 This is a very practical and extremely helpful book on being a witness in the workplace.  Dr. Larimore is co-author of "The Saline Solution: Sharing Your Faith in Your Practice", a course that has been widely used in the medical profession to help doctors become effective witnesses in their practices.  The authors emphasize the need to focus on being a witness and not on "witnessing", quoting John Fischer in "Fearless Faith":  "Salvation is God's thing and is out of our control.  Saving people is God's part, ours is being a witness."  The book places a healthy emphasis on relational evangelism, because, "We believe that the bubble has burst for an aggressive, non-relational approach to evangelism."  According to the authors, this book is based on four simple, but big, ideas:  1.	"Evangelism is a process.  The journey of faith takes place over the course of time as a person makes many small, incremental decisions that lead to the big decision of trusting and following Jesus." 2.	"Our job in evangelism is to discover where God is already at work in a person's life and to join Him there, not to force a conversation or persuade someone to pray a prayer he or she may not be ready to pray." 3.	"Being a person of spiritual influence is every Christian's calling, not just the responsibility of a gifted few." 4.	"More so than the inside of a church building or a foreign mission, the workplace is the most strategic place of ministry for most Christians."  This is a very practical and pithy book, in part because the authors give a one-sentence summary at the end of each chapter.  It should prove to be of immense help to anyone who is serious about being an effective witness in the workplace.  It combines many of the principles in other helpful books and tools, such as "Living Proof", "The Insider" and "Becoming a Contagious Christian" and applies them to the workplace.  I can recommend it highly.  
 It is inspiring to hear and see footage of the world's best violinists performing.. 
 I stopped to write a review only because I saw that all five stars were not fully checked. One can like or not like the content of the book, but as a exposition of writing craft it is - bar none - the best book in the world. (Allright, I'll be circumspect, maybe one of the best). It will blow you away and change the way you think about the novel as a literary form. A genius at his best, no less 
 A terrific book about an extremely disturbed yet meticulous mind.  Rudolf Hoess was just one amongst the many who were perfectly ordinary human beings; but having an extremly dark and evil side to them.  For a person to destroy thousands of people during day and then tell stories to his children at bedtime and kiss his wife goodbye and then return to destruction again does speak of a motivation that is far beyond comprehension of most of us. Whether it was circumstantial or of an inner voice; it  takes a lot for a man to be at the helm of an operation to destroy more than a million fellow human beings without as much as batting an eyelid.  Perhaps this was what made Hitler stand out from any other human being born on this earth since its creation; his ability to sway people and convert the most ordinary human beings into cold blooded killer machines.  Humanity will never pardon or forget the evils of Hitler; but that apart he was the only individual who was gifted with the power to enthrall people to such an extent that the line between cruelty and evil was forgotten.  And Rudolf Ferdinand Hoess was one amongst the thousands who was himself a victim of Hitler 
 I strongly suggest to buy and read this book to all people interested in history in general.   I am a fan of history books, and I provilege high readable, well documented and general-picture-introducing books. This book satisfies all these criteria: it gives a full explanation of the context before and after the Empire's collapse, it is enjoyable to read, and it is well-grounded on the reports by witnesses from both parties (turks and christians).   This is my first book by Runciman, and I bet will not be the last. 
 I grew up listening to this album in LP form, and it was one of the only albums that my father and I could agree on.  Now I listen to it not only for the nostalgic factor, but because it truly contains some of the greatest sing-along songs in swing music.  I can't wait to listen to the CD to hear what the songs sound like without the scratchy background noises from my father's ancient record album 
 Best Steppenwolf collection,very very cool band!Great songs and John Kay is true ARTIST.Sounds as good as 30 years ago!!!! 
 Suzanne White always tells it like it is. Her new Guide to Love gives you all the information you need to know about a possible mate, lover or business partner. I found my own adorable mate by using this book. And it sure helped me eliminate the dead wood! Thank you for stocking this important reference book. Everybody should own at least one copy 
 The Police don't need any introduction and I doubt this album does either. I had it on (very worn) vinyl for years but finally decided to upgrade to CD. In light of their recent announcement of a reunion tour, it may not be long before this becomes harder to find and/or more expensive than it is at the moment. It's great rock music delivered in the way only The Police know how but it's also classic 80s pop.  My favourite tunes are "Every Breath You Take", "Synchronicity II" (I absolutely loved the video!), "Tea In The Sahara" and "Wrapped Around Your Finger" but it's a great CD all round. Even back then, it was easy to see that Sting would become the megastar that he eventually did. I hope the reunion works out. I'd pay good money to see these guys play live.  
 This is an intimate account of what one woman goes through after having a heart attack.  I was surprised about how much I enjoyed it.  It is has a great deal of clinical detail of the illness, but it is mostly about the recovery process, the slow, hard, and difficult recovery from the insult to the body.  Reading about someone who can't do the basic acts we all take for granted makes it easier to count your own blessings 
 Lush life is one of the best record i've ever heard, naturally with My favorite things and the Miles Davis Quintet period (relaxin', steamin', workin', cookin' with...) Coltrane is at the top of is Art.... an angel! 
 Just skimmed this detailed book and its focus is profitability for a construction company. Includes a CD with helpful forms and checklists 
 Kay Hooper is one of my favorite authers.  Her books are fastastic--right up there with the great Nora Roberts and Catherine Coulter 
 This is the way into Judaism so many of us have been searching for - life-touching. The author is a great teacher, she explains things clearly in a way that empowers you to figure out how you might want to do Jewish in your own life. She's not trying to push any particular brand of Judaism on the reader, very refreshing.  Toxified as a young adult by Hebrew school, now, as an adult, when I was gifted with Meaning and Mitzvah, I couldn't put it down. Last year, when I read R'Milgram's first book, my reaction was the same. I give her books as Hanukkah, wedding and bar/bat mitzvah presents and to those intermarried or considering converting to Judaism. 
 St. Louis skipper Tony La Russa took more heat from this book than any decisions or comments he made during his hall-of-fame managerial career.  Teaming with writer Buzz Bissinger, the book chronicles a 2003 three-game series the Cardinals had with the Chicago Cubs. The book weaves through the games through the eyes of La Russa, with outstanding pieces on his life and feelings about the game.  At least one player made it known to La Russa - through the proverbial baseball grapevine - that he would no longer autograph items for auction to benefit Tony La Russa's ARF due to several comments in the book.   There were other grumblings that made it to print in the national press - especially that Bissinger was attempting to debunk the theory of statistical analysis in the bestselling Moneyball - but Three Nights in August is a true account of what a manager is thinking at the moment something is happening on the field or in the dugout. That it was a true account puts the negative comments in perspective.  A reader will not get any closer to the action or gain a better appreciation on the life off the field of La Russa.     
 This book is interesting book as it tells the story of a jewish lady and a hitiler youth member side by side.He, about his growth in the hitiler youth.Her's, about her struggle in the concentration camps.They would latter meet and attend lectures together.A nice book 
 A wonderful and inciteful book for anyone with a gaited horse.  A fundamental "must read" and one of the first resources I recommend to all who come to me for help to understand about gait, what it is and how to help their horses acheive natural fluid gait without mechanical aids, bizarre shoeing or hoof angles and severe bitting.  Lee has accomplished a huge work here that has become a cornerstone for those of us working with gaited horse owners, to help them understand that their horses have bred-in abilities and a little basic horsemanship goes a long ways.  Thank you Lee 
 After reading this book, proofs have become second nature to me. Before reading this book, I had no idea how to prove anything, I would stare blindly at a problem without knowing where to start. Although the book fails to provide solutions to the supplementary problems, they're pretty straight forward. All problems follow from the section. But this has given me the understanding I needed and I would recommend it to anyone who would like to understand how to approach any math problem. Great Book 
 Teada is a young four-piece band which won the Irish Music Magazine's "Best Traditional Newcomers 2003" award.  This is no nonsense traditional, West Coast style, mostly instrumental music played on fiddle, guitar, flute, bouzouki, piano, banjo and bodhran.  Jigs, reels and hornpipes are played with consummate skill and the Gaelic songs have a gentle understatement that is appealing.  The unaccompanied "Peigin `s Peadar" in three-part harmony has a truly ancient feel about it, while "A Bhean a' ti" will be familiar to lovers of early Clannad recordings.  The whole album conjures up a great night at an Irish pub, rather than a studio recording.  It rolls along at a pretty even and gentle pace, with emphasis on melody and charm rather than fancy arrangements.  Perhaps the bodhran playing could have been more varied, but lovers of traditional Irish music will definitely enjoy.  Interesting notes on the pieces are provided 
 Gore Vidal's major assets in writing political books are his wit, knowledge, and ability to write.  Mr. Vidal clearly shows what political problems exist and uses precision in diagnosing these problems.  His PERPETUAL WAR FOR PERPETUAL PEACE, a phrase used by the great historian Charles Austin Beard, is apt title for this book.  Readers should note that Vidal gives Beard credit for this phrase.  Vidal wrote one of the best assessments of the tragedy in Oklahoma for which Timothy McVeigh was executed.  This tragedy which took place in 1995 is carefully discussed by Vidal.  Vidal indicates that the way the feds explained the explosion is impossible to believe.  One should note that the feds cleared the debris from this explosion as quickly as possible removing forensic evidence that could have implicated others or revealed that the force of the explosion was not due to the explanations offered by government "experts."  Another interesting facet of Vidal's assessment of Timothy McVeigh view of the U.S. government.  McVeigh expressed anger and frustration and anger at government corruption and lying regarding both domestic and diplomatic issues.  Vidal's evaluation of McVeigh is thought provoking.  One should clearly note that Vidal does not condone McVeigh's actions, but one should at least be aware of why events, as tragic as they may be, do occur.  Vidal also gives some of the best explanations of U.S. foreign policy blunders that benefit no one except defense contractors, Pentagon bureaucrats, and some members of the U.S. House and Senate.  These corrupt cronies faced a severe problem when the Soviets conceded that the U.S. could outspend them on arms races and comitted the crime of refusing to play the game any longer.  Defense contractors, Pentagon flunkies, U.S. political figures, etc., had to invent new enemies to justify their bloated budgets and criminality.  Vidal cites examples from Latin America (espeically Columbia), Asia, and Africa where U.S. political and military intervention has made life miserable and unbearable.  What has been the result?  Vidal carefully explains that Americans have become hated.  In other words, the pious platitudes and obnoxious lies do not stand when the political realities and tragedies affect other peoples.  Those who have branded this book as "Bush bashing" have apparently not read it.  Vidal does not spare anyone in this book, and he demonstrates keen criticism of those who are prominent Democrats and Republicans. Vidal had serious clashes with the Kennedys.    This reviewer doubts if Gore Vidal's books will change the world. However, his book titled PERPETUAL WAR FOR PERPETUAL PEACE is there for the record.  One should carefully examine pages 22-41 to see just how extensive U.S. military and political intervention is.  Readers should refer to Theodore Rushton's previous review of this book to get a more concise view.  This reviewer agrees with Mr. Rushton that this book is important.  Gore Vidal is not a "trained historian" which is why the book is worth reading.  Mr. Vidal does not cater to politically correct nonsense and political agendas.  He is more concerned with truth which is a lesson current historians have long abandoned 
 Love it, Love it, Love it ... ... you have all opened up "diet" cookbooks hoping there is that little secret in there on how to eat what you love and be healthy at the same time and the pictures look great and then you cook it and blahhh!!!      Well that is NOT this cookbook.  It is real food, great comfort recipes, something for everyone, easy to prepare, and dishes you can serve to your hubby and he never knows any different!!!  And the icing on the cake ... all the great motivational stories, great tips and help from the people we know and love from the Biggest Loser hit show!  ENJOY!!! 
 This little book is perfect for me. Even the cover says "aah". In fact, it's one of about six I have on a little shelf reserved for favorites. McKay and Fanning do an outstanding job of calming you on every page. Every chapter spoke directly to me in easily identifiable subjects and simple language. Who ever thought there was a trick to breathing? After all, I've been doing it all my life. Thanks, guys.   
 It is little wonder why the leaders at Toyota give Henry Ford the credit for leading them to the promised land of LEAN and TPS. He was way ahead of his time and in some respects his vision is still way ahead of our time. What an amazing personality, mind, and story 
 Evelyn Mercer served as a foster parent for years.  During that time, she only found four children she couldn't place with adoptive parents.  Bobby, Angel, Jerimiah, and Jackie Mercer all lived with Evelyn in her house till they were grown, and she saved them from much harder lives than they would have had.  Bobby is still a hardhead and a fighter.  Angel pulled a stint in the military, but remains a man of violence.  Jerimiah became an upstanding businessman and overextended his grasp.  Jackie was pure rock and roll.  One November night, Evelyn was gunned down in a convenience store.  Her sons come back to Detroit for her funeral and stay for revenge, having to stay one step ahead of the police to get the job done.  While fighting the bad guys, they also have to fight each other and find a way to pull together.  Mark Wahlberg (INVINCIBLE, THE ITALIAN JOB) plays Bobby Mercer, putting together one of his street-tough roles that he does well.  Tyrese Gibson (2 FAST 2 FURIOUS, ANNAPOLIS) plays Angel.  Andre Benjamin (Outkast) stars as Jerimiah.  Garrett Hedlund (TROY, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS) plays Jack.  Terrence Howard (IDLEWILD, GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN') plays police detective Green.  John Singleton (2 FAST 2 FURIOUS, BABY BOY, SHAFT, BOYZ IN THE HOOD) directed.  Definitely leading with an edgy revenge western feel, FOUR BROTHERS stands up, takes names, and kicks butt from the beginning.  The relationship between the four brothers feels real, not forced, and they seem to have a history together.  The pacing keeps the story moving along and introduces enough twists and turns and oddball characters that the viewer doesn't really know how everything is going to turn out.  The revenge motif will get answered, but perhaps not in the way that's expected.  The Detroit surroundings look real, and the chase through the snow was a great bit even though it was ultimately pretty simple.  Enough of the story was hidden to keep the viewer guessing the whole way through.  Chiwetel Ejiofor stars as Victor Sweet and is one of the hardest and most menacing villains on the screen lately.  FOUR BROTHERS definitely isn't family fare.  It's more of a good buddy flick and a guy film.  The violence, swearing, and no-holds-barred intensity might jar some viewers who don't expect it, but viewers looking for an action movie with a little something extra will enjoy this one 
 This deck is very interesting simply because it incorporates so many beautiful images in a very stylised manner. I like the effects created - they look like some old painting that have been ravaged by age somewhat.  Other than that, the imagery in the cards is quite stunning. The pictures tell a story of their own. The LWB that accompanies the deck is well written too - each card has a line from a poem. Although the imagery digresses from the classical Rider-Waite imagery, the meanings come out so beautifully - its amazing.  I think that each deck with a slightly varied theme, should have different images and interpretations, so that a reader can derive more and more from the card than just basic text-book meanings attached to a particular card. I believe this helps the reader exercise his/her "psychic muscle" 
 There isn't much I can add that the previous reviewers haven't already - and very eloquently -- written about this unusual book.   As a life-long reader & amasser of books, I knew by the time I reached page 30, I was hooked. The narrator, having lost his memory, returns home from hospital and is led by his wife to a long room crammed with books whose titles he recognizes & begins to examine:   "I have so many books. Sorry, we do."  "Five thousand here. And there's always some imbecile who comes over and says, my how many books you have, have you read them all?"  "And what do I say?"  "Usually you say: Not me, why else would I be keeping them here...As for the five thousand I've already read, I gave them away to prisons and hospitals. And the imbecile reels."   At last thanks to Mr Eco, I have a snappy reply for the next person who says to me, what a lot of books you have, have you read them all...  
 Jesse Stone is sort of Spenser's alter ego. He's younger, and Spenser's never had a drinking problem, but other than that, they're pretty much the same character, except Stone's about thirty years younger. Robert B. Parker has been writing detective novels for a very long time now: this is the fourth Stone novel, there are 31 Spenser novels, three featuring his third character, Sunny Randall, and nine books that aren't part of a series, some of them non-fiction. That's 47 books, for those who aren't keeping up with the math. Obviously, by now Parker knows what he's doing. He seems able to write one of these every six months or so: he alternates between Randall, Spenser, and Stone with ease, and just floats along.  In this outing, Stone's faced with a real problem. Paradise (the town he's Chief of Police in) has been hit by a rash of killings, and it's soon apparent that they're the work of a serial killer, or killers. Stone has no way of tracking the killer at first, and the killers seem able to strike with impunity and kill whoever they wish.  Meanwhile, there's also a scared girl at the local high school, the victim of a gang rape and some threats afterwards. Stone has to resolve things, and control the situation so that the girl doesn't get hurt.  And of course there's his personal life, which has been a problem for him since the series started with Night Passage. His ex-wife is a manipulative sociopath, interested in only herself and how she can control him, near as I can tell. In this installment, she attempts to manipulate him more than she should, and things take some interesting turns.  I enjoyed this book a great deal, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for some light reading 
 I love Saving Jane and the songs off this album are GREEAT! It's flippin awesome times a gazillion,a MUST BUY! Saving Jane ROCKS, no doubt!<33 
 I picked this book up because unlike Alexandra Robbins "Pledged," Ms. Vida actually decided to experience a sorority rush as one of the "rites of initiation" she covered. For her other topics, she interviewed young women in the situations and did her best to observe some of the activities (e.g. a debutante ball). I especially enjoyed her epilogue where she attended the Burning Man festival in Nevada. I found it to be an amusing point of view and an enjoyable light read 
 I received this book as a gift when my first child was born and still refer to it occassionally for those "what can we do today?"  times.  Chapters are arranged according to appropriate activities ranging  from birth to age 3 years.  Most important to us were the ideas of what to  do with your newborn.  Topics in each chapter include MOVEMENT, MUSIC, WORD  PLAY, OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES, QUIET TIMES AND INDOOR GAMES.  There are also  chapters on various entertainment media, toys and parties.  This book is  full of FUN things you can do with your baby.  The only minus is that if  you don't know the tunes to some of the songs, you'll have a hard time  singing to your little bumpkin 
 If you want to be a mediator, you will have to take an exhausting training in just about any jurisdiction. You will be required to take at least 40 hours of training. In fact, before beginning the training, my best advice for you is to get a copy of this book, which can be read in four hours or less, and I am positively sure that you will have a considerable edge over your training classmates. They will all wonder if you came to the training with prior experience. Not only you will feel more confident in knowing the process, but you will also get good suggestions from the author as to how to conduct particular matters. I think that when you want to try something new, whatever it may be, e.g., table chess, judo, dog breeding, etc., you need a beginners guide and lots of advice from knowledgeable people. This is precisely what this book does with respect to mediation 
 This is a terrific children's DVD. It is advertised as "Spanish Version," but -- like most DVDs -- it's a multilingual version, with English, French, and Spanish options. The titles on the DVD are "The Birthday Machine," "Go West Young Train," and "The Birthday Balloons." All three episodes are the usual Little Einsteins fare -- more educational than most children's 'adventure' cartoons. They are perfect for our two-year-old, and are also enjoyed by a three-year-old (nearly four) who visits periodically. Highly recommended 
 World is not like some think it is. 
 There are few scholars who have tackled the implications of the Holocaust with as much insight and intelligence as Lawrence Langer.  From his analysis of Holocaust literature, to his impassioned invective against the misuse of Anne Frank's diary, his insightful analysis of Holocaust art, and his critical examination of the possibility of choice in the death camps, Langer has over the past twenty years carved himself a niche as one of the best Holocaust scholars.  *Admitting the Holocaust* is the first collection of his essays Holocaust-related themes.  Anyone interested in the Holocaust and its implications for contemporary life and thought cannot afford to pass up this collection.  The piece "The Dilemma of Choice in the Nazi Deathcamps" is by itself worth the cost of the book.  Coupled with his more recent collection, *Preempting the Holocaust*, this book is an extremely valuable contribution to any personal, public or educational library.  (Don't pass up his *Holocaust Testimonies* either.)  Perhaps only Elie Wiesel has addressed the Holocaust with more insight and sensitivity than Langer.  Five stars for all of his works to date 
 There is nothing unusual about this drive with respect to installation.  It's just like any other 40 pin IDC.  The above reviewer must be a dope 
 I may never get to photograph an NFL game from the sidelines, but I learned a lot of useful techniques from this book.  The pictures are great -- I should only do this well!  If you're curious about how sports photographs should be taken, this guide is for you 
 First, I have been a professional speaker and educator for the past 8 years and I am very pleased that Ken presented this informally and completely as himself. It reconfirms Kens' constant striving to present what he sees as truth authentically, which is visible in all of his work. If you really get what he is trying to convey, it would not make sense for him to present it in any other fashion.  This is the real deal folks.  I love Ken's intermittent laughter (perfect!), quirky since of humor and am constantly amazed at his unbelievable talent to integrate - everything.  His work has helped me beyond explanation in sorting and comprehending the many important questions about our existence and beyond.  I hope that in our lifetime, more people reach a level/stage of consciousness to understand the gift that Ken Wilber has been given of insight and communication of the big picture.  For me personally, the information within these 10 CDs has been life-changing. Vicki Sullivan, PhD, RD   
 Alice McDermott's narrators are all sharp observers. They see things you might miss. If you like subtlety, you'll find it here as she flits like a butterfly among the characters while they struggle in slightly adverse circumstances. All the little trials of life in Queens, the bus rides, the bills to pay for sending kids to school when there are financial limitations, the meeting of life's challenges, ordinary people doing their best to keep themselves steady while stormy winds blow around them. Why aren't these stories made into films?  Nadine Gall 
 This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.   "Shoot the Piano Player" known in France as "Tirez sur le pianiste" is one of Fran?ois Truffaut's earlies works and is quite popular.  It is about a pianist working at a bar in Paris. Depressed over the suicide of his wife, he begins to fall in love witha  waitress at the bar. The pianist's brothers have gotten into trouble with some mobsters and seek his help.  The Criterion edition is a double disc set with many extra features.   Disc 1 contains the film with optional audio commentary by film scholars, Annette Insdorf and Peter Brunette and a theatrical trailer.  Disc 2 contains interviews with Charles Aznavour and Marie Dubois, director of photography Raoul Coutard, and Truffaut collaborator Suzanne Schiffman, Marie Dubois' screen test, excerpts from 2 documantaries on the film and the novel which the film is based on, and an audio essay on the film's music.  In addition the liner notes have 28 bages of other material.  This is the best edition of the film to get 
 First, a word about the term cult fiction, and its implications. When I first saw the title of this little book, I assumed it would be full of strung-out wreckages like Burroughs and Dick. While the Rough Guide does contain them (as it should), its scope is far greater than writers of that type. In here you'll find a wind range of novelists reviewed, including Graham Greene, John Fowles, even Zane Grey. Bottom line: an excellent resource for readers 
 As soon as I finished the first book in this series, Whiskey Sour, I snapped up the next one, Bloody Mary.  J.A. Konrath brings the same mix of humor, suspense, character and plot to this sequel that made the first one impossible to put down, and I tore through this one equally quickly.  Again we are off with a bang as Jack has to solve the mystery of an extra pair of limbs that turn up in the morgue, handcuffed together...with her own handcuffs!  Signs quickly point to a killer who has killed before and will again, and who seems to be close to the police department, and possibly a member of the police himself.  The mystery aspect was somewhat less believable, resting on the assumption that the killer is almost animalistically out of control in his killing rage and yet able to maintain his cover on a day to day basis, and able to form an alliance with a helper to boot.  It's easier to see "who dunnit" almost from the start, but the plot takes some unexpected twists in the second half of the book.  The character development continues as both Jack and her co-stars gain more depth and background, and Jack faces both a career crisis and a romantic dilemma (that is perhaps a bit too easily resolved).  I continue to like this series very much and look forward to another installment, but I do hope the author is able to move away from the "Jack is personally targetted by a crazed killer" theme--once worked well, twice was a stretch I was willing to make with the author because the rest of the book was so good, but three or more times would become rather ridiculous!  Still I look forward to more good things from Jack and J.A. Konrath 
 Dr.Kissinger discusses the waning influence of Russia and the rising Chinese modernization program. The author asks that we develop a bond and new world order rather than a sheepish acceptance of whatever happens over time. American pre-eminence is a concommitant part of our ultimate destiny. The Treaty of Westphalia in 1848 set forth the policy of national soverignty. This policy implementation has been in place for decades since that time.   There is a new concept of Universal Humanitarianism and Jurisdiction by individual nations or even groups. Currently, the historic nation states group together in order to formulate strategies which benefit all. NAFTA is a clear example of this doctrine in implementation. In the past, far lesser alliances and transformations lead to big wars. The author believes that nuclear proliferation renders war less likely because of the strategic congruence of interests and stakes.  Currently, India, China, Russia and Japan treat each other as strategic rivals. Previously, the Atlantic Relationship lasted due to Russia, the unification of Germany and a growing European identity. Russia proclaimed a zone of special influence in the Balkans. Asia's challenge is how to prevent neighbors from joining coalitions against it. The Middle East and Africa are in a considerable state of flux. According to Dr.Kissinger, humanitarianism is limited by our willingness to pay an incremental price which may or may not be the ultimate price.  The book is a good historic rendition of the previous approaches to global challenges, the new challenges posed and the strategic interests aligned for the future 
 This book has many virtues, but I want to speak to one in particular: how writers can best engage in marketing their own books (whether they publish themselves or have a contract with a publishing house).  I don't think anybody else covers this topic with the experience, insight, common sense, practical advice, and cheerful realism that Judith Appelbaum brings to the task.  Most writers get modest support (if any) from the publisher--you need to roll up your sleeves and do it yourself if you're going to get the readers you deserve.  You can spend more time on marketing, over a longer period of time, than the publisher can, you know your audience better than the publisher does, and you are better connected to your audience than the publisher is.  Believe me. They've got hundreds of books to worry about--and you've only got ONE.  Make the most of it. This book is your best friend and coach for the long distance run.  Writers who ignore its advice will regret the consequences of that decision for the rest of their lives.  Judith Appelbaum lays out the options and leaves the decisions of how much to do for you to figure--did I mention that she is also a delight to read?--honestly I think every publishing contract should come with a copy of this book 
 First of all, this is great stuff; these arrangements aren't as far from the versions heard in the cartoons as some reviewers would have you think. The electric harpsichord does give a couple of the pieces a somewhat dated sound, but it works oddly well in the beautiful and underrated "You're in Love, Charlie Brown." I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes emotive, catchy instrumental music, especially if you lean toward jazz piano. Vince's ivories are mixed loudest throughout, thankfully, and the whole collection's a delight.  Granted, the mixing's not very good (I'm thinking primarily of the high level of hiss), but it's pretty old, after all; I made myself a noise-reduced version of the disc using Nero Wave Editor 2. But this is certainly better than the noisy, chair-scraping, musician-coughing mix on the Charlie Brown Suite, another CD that doesn't have the original arrangements.  It's not Coltrane or Satie, but it's terrific piano music and it leaves you in a great mood. I admit I don't understand why nobody ever busted Guaraldi on "Rain, Rain, Go Away," which is of course a gorgeous piece of music, but for a good reason: It's a direct rip-off of the Debussy piece "Clair De Lune." The CD insert explains that all of the songs were written by Vince Guaraldi. This is not the case. I'm not sure why he got away with this, especially considering that the Debussy melody is so relatively popular. In fact, it casts a suspicious light on the rest of Vince's so-called originals.  Recommended but not entirely original -- which of course doesn't ruin the pleasure of listening, in the abstract 
 If you love musical theater this is an absolute must.  I enjoyed this program even more than the first Broadway's Lost Treasures.  How fortunate we are to have these fantastic performances preserved for us to enjoy.  Buy it 
 I love this book.  It may not be quite the blast of noirish fresh air that the Maltese Falcon it, but it is fascinating psychologically.  It is my second favorite Hammet book after the Falcon.  If you like this book you should check out the movie Miller's Crossing which is essentially a film adaptation of it 
 Got these for my husband for fun, he really likes them, but they are a little small behind his head.  So if you wear a large hat size, these aren't ideal.  They are good readers for working in his shop

 We rented this movie and my 3-year-old boy loved it.  He keeps asking for it even after we had to return it.  I've heard him singing, "Tonka, Tonka, Ton-ka!" (Think conga line...!)  My one-year-old boy liked it, too.  Definitely a good little boy movie 
 Rebecca Cole's imagination soars when it comes to potted gardens! I love the way she sees containers in everyday items--including items headed for the trash! Hurray for Rebecca and giving me new vision for my garden 
 I loved this movie. Ebert & Roper are right. The cast is solid..every performance.Being a sports fan, I die with Keaton in the bar.This movie is so much better than most of the junk out there.A great "sit 
 Werner Herzog sure has a soft spot for obsessive idealists engaged in hopelessly enormous tasks (Aguirre: Wrath of God, Invincible, Heart of Glass, and so on...). One need not be a head-shrinker to see why the director identifies with the protagonist of Fitzcarraldo, a man who endows himself with the Herculean undertaking of dragging a steamboat up and over mountain to deliver opera to the savages.  The picture stars Herzog Best Friend Forever (and presumed crazy person) Klaus Kinski as the titular Irish émigré. An aspiring rubber baron and music enthusiast, Fitzcarraldo plots a way to combine his two interests into one profitable endeavor. The scheme: access an untapped forest of rubber trees, farm them, and build an opera house with the profit. Seems reasonable enough except for those perilous rapids that have prevented previous missions from getting there.  His solution is inspired: take the steamboat not over water, but over land. Enlisting the help of the Natives, Fitzcarraldo tasks himself with the impossible. On more than one occasion, we have to ask ourselves - why does the Indian tribe, who know nothing of the white man's goal, assist him in his strange quest? We are never given a direct answer, only left to assume that it is for the same reason so many great things are done - simply to see if we can.  Herzog's film has a wonderful visual poetry to it, something so few directors even attempt any more (let alone accomplish). Despite duplicating many of the same themes (and setting, star, etc...) of his earlier Aguirre, Fitzcarraldo is probably the better of the two despite being a tad on the lengthy side. One can't come away unimpressed by the fact that CGI and model-work are notably absent from this picture - that is a steamboat, that is a South American mountain, and they are actually dragging the former up the latter.  A nice corollary to Fitzcarraldo is the documentary Burden of Dreams, which chronicles the problematic production of the film and Herzog's own genius/madness.  Interesting footnote: Forty percent of the film was originally shot with Jason Robards in the lead with Mick Jagger playing the part of Fitzcarraldo's mentally-challenged sidekick. Robards took ill and was advised by doctors not to return to work. The ensuing production delays caused Jagger to drop out as well due to scheduling conflicts with the recording (and subsequent touring) of the Stones' album Tattoo You. Herzog was forced to reshoot everything (with old standby Klaus Kinski as Fitzcarraldo) and cut Jagger's (presumable substantial) character entirely from the picture 
 The thesis of The Making of Europe is simply that Europe is not a geographical region but an idea. The power and eloquence of this statement is played out in over four hundred pages of tightly constructed and well written prose. Bartlett's writing makes for powerful and alluring reading, and I came away from reading much of the book educated and armed with an understanding of how we come to construct others as well as ourselves. Bartlett takes an intellectual historian's approach to how Europe came to be "made;" arguing that the continent was born out of the concepts of conqueror and conquered. This mentality had as much to do with the shaping of Europe as did the actualities of history. I first used the book as a reference for my undergraduate senior thesis and have since read most of it for its intellectual force and beauty of writing. Bartlett makes the usually dry subject of history moving and relevant to modern day people 
 Released shortly before America's entry into the war, Columbia's "You'll Never Get Rich" is one of Fred Astaire's better films during the relatively dry period that extended from his last RKO film with Ginger Rogers to his first films at MGM...   Since leaving RKO and Ginger Rogers, Astaire had danced with Eleanor Powell in "Broadway Melody of 1940" and with Paulette Goddard in "Second Chorus."   In "You'll Never Get Rich," he had a new partner in Rita Hayworth: a lushly beautiful redheaded actress who was being prepared for stardom in mostly low-budget films... She was a talented dancer who had worked with her family for many years in a vaudeville act called the Dancing Casinos...  "You'll Never Get Rich" cast Astaire as Robert Curtis, a Broadway dance director who is drafted into the army... He becomes involved in an on-again, off-again romance with Sheila Winthrop (Hayworth), a beautiful chorus girl whose fiancé is a captain in the army... The not-very-interesting plot is often interrupted for musical interludes... Astaire and Hayworth dance together twice--to the sensuous Latin beat of "So Near and Yet So Far," and in "The Wedding Cake Walk," a military finale which has a chorus of war brides and soldiers, plus the two stars, dancing atop a huge tank...   Astaire and Hayworth make an attractive dance team, although Hayworth seems a bit too formidable, too "grand" for Astaire's self-effacing style.... Astaire also has several numbers without Hayworth: most notably, a dance in a guardhouse to the song "Since I Kissed My Baby Goodbye," in which he combines several kinds of dazzling footwork...  "You'll Never Get Rich" is lightweight but amiable entertainment, and it kept Astaire dancing...   
 I've had one these puppies hanging on my keychain for about 1 year now and it's been a lifesaver at times. The light comes in handy when you're stuck in a dark spot and I can't tell you how many times I've been stuck without a pen and then suddenly remembered that I did have one, on my knife! The pen hasn't run out yet and always writes great. The scissors cut with the precision you'd expect from a Victorinox knife and the nailfile and knife are always useful whoever you may be. All in all, a great companion to any keychain 
 i bought it for my fiance, and she loves it!! the instructions say to use it for 20 minutes at a time, but i'll go back 30 minutes later, and there she is, feet still in, sleeping on the couch!! great product, no complaints at all 
 This one is a great album. Why it didn't catch on is a mystery to me. this is the definitive Hootie and the Blowfish album with some of their best songs. I thought Cracked Rear View was overrated. Fairweather was too hit and miss. This was a perfect album front to back.  Their latest, Looking For Lucky is a close CLOSE second. But this one is the one I will always cherrish 
 The premise of Dragonwick seems very much like that of Jane Eyre--a young woman goes tot he house of a very wealthy man to teac his child and ends up falling in love with him. However, this book adds a completely new dimension to this story outline. The main character is absolutely nothing like the demure, humble Jane, and everyone else is sinister in a way that Charlotte Bronte's characters never could have been.  The book begins in 1844 and ends in 1849, covering the land rent problems the landlords face, the Astor Place Massacre, and the far-away wars in Texas. The Mid-Atlantic is peopled solely with those of old Dutch ancestry, and cattle still live in downtown Manhattan, which is more farmland than city real estate in the mid-19th century.   Miranda Welles is the daughter of a poor farmer from Connecticuit. One day the family recieves a letter from a wealthy New York cousin of theirs, the Van Ryns. Nicholas Van Ryn, looking for a governess for his six-year-old daughter, asks the Welles family if they might be able to spare one of their daughters for the task. And so Miranda goes to New York, a place much finer than she had ever expected it to be. Van Ryn is of old Dutch stock that came to America two hundred years before, and are landlords and adherents to the old way of living, a way that is quickly disintegrating.   Upon arriving at the family estate, Dragonwyck, Miranda meets the Lady of the House, the corpulent Johanna. It is clear that Nicholas is no longer in love with his wife, and his attentions turn toward Miranda, who is his cousin by marriage. The book has an omniscient narrator, with intervals in which various minor characters interject their thoughts and feelings (the French Count's are the funniest and most astute). Vvery quickly, Miranda notices something discomfitting about the house, despite its beauty. All the members of the blood line of the Van Ryn family can hear the ghostly cries of one of their ancestors, and Miranda can feel that ancestor's presence in several areas of the house.  Upon Johanna Van Ryn's death, under suspicious circumstances, Nicholas immediately proposes to Miranda, though they must wait a year to allow for mourning. Nicholas comes back to her exactly as promised, and they marry. But there is something not quite right with their marriage; Nicholas has a tendency to turn away from distressing situations--or he faces them and does something foolish. It is clear that Nicholas's moments of tenderness towards his new wife become few and far between.   Added into the mix is a country doctor, Jefferson Turner. A local man who supports those who are trying to overthrow the manorial system, Jeff has an intense dislike, yet an admiration for Van Ryn. He also develops feelings towards Miranda, who increase as the book progresses.   Oone thing that I liked about the book was the number of contemporary authors who had cameos. We meet, briefly, Fenimore Cooper, Herman Melville, and Edgar Allan Poe. By the way, it is from the latter that Nicholas acquires a foul habit that will affect him significantly later on in the book. In sum, I thought this was a wonderful book, though not on the same level as Katherine and Green Ddrakness. Nevertheless, its not difficult to see why Seton's books are being reprinted; they're truly wonderful novels in the gothic style. 
 Norah is just Norah on this dvd and that is way better than 99.9% of the singers doing concerts and/or dvd's at the moment.  There is not a single lightning flash or even a smoke grenade.  It is just Norah and a terrific group of musicians doing what they do so well.  I found no problems with the sound (referred to by others) on my 6.1 system.  First-rate purchase imho.  
 This is one of the funniest movies ever made.  According to me at least.  But just look at the reviews from other users.  The only negative ones are labeled 'leftwing bull' or something like that.  The comedy is priceless.  Watch the movie, enjoy the movie, and realize moore didnt make this movie assuming the second george bush would be in Iraq over 10 years later 
 Nevermind the inebriated folks who can't get over the fact that Haliburton stock has climbed since 2003 because they're solely focused on one stock and blinded by their previously installed hate for anything Republican or conservative.  If they had an objective eye towards anything (let alone the stock price of Haliburton [ticker symbol: HAL]) they would never have written anything about Haliburton seeing growth in their company over the past three years.  The fact is that almost EVERY company has seen enormous growth over the past three years (thanks in large part to the economic stimulus of our current administration and management of the FOMC) and the stock market has been going STRAIGHT UP since 2003!  Haliburton was losing money hand over fist for the three years prior to 2003, but along with the rest of the economy and business ventures in Iraq and Afghanistan they made a turn around, but STILL are not doing any better than they were in the 1990's!    One guy said that he "would have loved to have invested some money into Haliburton in 2003", when all he had to do was invest some money into ANY company in 2003 and he would be sitting pretty!  The economic growth that our country has seen in the past several years can only be rivaled by the the growth we saw in the late 90's!  What about Google?  They had an IPO at $80 and now they're trading upwards of $400 per share!!!  Are they conspiring along with Haliburton?  C'mon!  Anyone who uses the stock price of Haliburton to debunk this book clearly doesn't have an understanding of modern economic movements and they clearly don't understand how ALL oil companies have seen growth year after year for the past decade!  This is a must read for anyone who wants a different point of view other than what nearly ALL of the media outlets are spewing these days.  You will at least have something to debate in your mind instead of listening to the mind numbing crud that comes from Anderson Cooper or Wolf Blitzer's pie hole 
 If you love the old movies and their stars, you'll love reading Mr. B's reminiscences.  He met and worked with so many of them!  His wonderful writing style is conversational, not scholarly, which is not to say that he doesn't know his subject.  Peter Bogdonovich loves and understands movies and moviemaking, and has a great appreciation for actors and actresses.  His book is a great read! 
 Clark's text is scholarly without alienating the non-scholar.  Using familiar authors and texts from the 19th and 20th Centuries, and a super-abundance of critical and popular responses to those texts, she illustrates the rise, fall, and reascension of children's literature as a respected pursuit. Her list of sources is unfathomable; my only occasional complaint was a feeling of, "all right, already, I was sold several quotes ago." 
 Fumio Demura's basic books on Kobudo (I have Nunchaku, Bo, Sai, Tonfa) are good. They include some historical data, basic stances and grips, as well as useful drills to train grips, blocks and thrusts. This book on basic Nunchaku, however, does not present a Kata with the weapon, as the Bo book does. Some more on Japanese nomenclature would have been great, also. Still, I recommend it for beginners 
 So of course my senior quote was, "It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye."  Because I knew that in order to create my ideal life, I would have to follow the best advice Saint-Exupery offers us in this book.  And I knew that he was sharing the secret of life with us.  Following your heart, following the path that you know is right for your soul, is the way to achieve inner peace.  Your heart always shows you the right way.  Especially when you are lost.  The journey of The Little Prince reminds us that change is inevitable and necessary for our lives to evolve into the lives we want to live.  The lamplighter reminded me that it's so important to fully experience every moment of life and appreciate everything we have.  Because it all can change in an instant.  The fox wants to show us why true love means never having to give up your freedom.  And then there's the rose...  Each character teaches us incredible lessons about love, friendship, strength, and altruism.  All of which are important when you're traveling along the path to self-actualization.   There is no such thing as being too old to read this book.  I recommend it to everyone who wants to be the best human being they can be 
 A brilliant action-oriented plan in 3 steps that give your business the  steady growth it needs to survive and succeed in today's fast business  world. Step 1: Identify the Issue. Step 2: Develop a Plan. Step 3: Manage  the Plan. Very well explained with examples for better understanding 
 My slight disappointment at the later books in the Mma Ramostwe series by no means extends to this, the first in a series featuring the Edinburgh philosopher-detective, Isabel Dalhousie. You don't especially read McCall Smith for the plot, but rather for the many delights along the way, and here the main delights are provided by Isabel's mind and morals. Although only fortyish, she seems to come from an older time, when civility mattered and issues of ethics were worth pondering. And Edinburgh -- or at least HER Edinburgh, which is very different from the gritty inner city of Ian Rankin's Inspector Rebus -- is a city that is simultaneously a bastion of fierce nationalism and cosmopolitan culture. Isabel's case here, the mysterious fall of a young banker from the upper gallery of the Usher Hall, involves her with several upwardly-mobile twenty-somethings, and her judgements on their lives are usually wise but occasionally very wrong. For all that Isabel is a thinker, a reader, and connoisseur, she also has a heart and feelings, and when these come into play, as in the beautiful ending to the book, the result can be very moving indeed 
 Its truly a wonderful book for the white man.However, the victims of the social circumstance, minorities, will find  this book truly useless.  One may find better enlightenment  in Deepak's words of faith. Yet, I give uncle Harvey two thumbs up for his efforts 
 This is a wonderful coffee table book that will truly widen your perspectives of the world. Great conversation piece. A neat gift idea for all 
 I purchased this bag a few weeks ago--very happy with the whole experience!  Picture represents the products exactly, shipped quickly, and very happy with the quality of the bag.  The fabric seems like it's waterproof and made of a jacket-like material, which is easy to brush off dirt.  I love it 
 All the previous reviewers hated this book, and while I can see some of their points, I think they approach the book expecting it to be a "how to" guide for the disorder.  It is definitely not.  The author intends it to be a discussion of how the diagnosis originated and how these presupositions still guide, knowingly and unknowingly, the diagnosis's conceptualization.  These are valid issues for acadamics (not nearly as dirty a word as what the first reviewer insinuates) as well as mental health clinicians.  The diagnosis is not as definitive or helpful as what people think, and framing it in a more feminist light helps remove some of the pejorative connotations within the field 
 Fantes characters are rarely heroic. They are flawed and often slightly ridiculous, but he writes in such a way that one cant help warming to them no matter what.  In fantes world man is confused and irrational, struggling with catholic guilt and trying to make sense of an absurd world. Life is a tragic comedy in which the last laugh is very definitely on you. Although at times hilarious, at its core there is a lot of sadness, but what comes across most strongly is a warmth and compassion for his characters despite and maybee even because of their faults. His style overflows with energy and passion.  There is a tremedous appetite for life. The book catches you up in its plot from page one and sweeps you along. This is an extremely enjoyable book, a strange and beautifully told story, profoundly moving and funny 
 I have been very pleased with Wordperfect X3. I have always thought that Microsoft Word was over-rated.  I would recommend Wordperfect X3 to anyone that is looking for an alternative to Word 
 I'd been looking for this item for two years and I found it on amazon.com for 35% less than the store prize, fast delivery and awesome quality... don't know why I didn't try it before. Thank you... 
 This is one of the best photography documentary I have ever seen. I love photojournalism and this is as good as it gets. I love the story narration that this DVD succeeds in. James Nachtwey is the greatest ever to have photographed all the atrocities up close and personal. You can feel the pain, agony and raw human emotion in his photographs. He is right in the middle of shooting with mostly a wide angle just a few feet away from danger. It needs guts and commitment to do a job which has constant fear of getting killed. I salute you.....James Nachtwey  You inspire me.  - Uday  
 Jeannette Walls memoir proves that courage and intelligence can overcome the effects of a severely dysfunctional upbringing 
 This oddity from director John Ford and John Wayne has no right to work.  The direction by Ford is kind of awkward, juggling heavy drama and heavy slapstick sometimes not so successfully.  You never really buy John Wayne as the navy pilot turned scriptwriter, Frank "Spig" Wead.  Rather, Wayne seems to be playing, well, Wayne.  Maureen O'Hara, who in previous endeavors with Ford and Wayne ignited sparks, is essentially wasted here in the thankless role of neglected wife.  That said, on some strange level this film works.  It's never boring.  I think the sincerity and reverence that Ford and Wayne bring to the project compensate for the film's many shortcomings.  This is definitely an example of a top-flight director's lesser efforts being better than an average director's successes.  If you're a fan of either Ford or Wayne this film is indispensible.  I don't think I would recommend this film to anyone not familiar with their work to use this as a reference point 
 How do you begin to describe the best legal thriller you've ever read?  This was a well-paced, highly entertaining story, but the book's real success is its longevity.  You continue to be captivated by it weeks after reading it.  Hands down, this is Connelly's best novel.  Few books leave you so completely fulfilled at the end.  Mick Haller is a defense attorney with a unique perspective on how the justice system works.  To him, it's a machine, and he's the "greasy angel" who keeps it well oiled.  Even though Haller's cynicism is a constant source of amusement, his real fear is that he will be unable to recognize real innocence.  Then an enticing case comes along with a franchise client, who can pay top dollar.  Accused of attempted murder for the battery of a woman, Louis Roulet hires his services.  What first seems to be a straight forward case, will ultimately test Haller to his limits: his family will be threatened, he will be accused of a crime, and someone very close to him will die.  Not only is this an insightful and fresh look at our legal system, the writing is first-rate.  
 This massage chair is great to have at home.  We have wanted one for years, and are thoroughly enjoying it 
 I got the book because there are some bedroom issues between Mars and Venus in my universe.  Talking about the issues doesn't seem to help... especially when I am doing all of the talking.  After perusing the book at the book store, I recognized several situations described in the book that are EXACTLY what we are experiencing.  It is encouraging to know that a) our issues are not unique, but common; b) this author has already seen and dealt with our exact issues in his work with other couples; and c) the solution could be simply communication and understanding each other better.  Why would I NOT buy this book?!    There's nothing earth shattering here.  Just reasonable insight and advice in a short, inexpensive book by a successful author of relationship books.  At best, our sex-life improves dramatically and forever.  At worst, the advice doesn't work for us.  Either way, I think I've learned a few things from this book.    Hey, it's all about understanding and communication.  If you don't want that in your relationship, don't buy the book.  Otherwise, check it out 
 This is a truly great movie that is wasted on American audiences that are accustomed to the shallow themes, a truly beautiful movie for those who are deep and sensitive.  I did not find it slow for it has great depth and almost hypnotic quality.  It held my attention throughout and this is very hard to do.  I got lost in the movie but of course those who like cheap thrills and are shallow could never appreciate it 
 This is a fabulous introduction to DSP, by far the best I have ever read. It explains concepts without throwing equations and math at the reader. The tips and tricks section is also great and I have already found some useful ones. While not providing the depth of a reference book I will always have it on my shelf for when I truly need to understand a topic 
 A book built from the combined insights of two of the most successful marketers in the world.  This is a tremendous resource for building the power brands of the future 
 I wanted to pass on my thanks for this great book, The Externally Focused Church.  I read it from start to finish on New Year's Day 2005.           I have to admit that my interests (as a layman) have seldom gotten into the community, aside from the belief that the church is about the Great Commission and little else.  Your book helped me get past some of my "blindness" about the need and purpose of the church reaching beyond itself in more than evangelistic ways; in fact, to reach into the community is to be evangelistic in the best form.         As you said (page 108), LifeBridge's goals (and others like them) is "to get people into the community, into the church, and into heaven"...thereby, "building the kingdom throughout the world."         I can say that your book is the best book I will have read in 2005 [and I have 364 days yet to go]. I plan to buy copies for my pastor, an associate pastor, and a ministry leader and urge them to read it and take it to heart.       Thanks for a very readable, thorough, challenging and sensible book, and the charge to every reader to look beyond ourselves.  No better way than to start 2005 with the challenge you bring to us.     
 I would recommend this CD as well as the original "Wild Cool & Swingin'".  You'll like them both 
 Don't pay attention to the review with the "yellow belly" comment.   This book, in contrast to so many other romances, shows that true courage is found in staying true to your convictions-whether to go to war, or to be a pacifist. In my opinion, it took more courage for Clay _not_ to go to war, because he believed it was wrong, than it would have taken to enlist.  anyway, this story is wonderful. i cried buckets. I'm only sad that it's out of print, and it's damn hard finding a copy 
 ...If you are well grounded in the faith, Steadfast and immovable (Col1:22-23) read this book to sharpen your discernment. In studying these men we get a better understanding of what we are up against presently. When you discover the full scope of Calvin's destructive doctrines, his five points, and how everything ultimately concludes with `unconditional' eternal security, you will see the handprints of Satan in every tenant. These men planted the seeds of modern day easy believeism, although unaware of their negative influence, the things they taught will ring throughout eternity in the ears of millions of lost souls who bought into their security in sin message 
 Garry Wills gave up an endowed chair in the history department at Northwestern University to become a full-time author and public intellectual.  A devout Catholic with a doctorate in the classics, he writes often and intelligently about religion in America.  "Lincoln at Gettysburg: The Words that Remade America" (1992), "Saint Augustine" (1999), and "'Negro President': Jefferson and the Slave Power" (2003) are among his nearly 30 books, many of which examine the political consequences of debates over religious ideas.  "Under God: Religion and American Politics" (1990) uses the 1988 presidential election -- which, after the demise of Gary Hart in a sex scandal, pitted right-wing preacher-businessman Pat Robertson and left-wing preacher-politician Jesse Jackson against tone-deaf secularist Michael Dukakis and an outwardly pious (and ultimately victorious) George H.W. Bush -- as a jumping off point to examine a wide range of issues in American intellectual and religious history, all of them more relevant now than in 1988.  Wills's thesis in "Under God" is that the United States has always been a Protestant (and not a "Judeo-Christian") nation; that secularist politicians like Dukakis and the journalists who follow them ignore that fact at their peril; that at times much blood has been wrongly shed, but at other times much good has been done, in the name of religion in America; that religious concerns -- guilt and shame, redemption, suffering, and good works -- are nothing if not serious business; that some media-savvy evangelical Christians have an influence vastly disproportionate to their learning; and that Jefferson and Madison's "wall of separation" between church and state, prefigured in the lip service John Winthrop paid to the Church of England (while actually encouraging the separate growth of New England Congregational churches) and in Roger Williams's removal of his brand of purist Protestantism from the meddling of politicians, has paradoxically been very, very good for religion.  There are footnotes, all right, at the end of "Under God," but the tone is anything but scholarly.  Wills can write, and his book reads more like an integrated collection of essays than a dissertation.  Among the topics he weaves together are a re-examination of the Scopes trial of evolution vs. creationism; the impact of black millennialism on the civil rights movement in America from Lincoln to Jesse Jackson; and a re-examination of eroticism in the context the anti-intellectualism and censoriousness of religion in 19th-century America.  He cites to and explains authoritative translations of the Bible, not for divine inspiration but for historically accurate sources.  Wills's portraits of politicians and the use they make of religious themes and vernacular are extraordinarily good.  Almost alone among public intellectuals, he has an eye for the art of the possible and the angst of religious experience.  This is a good read. -- Robert E. Olsen 
 Best pregnancy book ever !!!! If you are pregnant don;t miss this book ! excelent  
 This movie is one of my personal favorites and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices. he hit the time, the place and the kids perfectly. this movie appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never had a relationship that they all share, i find that real friendship is something worth looking for and after about 10 billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me... this movie really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best thing in the world. i can only hope that i can find friends as good as these kids someday. its a great movie and i'd recommend it to anyone. you might have to look past the constant crying and deep emotions since it might seem a little fake but thats what this movie is all about.... growing up and not many kids these days are willing to share how they feel with each other which isn't as bad as it sounds. plus great script/dialog and a great tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that aswell. Its also the only movie that made me realize that i wouldnt mind living in the 1950's over this era. 
 Graphic designers love to talk about sources of inspiration, but less willing to discuss the basics on locating work, pricing, and how to handle irate or non-paying clients - so it's essential that any graphic designer operating independently have this practical reference. It's one thing to be creative; it's another to manage its business needs. How To Be A Graphic Designer Without Losing Your Soul provides tested strategies for setting up, running and promoting a studio - and working with clients and their common problems. 
 While generally well written, this book may at first seem to be of interest to a very limited audience -- those directly associated (now or previously) with the Worldwide Church of God.  Some of the other reviews posted here tend to bear that out: they appear to be partisan hacks which do not specifically evaluate the merits of the book in question, but rather rant against various religious or doctrinal issues that I suppose only insiders would understand.  However, the book is in essence a candid, first-person narrative of a type of "Reformation" of a single, small church denomination from unorthodoxy to mainstream Christian beliefs, and from insular exclusivism ("God's only true Church") to a greater fellowship with Christian believers of all stripes.  The book's appeal may also be greater than only to those who have been directly involved with this particular denomination -- many religious groups have unwittingly gone down similar paths of personality worship, prophecy addiction, and "special" doctrines, observances or insights that supposedly make their groups "better than thou".  Other religious leaders supportive of the WCG's move to orthodoxy call the event "Unprecedented in church history", and "The top religious story of this decade".  While the first description may possibly be slightly over the top, there can be no denying that this type change -- to drastically alter a Church's established doctrinal platform and focus, particularly at the expense of losing half of its membership and most of its annual income -- is virtually unknown.  In his foreword to the book, Hank Hanegraaff, President of the Christian Research Institute, highlights this fact.  Christian readers not associated with this denomination can find this story illuminating, particularly if they (or someone they know) has felt they were in the bonds of a "religion", but were instead seeking a personal relationship with God.  While the story of the WCG's collective journey from religion to relationship is here documented in Transformed by Truth, the individual's personal journey on that path cannot be missed 
 We had a Drinkwell fountain for more than two years and after the recent birth of our first child and a cross-country move, found that we had become overly lax about giving it a thorough cleaning.  The primary reason for this is that cleaning is very difficult -- it's almost impossible to get in every little nook and cranny.  Plus the plastic the Drinkwell is made out of seemed to get grungy very easily and almost absorb minerals thanks to the hard water in our new home.    I was a little apprehensive about the Catit fountain after reading a few of the reviews, but thought we would give it a try.  The first thing we noticed while assembling that we really liked is that water is filtered *before* it returns to the pump (on the Drinkwell, it's filtered after going through the pump, which leads to a gunkier pump).  It's also very quiet, so you don't get that "running water" sound that (with Drinkwell) occasionally led us to search for an open tap before we realized it was the fountain.  Some people have mentioned having difficulty seating the reservoir so water flows over the dome properly.  We did experience this after cleaning the fountain, but quickly discovered that we just needed to move the pump a bit to one side to allow for a secure fit.  With the large reservoir, we also enjoy being able to go approximately a week between refills with two thirsty cats, instead of refilling daily (we did not purchase the Drinkwell's optional reservoir).  It is also very easy to see if the water level is getting low.  One note: I haven't observed either cat actually licking water from the dome and I was sure our little female would love this since she will drink from the faucet.    Overall, I like this fountain better.  It looks kind of cool, it takes up a smaller footprint, is quieter, easier to fill and easier to clean than our old fountain.  We did not purchase the mat, and have had zero problems with spilling or splashing.  We did give the Drinkwell fountain to my sister-in-law since it was still in working order and her kitty is enjoying it thus far 
 Kazan may well have been one of Hollywood's most hated men --- in 1952, he "named names" of peers and pals that were Communists during McCarthy's maniacal manhunt, something for which almost no one forgave him; so strong was Hollywood's hatred that when Kazan was chosen, in 1999, to receive an Honorary Oscar, he was publicly condemned as a traitor. But there's no arguing that Kazan was also a damn good director. (Think On the Waterfront, Gentleman's Agreement, A Face in the Crowd.)  Noted film scholar Richard Schickel has penned a frank, unflinching biography, as smart as it is shrewd. Schickel's decision to put Kazan's decried decision into the context of its time and the director's life illuminates the personalities and  preoccupations of the man who reshaped the way we look at theater and film 
 This is a terrific movie with a terrific director's commentary on DVD.  Excellent cast, including John Houseman's first acting gig.    I'm not sure how much of the movie works without the commentary - the film takes place in the "near future" a few years after it was made in 1963 - Frankenheimer's commentary makes it clear what props (like the videoconferencing) would have seemed futuristic at the time.  The film is fascinating on many levels.  For example, I can imagine why Richard Nixon would think that recording all Oval Office conversations would be a good idea, if he had seen this film (which I imagine he had).  Many similarities in direction and photography to The (original) Manchurian Candidate, which is also an excellent DVD 
 Pair this book with The American Horticultural Society A-Z Encyclopedia of Garden Plants and you will have the most comprehensive gardening guides you will ever need!  The reviews suggested buying the books together and I'm glad I took the advice.   The books are HUGE!  I wasn't prepared for the sheer weight of them but they are beautiful as well as informative 
 It's true he really is the Japanese Grahm Greene, what a book.  Be ready to ask yourself how you would be Christian and be forced to watch other's suffer.  It's a deep look at good, evil and religion 
 I love this Elvis movie!  I have the VHS tape and would love to buy the DVD.  Hey, any chance of "Girl Happy" available on DVD in the future?   PLEASE!!! 
 Let me start by saying that the only Stephen King books I have read are the first four Dark Tower books, so am not biased for or against his work. I just took this book for what it was, a great story. It brings the first three books together. This book was so good, in fact, that I now want to read more about Cuthbert, Alain, and Roland's young Gunslingers' adventures than the actual "everyone's dead" tower quest. Anyone who says this book was too long or that it was an unnecessary addition to the series doesn't appreciate exceptional character development and a slow suspenseful buildup to an epic confrontation between good and evil. 
 After falling into a creative rut with Divine Intervention, Slayer desperately needed to put out new material to prove their relevancy. The band succeeded in their effort, releasing Diabolus in Musica, one of Slayer's finest works yet. Despite the unfortunate number of negative reviews, this album has it all for any true fan with an open mind: superb production (you can hear the bass-thank you Rick Rubin!!!), good lyrics (mostly dealing with war and other forms of violence, suffering) and a fresh approach to the guitar work courtesy of Hanneman and King. Do not be deceived: this is in NO way a "mainstream" or "sell out" effort. On the contray, it is one of their heaviest to date. Even one of the most common complaints about this album, the lack of speed, does not hold up; for while the album is certainly not as fast as Reign in Blood or Divine Intervention, it is ultimately no slower than South of Heaven or Seasons in The Abyss. For example, check out "Bitter Peace," a much stronger opening track than "Killing Fields" and IMHO an equal to "War Ensemble." Other outstanding tracks include "Death's Head," "Perversions of Pain," "Scrum" and "Point." Yet there really is no "filler" on this album. Each member shines: Hanneman and King continue their wild, off the wall riffs and solos, while at the same time exploring new tones and effects; Paul Bostaph proves once again that he is (or was) more than an andequate replacement for Lombardo, while Tom Araya is ultimately the showcase here, showing off (for once!) his bass chops and pushing the limits of his vocal stylings. At the end of the day, the genius of Diabolus is the (very limited) incorporation of contemporary heavy metal genres with an otherwise solid thrash foundation. One final note: Best album cover to date! Far better than the lame covers on Divine Intervention and God Hates Us All, while avoiding the cool, but overdone demonic artwork of earlier LPs.   
 I love these shoes they are durable comfy and cool they dont rip easily and i love them they r sweeeeeeeet 
 Probably the best book of the year. Diamond writes a great account of the Iraq disaster from an insider's view. Chapter 10, "What Went Wrong," is a devastating indictment of the many mistakes by this incompetent administration, e.g. the disbanding of the Baath party and the army, the insufficient troops and armor. The reader is left to wonder what might have been had the invasion/occupation been run more competently. Perhaps we would be victorious today. Disturbing, but fascinating. 
 First time I saw and heard Sylvain Luc in the Mezzo Channel I was amazed with his mix between extreme technique and great musicality. This guy is one of a kind! I never knew Biréli before this album...also a great musician! I recomend this album to anyone who enjoys  being enchanted by the beautiful melodies of two guitars singing 
 Being a lifelong UCLA fan, USC is my second favorite team.  Accordingly, I read this book with great zeal.  It is a must read for both Bruin and Trojan fans.  It's great to relive those years and games from the mind and eyes of McKay.    Unfortunately, a few things keep this book from getting a five-star rating, in my opinion--though USC grads may think differently.    First, McKay shows complete disdain for UCLA.  That was his perogative.  But it tended to hurt his credibility somewhat, especially when describing the SC-UCLA games.  For example, he said about the 1969 game that SC's final drive was merely aided by an interference call.  That, of course, was an understatement.  Even the SC receiver, when interviewed, expressed dismay--as did everybody else--at the UCLA defensive back who tackled him on fourth down as the ball was sailing six feet over his head.  That was just one example, and I won't bore you with the rest.  Another problem, however, was McKay's consistent denial of any responsibility for losing a game or making a mistake.  According to him, he never made a mistake in his whole coaching life.  The games SC won were always due to his brilliance or innovation, and the games he lost were always the fault of someone else--usually his own players.  He clearly saw himself as the perfect coach.  For example, when SC oddly went for one point in the 1969 game after Dickerson caught the TD pass, McKay claimed that the frenzy was so great that his players didn't hear him yelling to them to go for two points.  But SC was clearly going for the TD on the drive.  Any coach would naturally tell his team, or at least his kicker, beforehand to go for two should they score.  And McKay blames the Beban TD passes in the 1965 game entirely on his players not listening to him.  I just have a hard time believing it--especially when the bruins had to recover an onside kick and Beban had to make two TD passes for the bruins to win that game.  How is it that, at the end of the season after being so brilliantly coached, you still have defensive players who don't listen to you in the big game with a minute left to play--twice in a row?  McKay also tells about how he would discipline a player--a quarterback, for instance, who he felt wasn't giving a hundred percent.  He would secretly tell the offensive line not to block on the next pass play so that the quarterback would get unexpectedly creamed.  I found that negligent and immature, even for the Lombardi decade.    McKay also lamented at length about how USC should have been allowed to leave the pac eight (pac-ten), and go independent.  It struck me as an arrogant slam to the rest of the conference, and based solely on McKay's unfulfilled dream of coaching at Notre Dame.  But otherwise, as I said, "Coaches Story" is a great book and a must read for both SC and UCLA fans.  Erik Smith (Columbus, OH 
 I haven't played video games for a very long time.  I have a PS2 that I used primarily for playing dvds.  I was so excited to get the Wii because I wanted something my whole family could play including my 3 1/2 year old daughter.    The mini games got us all hooked.  I had my daughter help when I couldn't do it my first time.  She would help me shake the nunchuk to help close the door on the bunnies using the bathroom.  She would dance along with the music in the rhythm test and when "we" passed a test, she would say "You win!"  I even got my husband to participate when my arms were too tired to shake and control the wii remote and nunchuks.  The game is lots of fun and something that the whole family can enjoy 
 I love reading about history, and always think I know my fair share.  I obviously knew nothing about the Dust Bowl until I read "The Worst Hard Time."  It is truly remarkable what these people needed to endure, and I don't think the history of this event is told enough.  Coming from a generation of mass-consumption this is a must read to see how a generation completely over-used their own natural resources and ended up destroying their homeland.  The one negative about this book is that Egan jumps around a little too much for me.  Once the reader starts to get attached to one of the characters, Egan jumps to another character.  Still this is a must read 
  Flush by Carl Hiaasen does not disappoint! Who knew that a story about raw sewage would rate five stars! Hiaasen's Flush does just that! Noah and his sister Abby acquire some strange cohorts along the way as they try to keep their family from going down the drain! Sorry, but I just couldn't resist that pun! Their father's action in sinking a floating casino leads them on a quest to not only help their father but to save the environment. Along the way you will see how setbacks will sometimes end up as a success while their successes often end up having unwanted consequences! This was a Christmas present for our oldest granddaughter.  She loved it! Carl Hiaasen is a terrific author. His writing has made us laugh out loud numerous times. While this was written as a children's book, it was just as enjoyable for me to read as those geared to adults 
 An incredibly intelligent book. Jack Shadoian knows his field with astonishing depth and bredth. Using his characteristically witty and well-turned style, Shadoian illuminates the historical and social milieu  from which these famous films sprouted. I recommend Dreams and Dead Ends as  de rigeur for any film scholar 
 Bones is one of my favorite TV series. This one episode I missed so I had to get it to keep on track. Great show even if you have never seen it from the begining 
 Very insightful and thought provoking.  Made me question many of my views and my perspective of other Christians 
 I've fully read 6 of McKillip's other books and this is definitely the best one yet. It was very difficult to put down, but I made myself do it, because I didn't want the story to end. The dreamlike quality of it was appropriately intoxicating, similar to Winter Rose 
 I think that Edgar Allan Poe is a really great Author.  He completely mastered the style that he wanted to achieve.  His style is somewhat of a creepy, cold feeling one.  A coldness that grasps you while you read it.  While you read his stories, you really can feel the creepy sense in each one. It's a great style of writing, that doesn't always appeal to everyone, but it's still a great style to accomplish, and he did it very, very well.  I enjoyed reading most of his works, because they have a vocabulary on them like you wouldn't believe.  I had to look up a few words that he used, but it was still nice to read.  Anyways, have fun reading his books, and let them live on.  :- 
 This book consists of about half text and half glossy pictures of corvids (ravens, crows, magpies, and jays).  The pictures are beautiful, and range from "posed" shots of individual birds to some action shots of corvids interacting with other animals.  Savage is from Saskatchewan, so the pictures show these birds in all four seasons.  Some additional pictures come from Europe or Siberia.  The text holds the book together but is not the focus of the book.   Her central argument is that corvids are really smart, and she provides some anecdotes to that effect.  The evidence is one-sided, but it's nonetheless true that corvids are smart.  That said, the text is really beside the point in this beautiful book.  If you want to know more about how smart these birds are, read Bernd Heinrich.  In short, it's a coffee-table book in soft cover.   The pictures really are beautiful, and the text is beside the point.  It seems unfair to criticize it, as some other reviewers do, for being superficial 
 I LOVE Dr. Suess.  Really.  We have lots of his books and I enjoy reading all of them to my kids with the exception of this one.  It annoys me to no end.  That's just it...it seems like there is no end.  It's not rhymie or sing-songy like his others.  It's just repetitive and boring and ..... oh just YUCK 
 This book is a Collaborative Project of Harvard Medical Students and Faculty.It combines the needs of medical students as well as those of practicing physicians.Text,tables,and illustrations are concise and updated. It was enjoyable and refreshing for me to review this text and it must be recommended both to medical students and practicing physicians.   (Dr.Werner,specialist for internal medicine 
 "That's an obelisk!" "We have to find those dragon kites!" "The big red balloon can't fly high enough to get over Coit Tower!" The four "Little Einsteins" kids travel to Egypt, China and San Francisco on this DVD, which groups together two episodes of the popular Disney Channel preschooler series with a third episode never shown on television. As always, the episodes include serious works of art and classical music.  In "The Legend of the Golden Pyramid," the kids -- Annie, June, Leo and Quincy -- take off to Egypt, where they travel through the desert, down the Nile and to the Sphinx. They eventually find a pyramid that contains a golden harp, where they have a dance party with the ancient hieroglyphics inside. The featured music is "Hungarian Dance No. 5" by Johannes Brahms.   "The Dragon Kite" sends the curious crew to China, where they help track down friends of a Little Dragon Kite and then join the big Dragon Kite Parade. This show introduces little paste-eaters to paintings by Zhou Shen, Cai Jia, Zhang Lu and Chou Ying as well as the music of Edvard Grieg ("Peer Gynt, Suite No. 1: In the Hall of the Mountain King").  The new episode, "Annie and the Little Toy Plane" is set in San Francisco. As the gang, and the plane, tries to rescue a helicopter, viewers learn about Coit Tower and the Golden Gate Bridge. It's got Keith Haring's "Untitled, 1988" and Mozart's "Symphony No. 40."   There's also a bonus feature, "Where's Froggy's Family?" This one is snooze city for parents, but kids may like it. Using his or her television remote like a video-game controller, a viewer joins Leo for a globe-trotting (yet snail-paced) interactive journey that helps a frog return to his home.   If you're new to the "Little Einsteins" series, think of it as the best intentions of National Geographic, Sesame Street and the National Endowment for the Arts combined with an animation budget of, oh, maybe a dollar.  Still, what's not to like? The four kids are cute (their heads are as big as their bodies), all the messages are positive, the art and music are handled just right for a preschool mind, the shows never talk down to kids and -- beware, reviewer is about to climb up on her soapbox -- these younger years may be the only chance you get to develop your child's interest in geography! My daughter went to public school for seven years and never had one geography lesson! Not one! What the H-double-hockey-sticks are we doing with public education?!!  OK, I feel better now.   (Given that I am a Disney guidebook writer, I should mention that the "Little Einstein" characters appear at Disney-MGM Studios, one of the theme parks. Larger-than-life versions of the four kids pose for pictures and sign autographs on Mickey Avenue, and June and Leo come to your table during breakfast and lunch at the Hollywood & Vine restaurant. 
 Like I said, simply outrageous in all the best ways.  The thick accents did make it difficult to follow the dialogue at times, and I am pretty good at understanding accents.  Mark's withdrawal scenes in his bedroom were incredible.  Not just a heroin-is-bad story, but a true slice of life flick 
 Despite the fact that I am absolutly facinated with Shamanism (more so Ethnobotany than the new age stuff) I found this work to be more of a textbook in the school sense and at times really dragged on. I do recommend  this work for the content. Getting through the content can be a little  arduous thoug 
 This comedian is amazing... One of the funnest I have ever see. He is definately one of the best, If you havent bought this yet than you definately need to go get it. Big 5 out of 5 for Jummy Gaffigan 
 I loved Jamiroquai for a long time .. actually way back in the mid 1990's, and now I am caught up in their magic again. This cd is wonderful! their music is full of everything you would want in a cd.. sure to please in every way and I dare you not to get up off your chair and dance around your room, it's hard not too. Jason Kay has a wonderful funky voice and you inctantly feel the energy right through your stereo speakers.. YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS!!  I am a serious music buff and I would put Jamiroquai in my top 10 off all music groups out there. ENJOY ENJOY ENJOY!!!!! 
 Also for Baywatch-fans this CD from Charlie Sexton is a worth recommendation to their collection. The CD contains the song "Don't look back" that was used for the Baywatch-episode "Second Wave" (1989 / season 1). While hearing this "agressive" song, you'll remember Eddie Kramer having bad dreams of his schoolenemy Jimmy from his past.  If you are interested in songs that featured on Baywatch, you can buy here on Amazon.com the Book: "Baywatch - Rescued from Prime Time". This book contains all credits from songs/artists (like Charlie Sexton), that you can buy here on Amazon.com  The soundquality of this CD is excellent 
 This large sized book covered the subject exceedingly well in lots of color photos with explanations and, more importantly, in lots of diagrams and nuts and bolts descriptions.  I only read sections here and there but what I did read clearly indicated to me that you could actually use this book to build a natural swimming pool.  At the least, you could definitely make a  solid decision whether or not you could build or would want to build such a pool on your property.  These pools are basically like salt water aquariums in that you have to make a biosphere and monitor it.  In some ways it's not as easy as it sounds but also not as hard as it sounds. However, start up takes time and it can be tricky to finally reach environmental stabilization. I am not going to build a natural pool but I still found this book very useful. At the end this book are MANY pages of water plants and trees recommended for certain types of water areas.  There are zone maps of the US included for reference.  So even if you just want to make a little ornamental fountain in a big pot on the patio deck or a pond or a bog out back, this book has a VERY comprehensive set of plant lists you will find exceedingly useful. 18 pages of them.  Categories include Submerged Plants, Floating Plants, Floating Leaved Plants, Shallow Marginal Plants, Deep Marginal Plants, Moisture-loving Plants, Bog/Marsh Plants, Waterside Plats-Trees & Shrubs, Ferns, Grasses Sedges Reeds and Rushes.  Botanical and Common Names are listed along with height, spread, water depth, flower color, flower period, foliage, position, comments and plant zone. It's the best I've seen in any book so far 
 This season is one of the best but that doesn't mean that it's perfect.  For instance 'Scenes Of The Class Struggle In Springfield' is pretty boring.  However that's not to say this season doesn't have great episodes.

 Having been Lubavitch, I read Levine's book as both former insider and outsider. Her portrayal of the Lubavitch world captured its essence, and her description of the variety of personalities within it was also apt. Unlike an earlier reviewer, I considered the deliberate care taken to obscure the identities of the girls to be important and in keeping with academic ethics.   The Lubavitch world holds within it a certain comfort and certainty, simply because all the answers are there. Unfortunately, as we read in the cases of several of the girls portrayed in this book, there is little to no place for the girl or woman who thinks critically, questions the tenets of Chabad-Lubavitch, or who is called to higher education. For example, I wonder if one of the women portrayed ever completed her medical training.  An excellent study that offers the reader insightful glimpses into the world of Lubavitch girls 
 After eagerly awaiting the next book in this series, I was anxious to find out if Ben really was Isaac, if Lou would come back to Sam, if Esther and Zeke could find peace.... There was soo-o-o much to cover that I was shocked to see that this was the last book in the series. How would they cover it all?  Well, apparently, very quickly! Things happened too fast, people changed too quickly, things were resolved tidily and with great speed.  Though we don't really know if Lou will come back to stay, or how Esther and Zeke will fare with the shunning, we do know that Annie and Ben/Isaac will live happily ever after.    It was an enjoyable book, but I was disappointed with the unknowns 
 This was a very good book.  My parents think I don't learn enough in a public school even though I am in a Gifted and Talented class. So during the summer I am given assigned readings to finish every day.  This way I am either caught up or ahead of my class by the begining of the year.  These books have Literature, Geography, World Civilization, and more.  They are written at different levels for different grades and are very interesting.  I recommend these books for concerned parents and interested kids, like me 
 In his writing, Peter Guralnick has placed his own work in the mythology of American (roots) music. The portraits that make up this book are all written more than 10 years after the heyday of the people he is writing about. It's about people who are no longer the stars they were, though their legacy remains.  It's not a history book about roots music, for that you need to read others. It does give great portraits of the people involved, showing their feebles but still maintaining their mythological role in music 
 This is a quick and interesting read that uses a short story format to get the message, Extreme leadership - LEAP (Love, Energy, Audacity and Proof), across. In this format LEAP can be demonstrated rather than just discussed. Steve makes his case convincingly though I don't see myself following the path he lays out. This book is well worth reading and contemplating its message 
 Democrats struggling to develop a foreign policy vision in the post-9/11 world would do well to study Harry Truman's tough response to Soviet aggression following the Second World War. This book, based on years of primary research, is an excellent introduction to the subject 
 Its very rare when a sequel holds the same magical charm as its first but this sequel has done just that. If you loved the first movie, you'll be equally pleased with this one. The original cast along with holding true to the book series makes this a must see 
 A friend of mine gave me this cd about a year ago, I listened to a few minutes of it and was like "What is this crap?" and I shelved it for a couple months. I then picked it back up and gave it another listen. To my surprise it was really catchy to me. The music (and lyrics) are simple, but thats what I like about them. Theyre simple! This is a great college-rock cd. I plan on checking out more Teenage Fanclub, and I suggest you do the same. Notable tracks are Sidewinder, What You Do To Me, and Is This Music? 
 This is not a movie that you can have on in the background while knitting or gutting a fish or something.  But those who focus on it will be rewarded with one of the most under-rated films of all time.  There isn't a lot of action or sex or any of the things that appeal to most of the movie-going crowd, but it has some of the best acting (serious and comic) & writing & imagery of any film you're likely to come across 
 People complain about how commercial the songs on Vegas are.  There is a reason for that: the songs are good.  Call me shallow but the only reason why I listen to techno is to give my speakers a run for the money.  This is hands down one of the best dance/techno albums of all time.  It has very catchy grooves, has withstood the test of time (a real challenge in the electronic music genre) and stays upbeat for the most part thought out the entire album.    I am not saying this is a bad thing but when an electronica group tires to put more depth and creativity into their music, it just isn't very fun to dance too.  I enjoy music that wants to make you move and keep the blood flowing.  Crystal Method is special because they really hit the nail on the head here.  They know how to make big beat music.    I listened to others that make pure dance music like TCM but is cheesy because of senseless lyrics and cheap synths groove loops (2 Unlimited).  If you were to own one techno album, this should be one. 
 any leftish baffon who writes comments like yours proves that i need to read the book. i look forward to a terrific read. 
 years since I saw this film, but remember liking it, until I figured out how to find it. I knew 'Dana Carvey' was in it from knowing that the actor was with Mike Meyers in Wayne's  World. I am now waiting to receive it in the post to watch it once more 
 This is my favorite jazz CD (and I own a stack). The musicians are legends--Gerry Mulligan on sax; Bill Mays and Barry Manilow, piano; Mundell Lowe, guitar; George Duvivier, bass; Shelly Manne, drums. And if they don't impress, add appearances by Sarah Vaughan and Mel Torme. When someone says Manilow and you think "Mandy" or "Copacabana," you're in for a surprise. This album (Barry wrote and arranged the songs) he calls "smoky jazz with torchy lyrics." I love all the songs, but my favorite has to be the haunting "When October Goes" with lyrics by Johnny Mercer. Enough said--trust me here:  buy this CD, turn down the lights, and enjoy a five-star night of jazz 
 I have studied English for 5 years and am addicted to the written word. This is one of the best books I have EVER read. There is nothing i can say which will do it justice. It is amazing. It is a must have for every library 
 THE VERSIONS OF RUMI WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL BOOK. THE POEMS WERE NOT ONLY BEAUTIFUL, BUT REALLY TOUCHED YOU WERE IT COUNTS....THE HEART. THE POETS WERE REALLY COMPASSIONATE; AND SINCE THE POEMS WERE ACTUALLY WRITTEN  THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO, THEY WERE REFINED AND REVISED VERY WELL. I REALLY  RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANY READER, AND EVEN THOSE WHO JUST WANT TO LISTEN 
 Seven of Britain's top hunks are featured in a torrid male menage-a-trois involving the interactions of friends and lovers Mike, Damon and Hugh. Filled with scorching sensuality, this tale will dazzle Anglophiles and hot-to-trot actor watchers. 80 min 
 Federico Fellini's 1972 film is not his best, when he has 8 1/2, La Strada and La Dolce Vita to his credit. While many critics adore this film for its absurdity and plotless, dreamy structure, I found it boring and phantasmagorical. It is simply Fellini's version of Rome and not Rome, the Eternal City itself. To risk sounding negative, I shall admit that there are some moments in which it is most expressive of early 1970's Rome - the scenes in which the hippies and American tourists invade the city, the long scene in the outdoor restaurant where everyone is talking their heads off (though saying some pretty vulgar things) and my favorite scene- the underground archaelogical excavation in which the frescoes of old Roman Patricians fade into oblivion. But mostly this film is weak in that it bored me because there was no plot. It starts off alright, and the movie works well when there is no sudden fantasy sequences. Fellini is himself in this movie, as well as Gore Vidal. Fellini envisions himself as a young man studying Rome in his youth in a strict Catholic school (the slide/projector shows ancient monuments like the Colliseum, the Apian Way, Trevi Fountain and Vatican as well as an offensive pornographic image of a woman's behind) and later as a young man journeys to Rome itself and takes residence with a large family in a crowded apartment in a slum. Then the young man sees a talent show that is tasteless, vulgar and long-winded. I found myself just as unimpressed as outraged as the audicences that went as far as to throw a dead cat on stage! It bothered me that there is much attention to prostitution, brothels or cheap, slutty women. The cover on the film is the promiscuous woman at the start of the film. And for a film about Rome and Italy, there is hardly any allusion to opera or any true classical theater. The Pope fashion show was ludicrous and blasphemous. Only serious, hardcore fans of Fellini will want to own this DVD. It is a perfect follow-up to his equally absurd and sexually radical Satyricon, loosely based on the old Roman epic. 
 "Mozart's Brain and the Fighter Pilot" is about how to increase your brain's productivity from being able to focus better, remember things longer, and how to keep your brain healthy and strong.    I found the first 5 chapters to be absolutely useless as author Richard Restak goes through different parts of the brain and how they interact.  This information was interesting, but not useful for the rest of the book.  If anything, he could have just summarized this into a single page.  The rest of the book gets more useful however.  Restak suggests certain activities, such as puzzles, reading, and music, increase the brain's capacity for learning.  Restak also suggested different memory increasing activities such as looking at a shape and trying to recreate it from memory or memorizing a list of words.  Probably most interesting was how Restak gets us to think in terms of brain geography.  Certain activities, such as reading and writing utilize only certain parts of the brain.  Therefore Restak suggests we switch to different tasks, such as something that involves music or patterns to work different areas of the brain and give the original areas a break.  I also liked the idea of a "reading journal".  I read a lot of books but I really wish I could retain more knowledge.  The concept of a reading journal involves writing down the date you finished the book, and then writing down everything you remember from the book.  Then you can look over your notes with previous notes from other books and see connections and linkages.  Restak also gives a useful index of the games, books and activities he likes to use/read.  I really liked the idea of the software program "Inspiration" for creating mind maps.  I had been looking for something like that... and while it is older and could use some work, it is an interesting tool.  My only beef is that the exercises take a lot of time and work.  While the exercises are definitely useful, it can be hard to fit all of these suggestions into a normal life.  Regardless, this is a good book to read if you are looking to "sharpen the saw" and increase your brain's potential.  4 out of 5 stars 
 Not since Breakin' 2, Electric Boogaloo, has a vehicle of popular culture captured the true essence of the graffiti artist.  Some may argue that Turk 182 holds high honors in this catagory, but true enthusiasts know Bob Clark to be a hack.  Before this book you would have had to quit your job, bought a year's worth of Boone's Farm wine, and hung a sack from a stick to see this level of train graffiti.  Jack Kerouac would be proud 
 Marvel released so many new comics in the early 1960s that several of their super heroes were launched without the character having been fully worked out.  The Incredible Hulk is clearly one of these.  Within the space of the six issues reprinted here, they changed his color, his powers -- he figures out how to fly by taking reaaallly long jumps -- his personality, and how he can be controlled.  You would think they would have thought through these things before they started publishing.  It might not be surprising that sales were apparently not high enough to sustain the book and it was killed after just six issues.  In addition, they kicked the Hulk out of the Avengers.  In that sense the Hulk was the one true flop among the early Marvel books.  Still, I find these stories very appealing.  The idea of the Hulk was a great one and early Lee and Kirby (and Ditko in issue 6!) is always worth reading.  So, I would recommend this volume to anyone interested in the early Marvel Silver Age.  It ain't Spiderman or Fantastic Four, but it ain't bad 
 this three disc live show is one of the better moe. recordings. dither left me slightly disappointed. i thought (L) would be moe. at their best, but warts and all vol. 2 blows (L) out of the water. jammed out songs like kids and mexico make this disc worth buying. words cant accurately describe the musical chemistry between the members of moe.; one must listen and absorb the music with a clear and open mind. probably the most talented guitarists in the jam band scene today, al schnier and chuck garvey absolutly shred on every disc in this set. the soloing and jamming between the musicians are unbelievable and very intense at times. one almost doesn't realize that there are, in fact, humans playing the instruments being heard. another highlight is vinnie amicos fantastic drumming, some of the best grooves ever laid down on a live CD. all in all a bang up job done by moe., and hopefully a volume 3 from the warts and all series will hit stores soon. lets hope volume 3 is as good as this. peace 
 I have been working with the Bach flower and other homeopathic remedies for as long as I am able to remember. Like other reviewers have said, I have had to try to modify treatments from the books for humans to animals. Most of the time it was ok, but not always. This book has been wonderful.   I personally do not agree with the forward written by the doctors saying that animals do not have feeling, but instead act and react according to instinct and animalistic behavors. I have been working with animal communicators for years to know this is not true. They do to have feeling just as you and I do. Anyway, outside of the intro, the book is wonderful and I have bought it for my vet who works with herbs and Rescue remedy and some friends as well. So all in all. . .I highly recommend the book 
 I am a recent MBA just starting my career-- I received this book from my father as a gift last week and read the whole thing in a weekend.  It is a great historical look at how business began and how it has evolved through time.  I had no idea that money led to such notions of guilt as it did in medievel/feudal times.  I highly recommend it for anyone interested in history and business 
 This is a love poem from parent to child.  The poem lets the child know that the parent will always love them.  No matter how old the child gets he will still be a child that is loved by his parents.  There is a page where the parent is now a old lay and the son brings his children to visit.  The illustrations show the grandchild gets the grandma's cane for her.  This was my favorite part because my kids to this for MY grandmother each time we visit!         This captured what is in the heart of parents every where.  Children grow up fast and we need to let them know how much they mean to us.    Yes It would make a great bed time story. 
 Earlier this year, I read a find book entitled: The Tour de France, a cultural history. It's a fine book, and it shows the links between French culture and perceptions of the Tour. This is light years beyond it.  This book is a cultural history as well, and shows the links between Ian Fleming's Bond character and post WWII British history, but does it in remarkably entertaining way.  It parallels the Bond stories and the last gasps of the British empire, and ties the miserable state of Britain's economy in the 1970's to the Roger Moore film versions of Fleming's books. This book is one of those rare triple threats:  Funny (hilarious at times), perceptive, and thought-provoking.  If you're looking for the Compleat James Bond, look elsewhere. But for a bracing, enlightening view of a cultural icon, get this book. Mr. Winder brings a wide breadth of knowledge and arcana to bear on the subject 
 It's not only that it's challenging, but also effective and efficient. All the workouts are incredible and right to the point. I really enjoy it as it's easy to follow and focusing on abdominal. To firmer, strengthen, and flatten your abs. Highly recommended 
 I never tire of watching this movie but it's not because I can relate to the characters. There's something sick and twisted about all of them, as well as the odd fascination for a film that was marketed as Little Red Riding Hood for the 90's.   Our newly crowned Queen of the Oscars, Reese Witherspoon, leans heavily on her Nashville roots to perfect Vanessa Lutz, a 15 year old gun toting, ass whipping tornado of bravado and charm hell bent on retribution because..."I'm pissed off and the world owes me." You see, Vanessa was raised the illiterate daughter of a street corner hooker with a methadone habit and ex-con step-father who likes hitting the crack pipe before hitting on Vanessa. Our heroine decides to punch out in the family wagon after mom and dad are hauled off to jail, to go visit her estranged Grandma. Things soon get interesting when her car breaks down, and she is offered assistance by the ultra-slimey Keifer Sutherland as the "I-5 Killer" Bob Wolverton.  Enter gunshots, cops, juvie detention, catfights, jailbreaks, and side splitting courtroom hilarity. Reese deserved some recognition for this role, she's awesome, and she actually won a few obscure Best Actress awards in Europe. I'm sure there's some deep message about today's dysfunctional society and it's overlords, but damned if I care. Check your brain at the door and relax, Vanessa will handle the situation.  The DVD is actually not bad with an above average transfer and very good 5.1 audio. Also an interesting commentary by writer/director Matthew Bright, who also scored with Modern Vampires, but bombed with Freeway II. 5 Trailer 
 All began with the movie. When at first i saw it, i know that after that i will go and buy the soundtrack. That's songs are beautiful like "madd about you", the famous song of the Jet band and etc. I was very enjoy of it!!! It's Recommanded in warmth 
 I bought two sets (8 containers) of these about 3 months ago, and I absolutely love them. The shallow dimensions make them equally ideal for casseroles and cuts of meat, and their smaller size (a nice 2 cups) helps with portion control. They're much more durable than plastic lunch containers, and they can be reheated over and over without any signs of wear. I highly recommend these; I'll never go back to plastic 
 I searched all over for this movie, but was unable to find it.  That is until my son told me about Amazon.com.  Film quality is great.  Thank you for stocking all the old movies 
 Something different for the holidays!  "Poets & Angels" features gently spicy renditions of familiar holiday tunes played by nouveau flamenco guitarist Ottmar Liebert, along with five original compositions.  The traditional melodies are in there, but the Latin-style percussion and improvisational interludes and percussion set them apart from the usual holiday renderings.  "Poets & Angels" is a fun, upbeat way to celebrate Christmas.  Try also the album "Christmas" by guitarist and keyboardist Tino Izzo for another take on revamping traditional carols.  
 I admit im not the most interested in some of Gould's subjects (evolution and biology) but he is a great storyteller.  He sometimes attacks, sometimes defends some of histories greatest thinkers.  I think i'll  probably read most of his books (so far 3) in the next few years simply  because I like his style and diverse content 
 I recently purchased this cd and now have the complete Omen Trilogy produced by Varese.  Of the three it's the first soundtrack The Omen that I can not listen to because of the erriness of it.  That means Goldsmith was quite effective in accomplishing what he set out to do.  The other two scores I can and do listen to.  I find the score to the Final Conflict quite impressive.  This score is also good and is a must for Jerry Goldsmith collectors.  Way to go 
 I use this watch for business trip all over the world, the function is very nice, the compass,temperature,weather forecast functions are very useful, especially, the baro-chart is very important to assist to judge the correct weather forecast. The color is very nice, but someone mentioned it would discolor, I think it should be, but not happen yet, because it always staid in a very good condition (only business trip), but if I go mountain-climbing, I suppose it might happen soon. Then why I did not give the 5 stars, the only disadvantage is the dual time mode, to show local and home town time in a same display is very very important during business trip, it can tell when I should call back to my company, and the display still has enough space to display the home town time, I think La Crosse should consider to improve this function. Anyway, this is still a useful watch for business trip 
 The short workouts let you squeeze them in around baby's schedule, and still feel like you're getting a workout.  They are not too difficult and the countdown clock is great to see how much time is left in each segment.  
 This film sets a creepy mood. The director, Lucio Fulci, also achieved this mood in "The Beyond". When I was a kid this film was forbidden to be seen. In America it was called "The Gates Of Hell". I was raised around hard core bible thumpers and they all declared this film to be banned. So ofcourse I had to get my hands on it. The film didn't need the gore. It could have been great on the mood alone. It stands as my fave zombie film. Some people just won't get it. P.S. I love the urban monkey screams in the film lol 
 From start to finish the story pulls the readers into its deep realm of nuttiness. Beginning as an historical murder investigation by an enthusiast, i.e. the writer's first-person memoir, Mr. Elliott weaves into an iota of a sardonic science fiction genre towards the middle and end of the book. The dialogues borrow from the typically ironic scripts of the "Get a Life" series and the "Cabin Boy" movie. To like this novel is to be familiar with Mr. Elliott's kind of jokiness first. If not, everything and everybody would seem quite bizarre. Namedropping of well-known personalities from the past and present is a norm in each chapter; each is conformed to truly sarcastic remarks. Although a little bit on the long side (it is a novel after all), the mystery is solved and everybody lives happily ever after. It's just getting to the cheery ending is a little bit twisty as explained in Mr. Elliott's way of entertaining 
 This book is a good collection of photos of the first year of the new panda cub at the Washington Zoo.  It is especially useful for those interested in pandas who have not seen them and want to get a sense of the behaviors and expressions of a young panda cub 
 Without a doubt one of the best books on the Clinton years written. Harris is a stellar journalist and the book is exceptional in its balanced account of the events that unfolded during Clintons years as president. A must read for the historically interested and those interested in presidential biographies 
 There are many people writing reviews here that seem to be missing the point.  The views and predictions held in this book (and the rest of H&S other works) need time to happen.  People are quick to point out what predictions haven't come true, but they don't understand that they probably won't yet.  This book is a study of people born from 1982 to the new millennium.  Most of the people in that generation are not even teenagers yet.  We have to wait until the youngest of this generation is able to vote and see what they are like and what their contributions to society are at that point.  That is another 8-10 years away.  Please do not judge this book on the predictions that haven't come true yet.  Give them time.  I'm not saying that this book is infallible, but it certainly needs more thought put into it than someone saying "more kids smoke pot now than 8 years ago, so the prediction must be false!"  Kids that are in college now are just the beginning of the millennial generation, so we need to wait and see what high school and college kids are like in 10 years.  We need to give them time to make the change from being influenced by Gen-X  to having their own voice and thoughts.  Give this book a chance - It's a great read and interesting social commentary.    And please, please stop writing reviews of everything - books, music, etc. if you do not have all the facts or haven't thought it through.  People read these reviews and expect them to present a truthful (albeit somewhat opinionated) explaination of the material.  When you put info in that is false or underthought, it just makes people's decisions harder 
 Package came in a timely manner with no defects...great price, too 
 Exceptional perfomance and long life makes this battery a great deal. Always good to have a back -up and this battery comes in handy 
 For fifteen years before moving to the town of Raveloe, Silas Marner had lived a satisfying and happy existence in a close-knit community known as Lantern Hill. His contentment there ended when a friend betrayed him and Silas was found guilty of a crime he did not commit. After being forced to leave Lantern Hill, Silas settled in Raveloe, where he soon gained a reputation for being an excellent weaver. With his faith in his fellow man shattered, Silas had no desire to mingle with anyone in his new town, and he spent his days weaving at his loom and delivering his goods. His nights were spent gazing lovingly on his growing pile of money; guineas, crowns, and half-crowns, these gold and silver coins soon becoming his best-loved companions.   One dark, rainy evening Silas leaves his house to run an errand, not bothering to lock the door behind him. When he returns he discovers that his horde of money is gone from its hiding place underneath the floor and suddenly, in the space of just a few minutes, his world is turned upside down. His treasure is gone. But shortly thereafter an unexpected visitor turns up at Silas' home, someone who will change his life and in the process help him to reach out for the first time to his fellow citizens of Ravenloe.   This wonderful story brought both a tear to my eye and a smile to my lips when I finished reading it. Every fall when I visit my local bookstores I always see Silas Marner on the shelves with the required reading for students but for some reason I have always passed it off as not really being worth my time. What a tremendous loss for me, up until now. This poignant story has humor, suspense, many truly lovely characters and an ending that I adored. If you haven't yet had the pleasure of reading it, do yourself a huge favor and buy a copy. You will not regret it. Five GOLD stars for this marvelous book!! 
 Let's get down to brass tacks.  This CD has all the hits Johnny Horton recorded during his truncated life, including his biggest hit, the patriotic "Battle of New Orleans" as well as "Sink the Bismarck."  Aside from these two tunes and "North to Alaska," rest are pretty much filler, but so what?  Those three tunes are all that matter anyhow 
 Wonderful story, with a cheeky moral.  Colourful illustrations, simple text.  I read it to my group of children at toddler story time and they sat entranced.  Not difficult to get enthusiastic about this book - you must buy it 
 This landmark study is the best account I have come across of early Christianity. Speculation is kept to a minimum and the author deals with the evidence that we have from early Christian writings. His approach to these writings is to read between the lines and look at what we can tell about how the authors tell us things rather than what they tell us. The other strength is that the early Christian world is considered firmly in the context of the Jewish and later Gentile communities in which it developed. The author has certain presuppositions, e.g, that not all of Paul's letters were written by Paul. Also, he deals objectively with the role of religious experience in the development of Christ devotion. That is, neither affirming nor discounting any explanations of what such the actuality of these experiences, he simply looks at what accounts of these experiences can tell us about how early Christians worshipped and lived out their faith. Although this is really an academic text which deals quite comprehensively with a number of complex topics, the book never dries up and the author's style of writing carries you along. Essential reading for anyone interested in early Christianity, I can't recommend it strongly enough 
 Sony has done it again!  Fast charging and LONG lasting, this battery is perfect for my Sony Cyber-Shot Camera! 
 On this cd you will find the classic CARUSO !!! This live cd his a classic.A must for Jazz,blues and pop music lovers .Lucio Dalla is one of Italy s best. This cd proves it 
 I tutor in an adult literacy program. My student, who is in his 30s and not a native English speaker, really enjoyed this book, and is plowing through the second book now.  Although the writing style is a little old fashioned, the plots and characters are interesting for adult new readers. If you're looking for reading material for an adult literacy student, the Hardy Boys may be a good choice 
 As textbooks go this is without a doubt the best one that I have ever used.  This book manages to explain complicated things such as DNA, and other techniques, and tests that are used during the course of an investigation in simple terms that are easy to understand. Especially if you are new to the idea of Forensic Science.  Simple explanations, with colored pictures, diagrams, and case studies help show how different tests, evidence collection, and other aspects of Forensic's are used to help "catch" the bad guy.  Again easy to read and understand.  Well worth the purchase, you will learn a lot 
 Much of the repertoire on this album is drawn from the years just before and after the pianist's birth (1970).  We get Bacharach's "Alfie" (from the Michael Caine film of 1966), two Beatles tunes,  "She's Leaving Home" from Sgt. Pepper's (1967) and "Martha My Dear" from The White Album (1968), Nick Drake's "Day Is Done" (1969), and Paul Simon's hit "50 Ways to Leave Your Lover" (1975).  Balancing out this intriguing time warp are such more contemporary items as another Radiohead song, saxophonist Chris Cheek's "Granada," and two Mehldau originals.  The set concludes, eclectically, with something approaching a more traditional jazz standard, "No Moon at All" from 1947, which has been covered by such luminaries as Basie, Nat King Cole, and George Shearing but not by everyone under the sun.  It makes a splendid closer here.  For the most part, in other words, this is unconventional jazz material, and Mehldau does not neglect to make the most of that opportunity, bringing to bear his unique sensibility, which somehow synthesizes the harmonic sophisticiation of Schubert, Schumann, and Brahms, the best stylings of modern jazz piano, and the hooks of the popular composers whose songs he utilizies as vehicles.  For Mehldau, refreshingly, there are no generic barriers, only good music.  Much comment on this disc will inevitably focus on the lineup change, with Jeff Ballard replacing Mehldau's long-time drummer Jorge Rossy, who has recorded with the trio since Introducing (1995).  Ballard, however, has played with bassist Larry Grenadier for a while (in the trio Fly), so it's not surprising he fits into this unit so well.  In fact, Ballard comes out swinging, with propulsive support on "Knives Out," surely one of Mehldau's most exciting recordings to date.  The group offers a pretty straightforward, lyrical reading of "Alfie" before Mehldau launches into one of his most effective solos yet, a heavily embellished version of "Martha My Dear."  For me the real highlights are the title track, another extremely haunting re-working of a Nick Drake song, and the other Beatles tune, "She's Leaving Home."  Both are developed in extremely sophisticated, satisfying ways.  I love how in the latter recording a window suddenly opens on the simple, poignant theme just before the conclusion.  Unforgettable.  Of the Mehldau originals, "Turtle Town" seems the more memorable, with its odd twists and turns.  One other point: Mehldau himself produced this album.  The sound is great, and there are no annoying fade-outs such as marred some of the earlier recordings.  Overall, this is a fantastic album that builds on the pianist's past triumphs while achieving a distinctive sound of its own.  It's very unlikely to do anything but thrill confirmed Mehldau fans.  I hope it brings many more into the fold, because for my money this guy is just about the best thing happening in contemporary music.  (And I hope he soon records the song cycle he has written, based on poems by Louise Bogan and Rilke, for Renee Fleming--with Fleming herself, of course.)   
 As an author with my debut novel in its initial release, I hope my work endures as well as the work of Bernard Malamud.  THE ASSISTANT is a simple novel that captures perfectly its time and place.  It is also a morality tale.  It features a street thrug named Frank Alpine who thinks he might want to turn his life around.  He takes a job at a Mom and Pop grocery store to privately atone for a crime against that store (as well as other crimes elsewhere).  He agrees to work for room-and-board.  There is ethnic tension between the Jewish grocery store owners and the Italian criminal.  These tensions grow more severe when a romance develops between Frank and the grocer's daughter.  This novel comes as close to being perfect as any I've read in recent years 
 This is a great book for ages 12+ and up.Joan Bauer has mad another great book. I could relate to it a lot from the family being divorced to not knowing much about the rules of the road. It takes place in, Chicago, Illinois during the hot summer. Jenna Boller is the best employee at her branch of Gladstone's Shoes-she can sell anybody anything. she is sixteen-years-old and has had her driver's license for six months. But her family problems are harder to handle, especially her drunk dad, and there are times when Jenna wishes she could just get out of town and take a break. Her dad is a drunk and embarrases at her job. So when Madeline Gladstone, the elderly president of Gladstone's Shoe Stores, hire Jennna as her driver for the summer to take her from Chicago, to Dallas Jenna leaps at the chance-right in the driver's seat. And that begins a cross-country adventure. They learn a lot about the rules of the road... and the rules of life. Jenna is having a nice time driving Mrs.Gladstone around and spending nights at the hottest hotels and most expensive places to eat. Mrs.Gladstone's son is wanting to take over the business because he says that his mother needs to slow down and enjoy the rest of her life. The only problem is that her son,Elden and her aren't very close with relationship and so they don't talk a lot. Elden only cares about the money, not the customers. He will try to sell you anything no matter the price or how it feels on your feet. Later, in a couple of weeks they are going to have a meeting where people will vote and decide who should still be president over Gladstone's Shoes. Jenna meets Henry Bender, the best shoe-seller in Texas. Jenna only knows him for about a week and it's like he becomes her own father. She never really had a dad who took care of her since he was drunk all the time. She mostly took care of him. Then some disturbing news happen, Mr.Bender was killed in a car accident hit head-on by a drunk driver. Jenna's heart is crushed. The real conflict of the story is that right before the meeting that determines who is the president, Elden captures Jenna and gets a plane ticket back home. He takes her to a taxi cab and leaves to the meeting. She tells the taxi to turn around and go back to the meeting, she sneaks in and stops everything. She gives a speech and lets everyone know that Elden is just looking for money instead of quality. Everyone votes for Mrs.Gladstone to stay the president! As Jenna and Mrs.Gladstone arrive home Jenna thinks to herself, all this time she has bent over backwards for her dad and was scared to hurt his feelings for not wanting to see him since he is drunk all the time. Then she realizes that it doesn't matter what her dad wants, she has been their when he wasnt' and she hasn't gotten anything for it. She understands now. She wondered why her dad had to be a acoholic. Now she knew, it was to make her stronger, different and most importantly it showed her how to say no in the darkness. This was a powerful yet hilarious book. I will most likely read it again and never forget it 
 The movie really is a feast for the eyes, out of all of the movies dealing this historical character, I think these movies are the best. Jet Li really does come through and does an excellent job in this stunning film. The action and story is excellent and very entertaining to watch. All of the costars are as equally incredible. The characters are those you really do care for and the locations in the film really are beautiful, it really does feel like you are watching 19th century China. The westerners aren't shown in a extremely negative light, it could have been worse. The battles scenes really do stand out. Great stuff that just got better with the sequel! 
 Boy am I glad I picked up "Extra Man" before anything else by Jonathan Ames. Struck by his work for the New York Press, I finally found this book secondhand and it's a classic! Ames has a very distinctive and winning voice and his New York is a perfect balance of charm, chaos and perversion. Unfortunately, Ames tends to recycle the best bits in his work, but what incredible bits! His great aunt should be bronzed and put in Central Park as an unforgettable New York character. She needs a book of her own, Jonathan 
 I echo the previous review.  This book is very informative, well written, and very comprehensive with discussions on 79 hikes.  For anybody interested in the overwhelmingly beautiful and dynamic landscapes of the Commonwealth, follow the suggestions in this book 
 Wald's book stands out as the clearest presentation of general relativity yet produced.  The downside is that the conciseness often makes it inaccessible to the beginner.  If you try to learn from this book, you *need to do exercises* (from this book or another).  It is too hard to follow if you don't have the experience of computations under your belt.  But once you do get to the point where you follow Wald, you will follow him easily and pleasurably, as he writes with effortless clarity.  A common myth is that this book is overly mathematical.  On the contrary--some of the highlights are where Wald discusses the role of Mach's principle in Einstein's formulation of the theory, and the role of our "philosophical projudices" in our choice of cosmology.  Wald's talent is the ability to state the interesting physical or philosophical stuff without having to ramble on like other authors 
 Few writers can coin a phrase or capture a mood or feeling like Thomas Wolfe could.  This is never more evident than in "Look Homeward, Angel."  After all these years, still a classic, well worth reading for the first time or for another time. His ability to capture mood, colors, feelings and emotions in the depths of the human heart and soul, in and out of family relationships, is remarkable, as is the agelessness of the story. A timeless story of personal growth, coming of age and family dynamics. Well worth the read 
 I love this movie, AWESOME choreographed fight scenes that are very well filmed, great humor, and how can you say no to a love crazed Brittany Murphy and great martial arts! : 
 This was the ideal book for me!  Thanks to this book, I can draw better than I ever imagined possible!  Ames' provides good, clear instructions.  Beagles, basenjis, bulldogs and Germans shepherds are fun to draw.  Any dog with a curly tail is fun to draw.  Readers are also treated to a brief history of each breed on the bottom of each page.  Now, I wish there was a book (or maybe there is and I just don't know about them) of drawing classic cars.  How to draw a 1964 Ford Falcon - how cool is that! 
 Oh my goodness!  Powerful is what I say about Rahsaan.  I'd never heard of him until June 9th when he opened up for Kem in concert.  I was turned out and turned on as soon as he opened his mouth.  Since then, I've purchased all his CD's.  Wonderful, he sounds like no one else out there.  If you are not part of the HIP HOP Lost & Found you will absolutely love this artist 
 Talk about a twist and turn of events!  My first graders loved this book.  It teaches children that being first is not always best.  I use it now whenever my first graders fight to be first in line.  We all yell out, "Don't be a Pinkerton!" and in a gentle humorous way the "pusher of the line" concedes.  It is also a great book for a follow up discussion on homophones.  When you read this book, you'll know what I'm talking about.  You see, Pinkerton wants to be first when he hears someone offering a "sandwich" but it turns out to be a Sand Witch who makes him realize his selfishness.  It is an adorable book and voted one of the top five in my classroom 
 Oren Harari has pulled together some of Colin Powell's words of wisdom, many of which were already published in Powell's autobiography, and turned them into a useful leadership book.  Harari fleshes out many of Powell's ideas and gives memorable examples of what he believes Powell means when he says, for example, that "being responsible sometimes means pissing people off."  This book is a tribute to Powell and can at times come across as interpreting the teachings of the Messiah, but since Powell is one of the few leaders in today's world that is virtually universally respected, this is forgivable.  The Leadership Secrets of Colin Powell is a valuable addition to any leadership library 
 I found this book to be very enjoyable.....it has humor and a message. We all say things that we don't think will be paid attention but this story tells us that sometimes we say something and when it's repeated we are appalled. When we are respected for it later is a bonus. I think women of all ages would enjoy this story 
 Boorstin outlines the fundamentals and development of American consumerism and capitalism of the 19th Century. A great read for understanding why America was the great attraction of emigration. A good emphasis is put  forth on how much American ingenuity happened by accident.  This book is  excellent for describing who we are, how we dressed, how we ate, and how we  profited from it.  Like the rest of Boorstin's works, this is a must for  any student of history 
 In my opinion, A.S Byatt is a master of language; as well as of the observations of both human nature and society. I was first introduced to her work with Possession, and have since then read everything I can.  Overall, Babel Tower is an amazing work of literature. As always, the prose flows together in perfect cadence; along with observations of a new revolution of traditional values versus new ideas of free thought, the change of language, and how one must suffer so greatly to be accepted by society and it's stiffling expectations. Frederica; I continued to adore and be plagued by at the same time. However, one of my small problems with this book is that the character development did not seem to be as strong as Virgin in the Garden or Still Life. I also really missed and wanted to see more of Marcus, Jacqueline, Ruth, Daniel, and the old crowd of the previous two novels--I wanted to know more about how Daniel's children coped with their mother's death and simply more about one of my favorite literary families instead of the whole novel being almost all Frederica. My only other small complaints are that sometimes the excerpts from Babbletower detracted from the book as well as some of Frederica's lamentations or reviews. My advice is to skim these parts--they don't really do much for the overall plot so you can get by with just a basic idea. Finally, there are parts in the novel that seem as if the prose and all the literary references are forced if not slightly pretentious, while the other two novels had a very natural flow while the intellectual ideas were not pretentious or showoffish. It seems as if Byatt was slightly stuck at these "humps", but she gets over it quickly enough.  But despite a few mild flaws, this is a very good novel. Perhaps not as polished as the others, but a gorgeously told story with brilliant social commentary and satire to top it off.  A great novel to read with any group of friends or a book club as there is so much to discuss with so many different takes. It does take awhile to get through, as is the case with all of Byatt's novels, but you will feel content with the overall book  in the end-- even with the pretentious bits and an often tearjerking storyline. 
 I found the book a great comparison of the variety of conditions in which POWs found themselves. While no two POW had the same experience treatment and conditions did vary greatly. I've sent this book on to a few Ex-POW's because it provides context they may not be aware of, Like Airborne veterans captured without firing a shot. Not everyone lived like Hogan's Heroes or The Great Escape. The book has a solid spot in my WW-II collection 
 Grisham once said he wrote his other books, e.g., The Firm, et al., so he could afford to write important books, like this one, upon which the movie s based.  Matthew McConaghey gives a fantastic performance--and why hasn't Hollywood ever--EVER--given him another part this good!  Thought provoking, great acting, great story, highly recommen 
 This movie is a beautiful story about four Chinese women and their four American-born daughters. The stories deal with identity, survival, sacrifice, love, respect, pride, and forgiveness. I cried at the end of this film because this movie stresses the importance of mother and daughter relationship. We carry the spirits of our fore mothers and it dictates what we do with our lives.    I have one negative comment to make and it involves the image of Asian men. After drying my tears from watching this movie, something struck me hard because I felt this movie made Asian men look bad. Yes, there were two positive Asian male characters in this movie. There was the stereotypical Asian father who played June's father (one of the daughters). Then there was Lena's second husband, but he came across as a token. It felt like the producers threw him in to keep the Asian community from getting upset, because there was no story development about him and Lena's life and their love, but you knew EXACTLY what happened with Waverly, Rose, and their white husbands.   The one character that really bugged me was Rose. Her husband cheated on her because she was too much of an Asian wife. She put her husband's needs before hers and as a result, he wanted to leave her, which she tries to stop. It is not until she learned the story of her grandmother that she understands her "worth". After learning her worth, she and her husband stays together. The movie is blaming HER and her culture for why her husband cheated, but blames Asian men when they do the same thing (am I the only one that sees this?).    I am a black female (how odd for a black woman to be defending Asian men) and I have studied the Asia culture, so I know this movie is bias. What strikes me as wrong is this movie is often compared to "The Color Purple". At least the black men (like Mister) are allowed to change to become better men and the women did not rely on men (of any race) for their happiness as this movie does. There is nothing wrong with finding happiness with a man (I am a traditionalist in that perspective), but Rose needs to dig deeper to find out why she is so needy. If you want a more balanced portrayal of Asian women and men, check out the movies from Asia. However, this movie is still a MUST SEE! 
 This book was very inspiring. It is a very quick read because all of the biography is concise and to the point. Some of the people I had never heard of before and that made it all the more interesting. I don't know whether I would have called it the greatest business stories of all time or not but they certainly are up among the best. Every story was great and very interesting telling how they started and where they finished up. Also how people borrowed huge sums of money in order to buy a business that wasn't making money at the time only to turn them around. Like the guys at Harley for example putting together $1 million of their own and then borrowing $81 million to buy the company. Unbelievable.  Everyone who reads this will enjoy it as it was written very well. You will learn some valuable business and marketing concepts from the leaders of industry. Anyone will enjoy this one especially if you don't have the time to read a long biography. This is a great place for someone to start if they haven't been much of a reader of biographies because this is full of true life people overcoming against the odds 
 This story is loosely and I meanloosely based on the epic poem Beowulf. An Arab falls for the wrong woman so her husband has him sent far away as an ambasador. He meets up with a bunch of Vikings who are needed to go help fell Northmen from supernatural beasts who eat have been terrorizing them. It turns out that 13 men are needed and 1 of them can't be a Northman so the Arab must go. So they all go and defend the village.  One thing I like was how everything wasn't made all fancy looking like a lot of fantasy films try to do with their films. Everything looks like it would have looked like for it's time period, like the weapons, armour, clothes, homes and the wooden castle. Although some of the weapons and armour actually weren't used by real Vikings. The scenery is also good with it's green fields and forests and all of that fog. The fighting scenes were also pretty good and there's quite a bit of them to. One interesting thing is how they show the differnces from the Vikings and Muslim culture like how the Arab thinks that the Viking way of life is very dirty and barbaric. The Viking leader also shows interest in the Arab being able to write and he himself tries to write something in Arabic that the Arab had showed him.  Some things I didn't like was the ending because it seemed very anti-climatic because the leader of the bad guys dies way too early in the last battle and after that the rest of the bad guys run away into the mist. Also they should have shown a grand funeral for the Viking leader at the end. Also some of the characters really don't have that much depth so you really don't care when they start to die.  I also felt a couple of things were just a little too farfetched like when the Arab picks up Norse by just listening to them for a while. You can't just learn an entire language by just listening to it for a few days or weeks or for however long it took him to learn it but if he didn't then there probaly would have been subtitles because in the beggining the vikings are speaking Norse and after the Arab learns it they start to speak english.  Another thing that's farfetched is that the bad guys turn out to be Neanderthals, who were by this point in time extinct but in the end it works out so it doesn't really matter.   Overall there really aren't too many Viking movies out there and out of the very very few that I have seen I would say that this is the best one. So if you want to see a good Viking or fantasy type movie then you need to get this movie 
 As a former Political Science student, I can attest that Dagger's book on  Civic Virtues is one of the most comprehensive and entertaining political  science books on the market today 
 Dear Reader,  Those poor, unfortunate Baudelaire triplets!  They just escaped the clutches of the evil Count Olaf and his girlfriend Esme Squalor in THE ERSATZ ELEVATOR.  They had also just seen their friends, the Quagmire triplets: Duncan and Isadora taken away in a giant red herring.  Jerome was the last person who was willing to take the Baudelaires in.  Mr. Poe, however, had been able to find an entire village willing to raise the children, the village of V.F.D. Remembering the clue that the Quagmires had told them, the Baudelaires were hoping that V.F.D. would assist them in solving the death of their parents and the mysterious tunnel they had discovered from 667 Dark Avenue to the remains of their family home.  Alas, V.F.D. had never heard of the phrase, "It takes a village to raise a child" and treated the children rather bad.  About all that V.F.D. cared for were their migrating crows that ruled the town.  In fact, that's what this V.F.D. was all about; they are the Village of Fowl Devotees.  Still, the children's stay at V.F.D. wasn't completely a waste.  They met a man named Jacques Snicket who knew the Baudelaires' parents, the befriended a man named Hector who was going to let Violet, Klaus, and Sunny escape with him in his air-mobile home, and the children were reunited with the Quagmires.  Oh!  But THE VILE VILLAGE is not a happy story.  No, no, no, no.  Someone is almost burned to death!  A nefarious villain returns to make the Baudelaires miserable.  People are accused of crimes they didn't commit.  And once again Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are left to fend for themselves.  Those poor children!  Will the unfortunate events ever stop for them?  How I wish it would.  I'm depressed now.  I think I'll go watch the sunset to cheer me up.  Sincerely, Uncle T 
   This book is wonderful for those going through the challenges of chemotherapy and/or radiation. I purchased it for my mom----who is now in the middle of this experience herself. Wish I would have known about it months ago!   My mom loves that it is written by two oncologists---for the medical info---and by an author (Patricia Corrigan)--who has personal experience with chemo and radiation herself. Mom also loves that it has an index to look up particular topics when needed. She later told me a couple tips about chemo that she learned from a Pat Corrigan.  I thought she was talking about some friend of hers, but found out she was talking about the author---Patricia Corrigan---quoting from her book!!  As if she was her close friend!!  She was able to laugh about things that Patricia mentioned (the "fuzzy" thinking for one thing---that goes away after chemo is over!)  Patricia's sense of humor and encouragement are really appreciated by my mom and I. What a gift this book is!   
 	In 1921 some of the white folks decide to move the "coloreds" out of the middle of Freedomtown because it is in the middle of Dillon, all the coloreds must take action. The only reason they are making the coloreds move is because they don't want them right smack in the middle of Dillon and they want a park built in Freedomtown. The whites decide to take a vote the day after July 4th  about whether they should keep the coloreds in Freedomtown or move them, and Rose Lee finds herself in a mess, she must be a food server to the Bells because her cousin Cora has fallen ill and she also finds herself a spy, giving any information that she hears about Freedomtown to the colored men of Dillon. Rose Lee also finds herself getting Henry out of two sticky situations and helping out an old friend, Catherine Jane.

Also, will she be able to find a way to save Henry's life 
 ...to when Lucasarts was a good company. Today, Lucasarts is nothing but a greedy company that cares nothing about its customers, and I can't same I'm impressed with George Lucas these days either.  But anyway, when Jedi Outcast hit stores Lucasarts was the best gaming company in existance. They had a NICE CEO, unlike the one they have now. One who actually CARED about us gamers.  I'm sorry, I'm really ranting here.  In Jedi Outcast, the 2nd best game in history second only to KOTOR, you play an ex-Jedi named Kyle Katarn. The story takes place about 10 years or so after Return of the Jedi and Kyle Katarn (you) have given up your lightsaber and Force powers in fear of falling to the Dark Side. But the Republic needs you, so you must train to become a Jedi again and face your destiny.  There are many interesting and cool characters in the game, like the fat Rodian garbage collector Reelo Baruk and your companion Jan Ors. Not to mention the master of the Sith Desann and his apprentice Tavion.  Also, the multiplayer mode is FANTASTIC!!! The only problem is, no one is ever playing. I play by myself with AI bots and its still really fun!!! You can be stormtroopers with lightsabers!!!  The single player is amazing, too. The storyline is somewhat confusing but interesting all the same. The graphics are pretty impressive for a 2002 game and the combat system is nicely done. I love slashing the arms of of stormtroopers. What fun.  Yes, its true you only use a blue single-bladed lightsaber in the game. BUT NEVER FEAR. I have discovered a cheat to change your blade color:  First, hold SHIFT and hit ` located to the left of the 1 key. This will bring up the console. Type "devmapall" (no quotes) and hit enter. Next type "sabercolor x" where X is what color your saber can be. Here are the colors: orange, yellow, red, blue, green, and purple.  Enjoy that one!  While cheating, always do "devmapall" first. It enables the cheats.   My all-time favorite cheat is "g_saberrealisticcombat 3" I won't tell you what it does. Find out for yourself by killing an enemy. But its funny. (Don't worry it doesn't crash the game I wouldn't do that to you)  I first discovered the wonders of Outcast when I played it at my cousins house. We sat there for hours having fun and screwing with the cheats.  And that's also really cool: cheating does not mess up the game in any way, shape, or form unlike many other games. In other games, you cheat, it has a price. Usually an expensive one. In Outcast, you cheat, its FREE!!!   There is one problem I have with this game and that is the glitches. There aren't many that affect gameplay but sometimes the walls are flashing and it gets sorta annoying. My cousin who has beaten the game at least 10 times has discovered many glitches, including a room where Tavion is standing and you can walk through her, a room filled with lights contained three floating AT-STs, and even a room with mountains painted on the ceiling (I actually found the last one). But its kind of fun, discovering these weird rooms. There are quite a lot of them!  Wow, just writing this makes me want to play the game! I'm gonna go play it!  I remember when Outcast was $49.99. Now, the price has gone down $40.00!! NOWS YOUR CHANCE!!! BUY THIS GAME!! 
 I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in early 20th century history. Ataturk, for sure, played a crucial role during this time. The book is well written and what Ataturk achieved and his fight before during and after the World War I as well as the transformation he forced Turkey through is really amazing. I think he deserves to be called as one of the most influential leaders of all times. I think the book reflects his strong leadership while at the same time sehdding some light to his personality and private life as well 
 I expected this to be dry and mechanical like lots of other math texts - too-technical proofs, homework questions irrelevant to the material, insufficient explanations for why things are the way they are. This book really surprised me because it wasn't "mathy" at all. It doesn't just throw proofs at you expecting you to wade thru page upon page of math notation until you understand - it gives you the intuitive side of important concepts, which means you only need common sense, not an intensive mathematical background to get everything. The examples they picked simplify rather than confuse the concepts. Each easily and naturally leads to the next. If there's anything not thoroughly elaborated, they were sure to cover it in the homework questions, by gently prodding the reader along towards the answer step by step instead of smacking them in the face with impossible problems. Homework questions supplement the material perfectly and basically leave you with a full and well-rounded impression of what the concepts mean as well as when and why to use them, not just how to plug numbers into some formula. If anything, I'd say this book errs on the side of caution in that in some sections it could pick up the pace a little. But then again, you could always just skip the easier parts 
 This book may well sicken and horrify you -- in fact if it doesn't you might be dangerously stoic, but the unforgivingly visceral assault of Vollmann's juicy chewy prose is inarguably a part of this graphic examination of the seedy Hobbesian underworld of drug addicts and sexual 'deviants.' As Vollmann fans know, he loves San Francisco, but this novel more than any other is his desperate howling lovesong to that city. It will help you a lot if you've been there; if you haven't, you'll have to take his word for all the streets and neighborhoods and stores and coffee shops and hotels and parking garages that his characters visit. San Francisco is a deceptively small city, with its cultures and districts piled cheek-by-jowl one atop the other like a cracked and tiled mosaic: Stand in the financial district and turn around and you're in North Beach, turn around again and you're in Chinatown, turn around again and you're in the Tenderloin. This uncomfortable yet functional forced familiarity is reflected in Vollmann's cast of characters: The ethereally tender and matronly but [drug]-addicted Queen of the [...]; slacker private-eye Henry Tyler who unceasingly hunts her along the liminal edge of poverty and despair; and his brother John Tyler, the crisp professional junior partner at a prestigious law firm in $300 neckties whose girlfriend lives in Pacific Heights, of all places. The fact that John is eternally right around the corner, both literally and figuratively, from the kind of squalor and desperation that most of us can't even imagine -- a squalor into which Henry dives deliberately seeking salvation or penance or simply death -- is the source of this novel's nightmare fascination 
 ...despite some of the criticisms, the book is a good read and introduction into an interesting period of history. For those who have never traveled to Morocco, the Berbers are a mixed race and do not consider themselves 'white'. Likewise, the man who lead the so-called Army into what is today southern Spain was from Syria and the sole descedent of an Arab family that had been massacred by a rival group (Abbasid vs the Umayyads). As one local Moroccan legend goes, upon arriving in Tangier the [Christian] head of the city lured Abd al-Rahman to leave the city in search of gold and riches just across the Straits. Fast forwarding, they later set up model cities of tolerance and learning centuries ahead of their European neighbors to the north. Their downfall was hastened by not only the Christians but also Islamic extremists from the southern Berber regions of Morocco who viewed them as too moderate. This is a fascinating period of history and there are other good books on the subject out there that I recommend those interested in the topic read. Two of which I highly recommend are "The Ornament of the World" by Maria Rosa Menocal and a new one recently out called "White Gold". Enjoy. 
 I agree with the reviewer that said one should take this book with a grain of salt. The idea of giving a young child lots of time to play and a simple, natural environment to do that in is a good idea. However, we cannot shield our children entirely from the outside world of noisy electronic devices and any kind of machine whatsoever. If you read the book, you get the sense that even playing a CD or using a vacuum cleaner is unhealthy exposure for children seven and under. I think our kids will survive!  The part about leaving your kids at home when going to the mall, if possible, is wise advice. I know my kids' senses get overloaded in those places! This isn't the most practical of books, but it does gently point the reader toward creating an environment of peace, order, and simplicity for our children to grow up in. We can all lean a bit more in that direction 
 This book has been replaced by a new edition.  If you are planning on taking a Red Cross Emergency Response course, you should seek out the Emergency Response book published in 200 
 This is a very good book about a sixth grade academic quiz bowl team.  They are all good characters with unique stories that sometimes overlap.  I don't think this book is very realistic, but it is very interesting.  It is nice to see eleven-year-olds who are mature and get along, but it doesn't happen like that much in real life, does it?  The story is very sweet, and there are quiz bowl questions put in between chapters for fun.  The questions magically tie into the story, though 
 The Ancient City: LIfe in Classical Athens and Rome is a good book because it has a good description of the two  civilizations. Ancient Rome and Ancient Greece are two different periods, and the book divides the two with clarity and nice colorfull pictures. It will give you good information that you can't find in a encyclopedia 
 Although this reference does not discuss physiological plausible computation models, it provides a fairly easy to read yet serious introduction to conventional parallel computation architectures

 Director Sam Fuller operating in the midst of the Cold War with a low budget comes up a tad short in his film noir crime drama "Pickup on South Street".  While the camera work and sordid settings in Lower Manhattan greatly add to the viewing quality of the film the interrelationship between characters were an unbelievable fairy tale.    Wise aleck pickpocket and three time loser Skip McCoy played by Richard Widmark pinches the wallet of attractive bad girl Candy played by Jean Peters on the New York subway.  Little do they both know but she's been acting as a mule for her ex-boyfriend Joey played by Richard Kiley, carrying a sensitive piece of microfilm containing a secret chemical formula.  She unwittingly was delivering it to a group of Communists.  Unknown to both characters the theft was observed by federal agents who had been shadowing Peters.  The plot essentially involves the coaxing of Widmark to relinquish control of the microfilm by both the authorities and the minions behind Peters and her red sympathizing boyfriend. The cops use tie saleswoman and stool pigeon Moe Williams played in a terrific acting performance by the accomplished Thelma Ritter to ferret out the whereabouts of Widmark.  Widmark however realizing that he's stolen something valuable is holding out for a big score.  The feds try to wave the flag at him to get him to cooperate to no avail.  Slightly tarnished Peters falls for Widmark in an implausible sequence where she unsuccessfully tries using her charms to woo him and recover the film.  Fuller seems undecided whether to make his film an anti-Communist piece or a crime drama and winds up falling short in both areas in terms of impact.  The characters created by Fuller were for the most part universally unlikeable with too may issues to be considered protagonists.  The acting performances most notably by Ritter were well played 
 Bend it like Beckham is an uplifting film that will inspire and uplift you. This is a smart, funny and thought provoking film with a likeable heroine you just want to root for. I urge every mother to give her daughter this DVD for a birthday, Christmas or graduation gift. I think they'll thank you for it. Bend it Like Beckham follows Jess, a young British girl of Indian descent on her quest to become a soccer player like her idol David Beckham. She strives for this goal despite the disapproval of her traditional Indian parents who want her to conform to traditional Indian culture. I love how the movie explores the changing cultures between the generations of family. She perseveres despite numerous familial and social obstacles and in the end achieves her dream. There are a lot of funny moments in this movie; I don't want to give too much away THIS MOVIE IS TOO GOOD TO SPOIL. I love this movie; this is how movies should be made. The cinematography in this movie is amazing; the camera disappears and we see real life transpiring on screen. The entire cast disappears into their characters becoming real people you care about. Look for Keira Knightley in a supporting role. A Shawn James five star essential movie. Definitely get this movie along with the wonderful Muriel's Wedding, a great Australian film that follows a similar type heroine on her journey.  
 Lin has devoted in area of the sociology. This book is another great work followed by other works in sociology.  Strongly suggest to buy and own it as a scholar's guid of the theory of social capital. 
 Schindler's List is one of the best scores ever composed. It is dark, violent, innocent, sweet, emotional, and epic. It is a soundtrack that is better described as an emotional journey through your own heart and soul.  Quite simply put, this is a must have 
 This book was a great help to me in being able to detect when people are lying. It shows you how to look at eye contact, pauses in speech, and unneccesary details people put into lies that they do not put into regular conversation.I have used these techniques for years 
 This book is an absolute gem I found it at LAX newly arriving from ohoo  I have been folloeing the steps and I have ser up a great new life for myself and am working alot in theatre and doing my own web show .the theatre tips were especially helpful. I recommend it to anyone who does not have a good grasp of LA. It def will help prepare you for starting out your caree 
 This is a very compelling story of a tribal african man and his family before the onset of colonialism and then how they deal with the infiltration of europeans.  What is unusual is that this book is actually written by an african.  Most fiction that deals with tribal africa is actually written not by africans but by european or american novelists.    Achebe trys to show the african charecters in a realistic light.  Very flawed but heroic in thier own way.  He does not reduce his africans into victimized but nobel cartoon charecters who embody some mysterious but profound primitive enlightenment that eludes us dense and insensitive westerners.  Instead of showing the christians as some racist and overbearing outsiders he also shows them as flawed but dedicated.    To be frank I find it a refreshing alternative to all the self-loathing white literature written about Africa. 
 This is the RATPACK on the home turf Las Vegas with a nice orchestra INCLUDING strings which add especially on the ballads.  The set is tightly paced throughout and though a few jokes are dated a bit perhaps, I think they hold up well.  Sammy doesn't get to sing a whole lot and he gets picked on the most - some people may be offended and consider that racist. Just the opposite - the whole objective of those jokes was to POKE FUN and RIDICULE racism which back then was still more prevalent.  How many doors were opened to black entertainers by the RAT PACK is obvious.......  But back to the show......this is probably the best set that they did together and the sound quality is AMAZING albeit a bit dry (lacking reverb) for my tastes.  What was nice is that Sinatra sang a lot of songs which he had (at the time) recently recorded e.g. CALL ME IRRESPONSIBLE, PLEASE BE KIND etc.  Keep in mind this was yrs before MY WAY and NEW YORK.  So put this CD on, close your eyes and let yourself be transported back into cool land 
 In the small California community of Divido, high school student Romey Arden is the only out lesbian teenage student. The day she came out-with the support of her ex-hippie, heterosexual, single parent mother-was the day a lot of the kids began shunning her. But not Elliot, the only other gay student. And not Amina, a straight girlfriend who sticks by her through thick and thin. Romey still feels isolated, particularly because there are no other lesbian kids to hang out with. Amina and Elliot are dear to her, but she wonders if she'll ever meet that special young woman.  Julie Wright is unknown to Romey. A gifted singer and student, Julie is home-schooled by her deeply devout Christian parents. When the book opens, Julie's dad, reverend of the Divido Bible Church, is at the local school board meeting damning homosexual teachers. Meanwhile, his only child is at home lying on her bed letting "moonshine in the window and along her body. She felt that liquid sensation, new to her these past months, blushing over her again. She had a private name for it: Yearning" (p. 23). Nearly age 15, she is "old enough to understand what her dad's sermons had to say about her own life. To Julie, the sermon said that this new Yearning was her own special blessing, chosen for her by Jesus. Its mystery would be revealed in time, or not. Either way, she would thank Jesus for the inner joy bestowed upon her, welcome Yearning, and protect it" (p. 26).   It is inevitable that Julie and Romey should meet, and despite their youth, they both feel the "Yearning." At first seeing one another requires only a little sneaking around, but soon they are facing major obstacles. It doesn't take long before Julie's parents do everything they can to keep the two apart. But the depth of feeling that develops between the two girls can't be denied. Their actions set off a string of unexpected events that shock everyone in town and cause change and disaster. And with so much against them, can the love of these young women survive?  MacLean uses beautiful language and a tight plot that moves along with all due speed toward the startling denouement. The novel's structure and prose are flawless. One of my favorite scenes contains this description: "Romey ran into the soft night. With every stride, she sensed the moment when both of her feet were off the ground, that moment she was airborne. It was a way to trick relentless old gravity, which, unlike a parent, never lets its attention wander for even half a second, but obsessively keeps you pinned down. Without engine or wings, for moment after moment, perhaps a fifth of every stride, a minute out of every five, twelve whole minute out of every running hour, she was flying. Gliding on air" (p. 64). The novel is packed full of fine writing. It's by turns serious and also funny in places. With a fine group of secondary characters, this book has it all: compelling plot, unpredictable storyline, and a knockout ending.  The mark of a truly fantastic story is that when you finish reading the book, off and on for days you remember the characters and explore alternatives for each person's future. When you are finished with this expert debut novel, you will find ROSEMARY AND JULIET has left an indelible mark in your memory. Don't miss this one. ~Lori L. Lake, independent reviewer, Midwest Book Review 
 If your only experience of Charles Dickens involves never-ending readings of Great Expectations or Oliver Twist in high school literature class, then you may be surprised to find that Dickens was a master of wit as well as woe.  In The Pickwick Papers all aspects of the amazing talent of Charles Dickens are on display.  Through the adventures and ramblings of Samuel Pickwick, Esq. and his companions Messrs. Tupman, Winkle, and Snodgrass, we are given an intimate look at 19th Century England, from her small country towns to the dark heart of London's debtor's prison.  The characters and places are vibrant, the story alive with humor and pathos.  Continual feasting, fun, and holiday parties with friends share the pages of this story with tales of poverty, abuse, and neglect; all set down by the hand of a master story teller and observer of human nature.  
 I absolutely loved this romantic comedy.  It's a chick flick to watch over and over again 
 A good way to read about mathematical philosophy. A bit dry and heavy in parts. I don't know a lot about postmoderism but am learning, as many of the people I read and write about are postmodernists. People seem to rave about postmodernists but even though some are maybe out to lunch which is bad because they have responsiblilities for the disabled as psyhciatrists, they have some interesting points for thought. Don't get blind sided by postmodernism, study first year calculus at least in your fine arts degree 
 The Rings of Tautee is not your run of the mill save the inhabitants story.  It has one big difference.  This exciting story by Dean Wesley Smith and Kristine Kathryn Rusch has Kirk transporting hundreds of people from a dying civilization.  The scenes that make this one stand out?  The ones where he struggles with the Prime Directive and his classmate and friend, Captain Bogle.  The Klingons join in this rescue with great reluctance.  It's not another shoot from the hip Jim Kirk here.  I have always said he's not the space cowboy that the next generation always claimed he was.  Just as Picard has finesse in negotiation; Jim also has the ability to seek out a peaceful resolution without firing a phaser 
 Nate finds a note that had been slid under his door. It's from his mother. She's lost the recipes for her monster cookies. Nate loves those cookies, Strawberry Draculas, Chocolate Frankensteins, Cinnamon Werewolves. Even though Mom doesn't like werewolves, she bakes the cookies for Nate anyway.  It's up to him and his dog sludge to find that recipe. And so they go on the hunt, real detectives them in this learning to read book that, like all the Nate the Great books, is excellent for beginning readers. My girls love it and your children will too.  Sophie Cacique Gau 
 Typee is an absolute favorite of mine. I drive long distances with my business and it is an absolute favorite. Maelville paints great visions of the south tropical Pacific Islands and touches so sweetly into the simple lives of simple living. It is full of suspense, intrique, beauty, and laughter. I love this book so much I had to buy an original 1800's hardcopy on ebay and it now graces my collection 
 I wonder if,'The End Of Art' signals the end of Don Kuspit's tirade against post-modernism. He's not the first to decry the cynicism, the anti-aestheticism, and material poverty of art since the Second World War. However,he is a particularly coherent and vehement spokesman for the return of' New old Masters' and the wall of art market hogwash in which they are embattled. Kuspit's brush is broad.  To set his agenda,he summons Baudelaire's famous descriptions of incipient modernism from 'The Salon of 1846', which I first encountered courtesy of the enthralling Peter Schjeldahl. The worm was in the wood with the rise of new capitalism. Manet and Courbet's'slice of life' paintings paved the way for a levelling out of subject matter and the skills to depict it. Apart from his repetitive depreciation of(borrowing from 'Happening's master, Alan Kaprow)'postart', there are cogent summaries of several luminaries who highlight contemporary art's dilemna. Concurrent with Nietzsche's declaration that God was dead, Van Gogh endowed art with human purpose transforming it into the living religion of god. He is the foil to postart's, vaccuuous Warhol who assimilated art into money, diminishing its spirituality and integrity. Schjeldahl would never decry Andy! Duchamp's nihilistic pessimism, confusing banality of mundane objects with art, has robbed art these subsequent 90 years of its transformative values, to place us'in a radically different emotional place than we are in everyday life - a place that seems beyond life, however lifelike. This is as much liberation from life as it is possible to have while living.' Kuspit does report on the return to the studio of the New old Masters, though I'm wary of some of his nominations. Lucien Freud is indisputable. And I've experienced Richard Este's realism to induce a proximity 'to the human heart for seeming to be more material' than the material world. But no Kiefer while Eric Fischl gets a guernsey? I was fascinated by his courageous portrayals of middle America in the 1980s, but as he's become more suave, an entropy has cursed both his medium and message: his images packing more wallop in reproduction than in life.In Australia,I'd nominate a single New Old Master, Melbournian, John Anderson. It's inappropriate to be cheap here, but Kuspit's on the money with his courageous manifesto, attempting to rid the Temple of its Moneylenders 
 The man is Las Vegas. I have loved Wayne's songs since I was a kid. And I am not old I am only 21. I took a friend to see Wayne in concert and brought them around. Listen to this album and if you don't like or know  Wayne you will 
 I recently made room at the top of my "Favorite Teen Books of All Time List" for this book. And, trust me, that's saying something.  The concept of a girl attending a virtually all-boys Catholic high school was what hooked me from the beginning. Francesca's observations of the male population at St. Sebastian's are dead-on and hilarious. From Thomas Mackee, the immature music-loving jerk/good guy, to Jimmy, who is too smart for his own good and the only person who can make her mother laugh, to Will, the arrogant but strangely attractive senior that she finds herself kissing at the most inappropriate times.  Francesca, who still considers herself best friends with girls from her old school, grudgingly engages in relationships with three other girls at Sebastians's that she never thought she would become friends with. From Justine, the nerdy but confident band member, to Tara, the feisty feminist ready to take on the world, to Sioban, promiscuous show-off and Francesca's seventh-grade dancing partner. I fell in love with Marchetta's characters from the very beginning.   Marchetta also deals with the issue of depression with incredible realism and honesty. Francesca is unsure about how to help her mother, who spends most of her time in bed; she also struggles to fight the same disease that she feels could be lurking somewhere inside of herself. Since reading the novel, I have gone back more times than I can remember to reread funny observations or poignant moments. Bottom line: A must read for every teenage girl 
 This is another good story in the line of alphabet mysteries by Sue Grafton. Her few "detours" from great writing in previous "letters" seem to have been a minor bump in the road and she now returns to a good plot and strong characters.  I have to admit that one of my favorite characters in this series is Henry Pitt, Kinsey Millhone's landlord and friend. I enjoyed the Henry who wrote crossword puzzles and tried them out on Kinsey before he sent them in for publication. I enjoyed the Henry who always had something baking in his kitchen. And many times I have wondered why some sexy senior citizen hasn't snagged this wonderful catch of a man!  This story gives us a little more insight into Henry than we've seen in the past. Henry convinces Kinsey to help a friend of his on a simple matter - she needs to show that Henry's friend served in the military during World War II so he can be buried as a veteran. Such a simple request and it should have a simple solution, but as we've seen with Kinsey in the past, nothing is an easy task, so the plot thickens...   The family of the deceased is too busy fighting among themselves to be much help to Kinsey. Then an old friend shows up and gets attacked at the dead guy's apartment.  Once again we're on a race to see what's around the next corner for Kinsey and to find out why the government has no record of this veteran serving his country.   There's a little bit of mystery, but more suspense in this book. And more laughs than we've seen in the past with Grafton's other books. I'd recommend this easy read to anyone wanting a few hours of enjoyment as it's definitely one of Sue Grafton's better books in this series. I only hope she will continue with this quality and not hit any more bumps that throw her off to only mediocre writing! 
 If you're a new writer and would like to focus on a few specific areas, then "Ready, Aim, Specialize!" will benefit you. In addition to advice specific to ten or so genres, each chapter features a helpful list of print and internet resources; if you are an experienced writer you'll probably be familiar with them already, as well as most of the information James-Enger imparts throughout the book. If you are a brand-new writer and are seeking information on freelancing as a whole, look at "The Renegade Writer." But for those wanting to focus on health, travel, parenting, etc..."Ready, Aim, Specialize!" will give you your money's worth. 
 This is a book that every child should read.  My son thought it was very funny, and we enjoyed it a lot 
 Lynette has done a great job digging out some of the most hard to find tips and tricks to help me with Photoshop CS2. There are so many Photoshop books out there, but Lynette's easy to understand, yet powerful tips have already helped me in things I do with Photoshop everyday. I recommend this book to all Photoshop users 
 We've had this product now for about 3 weeks and use it everyday.  We just put in hardwood floors and needed something that wouldn't damage the floors, but picked up the dirt, dust, and our pets hair.  This product is extremely light, easy to push around (my 3 year-old loves playing with it), and has great suction.  There's been nothing so far that it hasn't been able to pick up.  After each use, it's simple to open up and dump out the debris.  It also has a charger unit that conveniently stores the vacuum until next use.  Well worth it 
 I first read the original version of this book in 1987. Reading it changed my whole outlook on life and was instrumental in continuing my spiritual journey along a path of truth. No more mystical airy fairy stuff, at last I had found where I could get answers to my questions. It set me on a path of self understanding, growth and evolution that continues to this day and of which I am entirely grateful. I found that Ramtha covered every topic imaginable and laid to rest many otherwise mysteries surrounding life.  This book (affectionately called The White Book) can be read and re read, and one will always learn something new and great that can immediately be applied to life ..... they are the teachings of a Master.  I highly recommend this book as a worthwhile addition to any library, that can be referred to often for continual inspiration and knowledge 
 La Ciudad is a significant documentary that provides full detail on illegal immigrants, more specifically Mexican immigrants, whom come to the United States.  The structure of the film as well as the narrative was well organized.  Each new story began a snap of a picture.  The picture and/or camera can be analyzed as a way of communication between immigrants in the United States and their family back in Mexico.  It is a way to keep in touch with their loved ones when they are far away.  Another observation on the documentary is the repetition of windows.  In the case of Luis, he takes his daughter to school and sees the classroom being conducted through a window. In order to enroll his daughter, Luis is to provide proof that he lives in the city.  However, he does not have legal proof, a rent receipt or a phone bill, and is denied the enrollment of his child.  In the film, immigrants would always look inside windows.  The windows can be seen as the United States and how legal and illegal immigrants see the United States as a whole.  However, it is the opposite of what immigrants might have expected the country to be.  Immigrants might have expected a better life and/or working conditions once they immigrated to the country.  They are struggling to obtain a decent job and are not allowed to receive public benefits such as an education as seen in the case of Luis.  The film's scenery is in black and white which gives the viewer an impact on the stories that have been presented.  It lets the viewer see that not everything in this country has color. 
 ever since cursive's ugly organ album i've been trying to find a new sound that i connect with just as much, a new cd i know i'll just love forever and want to keep listening to. this is it, and it's been a long time coming. i recommended it to my friend who's fav. band is sleater kinney, i want to see them live, i can't even say which song is my favorite, beacause i like them all. but i think if i had to include just one on my i-pod it'd be "the list". 
 Fantastic movie, could be viewed with the whole family. My husband cried and it made us think about the real meaning of love. Mother Teresa is in our daily life now, as an example of giving and unconditional love. 
 Pierre Boulanger plays Momo, a young boy living alone in Paris, who is abandoned by an overwhelmed father and absent mother. The child's protectors are the benevolent hookers who parade the street near his empty apartment and who treat him to love when he is a bit older.  There is also the old Muslim storekeeper (a marvelous Omar Sharif) who watches in amusement as this fatherless boy shoplifts from him, permitting the theft as an act of religious charity.  That the old man befriends the boy should be no surprise, But still, "Monsieur Ibrahim" is charming and engaging throughout. Watching this humane man breathe life into the life and soul of a wayward boy is uplifting - as is the shopkeeper's use of Islamic scriptures to give the boy a sense of morality. I quibble only with a certain tragedy that occurs toward the end, which drains some of the film's freshness.   "Monsieur Ibrahim" is a classic movie from the French. It is intelligent and warm, introducing us a warm, varied and believable cast of memorable characters. 
 I have made a special place on my shelf for Hucaby's ASA and Pix Handbook.  It will be there for a while.  And not just collecting dust.  This book is a good first stop for questions about configuration and troubleshooting.  One thing I loved about this book right away was that it provides a side-by-side comparison between PIX 6.X and 7.X commands.  This is pefect for someone like me who configures and works with both versions of firewalls, but not on a daily basis.    There are so many new features ( and changes to existing ones) in Pix 7.0, it's pretty hard to keep track of it all.   Most concepts are covered in detail and include when a new feature is used and the corresponding configuration commands.  For example, the topic of Security Contexts is given a great deal of coverage (30+ pages).  Other featuers such as QoS are more sparse (5 pages).  Still, even in those 5 pages, I felt like I came away with a basic understanding of how and when to use that feature.  The section on firewall failover is worth the price of admission alone.  It is comprehensive and again has side-by-side comparisions between 6.X and 7.X.  It also points out a couple of the common gotchas such as how to properly upgrade a failover pair.  I recommend dog-earing Chapter 10 - the troubleshooting chapter.  This chapter goes into checking firewall vital signs, watching data pass through the firewall and verifying connectivity.  The explanations are thorough.  The tips are memorable.  It even goes into viewing packet captures for packet level debugging.  I did find it lacking in certain areas such as VPN configuration (I'm still looking for a good Cisco book on that).  I rest of the book is so good I can certainly forgive him this omission.  The book weighs in at 800 pages as is. 
 I  actually  had  to  read  this  book  several  times  to  get  the  point. It was  well  written  and  told  the  truth  through  the  eyes  of  an  experienced  teacher.  Reading  this  book  helped  me  come to  the  decision  to  homeschool  my  kid 
 Interesting projects,  but what I found most interesting was the history & other information about sheep, wool & felting.  Very good, detailed instruction for felting.

 If you don't have any serious plans, I'd suggest this book. I was unable to put this book down once I started reading about the famous (and infamous) folks listed in this book. You might find yourself surprised at the ways many of these people checked out. It is NOT a morbid book. There is plenty of information about people that you may or may not have known before. It is thick and enjoyable...And yes, I did note a few errors in Benoit's information, but it didn't take away from my total enjoyment of the book 
 Some women want to strangle models, but most people don't actually go that far. That's not the case in "Blood and Black Lace,"  where models run, scream, and die in all sorts of gruesome ways. Mario Bava's classic giallo has some monotonous moments, but mostly it sticks to stylish slayings.  Just before a fashion show, the model Isabella is found dead in a wardrobe. The police investigate the fashion house's various models and managers, but can't find any solid evidence. And during the show, one of the other models finds Isabella's diary, which is loaded with scandalous information about drugs, lovers, abortions, and debts.  But then the diary is stolen, and trenchcoated killer waits until the models are alone -- and then he burns, strangles, drowns, and claws them. The police suspect the men -- designers and managers -- at the fashion house, but even detaining the suspects won't stop the gruesome murders...  At first glance, "Blood and Black Lace" seems like just another bloody slasher movie. Well, giallo is to slasher movies as fine cheese is to Velveeta, and "Blood and Black Lace" is a perfect example of a giallo, with the arty lighting, graphic violence, colourful sets, and of course those black gloved hands.   The plot is a pretty straightforward whodunnit -- it's not blatantly obvious who the killer is, but seasoned movie fans can probably guess. And while there are gruesome slayings, the killer doesn't just jump out and kill. Bava builds up the tension and fear (which the characters also demonstrate) until it's almost a relief when someone dies.  But one of the biggest necessities for a giallo is visual style. The fashion house is lushly palatial, and the murders are elaborately choreographed chases, with weird lighting and lots of luxurious surroundings. The second murder, for instant, is like hide-and-seek in an antiques store. The only problem is a misogynistic edge, such as when the women have their shirts ripped halfway off.  None of the characters really stand out much -- they're the Models, the Creepy Boyfriends, the Skeptical Police, the Weird Landlady, and a handful of others. So it's a credit to the actresses like Mary Arden and Eva Bartok that they are able to make us feel sorry for their characters.   "Blood and Black Lace" is a beautiful, bloody guilty pleasure, and a perfect example of a giallo horror movie. Good stuff 
 I've read only one other book of cowboy poetry so far (Cowboy Poetry:  The Reunion), and I enjoyed this one just as much as I did that one.  This book has more of the older poems by some cowboys who have long ago ridden off into the proverbial sunset, but also contains poems by some contemporary ranchers and cowhands.  What I like about this genre is that the folks who write the poetry are working ranchers, farmers, and cowboys.  Their poetry, therefore, is straightforward and rings true.  Reading some, you can almost taste the dust.  These folks have a hard life, yet one they love.  Yet they express themselves so beautifully that it sometimes brings a tear to my eye.  I'll take this kind of poetry over some of the weirdness you read in so-called literary magazines any day 
 There are a lot of different memory cards on the market for the PS2,but the official Sony 8mb memory card is by far the best card for your system.Unlike other memory cards available,this baby will not fail you.That means you can depend on it at all times.So to make a long story short,do yourself a favor and buy this ever-reliable memory card. 
 The original Broadway cast album of MY FAIR LADY is a mandatory disc in every self-respecting musical fan's collection.  It captures the cast at the top of their game, and Julie Andrews at the peak of her Broadway career.  Her voice is sparkling and effervescent, with Rex Harrison as a thrilling Higgins and Stanley Holloway a delight as Eliza's erstwhile father Alfred P. Doolittle.  The monaural sound is warm and lush in Columbia's best style.  This newest remaster of the album sounds better than ever.  By the time the London cast album was recorded 4 years later (to take advantage of the new stereo format), a tired feeling had crept into Julie Andrews' singing (or perhaps boredom), so the Broadway edition is the format of choice, despite the technical limitations of the mono mix 
 Instant messaging, instant cash, instant buying - all good, yes?  Sometimes.  Instant access might be the Trojan horse of modern life. The same online convenience that offers everything out there in cyberspace, and offers it instantly can also be the portal that invites savvy thieves into our lives where they will help themselves to our hard earned cash.  Sure, a smart consumer monitors credit card charges, checks online bank accounts, and buys from secure web sites while sending up a silent prayer that `https" really does guarantee a safe transaction. Document shredding has become a way of life as we fill trash bags with revealing bits of paper that could undo us in the wrong hands.  We may even check our credit reports now and then to be sure we stay on the plus side of the bottom line.  But even with all that, can we ever feel secure?  Not likely, suggests T.C. Boyle, in his novel "Talk, Talk."  He spins a story of identity theft by taking us into the life of Dana Halter, a deaf teacher who, in a routine traffic violation is arrested.  Apparently she is wanted for a laundry list of crimes, none of which she committed. It's hard enough sorting out this kind of mess as a hearing person and endlessly frustrating for a deaf person who must first get the attention of those in charge.    Dana's boyfriend, Bridger, tries to rescue her and quickly learns what we all suspect. In the hierarchy of compelling crimes, identity theft isn't at the top of anybody's list.  By the time he gets Dana released, she has been in the claustrophobic company of nasty street criminals for a few days and has nurtured a finely tuned sense of rage that fuels a relentless need for vengeance. She must find this lowlife who is walking in her hard earned shoes and doing in grand style.  Boyle knows conceits of modern life and strikes just the right balance between pathos and indignation.  We feel Dana's, frustration and want her to get this guy.  And when we meet him, (aka William "Peck" Wilson) we are astonished at his bravado and chameleon like ability to become someone else as effortlessly as we don on a new set of clothes. This guy knows how to live!  An ocean view condo; a beautiful Russian wife accustomed to the best of everything; a shiny Mercedes in the garage; gourmet food on the table, all these are his with a keystroke.  He learned the secrets of his trade in jail from a fellow inmate and they have done quite well for themselves - until now. With a little help from some shady friends, Dana and Bridger connect the dots and begin to develop an idea of their adversary.  Bridger gets lucky when he calls the cell phone number on an overdue bill with Dana's name on it.  They hit pay dirt.  The "other" Dana answers the phone and his practiced suspicion tells him it's time to relocate. He packs the Mercedes and they are off. Dana and Bridger follow in this cross-country quest fueled more by anger than common sense.  The chase is on, alternating between the naïvely determined Dana and Bridger, and the volatile Peck who still has friends in low places.  Along the way, we learn just enough about identify theft to know it can happen anytime, no matter how careful we are. Who wins in the end?  That depends on your idea of winning. But at the very least, you will want to check your bank balance with a tad bit more regularity.    
 This is a decent collection of song from Soul Asylum From 1993 (grave dancer's union) on. They could have drawn more heavy on the Grave Dancer's album which was by far their best seller, but chose to go with a mix from their last next two albums Let your dim Light shine and Candy from a stranger instead, and unfortunate.  Although the songs are good, Many fans feel ripped off because their favorite are off of grave dancer are not included. Also, Although A&M re-released some of the Twintone/restless back catalog, about 4 or 5 albums total before grave dancer, they did not include any of that material.  This year though they did release their best of Soul Asylum, the twintone years ,which has the earlier recordings from Soul Asylum previous released first by twintone and next in 1991 by Restless, then a few by A&M.  But, despite this album missing pieces, a good one for the collection, and not that expensive on Amazon 
  "The Corrections" ,although often times comedic, is a discourse on the tragic emptiness of modern life.  We see an ordinary family dealing with the situation which modern society has handed them, that is, the renouncement of all social traditions and the emphasizing of the individual's sense of pain and pleasure as the measure of all morality.  What we see are not morally awakened individuals, but rather, a collection of confused young people who have no moral basis for denying themselves pleasure for the happiness of another human being, in particular, their elderly sick parents.  I have a great interest in the moral collapse of modern society.  I discuss this topic at my website http://moralvacuum.blogspot.com     Although I found this book to be very well written (but occasionally pretentious) and to contain several powerful messages, I did not see where the conclusion explained how the fate of the principal characters corrected their lives.  The author implied that such was the case but I don't think he resolved in his own mind how they could be redeemed.  His power lies in his ability to describe their desperation not their successes.   
 This book is about opiate addiction and the author (William Burroughs) was an ex addict. Being I'm an ex heroin addict...it was interesting to me.   Also, my father (Don Swaim) interviewed William Burroughs, when my father worked at C.B.S radio and had a show called "Book Beat."   (...)   In closing,  Although the book is dated, it held my interest and it is a must for any William Burroughs fans.   D. David Swai 
 This was a very compelling book.  I really enjoyed it - still thinking about it............................  
 Most of the stories in this collection read well on their own, but when read as one collection, they can begin to seem redundant. The themes "Dublin is dirty," "The city is oppressive and creates paralysis," "The church is oppressive," "England is oppressive," etc. can get repetitive, especially in the middle of the book. It's better to pay attention to the characters than to the themes and plots once you've gotten Joyce's point.  My favorite stories, and those that stand out as being the strongest on their own, are "The Sisters," "An Encounter," "Araby," "Eveline," "The Boarding House," "Clay," "Ivy Day in the Committee Room," "A Mother," and, of course, "The Dead." I've read "The Dead" several times on my own and in at least three English classes over the last several years, and every time I love it even more. The first time I read it I was a freshman in High School and hated it, because I didn't understand the point at all--it seemed to me that the story was really "about" Michael Furey and Gretta, so why were the first 50 pages even necessary? Now that I've read it in classes that focus on Irish culture and history and Joyce's literary aims, I really understand how invaluable it is. It's wonderfully written, powerfully sad, and that famous ending is just so ambiguous that you can read it again and again and never get tired of it 
 Despite the plethora of books on this subject it's hard to find one that's any good, i.e., helpful. There are traditional books with a lot of Sanscrit, which provide little useful guidance. There are a tons of oversimplfied new-agey books designed to make the reader feel good about themselves.  While the perfect book isn't there, I like this book a lot because it seems to be authentic, because it seems to come from the author's experience, rather than copying others and it strikes a balance between the other two extremes. It could have a little more specific information on the chakras and how to directly experience them, but if the readers get follow the exercises, will be lead to Higher things.   Progress with his system will require Work, and that means Work upon yourself. Not just reading. Not just intellectual understanding. Mr Sherwood gives out a lot of useful practical suggestions. It is fear that keeps most people from development, fear of the unknown, superstitution...   It does not bother me, as is mentioned in other reviews, if the author is eclectic and was, at some point a Pentecostal minister. Who cares?  I'm eclectic myself, truth is found in many places. Many authors (and readers) will come from other traditions. Properly understood, these ideas don't confict with the practice of Christianity (or Islam, or Judaism, Taoism, Buddhism or any other religion). There is one God. Factional literalists and fundamentalists (of all religions) squable over doctrinal religious differences and this keeps them fighting on the lower part of the mountain.  The mystical traditions of all the world's great religions  eventually converge with the experience of something Higher, at the Top.    Be careful with the Pranayama. 
 Jennings catalog has seen its share of reissues, in both original albums and anthologies, but never before has a box set captured the full story of his career. Reissues of original albums have told Jennings' story in bits and pieces, single-disc anthologies have cherry-picked the chart highlights, and Bear Family's import box sets "Destiny's Child" and "Six Strings Away" have laboriously cataloged the details of his pre-outlaw career. But with the release of this beautifully produced 4-CD collection, RCA provides both depth and breadth, essaying Jennings transition from a protégé of Buddy Holly to purveyor of folk- and country-rock hybrids to increasingly uncomfortable Nashville cat to rebel immortality and self-direction. Jennings' transformation is highly personal yet shared out loud with his audience; and especially visceral when condensed from thirty-seven years of individual albums to a four-disc box-set.   The earliest side here, one of three cut under the direction of Holly in 1958, is a version of the Cajun classic "Jole Blon" featuring a '50s-styled sax and a waltz-time saunter. The collection's second track, "My Baby Walks All Over Me," dates to Jennings' initial early '60s residency in Arizona, with Ray Corbin's twangy lead guitar retaining the sort of energy laid down by James Burton on early tracks by Ricky Nelson. Next, the set jump-cuts to Jennings mid-60s beginnings at RCA where the sound was more polished (and in stereo), the jumpier tempos had relaxed to a cantor, and Jennings voice turned to an earthy croon.  Jennings' enduring legacy was minted by his fight for artistic independence in the early-70s, but his initial RCA sides are just as worthy as his outlaw breakthrough. He may have felt constricted by RCA's factory song construction, but the results included some of his most endearing sides, including "Stop the World and Let Me Off," "(That's What You Get) For Lovin' Me," "Mental Revenge," "Only Daddy That'll Walk the Line," and "Brown Eyed Handsome Man." Even with Chet Atkins' and a studio full of Nashville A-listers smoothing the background, Jennings gravitas carried every single.  The late-60s original "Just to Satisfy You" shows Jennings at the peak of his pre-outlaw period, with a stripped down arrangement and lightly jazzed beat accompanying his commanding baritone. Ironically, it was an earlier, more raw recording of this same song that had brought the Jennings to RCA's attention several years earlier. Lesser remembered treats from this era include a hit duet with Anita Carter on "I Got You," a soulful duet with Jessi Colter on her "I Ain't the One," and the title track to the American International Pictures film "Nashville Rebel." The latter, recorded in 1966 by Harlan Howard, was tremendously prophetic, with lines like "I've got things to do, and things to say in my own way."  By the end of the decade, the Nashville system - writers, producers, studios and session musicians all supplied by the label - left Jennings unfulfilled. He did indeed have things to say in his own way, and that included a broader choice of writers and recording venues, and most importantly, the familiarity and warmth of recording with his road band. RCA's way of doing things wasn't producing the commercial success he felt he could achieve, and so Jennings found himself compromised both artistically and financially.  The end of the '60s provided the circumstances for Jennings to make a change. He'd grown increasingly uncomfortable with RCA's cookie-cutter style, married Jessi Colter (his third and lasting marriage), and been given time to think by a bout of hepatitis that temporarily ended his touring. Willie Nelson had decamped to Austin with similar thoughts of independence, and Jennings longtime drummer Richie Albright suggested that they push for the sort of artistic freedoms afforded RCA's rock acts. By mid-decade, Jennings had released the successful "Honky Tonk Heroes" and "Ladies Love Outlaws" LPs, and with his RCA contract up for renewal, he held a strong hand.  By the tail-end of his initial contract he'd already begun to wrest control of his recordings away from RCA. 1972's slowed-down take of Buck Owens' "Under Your Spell Again" is sung as a duet with Colter, a pair of tracks from "Lonesome On'ry and Mean" features Jennings' roadband, and a co-producer credit on "You Can Have Her" pointed to the following year's independence day. Jennings hired himself a New York City manager and gained the desired concessions in re-signing with RCA. He was now free to record what he wanted how he wanted and with who he wanted to play and produce.  The initial fruit of this new-found freedom was 1973's legendary "Honky Tonk Heroes" LP. Jennings co-produced with Tompall Glaser and recorded an album of songs by Nashville-outsider Billy Joe Shaver. The album's title track begins in tribute to Jimmie Rodgers before segueing to a twangy guitar-and-drums sound that hadn't much been heard in Nashville. The stripped-down arrangements have a more live feel than anything Jennings had recorded before, and Shaver's songs were fresh and direct.  To further insulate himself from label pressures, Jennings moved his recording sessions from RCA to Tompall Glaser's independent studio, subsequently dubbed "Hillbilly Central." The initial LP from this arrangement, "This Time," gave Jennings his first #1 single with its title track. Thus began a streak of spectacular albums, including "The Ramblin' Man," "Dreaming My Dreams" and "Are You Ready for the Country," and a string of iconic hits that included "I'm a Ramblin' Man," "Rainy Day Woman," "Amanda," and "Are You Sure Hank Done it This Way." Jennings toured extensively with this material, and disc 3 opens with a trio of cuts (from 1974's "Waylon Live") that shows off his towering talent as a stage performer.  Jennings fame crossed over to the pop charts with "Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys," and his involvement with "The Dukes of Hazzard" brought his theme song and narration to televisions nationwide. His albums of the early '80s continued to track new ground, and his singles, including duets with Willie Nelson, and covers of Otis Redding, Little Richard and Eagles hits, kept him on the upper-reaches of the charts.  In the mid-80s Jennings recorded an album with Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson as The Highwaymen and moved his solo career from RCA to MCA. At MCA, producer Jimmy Bowen crafted a decidedly more modern sound (gone is the steel, in is subtle synthesizer), but Jennings still sounds great, and the material is well chosen. A 1990 move to Epic yielded the top-10 "Wrong" before diabetes and carpal tunnel syndrome slowed Jennings work. A few more albums for indie labels (not anthologized here) found his artistic flame undimmed. The collection closes with the well-chosen, "I Do Believe," from 1995's reunion of The Highwaymen. Jennings song is resolutely independent, yet faithful, as had been his entire career.  Completists will note a few omissions (nothing from his lackluster stint with A&M is included, nor is the Grammy® winning take of "MacArthur Park"), and fans may miss a few favorite album tracks, but that isn't the purpose of this set. Further, this isn't filled with rarities and alternate takes; again, that's not the point of this box. Instead, these 92 selections paint the full picture of Jennings artistic arc, from proto-rock 'n' roller, to industry man, to his own man. Across four discs, Jennings talent can't be denied, whether singing within the confines of Nashville's system, or flung wide-open to his personal interpretation.  Lenny Kaye's introductory essay is written as both a friend and biographer, filled with warm remembrances and penetrating insights. Rich Kienzle's liner notes provide detail on Jennings' career, recording the pivotal moments that created these recordings. This is a superb introduction to Jennings' career, and a wonderfully listenable condensation for fans. [©2006 redtunictroll at hotmail dot com 
 If you trully want to understand geophysical fluid dynamics (ocean/atmosphere) you can not avoid this great book. I strongly suggest it, specially if you are a graduate student going through a GFD course. Years from now you will still go back to Pedlosky to clarify your doubts 
 Momentary lapses in judgement can destroy lives. Truck driver, Derek Morrison, found out the hard way.  For Robert Whitney revenge seems to be the best punishment for Derek's lapse in judgement.  This book is what I consider edgy fiction about when hatred and revenge gets a tight rein  and causes a normal person to go off the deep end.  Mr. Reaves weaves a masterful plot with a message that can change your life completely.  This would make a great movie - plenty of action, a little romance and a lot of intrigue. I read it in one sitting (with a few minor breaks 
 Excellent manual. Comprehensive and has great index for finding topics. Recommended for all farmers, ranchers, vets 
 Prestowitz takes a wide view of globalization as he chronicles the shift of power and wealth in the world. Tracing the old trade routes of China through Europe to America and now back through China and India, he traces the course of economic progress through industrialization to modern technologies and development. At one time, China was the leading economic power in the world. If "Three Billion New Capitalists" is correct, the sleeping giant may finally be stirred to take that place once again.  And China is not alone. India with its technology backbone is right behind and likely to outgrow China in the years to come. In addition, the European Union, as well as South and Central America, continue to grow and contend for leadership in various markets.  There is a shift of power and wealth in the world. And the key to properly predicting its course lies in properly discerning the flow of capital. At the moment, capital is being redirected from the hostile West and to increasingly capitalistic Eastern countries engaged in manufacturing, production, research, and service-based enterprises. The ramifications of this trend will be felt in the politics, economies, and cultures of the whole world; especially in America.  Prestowitz feels there is an absence of central planning, discipline, strategy and focus in the United States; a lack of public policy on global economic strategy. He believes this could very well lead to her decline. He fears that a lack of central planning leaves America vulnerable to lobbyists and foreign policymakers.  Some capitalists would disagree with Prestowitz and counter that the unseen hand of market forces is the invisible genius of America and of all free markets. Capitalism works properly and powerfully in the absence of governmental policymakers and flourishes in the unhindered decisions of a free marketplace.   In either case, "Three Billion New Capitalists" is an eye-opening, thought-provoking book which commands respect and attention. One thing is for certain, the world; it is changing...and it will never be the same. 
 Barrett Browning's sonnet sequence is far from the sloppy, sentimental doggerel it has been made out to be. Instead, the poems examinge Barrett Browning's guilt over her brother's death, her awakening passion for Robert  Browning, and her fear of an inability to love. If one looks very closely  at these poems, what appears is not a tribute to Browning, but in fact a  brilliant woman's realization that her life has been totally sterile, and  that she has now been placed in the precarious position of having to make  choices that will alter the course of her life. Tehcnically, the poems are  brilliant; written with all of Barrett Browning's characteristic blend of  caution and verve 
 This book provides a great overview of the developing technolgies in digital design and fabrication.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a comprehensive study in the current trends in digital architecture.  A series of 20+ articles by designers working in this area of architecture, this book updates the conversation to what is happening today and what is being projected in the future.  Great resource 
 This is my first book review and, WOW! did I pick a great one to start off with.  You'll have to pardon me if I'm over-enthusiastic with my praise, but I'm telling it as it is.  From page one, I totally related to this lady (Caroline Knapp), from the time she was 'just thinking' about getting a dog, to going to the Dog pound to 'just look', to 'should I adopt or not?' to 'well, maybe' to finally getting the pooch.  I think I even got the same Mutt breed that she adopted. The Pound informed me that my Sara was a GSD/Mix. Ms Knapp adopted a Shepherd/Mix. She says this is Dog Pound code for "We really don't know."  I became so engrossed with the human/dog connection we have with our soul mates, that I looked Caroline Knapp up on GOOGLE.  Sad, it is to say, I found out that she died of cancer at the age of 42.  Her loyal companion, Lucille, was there at her bedside, faithful to the end.    
 I don't recommend this book to the mosquito lovers of the world.  If you've a soft place in your heart for those buzzing swarming little blood-sucking fiends, you probably shouldn't peruse this particular book.  HOWEVER.  If you happen to enjoy a good "why" story from Africa, you could hardly do better than the lushly illustrated "Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears".    In a kind of Chicken Little series of events, a lying mosquito sets off a chain reaction ending, ultimately, in the sun no longer rising.  When the animals of the forest slowly track down the reasons behind the sun's disappearance, they eventually reach the conclusion that mosquito is the one to blame.  Ever since, mosquitoes will sometimes ask people whether or not "everyone" is still angry at them.  The answer is a satisfying (I love this descriptive sound) KPAO!  The illustrations are splendid.  During the day they are set against a white background.  By the time the sun disappears, they pop out of a black setting.  Kids will like finding the small smiling pink bird that cleverly pops up in every scene.  It's a fine fine text that bears more than a passing resemblance at times to the classic nursery rhyme "The House the Jack Built".  And who knew that the sound lions make when they laugh is "Nge nge nge"?  Not I, said the fly.  A lovely read 
 The pool holds plenty of water and is colorful and inviting for the kids!  The padding on the bottom is especially nice to cushion harder surfaces.  Granted--a lot of inflation was needed, but we also bought the hand pump and that did the job (and gave us some exercise--but it did not wear us out--and we're grandparents)!  I found the plug drain in the bottom no problem at all.  We pulled the plug and came back later and all that was left was a little puddle in one corner. The height of the sides was great, but I would have liked it a little longer in length.  Bottom line--this was a great buy! 
 The Hottentot Venus exhibit--promising to present a rare African woman from the Hottentot region for public view--opened in London in 1810 to an expectant audience waiting to see the new curiosity otherwise known as Saartjie ("Saar-key") Baartman. Saartjie's skills as a performer combined with her particularly large buttocks and allusions to her supposedly extended labia only added to the exhibit's appeal to rich (white) Londoners.  According to Rachel Holmes, author of "African Queen: The Real Life of the Hottentot Venus," Saartjie Baartman is one of South Africa's most widely known historical figures. Everyone in South Africa knows Saartjie's name and story.   Born in 1789, Saartjie was illegally transported to England by her master Hendrik Cesars, a free black, and Cesar's employer military doctor Alexander Dunlop. Once in London, Saartjie debuted as the Hottentot Venus. Singing and dancing and generally exhibiting herself in "tribal" attire before fashionable Londoners in the audience, Saartjie was, Holmes writes, "got up like a fetish and a showgirl." It also helped that Lord Granville, a well-known politician of the time, had a large posterior similar to Saartjie's. Thanks to this combination of otherness and entertainment disguised as scientific curiosity, Saartjie became England's most well known black entertainer of her time.   Her fame covered the darker fact that Saartjie was "literally a scientific object," Holmes said. This fact was painfully obvious after her death in 1815 when renowned French scientist Georges Cuvier supervised Saartjie's dissection. Her skeleton, brain, genitals and full plaster casts of her body remained in the collection of Paris' Museum of Natural History until 2002 when they were returned to South Africa for a proper burial.  In the 189 years between her death and burial, Holmes says, Saartjie became a "living ancestor" in South Africa, "a representative figure in the struggle for women's equality in South Africa." This book tells all of the story, the glamorous and dark aspects of Saartjie's life. The prose flows well and is written simply, making the book a quick and informative read.  When Holmes came to Saartjie's story she "literally had bare bones" and a variety of scientific documents from which to start her research. Unable to read or write, Saartjie was in many ways a slave during her years of performing. While many offered theories on how Saartjie must feel (abolitionists tried to persuade her to attend bible school and return to Africa; Saartjie refused in favor of promised wages and return passage at the end of six years abroad), "no one asked for her opinion." Holmes does a good job here of imagining what Saartjie might have said if asked. The book includes a lot of inference on Holmes' part, but not enough to make the story ring untrue.  "African Queen" is Holmes' second biographical work (her first was "Scanty Particulars," which tells the story of James Barry--a British doctor who was likely a woman, or hermaphrodite, living as a man). Holmes says that she chooses to write historical and biographical works because "truth is always more curious than fiction."   She also felt compelled to tell the stories of those who did not have a hand in writing history, namely the people who were not privileged, literate or otherwise empowered during their lives. These ideas of fact and fiction converged when Apartheid ended in South Africa, giving citizens the opportunity to "uncover our history and unravel the fictions that were sold as reality," Holmes says.  Writing "African Queen" took five years, including extensive research in South Africa and Europe. When asked how she found all of her material--describing the experiences of a woman who was never interviewed and who left behind no personal writings--Holmes said, "If you work hard enough you can go back two hundred years. You can find the information. 
 If you have ever heard of the Kelly Criteria for position-sizing, or wondered if Optimal F is a good way to manage risk, this book is for you. In a narrative, story-telling style that is much easier reading than a mathematical, economic, or statistical textbook, the author covers a whole range of interesting and informative theories that are relevant to trading and investing.  Knowing that a trader who uses the Kelly Formula to maximize return always has a 50% chance of losing 50% (or X% chance of losing (100-X)% generally) of their capital may be an eye-opener for many traders. Although this book will not tell you how to make money trading, it will generate more than a handful of useful areas of research, and get you thinking about risk management rather than entry signals.  Covering a multitude of financial, economic, and mathematical geniuses, this book has many interesting side-stories and anecdotes that are amusing, interesting and thought-provoking. The majority of this book is not strictly about trading, but all of the ideas have some application to trading and investing if you think hard and long enough 
 It's time to search the living room couch for change. Brown weaves a black comedy of traditional tunes and Burnside originals, wailing through the blissfully offensive vocals and taking the Mississippi blues back to the glory days of Vox amplifiers and stainless-steel microphones. Kenny learned at a young age to play from the best, spending many of the years in his childhood under the tutelage of Legends such as Joe Calicott (He cut classes at age 9 to receive guitar lessons from Calicott), Johnny Woods and Mississippi Fred McDowell. His slide is raw and furious with determination, tearing through your speakers in conjunction with his arterial wail. After a quarter-century of touring alongside R.L. Burnside, Kenny Brown is back on the road now with R.L's grandson and drummer Cedric, forming the former half of the duo Brown & Burnside. They are currently touring with the Fat Possum Mississippi Juke Joint Caravan; featuring Paul "Wine" Jones, and T-Model Ford 
 The temptations are my favourite band ever...and this is their best album...You just can't deny songs like "My Girl"...which is in my opinion the best song ever...I recommend this album for any SOUL music fan 
 These are the best diapers I have used. They are soft, flexible, and easily adjustable for a good secure fit. They hold leaks extremely well. Of course leaks do occur (why wouldn't they if your baby has, say for example, 4 explosive poops in the course of 5 minutes....it's happened), however this is to be expected. They do not occur regularly and the diapers are not saggy, but fit very snuggly which provides for good protection. I HIGHLY recommend these 
 First of all, to all of the reviewers who complain that Kinsey Millhone is stuck in the 1980's, so what?  Use a little imagination.  Who cares if she doesn't have a cell phone, a computer, or access to high-tech equipment?  I think the stories are more interesting since she has to rely on good old-fashioned brain power and persistence!   Should radio stations stop playing music from the 1980's?  Should TV channels stop showing movies from the 1980's?  Why should Sue Grafton stop writing about a character who lives in the 1980's?  "S is for Silence" captured my interest as much as any of the previous books in the series and I like that Grafton employed a different style.  The ending leaves the readers thinking and that's a good thing, right?  
 Adam, Ethan, and Ryan have everything they want in life with the exception of one thing - a woman who will complete them.  They've planned and dreamed of the day they'd finally find a woman who incites the passion in all three of them and is strong enough to love and accept each in return.  They'd just about lost hope until Adam trudged out to get the mail and finds Holly laying unconscious in the snow only yards from their home.  Holly is running from the man she married.  She's been running scared since her wedding night when she saw her new husband commit murder.   She was still running when her car broke down at the base of a mountain where the Colter brothers hunting lodge sits.  She'd walked to their lodge, but lost consciousness before reaching the door.  Next thing she knows, she's buck naked in a bathtub full of warm water with a gorgeous man standing over her.  As if that isn't enough of a shock to a girl's system, there are two more men waiting in another room and all three of them want to keep her - forever.  The Colter brothers agree that Holly is everything they want in the woman who will become their wife, lover, and eventually the mother of their children.  Convincing her that they're serious about wanting her to stay is going to be a bit trickier than any of them anticipated.  Holly is determined to keep running.  Not only is her husband a dangerous man, but she's also confused by her own desires for Adam, Ethan, and Ryan.  Being so turned on by all three men at the same time makes her a whore, doesn't it?   The brothers are going to have to do some serious explaining about their intentions toward her and why her attraction to all of them is acceptable and even desired.  Helping her to get a divorce as quickly as possible is imperative, but not nearly as important as keeping her safe from the man who wants nothing more than to see her dead.   Maya Banks COLTERS' WOMAN is an awesome story full of emotional turmoil, hot sweaty sex, and enough suspense to keep readers anxiously reading through each scene with bated breath.  Adam, Ethan, and Ryan each have vastly different personalities and needs.  Holly is faced with the prospect of trying to figure out their quirks and how best to deal with each man.  It's a bit overwhelming but she's up to the task.  This book is chock full of scenes that will have you close to tears one minute and laughing out loud, all while chewing anxiously on your fingernails.  The emotional bond that develops between the Colter brothers and Holly is a key factor throughout the story and readers won't soon forget any of these wonderful characters.  Beautiful job, Maya!  You've more than fulfilled my expectations with this endearing tale.  Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)  
 My daughter is crazy for Oxenbury's babies.  The illustrations and text are a perfect marriage for toddlers.  They can relate to the simple, every day message Tickle, Tickle relates..."gently, gently brush your  hair".  My daughter's favorite part is "tickle, tickle under  there" when she gets a HUGE tickle from her dad or me.  a must read 
 Coolio's "Gangsta's Paradise" is most well-known for having the hit single of the same name, and even though that's obviously the best track here, the rest of it holds up pretty well. Some of the songs are bad, yes (see "Kinda High Kinda Drunk"), but there's enough good and decent ones here to warrant a "4" star rating (the amount of songs here help things out, too). Coolio is indeed one of the most unique rappers in the business - at least when it comes to his voice. I admittedly don't have a great amount of knowledge in terms of MCs, but I still haven't heard anyone who sounds like Coolio. While his voice and delivery are pretty good, it unfortunately sounds a bit pop-oriented when the lyrics are discussing the gangster life (again, see the title track). This isn't a horrible problem, but it's noticable - he doesn't quite seem to fit in with what he's rapping about. Musically the album is pretty much based on Dr. Dre's g-funk sound, and the production is pretty good, if not a little dated sounding - I don't think it'll cause any problems. Basically, if you like rap or if you liked his hit "Gangsta's Paradise" and wanted to hear more Coolio songs then "Gangsta's Paradise" will satisfy you, just not greatly. Recommended.  Highlights include: "That's How It Is" "Gangsta's Paradise" "A Thing Goin' On" the rest are mostly good or decen 
 This book was really fun! What I learned from this book is about the tomb robbers. And that Egypt is in Africa.  Elizabeth 7 years old.    
 This book stutters awkwardly through a strange, nails-to-chalkboard, rambling story.  The characters are jaded, disgusting and destructive.  The language is coarse and simple.  It is simply one of the most brilliant pieces of writing this generation has seen.  Chuck shoves his finger up grammar's *** with no apology.  Beautiful.  Original.  Viscerally satisfying.  Read it for the carnal thrill.  Or the literary genius.  Or the clever social commentary.  Or better yet, all three.  Think Picasso.  It's that good 
 Most people doesn't realize that this band SUCK'S!!!! I AM a "HARD-CORE ROCKER FAN" but please!! Is not because this band doesn't know how to play music or is fictional, is beacause it suck's!!   The reason that Spinal Tap suck's is because of their bloopers in live-concert and most of all THEIR STUPID LYRICS!!!!!  I mean: "YOU KNOW WHAT I NEED, OR MAYBE YOU DON'T!!!!!??????" "LISEN, SHHHHH!! WHAT THE FLOWER PEOPLE SAY AAAAAHHHHH!!!!!?????" "THE CATS MEOW!!!???" "SEX FARM WOMAN!!!???" "BIG BUTTON!!!!??" "I JUST WANT TO MAKE SOME EARDRUMS BLEED!!!!????"  COME ON! PEOPLE!!!! Try to realize why this movie is sooo funny! BEACUSE ALL THE PEOPLE LIKE A BAND THAT IS PURE GARBAGE!!!!!! But don't get me wrong! I did enjoy this movie(documentary really) because is a parody of the rock bands in the 60's, 70's and early 80's. And their music is LOUD, FAST and HEAVY!!!  Adios.             
 This CD is great.  Songs are catchy and you want to sing them at the top of your lungs.  Lyrics are amazing.  Sound like the beatles but more contemporary.  If you haven't checked this band out you definitely should.  Live shows are extremely energetic and entertaining 
 I am a serious Dean Koontz fan and I never knew it at the time but I lived a short distance from him in Laguna Nigel Ca. I enjoyed this book so much I have purchased this and Life Expectancy for my daughter as a gift. I recommend them every chance I get and those that have taken the suggestion, seemed to enjoy them as much as I did. This book is fiction at it's very best 
 This is actually a well plotted, scary horror film. The opening credits of children singing while a camera roles through a dark corn field tells you that your in for a treat. It starts out when a group of foster parents are found badly decayed in a celler. Now, the cult of evil children are up for addoption! With satanic plans on there minds, they must be stopped soon before another massacre of adults befalls the isollated town. When elders who know of the evil inside the children speak up the children go on a mission to convert any new child in the area, and kill any adults who get in their path. Can a boy and his father stop them before they reach their goal? Featuring great effects and scary suspence. 
 This novel was so utterly absorbing I scarcely noticed that I was on a plane and in airports the entire time I was reading it -- the time flew (as did I).  The first thing that struck me was the language: beautiful and sufficiently archaic to invoke the 17th Century, without being incomprehensible.  The second thing I loved about the book was the abundance of vivid historical information, researched in marvelous detail, about everything from lead mining and commerce, medical theories and herbalism, to comparative religion.  Some of the plot developments were so extreme that, despite often being moved, I occasionally felt a bit of ironic distance from the narrative, but overall I was fully engaged and just devoured this book and am currently enjoying Ms. Brooks' Civil War novel, "March." 
 A challenging aspect with absorbing great literature plays is to find out why the title was named so, whether the title is hidden metaphorically or literally visible.   The title for Miller's first successful play, and not as well-knows as Death of a Salesman, derives from a line "they were all my sons", when the main character, Joe Keller, refers to the twenty-one P40 pilots killed because his company knowingly shipped out cracked cylinder heads.     Although sent to prison for 14 months, he was exonerated, because he shifted the blame to his worker, Herb Deever, who still sits in prison.     The emotional drama is lengthy and considered in the book series Best American Plays from 1945-1951 edited by John Gassner.  The themes run gamut from family, employment, greed, betrayal, denial, lies, anguish and most of all, responsibility.  The plot evolves, a twist here, and a  turn there!  Pain, sorrow and confusion permeate the mood.  And like Miller's plays, there are lengthy emotional monologues.    Set in the back yard of a home in an American town, it takes place in one long night and it opens with family keeps remarking on the tree planted for their 27 year-old son Larry, missing-in-action  for 2 years, and some presume him dead.  The broken tree keeps popping up throughout conversations as it is symbolic of the demise of the family.    The night the tree breaks, the chain of action begins.  Larry's girlfriend Anne is expected to come back to town, but now, she is about to marry Chris Keller, the other brother.  The tension & conflict arises because, once childhood neighbors to the Kellers, Anne and her brother, George, now an attorney, are the children of the man, Herb Deever, the one who was forced to take the blame for the death of twenty-one pilots.    Like most plays, they are always better than the movie versions, (if any).  If you see an exact play performed, then it is worth it. ......But the books are always better....MzRizz  
 I am a fan of Jack Trimpey's.  However, even I was a little put off by his anti-AA comments initially.  I turned around, though, when I learned more.  Those anti-AA comments are necessary for those of us in the public who haven't learned the truth about AA yet.  And, it's impossible to learn the truth because schools, courts, television, articles, and "experts", seem to all spew the same party line. . . that AA is the "only way" and that AA is successful.    In fact, AA is not the only way to be successful, and all of the studies that has been done over the years have proven that alcoholism is NOT a disease and that AA and 12 step treatment is absolutely NOT successful.  In fact, there have been studies that prove those that quit drinking using AA are LESS successful than those that quit without AA.  So, to the reviewer who passes on the erroneous information that AA has a proven track record, the truth is that AA does NOT have a proven track record. Or, to be more concise, their proven track record is that it doesn't work for 95% or MORE of the people that try it.  Some evidence has shown that it's actually DETRIMENTAL to those trying to quit drinking.  And, evidence has shown MORE people are successful on their own.  Furthermore, those that try and "recover" with AA-- who have been indoctrinated with the AA philosophy (pure folkwisdom) have a MORE difficult time moderating or abstaining than those who haven't been brainwashed into believing they ar powerless and have no control over their addictions.  For a more comprehensive look at this, look at The Truth About Addiction and Recovery, by Stanton Peele.  Peele doesn't share his opinions only, he shares his opinions based on the results of many many studies done over the past decades. . . even the studies that AA quotes as proof for the disease model.  Peele gives the entire story and sources it thoroughly.  Go do a search with the words "aa cult" and read what you come up with.  AA is indocrination, pure and simple.  It's not a quit drinking program.  And, unfortunately, those schools that introduce 12step programs, court officials, television shows, articles, and "experts" either don't know the truth or have a hidden agenda (like the massive money poured into treatment centers that have been scientifically proven not to be successful).  My point is, somebody has to speak the truth and I completely respect Trimpey for doing so.   AVRT works and it's SIMPLE.  Trimpey's correct.  Make the decision to quit, do it, and go work on your life if you need to. If you have anger problems while you're drinking, you might have anger problems when you quit.  But, at least your mind will be clear from the alcohol and you will be actually able to WORK on those anger problems.    Or, end up in neverending "recovery"-- only socializing with other addicts and self-professed sick people.  WHich makes more sense? Surrounding yourself with others that profess to be sick and need the comfort of other sick people for daily meetings for decades? Or, does it make more sense to take charge of your life and  live in a healthy balanced way while surrounding yourself with others that live balanced and healthy lives?  The absolute only fault I have with this book is that, despite the fact Trimpey does not accept the disease-model of alcoholism as a disease, he firmly believes one can never drink again.  In fact, studies have proven that many have successfully moderately drank again although they once struggled with addiction.  Once the addiction is conquered, it's conquered. In theory, then, one could moderately drink sometime in the future.  As a matter of fact, it has been also shown that those who DO drink moderately in the future are, in fact, more well-adjusted than those that permanently abstain or drink too much.  This is really a small issue, though.  Conquer the addiction and improve your life 
 If you are a serious cross country skier, and you own a computer,  then  you have to have this CD-ROM.  Simply speaking there is nothing like it on  the market, and it will make you a better skier 
 What Peter Frampton did with with "Frampton Comes Alive", Johnny Cash accomplished a few years earlier with "Live At San Quentin". It takes place in a hell-hole prison, so to say you have an attentive audience is an understatement. Everytime John scratched, talked, sang or twanged a guitar, this audience went up in flames. This crowd is all but up on the stage during this recording and you can hear them loud and clear. The late 60's and early 70's was Johnnys period of total convidence. Not just with his music but with his political views. The "Man in Black" thing was getting explained in clear detail. Not a popular thing to do for what was then still considered "ol boy country". You listen to "Live" and you are certain a riot is damn near ready to break out. Its that vivid. Excellent job in the mastering and mixing on the re-issues. THe audience is right there with John and crew. Not just some background noise and clapping after a tune is finished.  Johnny Cash was the toughest man in the game. All guts, no ego and pure talent. Compare it to the panty waist fluff and digital garbage that country music has mostly become in the 21st century you'll see what I mean.  Sure some is OK, but how many [..] and tight jeans does it take to make a country tune today?? Cash didnt need it for HIS music 
 This revealing book covers a highly charged and controversial period of American investment history. George P. Baker and George David Smith study the emergence of the investment house Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts (KKR), and follow it during the decade KKR ruled the world of leveraged buyouts. The authors begin with the early days when the partners worked together at Bear Stearns. They track the men as they build their own firm and create their own success. In clear, straightforward language, the book presents KKR's intentions and the economics of leveraged buyouts (LBOs). It discusses KKR's role in structuring and managing the deals. We [...] recommend this book as a must read for anyone interested in LBOs or the history of KKR. Executives at all levels will find the KKR saga interesting and useful 
 This is a good album and i guess you could say that 50 Cent bite Ja's formula. But hey, this is Ja at his best probably and has some good tunez depsite him tryna sound like Pac. Wit Ja you expect the ladies songs and singing in the chorus but he has he's gnagsta moments with Smokin' & Ridin' and So Much Pain. Ja Rule was never gonna make a classic but good album and worth gettin' even if u love 50. Haha  Top 5:  Smokin' & Ridin' Down Ass Bitch Livin' It Up X So Much Pai 
 . . . (and there is always a but), it is not for those whose ambitious beginnings fall to ruin at the thought of working towards their hobby goals. This book contains marvelous recipes, but one must want to make them quite a lot to search out a good portion of the ingredients. Perhaps my experience is singular, but my well-stocked natural food store had never seen witch hazel that was bottled pure and without accoutrements such as aloe. Other obstacles were present as I tried to gather necessary ingredients, and so my interest slowly waned. The book is, however, well written, concise, and with all the information needed to use it arranged neatly for easy reference. This woman knows her stuff. In the back of the book can be found a few reputable companies from which to mail-order your products if they are not readily available. Once again, this takes patience. One more word of caution: the book contains very few "food" recipes; that is, no "avacado and banana masks" or "pancake batter miracles." It is a book of traditional herbal extract or fresh herb recipes. I say this simply to make sure you buy the home beauty book you desire. So, in conclusion, if you are willing to work a bit more to have your homemade radiance and NOT eat it too, this is the book for you 
 This is a good book and would serve as a great reading requirement for a college Political Science 101- American Government course. However, that is about the level that this book is written at, people who are knowledgeable about the Consitituion and the Constitutional Convention may find this book lacking in information and ideas that are not obvious. Also, the book is rather short for a topic about which seemingly so much could have been written. I recommend the book as a good read and it offers a slightly different approach to discussion of the Constitution. College professors who teach introductory American Government courses should require that this book be read 
 I would strongly recommend this book for those who are starting out on the path of cooking, are looking at upgrading what Grandma gave to them, or are considering increasing their stable of cooking utencils.  Alton gives the reader the skinny on different implements, small appliances, and the tools needed to make that perfect quiche.  With his typical aplomb and humorous style he explains with science the whys and wherefores of how things work as they do.  Based on this book I've certainly grown to appreciate certain tools I've had for several years, thrown out some unused appliances and whatnot, and look at those television ads touting the latest and greatest slicing and dicing utencil with great skepticism.  Kudos to Alton for making an easy and fun to read book 
 "Leadership Wisdom from the World of the Wizards" should read "Leadership Wisdom from the Wise and Intuitive Perspective of Tom Morris" as, in many ways it's one and the same.  Tom writes with an energy that contains the kind of 'magic' that captivates and grabs hold of your imagination.  One can't wait to see the connections he weaves, creating magic in every day life.  If you integrate even a fraction of what you learn through his words, your world as you know it will be infinitely better and filled with a wealth of possibility 
 This book came highly recommended to me by a friend who works with children who have a variety of different special needs. She pointed out that it picks up where a lot of books about eating challenges and "picky eating" behaviors leave off, dealing with the child whose food repertoire may consist of two or three foods; and who may be facing significant physical/behavioral or other challenges that interfere with the process of eating.  I was immediately impressed by the book because it was so detailed and solutions-oriented. Not only do the authors present practical tips, ideas, and solutions that apply to specific situations: they include case studies that show how families can apply them. The book also includes helpful illustrations designed to help parents understand the postural control and other body exercises that are explained in the text. Highly recommended 
 The beats are dark & gritty which gives you a real good underground sound. Pharoahe & Prince Po are at the top of their game. Neither one MC outshines the other they are equally matched throughout the whole LP.The wordplay, flows, and lyricism along should make you consider this in your TOP TEN LIST.  
 Like most people, I love sugar, carbs (not the good ones) and just about every other ingredient that is brain toxic. When I first purchased this book, I was absolutely dreading changing my eating habits. But once I began eating according to Patrick Holford's recommendations, I noticed results immediately. Replacing fried foods with a nice salmon steak and veggies is not as hard as I had imagined!   This book is clearly written and has undoubtedly improved my life. To supplement eating right, I also joined a fitness club for the mind at Agogus.com - which is a great for your mental fitness. My mental clarity has increased dramatically, my memory has improved, and I am healthier mentally and physically. So, between eating brain-nourishing food and joining a club that literally works out my brain, I have never felt better - I recommend this lifestyle change to everyone! 
 Prince Carrick of the fae (farries) is cursed to live without his ladylove, the human Lady Gwen, until three people can fall in love.  The first is Aidan Gallagher, owner and operator of the local family pub, and keeper of his artistic absent-minded brother, and lovably shallow sister.  Jude Francis is an American ex-psych professor who wants to write a book on Irish fairy tales. She moves into her grandmother's cottage, the very one Lady Gwen dwelled in, and where her ghost still haunts.  Aidan is a very fatherly character but still tall, dark, and sexy. Jude was hard for me to relate to (I read this when I was only 20) as she's a little older than most romance heroines (other ones about her age and maturity are usually widows falling for their husband's best friend).  Roberts creates very believable sexual tension without blinding conflict, just uses human frailties to keep you guessing about the fate of Aidan and Jude, and she interweaves a masterful tale of Carrick and Gwen. The secondary characters are rich, the scenery beautiful, and the set up for the next two in the series (Tears of the Moon, Heart of the Sea) excellent.  A sure fire page turner for every romance fan, and another smooth tale for Nora Roberts' fans 
 This controller feels great in your hands.  In fact, after using this controller for awhile, my batteries went low and I had to switch back to the Dualshock controller.  The Dualshock felt wierd in my hands.  The response of the controller is good.  I have had the controller for a long time now and have not experienced any lag time.  One down side to the controller was that i returned two controllers because they has stopped working in a short period of time.  I guess the 3rd time is the charm because this one is working fine after almost a year 
 I am a very big Western fan, while this movie is entertaining I thought that it was a little short on action. But, if your a Tom Selleck and Sam Elliot fan (as i am) this is a wonderful addition to your western colletion 
 Especially at smug "artists," fatuous critics, and clueless collectors.  This book has a strong appeal for the little boy knows who knows there are many kings and queens running around buck naked 
 For those with a less-than-active lifestyle, this book will help you get started in weight training.  Great exercises are included 
 Other Amazon reviewers have done a great job of laying out the plot and the best features of "The Whole Wide World", so I just want to add my two cents worth. I really love this movie. It is such a touching story of two people who were in love but not able to be together. Vincent D'Onofrio breaks my heart every time I watch him in this movie. His character wants so badly to connect with Novalyn but he just can't. I cry every time!   I can't imagine that anyone would be disappointed after watching this film. It is beautifully written and filmed, and the sweetness and sadness really stays with you. Oh, and the front yard kiss between Robert and Novalyn - best screen kiss ever! I highly recommend "The Whole Wide World" 
 I agree with everything written below with one addition:  This cookbook  has photographs of each step as they are done which is very helpful to  follow along with the process.  In addition, it gives nifty ideas for how  to mix and match Japanese dishes to create a perfect meal capable of  impressing even the harshest critic 
 This is a very timely and insightful book. I have been waiting for this book for many years. Marianne has been able to put into very readable and meaningful terms the process of Art Journaling and it's benefits to the person using this process. The illustrations are exceptional and indicate with the examples that this is a process that works for many people. I have used it in my lifetime and am so happy to see it now in print and know that it will be very helpful for many people. It is great for personal insight and clarification as well as very helpful for professionals that are in the helping professions. This book will make a great gift for yourself and your loved ones. Be sure to buy this book 
 Prince's 1986 romantic comedy "Under the Cherry Moon" finally received the DVD treatment it deserved in the Summer of 2004. When the film was released, it was bombarded with bad reviews but this film is actually decent. Of course the music stands out but it actually succeeds as a comedy. The acting may be full of flaws but it's the 80's, what do you expect? Prince and Jerome Benton , from The Time, are gigolos living it up in South France and they come across a beautiful heiress (Kristin Scott Thomas) who happens to get her trust fund on her 21st birthday. They both woo her for the money but Prince ends up catching feelings for her. With a beautifully filmed movie and an incredible soundtrack, "Under the Cherry Moon" fails to disappoint 
 I first saw this being used in a hotel breakfast establishment in Sedona, AZ. The server gave me the name of the product and I ordered it from Amazon. This cuts bagels (right from the refrigerator also) with ease. You can even cut one using only one hand!!! It is totally safe because the blade is encased in hardened plastic. I just love it. Use it all the time. I highly recommend it 
 "Sister", as someone else previously mentioned, is comprehensive.  It combines the group's signature elements from their noise/spoken word roots with punk, garage rock, or whatever you like to call it.  This is definitely the place to start with SY's 80's repertoire; unlike Daydream Nation (certainly a monster itself) this record is concise.  I recommend this album to SY noobs and neophytes alike.  This album rocks from start to finish!  
 I am the only pumping mom in my office.  This book helped me feel not so alone.  I am determined to pump for the full first year and now I feel that I can do it more then ever.  I even joined the on-line forum to help get more support and ideas from other moms.  I would suggest this book to any mom who plans on pumping and working 
 The hours are long, the people you meet on the job tend to make you feel unwelcome, the amount of travel required for the job is mind-boggling, and the requisite decor is monotonous.  Such is the life--- ummm, such is the routine of Death, the anthropomorphic personification of the end of life.  An assistant would ease two of the shortcomings of the job and mitigate a third (sorry, even an assistant is no help with the decor issues), so Death takes on an apprentice.    Death's horse is pale, but is also named Binky.  Death likes cats.  Death is the only character to appear in every Discworld book.  Most enjoyable is how Death alternates between passionless competence in his domain, and mild neurosis regarding his self image and relationships.  Anyone, even Death, who thinks that an adolescent girl is easier to deal with than a younger child deserves what he gets, so Death has adopted a teenage girl.  And boy does Death create work for himself by taking on Mort as an apprentice to aid him and be a companion for his adopted adolescent daughter, Ysabell.  Hilarity ensues as Mort becomes romantically involved with a young woman who was one of his scheduled tasks, and we learn more about Death's servant Albert.  Pratchett begins to hit his stride in this book, although some later volumes backslide a little.  This volume shows the deftness and brilliance Pratchett is capable of in a well-flowing story.  Very enjoyable, but provides those twists on perpective that make Pratchett so much fun 
 Set during a lazy summer holiday alongside the New Zealand coast RAIN explores the dynamic relationship between mother and daughter. Thirteen-year-old Janey is entering adolescence when her primary role model, her mother, is frequently drunk and engaging in infidelity acts. Torn between swimming and fishing with her younger brother Jim and imitating her mother's actions Janey appears to have a duel persona throughout the film. While watching over Jim during one of her parent's loud music and booze parties Janey manages to sneak alcohol and cigs while spontaneously kissing boys. RAIN does an admirable job in exploring how Janey explores her new devious side influenced by her mother along with her devoted love to Jim. Unfortunately this DVD lacks any special features and as previously stated by another reviewer I fail to comprehend the significance of the title (or maybe I'm thinking too hard). Although a couple of the plot developments were predictable it didn't deter too much from my enjoyment of this film. RAIN is a worthwhile film as Janey's troubles easily transcend national borders and is relevant to both girls and women across the globe. Enjoy 
 One session of listening to Howard Shore's breathtaking score for LOTR--RETURN OF THE KING and you instantly appreciate why he was repeatedly nominated for an Oscar.  Sweeping orchestral pieces transport you to the epic battles fought, while softer instrumentals summon the characters' pains suffered and quiet triumphs obtained.  If you own the other 2 CDs in the series, this is a no brainer. If you don't, ironically, starting here gives you a taste of all 3 as Shore weaves together a final tapestry of the trilogy in an expert fashion 
 This is a particularly fine example of evangelical scholarship which also interacts with both Jewish and liberal scholarship in a significant way to produce a very usable commentary for both the specialist and the informed layman.    His work in the NICOT on Ezekial is heralded by many (Tremper Longman among them) as simply the best OT commentary in print.  The constraints in this series might be a bit more restrictive, but Block has managed to produce what is probably the best commentary on Judges available. (Lawson Younger's work in the NIVAC series is good too but the goal of that series is even more modest.)  Block's introductory material is almost worth the price of the book.  And the commentary portion, while working verse by verse, includes an awareness of the literary, poetic and narrative concerns.  He also shows an awareness of the text-critical issues when appropriate without getting bogged down, he always displays a high view of inspiration, and his footnotes are a wealth of information for the student wishing to go deeper and interact with scholarly sources.    The primary drawback to the commentary is that often after writing a page or two about one particular verse Block often fails to draw some fairly obivious conclusions on what the narrator is actually communicating.  For example, he spends nearly 2 pages on the place and person names of 4:2 and suggests various possibilities concerning the issue of how Jabin could oppress the Israelites from Hazor (which had recently been decimated by Joshua), and yet he does not draw any conclusions about the narrator's characterization of Israel's request for the Lord's help being due to political oppression (that is, rather than repentance. 
 It's working great.  It was pretty easy to put together, looks good, and works well.  A great value at around $50 
 All I can say is that if there is anyone who doesn't love this show after seeing it than we don't live on the same planet. This show inspired me to take Irish dancing. Now I've worked my way up to going to the world championships next year! In other words, it's a masterpeice. Personally I would give this 10 stars. There just is no comparison 
 I picked up a copy of Spirituality & Health a couple of years ago at a bookstore and sent in the subscription card right away.  This magazine is wonderful if you're looking for a magazine devoted to putting a spiritual perspective on life.  This magazine covers everything; mind, body, and spirit, the total package.  In the back there are also listings of upcoming events that the spiritually inclined may be interested in.  I highly recommend this magazine, as I always catch myself saying to someone, "I just read this awesome article in Spirituality & Health... 
  A great read with well-developed characters.  It's one of those books where you feel a little sad once you reach the end because you've become attached to the characters.  A lovely boo 
 Product was perfect I knew it excisted but was hard to find I am a loyal SF fan starting 1969 hopefully they will be back to being competative soon but will watch anyway all the glory years together watch it a bunch go niner 
 There are very few books which bring me to tears of laughter and this is one of them.  Incredibly, this book was written by Carl Hiaasen in 1986 and here I am listening to the audio version 20 years later and it's still incredibly funny - although younger readers might be lost on references to Jane Pauley and Michael Landon.  The audio version is expertly read by George Wilson.  He does an amazing job of bringing these quirky characters to life 
 I got this book from the library when my daughter was 22 months old. She loved it immediately and asked me to read it 5 times in a row! We have other Dr. Seuss books but somehow she likes this one most. Now she is 23 months old and she "reads" this book by herself. Great book and I recommend it for children under 2 
 My son just loves this book. The interactive pages make it fun while teaching worthwhile information.  I love that it helps put my son's life into perspective when compared to that of children in other parts of the world 
 I love to give this book, as it always draws compliments from the receiver.  Its bright and colorful pages keep the child's interest. Its one of the best counting books for young children 6 months to 3 years. You won't be disappointed 
 A friend gave me this book shortly after I lost my beloved Tasha, a German Shepherd who brought endless joy into my life. Her own life was cut short by cancer, a month short of her 5th birthday.  There are all sorts of books available deal so seriously with grief and coming to grips with loss and bereavement. If that is what you need, then the other current review of this book is correct: this is not the book for you. If, on the other hand, what you need is for someone to hold you, rock you, and whisper silly "meaningless" things while you cry your grief out, then this book may be for you.  Virginia Ironside has been an "agony aunt" journalist for some time and has collected thousands of anecdotes on all sorts of topics. She's gone beyond collecting, though, to finding resources to share with people who have too much to cope with to look for them on their own. This is obviously a collection of those anecdotes as well as a resource of (yes, British) resources for dealing with the loss of a pet. The "messages" of this book have as much depth as a magazine or newspaper article can have. But there is much to be said about the value, the worth, of a soft touch as opposed to some serious, deep examination by some psychologist or doctor or self-proclaimed expert on coping with grief and death.   Nothing I could read would ever make the loss of my Tasha "make sense". But reading the anecdotes did more than make me feel that I wasn't alone -- after all, if misery loves company, what good is miserable company? No, these stories made me remember all the joy of the time I was blessed to share with my dog. Ironside organizes of these anecdotes into chapters based on the questions we all have, such as coping with the decision to put a pet "to sleep" or facing the inevitable, uncaring "it was only an animal" comment someone is bound to say. And Ironside's own prose weaves them together with common sense advice, which is often more helpful than what any expert can share.  The one chapter that helped me move beyond my loss was, appropriately, the last in the book. The message, from your pet's point of view, is basically this: "You shared so much love with me, but don't let it end with me. There are others out there that need your love -- find another and give to it the same love you gave to me." When the time was right, that sentiment gave me the will to look past my grief.   And by circumstance or serendipty, I find myself writing this review on the birthday of Leyna, my wonderful and true best friend, who today finishes her fifth year of bringing me joy and begins her sixth.   If you buy this book, I hope it brings you the solace I found in it 
 [....], they have all praised "Break Point." It has been called the best tennis book of 2006. I thought it was at times hilarious, but also telling, a pro tennis player who has all kinds of rationalizations for why he's not playing as well as he expects, but still plugs away and loves the game and the life. Most of what we hear from pro athletes is about the hardships, but Spadea makes the game and life seem for the most part a great challenge and fun. He's a little Holden Caulfield, Dennis Rodman, Huckleberry Finn and Jim Carrey put together. I can see where some readers felt they wanted more insight into the top players' games and psyches, and Spadea does tell good stories about Agassi, Blake, Roddick, John and Pat McEnroe, Navratilova, Sharapova, Clijsters and Brad Gilbert, but Spadea is obsessed with his own path. And it's an odd, but passionate one. At 32, I believe he's the oldest American in the top-75 in the world-rankings and as Wertheim says, "Spadea gives a lot of insight into the world of a 20-50th ranked player." If you're interested in the journey of a pro tennis player, distinguished enough to have played and beaten Agassi, Blake, Roddick, Federer and Nadal, but below the radar screen of most sports fans, this is an absorbing and enjoyable read. 
 I work in a daycare, and I decided to buy this album to use as background music in my classroom while the kids are having their free-play time.  It really is a nice change of pace from the typical kid songs you might hear.  The kids love it, and I do too!  =)  Definitely highly recommended for teachers and parents who are looking for music that is fun and kid-friendly, but still enjoyable for adults as well 
 Toshiba laptops are screwed when it comes to cooling. Mine would stop several times a day. I tried several coolers from various stores and returned them all because they did not help. This cooler works for my laptops cooling configuration (probably will not work on all brands because the fan placement is different} and my laptop has not shut down even once since 
 Reading the reviews of this and other "In Death" books, I've noticed that sprinkled among the many enthusiastic, positive reviews are a few expressing discomfort, even active disapproval, over Eve's untraditional marriage and straightforward personality.  "She's a horrid person because she doesn't want children (as though the only possible good woman was a maternal one)."  "Why can't she be more "womanly" (i.e. a stereotypical clothes-, appearance- and kids-obsessed woman)?"  "Why can't she be nicer (i.e. subservient) to Roarke?"  First, please look again at the relationship between Nixie and Eve.  Those who are condemning Eve's attitude towards Nixie seem to have skipped or skimmed over the subtleties and nuances of their interactions at, for instance, the end of Chapter 12 where Eve tells Nixie it's OK to be mad and that justice will be done, Chapter 20 where Nixie tells Eve"You're not really mean" (loved Eve's reaction!), and the last 3 ? pages of the book.  Second, Roarke doesn't need a "wife" in the traditional sense - after all, he's got Summerset and a whole army of minions.  What he needs is someone unique, someone strong enough to help him save and uplift his soul.  Eve does that perfectly, giving him a venue where he can forge and polish his personal definitions of good and evil (something he missed out on completely while growing up) and become a better person.  Remember, he told Dr. Mira that Eve had "saved" him.  In return, he supports her efforts to be a good cop and helps her work through the horrific wounds of her own childhood.  They are the perfect couple because they are perfect for each other.  Also, if Roarke was the dedicated cop and Eve the rich business woman, no one would question or criticize their relationship.  Lastly, no well-behaved, well-dressed, conventionally-nice woman would be strong, complex and interesting enough to carry more than 20 novels - every one of which is a keeper.  Which leads me to my sincere praise for J.D. Robb, whose "In Death" books are far above and beyond her "and they lived happily ever after" Nora Roberts books.  One of the things I most like about Eve and Roarke is that we get to see them living together as a loving, married couple who are still working all sorts of things out to suit themselves in a truly unique relationship.  PS - to echo others, to get the most out of this series, start this series at the beginning with "Naked in Death, then "Glory in Death" and so on.  Also, like so many others, I adore the diverse cast of supporting characters - Peabody, McNab, Feeney, Nadine, Baxter, Trueheart, Mavis and everyone else!  Even fusty old Summerset and his tight-assed sniffing, sniping and fussing.  I loved this book 
 This book fills the reader with emotion and knowledge about photography and photographs.  I will never look at a photograph the same way after having read it.  The language is beautiful and inspiring and photographs  wonderfully reproduced. Anyone who loves the subject or art in general will  find excitement on every page.  NOW I can begin to know which photographers  to study first and how to approach an enormous subject 
 This is, by far, one of the best books that I have ever read. Those folks that have reviewed it and wondered where the "proof" is are stuck in perpetual la-la land. The tragic events of 9-11 are forever ingrained into the American culture. This book should be a "must read" for every American. Jere Longman is a great story-teller 
 David Icke has been researching the 'Illuminati' or 'enlightened ones' aka those with 'all the knowledge' for over 25 years now. These people are the same few that control all global events and the world money system. With this type of power, anything is, and has been possible.   Icke's research and references are solid. He doesn't make stories up, but rather puts together factual pieces of information and looks at similarities and starts building puzzles that become clearer and clearer.  Give this book a chance, if you are a skeptic or not, read it from cover to cover, then start criticising, this book one very well written, well researched text that will blow your mind and give you some real 'enlightenment'.. 
 If you've seen this piece at the local stores you've probably heard that they come assembled. Well, the Amazon version requires assembly. While it wasn't too difficult or time consuming (maybe two hours including disposal/organization of packing materials), it would have been nice to know it. Aside from assembly, the quality and look of the cabinet are great. Definitely worth the sales tax savings to get it through Amazon - plus you get that feeling of accomplishment once you've put the thing together 
  So by the time they made CAREFREE, the Astaire and Rogers duo were tapping in to the changing times.  The movie, therefore is both less and more than their other films.  It is less ball gown and tails and more like the people who were their devoted audience.  We get escapism but of a more accessible kind in this slice of the radio-listening and golf-playing late Thirties America in this vehicle.    The plot combines a hypnotist-practicing psychiatrist (Fred) and a very popular radio singer (Ginger) with Fred's-best-friend-slash-Ginger's-boyfriend (Ralph Belamy) completing the love triangle.  There are some great comedic bits--especially when Ginger runs amuck on the air just when she is pitching a commercial that is supposed to be plugging the sponsor's toothpaste (funny, funny, funny).    The Irving Berlin songs are charming if not quite the popular sensation that tunes from some of the earlier films had been.  The same is true of the dance they create, "The Yam" which is great to watch but is more of the novelty number than they may have wished, especially given the long life of "The Carioca" (FLYING DOWN TO RIO) and "The Continental" (THE GAY DIVORCEE), which people continued to dance for years.  It is great to see them go over the top with this, their most ambitious up and over the furniture dance routine, but who, pray tell, is going to do a dance about a sweet spud?  Well then again there was the "Mashed Potato"...    Throughout the film, Ginger looks fantastic as always especially in the dress with the lightening zap and the heart; Fred is debonair in a wardrobe you could just as easily wear today as in the `30s.  The running critique through all the Fred and Ginger films was that they do not kiss on screen--and one could argue when you dance like that who needs to kiss.  In an earlier film, they do kiss just off screen, behind a door (SWING TIME).  Here, in this movie, in the "Color Blind" number they fix that problem by kissing in front of the camera and since it is done in a dream sequence slow motion, they more than make up for lost time.  This is the last of their series for RKO.  
 William Vollman has to be read, and read more.  The question is more which Vollman to read than whether to read Vollman at all.  His works can be loosely divided into the historical (the Seven Dreams series and the recent philosophical work in violence, Rising Up and Rising Down) and the journalistic fiction (including Butterfly Stories and Atlas and Whores for Gloria).  But the work of cultural archaeology that Vollman is performing can be located in all his works.  He is bringing that which has been buried by long years of cultural blindness and prejudice into the light.  With great patience we will learn to think "person" when we hear "prostitute", instead of just shaking our heads at what we know only as some abstract category of social depravity - a prejudice that many might protest but secretly be a party to (myself reluctantly included).   In the introduction, honest Vollman makes his plea for suspension of judgment on his blatantly controversial cast of characters: "In case any of you readers happens to be a member of the Public, that mysterious organization that rules the world through shadow-terrors, I beg you not to pull censorious strings merely because this book, like one or two others of mine, is partly about the most honest form of love called prostitution - a subject which the righteous might think exhausted with a single thought - or, better yet, no thought at all - but the truth is that there are at least thirteen times as many different sorts of whores as there are members of the Public (and I think you know what I mean by members).  Shall we pause to admire them all...?" And from there, Vollman plunges into a heart-wrenching story of  alienation, desparate love-seeking, and reality-smashing encounters with a tumultuous underworld of eager and elusive women.  We follow the protagonist, the journalist, from his school days, to a trans-European train ride, to the brothels and discos of Thailand and Cambodia, returning to an estranged home, and the subsequent delirium of desire and uncertainty.     Here is a story about love and loneliness, ethics and humanity, pleasure and pain.  It is a story about willful self-destruction and about grabbing for assurances on the way down.  It is what you will let it be.  Either way, Vollman is a master 
 I am the worlds biggest procrastinator when it comes to putting together furniture!  I bought this piece, along with the desk, in January and here it is April, and I am just now getting the job done.  The table part of this product was fairly easy to put together and at this point my spirits were high.  The file drawer on the other hand is a different story.  None of the pieces are labeled, getting the two sides and the front to align long enough to put the screws was almost impossible and I did need to use a hammer to fishish off the screws.  I liked to never figure out why my drawer was not sitting right, when I finally figured it out that I had it in on the wrong side.  Overall, putting it together could have been made easier with written directions instead of just pictures, screws that actually screwed all the way in and pieces that are labled.  The file cart is a little wobbly but seems to be sturdy enough to hold my printer...for the time being 
 This book by prof. Cobban not only provides a good overview of the political ideas of the Enlightenment thinkers, but also illustrates how these ideas are relevant for our own age. In that respect, it is the best book that has ever been written on the subject. Besides discussing the general tenets of the Enlightenment, dr. Cobban also goes on to demistify some myths surrounding the impact that the Enlightenment allegedly had on the French Revolution and political philosophy after that. Cobban gives a clear outline of the profoundly classical liberal nature of the Enlightenment, which is the basis of the "humanity" he seeks to re-discover, treasure and cherish. Anyone intending to defend classical liberalism in our time should take heed of the ideas espoused in this book 
 About 6 mo ago I read the first book in the trilogy, The Dark Queen and fell in love with the story and the characters.  I have been itching to read the Courtesan ever since then.  This story was delightful! It carries on the story of the Cheney sisters with Gabrielle and her life as a courtesan and separation from her sister Ariane and Miri. Gabrielle thinks this is the life she was always after, but deep inside knows shes not happy.  She greives the death of Nicholas Remy, then things take a dramatic turn, Remy is alive! He didn't die that bloody Massacre of St. Bartholomew night.  Her life isn't necessarily jeopardized, but definitely turned upside down.  Her ambitions of seducing Henry of Navarre become apparently over.  Her heart is with Remy and no matter how she might try and deny herself this truth, it slams into her like a train.   Catherine de Medici isn't really the focus in this book like she was in the dark Queen. We also get a glimpse of Ariane and Renard and their difficulties having a child. Miri also joins the story along with her once childhood love Simon Aristide now know as the witch hunter Le Balafre (this character is not the same as the historical duc de Guise).   A new witch is also introduced in the story, Cassandra Lascelles.  Cassandra is at first a friend of Gabrielle's. She is shrouded in mystery in this book and is in bits and pieces. But I feel she is a character set up to be prominent in the following novel, The Silver Rose. So I guess we shall see!  I really can't wait to read The Silver Rose and find out what happens in this story of the Cheney women of Fair Isle.  I absolutely love Susan Carroll's stories! I love how she intertwines history with fiction into one seamless story.  A job well done indeed 
 I have enjoyed thinking about doing some of this. The book gives fine guidanc 
 An excellent book for the beginner to the art of woodturning. It is an invaluable item to have alongside the lath 
 Forget bronze - all of Gould's Bach-playing that I have yet heard (probably most of it by now) is gold-medal stuff for me. However two thousand years ago another bachelor, Horace, was emboldened to claim permanence for what he left to us, and I don't feel it's unreasonable or presumptuous to claim it for Gould as well. In his own way Gould created a new epoch. He fought and buried the myth that the keyboard masterpieces of Bach could be properly represented in performance only on the instruments available to the master before the piano was invented. He reminded us of what we should never have allowed ourselves to lose sight of, namely that instruments are there for music and not music for instruments. Above all, he embodied the great and prevalent truth that the music of one genius is best heard through the medium of another.  This set of the final three English suites was recorded in the 1970's when Gould was in his 40's. The very interesting liner-note gives us some insight into how Gould went about his recording sessions. He would do a variety of takes of certain movements, and his interpretations would sometimes be startlingly different from one take to the next. If you know his disc of part of The Art of Fugue this will not surprise you, as it presents certain contrapuncti in alternative readings, made not far apart in time, that are as unlike as chalk and cheese. Gould himself, and most commentators since, made a great song and dance about the two different readings he offered of the Goldberg variations over a time-interval of 26 years, and while the difference undoubtedly reflected changes in his thinking and philosophy to a great extent, what I read here suggests to me that genius of this order is not necessarily a matter of one single view even at one point in time. Here he has had to settle for one way of playing each given piece. I would give a lot to have heard some of his other ideas, but I am only too grateful for what he decided on.   The playing here is of Gould's usual kind, the touch generally non-legato but with a few slight concessions to legato and even a hint of sustaining pedal here and there. Also as usual, there is very little rubato, and a tempo once set is adhered to rigidly except for a slight easing in the final phrase of a movement. No startling speeds, particularly no amazingly fast ones, are adopted this time. The recorded sound, while satisfactory in the basic respect of preserving the player's clarity of touch, is not actually the best I know among Gould's recordings. It is slightly hard, and does not do full justice to the pearly quality of the runs such as we hear in his set of Haydn sonatas, although it emphasises the cut-diamond brilliance of his trills and other ornaments; and that, after gold and bronze, exhausts my stock of metaphors from jewellery and sculpture.   There is nothing about the music in the liner-note, which is probably no great loss considering what we are often offered in that respect. There is a certain amount about the man himself, some of it from the man himself who, whatever his reclusiveness in many ways, was nothing if not talkative. Whether he suffered from agoraphobia or whether he was just naturally shy I can't tell. What should be more important to us now that he is gone is that he came to have such a liking for recording. This particular disc is not the first I would think of if I had to introduce some newcomer to Gould, but I am only too glad to own it as another ornament on his monument 
 First I must admit to a certain bias here.  I travel a lot, I travel with a dog as a companion and I enjoy reading this particular author. I was doing all of this long before this book was published and continue to do so to this date. I can relate to this work!  That being said, this is one of those books that I have reread several times over the years, and year after year, I find that Steinbeck's observations contunue to be relevant.  This is a very easy reading book.  I do need to point out to a number of other reviewers though, that this is NOT a novel(despite what his son said)!  It is a travel book and it takes a look at parts of our country seen through the author's eyes.  It is interpreted through the author's past expierences and how he preceives the world.  I am sure that any ten (or one hundred) people could take the same trip and we would come up with ten (or one hundred) different stories and interpretations of those stories. I shared some of his opinions and agree with some of his observations...others I did not.  That is what makes life so wonderful and why it is always good to read, or better yet, talk to others, and agree or disagree, enjoy their views.  I certainly cannot fault the author's usage of language, syntax and organization.  It is all good solid Steinbeck. This is one of those books that can be read on several levels.  You can read it as a social commentary of that particular time in America, or, as I do, you can relax and enjoy the ride with the author.  As a side note:  I do note that many of the younger readers appear to feel this work is boring.  I can see where this might be the case when you consider the movies, T.V. etc. of this day and age.  I might suggest though, that you give it another read in a few years.  Perhaps you will look at it differently.  I know I have expierence that with other works by different authors.  All in all, recommend this one highly.    
 This is a must have for artists, animators and actors. Yes, the photography is superb, so as a pure art book, it's great. But I also recommend this book as a teaching tool. I have seen many, many books on facial expression, but this one surpasses them all by miles. Not only because it uses actors instead of ordinary Joes, but Schatz puts them into character by giving them a situation to react to and a personality to react with. Other books on expression, simply state "sad" or "confused" or "angry". Schatz directs the actors by saying "your are a man who has been told he has inoperable cancer", for instance. The results speak for themselves 
 I just finished this book and already I can't wait to re-read it. I laughed out loud so many times I know the people @ the park thought I was crazy! I  think "Island of the Sequined Love Nun" will be next on my list of Moore books 
 I love this book! I have to admit, I was beginning to worry about my husband's role in our family as we approach the birth of our first child (due April '07). The only time my husband reads is in the bathroom, and most of the time it's People Magazine or the newspaper...I ordered this book anyway with the hopes that he would become involved and learn about what to expect once the baby is here. It was amazing to see the transformation he made as he read this book. Since becoming pregnant I had been the one doing most of the talking about the baby, but once he started this book it was him doing the talking. We laughed about what he was learning and I think it has made a huge difference in our relationship. I wish this author would write another book 
 Out of all the books at the day care center I worked at, this by far was the favorite and most requested book of the kids. I don't know why, but whether the unit for the week was colors, animals, or Easter this book had to be read several times during story time and was often read just for fun. Surprisingly, none of we teachers ever tired of reading the book. The copy of the book at the center was read so many times that the back cover literally fell off. The book uses a white rabbit to illustrate how by mixing primary colors, secondary colors are made. Not only that but the book helps introduce children to "sensations" that colors can cause; for example white rabbit thinks dunking in blue will feel cool and that red is sizzling. A wonderful little book 
 I wear it almost every day.  It is very good and beautiful 
 This was the book I was looking for.  I wanted a book that gave you natural, alternative ways of coping with labor pain.  This hit the nail on the head. Like other readers have said you got the facts without the bias.  There were even sections on using medication as well as common interventions during labor.  This was definitely worth the money and should be helpful to me during labor! 
 ...but I had to watch this one again, right afterward, because I needed to go back and watch for clues.  Honestly, and I won't give away the 'ah ha!' moment, but I knew that he was... well, you know, what he was. What I didn't get was how that was possible, or how the interaction with the others that I saw... so I had to go back and watch the movie AGAIN, just to make sure there were no errors in the filming of it.  Sure enough, I found none that I could call an error, and was totally blown away with how this was filmed.  I am a writer, and I also adapt novels for scripts, and when something like this comes along, that something that just totally grabs me and says, "This is something special... this is not the ordinary..." well, I am impressed.  I aspire to write something that can really AH HA! someone in this way.  I recommend the movie, highly 
 I bought these with the also great socks and was completely pleased by the way they left my hands, hydrated and soft. After leaving them on for half an hour with the Glamour Gloves Gel my hands felt reborn. I couldn't get over how the moisturizers had penetrated. I've had these for a couple years and was almost sure they would stop working but they're still doing the job. I've recently seen less expensive gloves on the market and don't know how well they work but these are very high quality 
 Loved the book.   I'm now hooked on Nelson Demille's books. John Corey is the best character.  I hope they make this book in to a movie, and I'd like to see Tommy Lee Jones play him.  I think the ending was just perfect for the story.  Book was hard to put down. 
 Allan Savory and Jody Butterfield have produced a vital book for the future.  This updated version incorporates the incredible learning of thousands of people world wide-- all engaged in a serious effort to learn how humans can live in sync with the natural world, how we can learn to not  only diminish our harmful impacts but indeed restore biodiversity and  health to many ecologically damaged areas. It helps build deeper  understanding of the human/Earth relationship as a whole,  while providing  very practical guidelines for steering one's personal life, one's family,  business, community and indeed our larger collective and governmental  policies towards the values and way of life that make common sense and  sustain life at the same time.  I can only hope that this book and its  message will reach far and wide and provide its insights and  "navigational aids" to people who are committed to a healthier  future with the Earth and one another.  But beware,  it will change your  thinking and there is no going back 
 If you are one of those people who doesn't want to be in public working out and sweating to a tough yoga practice, then this DVD is for you. Bryan is really a great teacher, giving clear instructions and demonstrations, and putting together a workout that is good for advanced beginners and experts alike. Excellent DVD 
 The book covers almost all different kinds of "head decoration" styles. And it's great to show how to do it if you have no idea where to start! Of course, practice makes perfect 
 I studied Spanish Literature in school and  when I think of Spanish authors, I think of Cervantes, Quevedo, Becquer and of course, Gongora. Then there's a leap from the "Golden Century" and Spanish Literature becomes Latin American Literature with Garcia Marquez, Octavio Paz, Pablo Neruda and of course, Isabel Allende.  Perez Reverte is a revelation.  He really takes you to Seville with a host of characters that are different from each other, and through their antics and actions,they show another dimension of this legendary city. The pace of this story is well contained, since it cannot be read in a rush. Perez Reverte takes you to a walk through the narrow streets of Seville, showing you the Tower of Gold, La Giralda, many squares and plazas, churches and convents,all the way to the shores of the Guadalquivir River. One can see the ocher walls, and hear Tablao throughout the entire story.  Father Quart is a unique character, and the hero of the story. He so methodical in everything he does, that he reminds me of "The Day of the Jackal." He feels more pride than piety, and control rule his acntions, rather than zeal. I liked this character very much.  Macarena is the "Maja" of the story, and trough her mother, Cruz Brener, Perez Reverte takes the reader to the times of the "Other Spain," the aristocracy, the wealth, and the world of privilege that is fading away quickly.  I just have one recommendation for this book. There's nothing wrong having a good looking priest around, but it seems that Perez Reverte describes Fatehr Quart too many times as a Knight Templar throughout the entire story. I picture Father Quart as a young Arnold Schwarzenegger playing Ivan Danko in "Red Heat" running around Seville looking for Vespers.  I'm glad I discovered this author, and I have a feeling this won't be the only book I'll read from him. Well recommended, you won't be disappointed 
 This is a great intro to Supertramp hits from the 70 ths and 80 ths.  Most of the hits here were "mega hits" in Europe, and they where also well known all over the world. Track 1 School, is a very "Supertramp", with it`s wide open soundpicture with lots of air and ecco from the different instruments put in where it fits. The harmonica in the beginning, and the vocal creeps sloooowly in to the melody, and then BANG, with a scream it moves into great "sympho rock". Track 2 Goodbye Stranger is more average with it`s minor funky beat, anyway it still shines, but it`s not realy up there because it spin`s too much around in the same themetrench. Track 3 The Logical song, is more "up there", with the piano and the saxophone solo which bring`s out a harmonic gem all trough. Weird and funny vocal sometimes, but that`s ok in this kind of song. Track 4 Bloody well right, has to much instrumental preludes before the vocal come`s in, and then you begin to loose interest. Track 5 Breakfast in America is the realy great hit song, which nearly every bit`s and pices is placed where they belong, to make a great song. Greatness shines on this one. Track 6 Rudy is more in the "Elton John" school of rock, with great piano play that makes it simple and quite effective all trough. Track 7 Take the long way home, has a very clear soundpicture and where back in "classical" Supertramp form. Here and there it works, but as a whole not everything is "up there". Average. Track 8 Crime of the Century, has a simpel narrative musical line with the piano, but then it goes over in somekind of  heavy sympho rock. There are some nice bits and pices here, but as a whole is a letdown. Track 9 Dreamer, is experimental, and a weird listning experience as a whole. Some nice bit`s but to "dreamy" for my taste. Track 10 Ain`t nobody but me is in the "sympho blues/light heavy metal" department. It goes to much around and around with not to much creativity as a whole. Track 11 Hide in your shell, has a nice touch of a melody, but the theme spins out of gas before it ends. Too long, to slow build up in other words. Track 12 From now on has some flair all trough. It`s light weight but quite effective, as a slow song, but nothing very special. Track 13 Give a little bit, is a great "alcapella" song with the very effective refrain which creates as a whole a good listen experience. The saxophone play is put in the right places, an that also helps a lot. Track 14 It`s raining again, it`s nice, smooth, and a good "easy come easy go" song, but here the "easy way out" is a quality mark. Track 15 Cannonball is quite effective with a different beat as we have known Supertramp until now. More urban and fast funk in a way, and also more thight put together. Anyway. Supertramp is a creative symphonic rock band high on quality and flair. A good intro for newcomers this one on the "early" Supertramp sound 
 I haven't read any other studies of suicide, but like many introspective people, the subject is familiar and even, ever present. Being also a huge student and aficionado of literature, A Savage God made for a pretty soothingly delightful read.  To start off, Alvarez presents one with a mildly interesting account of the author's relationship (or acquaintanceship, rather) with Sylvia Plath and some musings on her suicide. This gives way to a somewhat terribly constructed historical analysis of suicide that more or less falls flat. The psychological angle is dealt with contemptuously -- as it should be -- and the most interesting part of the book, the literary analyses, takes over in the second half.  The book was interesting in fits and starts, but never so boring in any one sustained part that I was moved to stop reading. One was carried from one stage to the next pretty seamlessly. It is conversational in style, even if the style is rather stiff and British - never personal, yet personal all along, the way some people can strip down to bare skin and their every thought is on their lips,  and yet you don't get the sense of anything "personal" emerging. It's pleasant nevertheless because it's direct and honest.  Even if a lot of light wasn't shed on what is, after all, a tremendously obscure subject, the book makes for good reading because there is a lot in it that I found myself thinking I would like to know. Just know. It doesn't matter how it connects with suicide, it doesn't matter how it illuminates the problems of the human condition: there are bits of knowledge that it is simply pleasant to be in possession of, and Alvarez provides plenty of those throughout the book. Also, I would be suspicious of any psychological or existential theory that would try to wrap suicide up in a package of overarching explanation -- it can't be done, as suicide is as varied as the experience of human suffering. Alvarez's method is more freewheeling, letting a picture of suicide emerge through a few case studies, a few historical tidbits, all resulting in giving one a clearer sense of suicide than one had to begin with. It's the same sense you would get if you were to sit down and do your research to write the first book on suicide ever written. In other words, it doesn't make suicide suddenly clear to you -- but you are left knowing  more and seeing it with deeper understanding.  If it goes to recommending it, it's a pretty quick read, and well enough written so that even a person not particularly interested in either literature or suicide would find it not wholly unreadable. I notice I use the word 'pleasant' in connection with the book, despite its morbid subject: That is, strangely enough, the effect one is left with - nostalgic, wise, calm, looking at the world and at people with wide understanding eyes that see across centuries to the pain that persists contra all essential instinct 
 they're just perfect.  nice and thick and thirsty, just the way i like e 
 I love a chef who understands what makes food taste good and why we need it to taste good.  These authors get it.  Some reviews give this book poor marks because of errors in the recipes.  They may be there but they haven't been a problem for me yet.  The book is fun to read, informative, and the recipes are flavorful and satisfying.  
 This is surely the great American historical novel. If you love reading historical fiction. This is the book for you 
 I really enjoyed this book. Mario Cuomo really has a strong grasp on the most important issues of today. His views should be those shared by moral americans. As he says we are not all just 250 million lone horsemen riding  off into the sunset, we're all in it together. It is our unity that keeps  us strong.       I agree with Cuomo that the Republicans are all just a  bunch of babbling bafoons filled with greed. They are always pandering to  the basest fears of people. Man's basest nature is greed and desire for  control over other humans....... The Republicans embody all of that. Greed  and Control

 Louis Menard points out his excellent introduction to The Manchurian Candidate that Richard Condon's novel is about control, conditioning, and manipulation.  Raymond Shaw and his fellow G.I.s are captured in Korea, undergo "brainwashing", and are released believing that they, through the heroism of Sergeant Shaw, have been saved from a company of enemy infantry.  The encounter never took place, of course, but that's the story that will win Raymond the Medal of Honor.  However, Raymond has been conditioned to be the ulimate assassin.  Meanwhile Major Marco, Raymond's commanding officer in Korea, has been having terrible nightmares in which he sees Raymond killing two members of their patrol in cold blood.  He also sees himself and his patrol on a stage facing some high ranking Soviet and Chinese officals. The staggering nightmares cause Marco to start wondering if he, Raymond, and the others have been brainwashed.  This leads him on a frantic investigation to discover the truth before something disastrous happens.  Raymond can't recall any of what Marco has been dreaming about.  He has been completely conditioned twice over -- once by the Pavlovian doctors and also by his mother, Mrs. Iselin, probably the most evil villainess in all of literature.  She is the embodiment of Control and she savages anyone who gets in the way of her plans for domination.  The Manchurian Candidate is very fine writing.  Condon's style is eccentric but it is perfect for the bizarre, paranoid tale he is telling.  His portrayal of Raymond as a damned soul is moving.  Raymond, who is cursed with "crushing contemptuousness", is "impossible to like", but we can't help but be sympathetic to this young man who was never allowed to be himself, who was never allowed to feel.   Mrs. Iselin is over-the-top, but who cares?  She sends chills down your spine while providing some wicked humor.  The Manchurian Candidate is a Freudian cocktail that will give you lots to chew on.  
 I don't know anything about jazz. But I do know that being a woman, listening to this CD feels like I'm being sofly caressed all over by the man of my dreams. he plays the 'sexophone' so smoothly some notes sound more like whispers.. anyways you get the picture.. it is fabulous background music and to me, this is Jazz in its purest and simplest form. Enjoy 
 I just bought this headset for use with an LG VX-8300. The stereo headset lets you listen to music and talk on the phone (has microphone built in).  Works fine 
 If you are looking for literate entertainment, ROSE, by Martin Cruz Smith, is it.  It is a set of tangled mysteries as well as a sharp Dickensian social portrait of 1870's England, specifically the coal and mill town of Wigan, in Lancashire.    The first mystery that sets the rest of the story in motion is that of Wigan's young, idealistic and evangelical Anglican curate who has gone missing.  Bishop Hannay, also the local nobility and mine owner, calls in his gold mine engineer from his African holdings to find out what happened to the curate, who had been engaged to Hannay's daughter, Charlotte.  The engineer, our hero Jonathan Blair, is flat broke, swimming with malaria and, by Victorian standards, a scandal for having gone over to tribal life in Africa.  He can't refuse Hannay if he wants to get out of Wigan, and either get back to America where he was mostly raised or to Africa where he has a child by his deceased African wife.  The first thing Blair learns is that the curate was last seen talking to a pit girl, one of the legendary scandalous women who worked in the mines like men.  That would be Rose of the title.  The second thing Blair learns, that Hannay omitted, was that the curate went missing at the same time 76 miners were killed in a blast.  And from there, the mysteries and revelations begin piling up very quickly, especially those of character and motive.  Smith's descriptive powers are in full strength here.  The sounds and visual impact of Wigan are vivid.  His dense plot is satisfying and does not disappoint.  Because of some loose parallels I drew with THE FRENCH LIEUTENANT'S WOMAN by John Fowles, I guessed one of the chief surprises, but only a page before it was revealed.   In a book that is very much about how surface life often betrays the truths below, geologically, socially and psychologically, and how there are mysteries that can never be sorted out entirely, Smith does a darn good job of making his story balance in the end. 
 A great diversion that beats most cable TV oldie shows. Of course its a bit hokey but what 70's TV wasn't? I enjoyed this set as well as the season 2, but this set had the better songs. A nicely done set, high quality sound and video. If you liked it as a kid like me, its was great to see the shows again 
 This album is great value for money, four CD's for under ten dollars. If you like the Condon "Town Hall Concert" series, you will love these four CD's covering jazz music from 1933 up to 1961. Here you have Condon, Pee Wee Russell, Hackett, Kaminski and many of their contemporaries blowing out great jazz. Over four hours of jazz music played by many top musicians.   Alan Carric 
 well written - i really like her writing. very much my style and I am an actress and writer. it's chick-lit, but not in any way sappy or Harlequin romance-ish, which I find in some chick-lit, and that is not modern. Jane is - a modern woman. 
 I really like this curling iron...- and you definitely can't beat the price!  It heats up very quickly, and gives me great curls.  The key to working with large barrel curls are to use a mouse or cream to texturize your hair.  Then, after you curl, make sure to take a blowdryer on cold/low setting to lock the curls down.  I always receive so many compliments on my hair!! 
 We took this camera on a trip to Austrailia, Fiji, and New Zealand.  VR was great and camera performed flawlessly.  Would buy again 
 When I first heard the sound of the Rippingtons in the '80s I was impressed with their sound as it was different and quite hip. They sounded very progressive and ushered in a new style of music. Then, I happen to see them live at an out door concert in Regency Park in Raleigh, North Carolina and I was hooked. After a few sucessful CDs, they seem to loose some creativity and their CDs were unmemorable. Also, they shared a common trait, the horn section was too loud and was irratating to listen to for an extended period, and the bass was lacking. The high frequencies dominated their recordings making them fatiquing to listen to for an extended period. They also lost a few members. However, beginning with the CD before this one, I thought they seem to sound a little better with their recordings sounding better balanced as the horn section was tamed. To me, this effort marks their reclaimation as premier smooth jazz artist as the sound is that of the old Rippingtons during the beginning of the smooth jazz format. I understand that they called all the original musicians on this anniversary CD and it shows. They sound like the group I liked when the smooth jazz format began. The recording quality shines on this effort and it is truly a reference quality sounding disc. To top it off, at the end of this CD, they have a live mix featuring all of their top past compositions which is excellent to say the least. A good DJ mixer could not have done a better job. Additionally, they throw in a bonus DVD, which has marginal picture quality, but contains good music. This CD is a gift to all smooth jazz lovers and Rippingtons fans in particular. They are due a thank you, and I thank them. You, too, will thank them once you hear this CD/DVD 
 In order to become a market leader you must choose what kind of customers you want to serve, and design your operating model to fulfill the chosen customer value, while maintaining appropriate standards in the other two customer values.  According to the authors, there are three kinds of customers, each with its own unique idea of what constitutes value. 	For the first kind of customer, high performance is the most important value of a product or service.   	For the second kind of customer, personalized service is the most important value.   	For the third kind of customer, the overall cost of the product is the most important value.    Market leaders beat out their competition, say the authors, by focusing on one kind of customer and fulfilling their expectations.  This means that you should choose one of three operating models:   	Product Leadership:  Focused on innovation and performance, product leaders strive to turn invention into breakthrough products. 	Customer Intimacy:  Focused on specialized, personal service, these companies become partners with their customers.   	Operational Excellence:  Companies with the operational excellence model offer customers the lowest possible cost of a product.  These companies focus on their supply and distribution systems, in order to reduce costs to the customer.  There are three steps to choosing which operating model is best for you. 1.	Determine how well you are currently delivering the three kinds of value to customers.  Use market research to find out which kind of value your customers care about, and how well you compare to your competitors. 2.	Make a list of possible options of ways you could change your organization to meet the needs of each kind of customers. 3.	Use teams to evaluate what operating systems would need to be put in place to implement these options, and whether you would be able to compete with market leaders once this was done. 
 this is one of the best albums of the nineties get it  then di 
 Great WW... simply amazing work 
 I am an Elizabethan freak so it takes a lot for me to really get into a book about the period and not nit pick it.  This book follows Elizabeth across her life.  I didn't think it offered much of a new perspective or new data however.  It was a pretty standard biography of her (I've read about 10), but Alison Weir is a good writer which makes it enjoyable.  If you are looking for new facts or a more thought provoking read, I would suggest David Starkey's Elizabeth.  It explores her youth more and discusses many of the possible theories of a pregnancy, dispells tower gossip stories based on scientifc records from the time period, and is also an enjoyable read.  So if you want something a little mindless and entertaining, or if you are new to this field of study, this is a good book.  If you're a little more seasoned, I would choose the Starkey book and if you can afford both, I would suggest that so you can compare and contrast 
 nothing extraordinary (if you've listened to radiohead before). but in the end, if you like radiohead you'll definitely like the eraser. just one more album you can put between your kid a and your amnesiac 
 Always love the way she writes and was not disappointed!  Although it is a continuation of a series, you do not have to read previous ones to understand the characters.  In fact, I was able to find an older book in the series AFTER reading this and was STILL engaged in the plot! Enjoy her banter and descriptions of people and old items.  Looking forward to reading another Mary Kay Andrews book soon.  Keep 'em coming 
 This is a book version of Stephanie Levine's doctoral dissertation, but don't let that put you off--all it means is that it is very well researched and has some theoretical underpinnings laid out in the opening and closing chapters, which are quite readable in themselves.  HOwever, the meat of the book is the profiles of individual Hasidic girls who run the gamut from intensely religious to rebelling against the norms of their enclave.  The girls all come across as fascinating individuals and Levine is a sympathetic portrayer of them.  She can appreciate both the strengths and the confining aspects of the Hasidic world, and marvels at the strong assertiveness of these girls who have been educated and largely socialized in a single sex environment.  For anyone who has looked at these communities from the outside and wondered what it's like to live or grow up within them, particularly as a woman, this is a fascinating book that in no way reads like a textbook or a heavy academic tome.  Excellent 
 It's remarkable how undated this book reads:  children are still driving their moms crazy, husbands still have jobs that wives have to work around, and women still have to fit their jobs around the rest of the family...Kerr writes about domestic life, work life (although she was self-employed as a writer, she didn't seem to have tons of free hours to devote to her craft-- and most of her plays didn't do that well; she is roughly comparable to an affluent working mom of today, doing many jobs, but none of them especially well). What I love most about this book, in these days of articles on supermoms and the  "mommy-wars," is that Kerr doesn't pretend to be Mrs. Perfect, or even Mrs. Tries So Hard. She admits she wants to sleep till noon; and she is a faithful attendee at nearly every play her critic husband must review, because, as she puts it, "I have four young sons, so naturally I need to get out a lot." Funny, relevant, and somewhat neglected among the canon of humor writing--when WILL women be allowed to be funny 
 this book is the best medical physiology available.. its well explained, covers every aspect of the human physiology es the best book to survive medical schoo 
 I'm not sure why the other two reviewers found Christa Schwarz's Gay Voices of the Harlem Renaissance difficult to read.  I find Schwarz's prose clear and natural and her organizational scheme transparent.  More important, Gay Voices of the Harlem Renaissance is a valuable contribution to black and queer studies--Schwarz's scholarship is impressive and thorough.  Until this book appeared, the critical question of how queer genealogy intersected with the New Negro literary movement tended to be localized in debates over individual authors, such as the question of Langston Hughes's sexual orientation.  But Schwarz's book does much more than merely consolidate archives into a single text.  Gay Voices of the Harlem Renaissance performs the necessary labor of demonstrating that to talk of the Harlem Renaissance is to speak of the beginning of the queer revolution in the U.S., to suggest that among the emancipatory products of the New Negro was queer counterculture.  The significance of Gay Voices of the Harlem Renaissance cannot be understated 
 In The Pink: Dorothy Draper, America's Most Fabulous Decorator by Carleton Varney is an incredible collection and celebration of timeless interior design concepts by the renowned interior designer and decorator Dorothy Draper, a woman far ahead of her age. Deftly compiling an profusely illustrated compendium of Draper's remarkable work, In The Pink holds the reader's total attention from first page to last with an informative text enhanced with photography showcasing memorable designs created by the sharp eye and even sharper imagination of Draper throughout her world acclaimed career. A "must" addition to professional and academic library Interior Design reference collections, In The Pink is to be given high praise and recommendation for non-specialist general readers with an interest in interior design. 
 Morris Berman's Dark Ages America was a mixed bag for me.  I found his analyses and critique of corporate culture and degenerating morals and values in American culture as well thought out and superbly argued, for the most part having strong supporting evidence to back up his claims.  I find citing sources such as Jay Leno and Seinfeld as a bit unscholarly, however, even if they superficially serve to bolster his points.  Also, much of his statistical evidence is too general.  He speaks about world economics and U.S. foreign and domestic policy very broadly for the most part, and much of it resonated with me and rang as true, but many of the arguments presented in each chapter could very well be expanded into a book of their own.  I think a holistic critique of American society is quite an auspicious undertaking, and I cannot fault him for his end result, however the repeated usage of terms (for example, his references to Bush as an 'anti-intellectual bafoon') and the like serve to give the book a tone I found unneccesarily condescending, or at least much more heavily opinionated and not relying as much on hard, factual evidence as it could have been.  Let it be said that I agree with most of his critique of the Bush administration, I just think it could have been handled all the more scholarly, not sugar-coating the subjects discussed, but overall increasing the amount of legitimacy and resonation that he was attempting to get across without using such brash terminology. All of what I just wrote sounds like I didn't like the book, but my rating shows I enjoyed it for what it is, and I look forward to reading his backlog of previous releases.  I sincerely hope that the current state of the U.S. improves, and that Berman is proven overly pessimistic in his overall critique, but as he argues, our decline may be irreversible.  We shall see 
 I'm currently doing an MBA thesis on various types of strategy and this book helped a great deal. It's well written, easy to read, and covers all aspects of strategic thinking and the various strategy schools.  If you want a general overview of all common strategic thinking, this is the book for you. I thoroughly enjoyed it 
 I have had several Clancy Brothers & Tommy Makem albums on vinyl for more than a decade, but nothing on CD until I came across this bargain-priced collection. It would have been nice if Madacy had included some information on the 28 tracks included here (recording dates, instrumentation, band members/history--the band has been recording for more than 40 years and founding member Tom Clancy died in 1990), but for the price this is an enjoyable collection.  Unlike the Chieftains (whose recordings focus on their instrumental prowess), The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem (although competent musicians) emphasize their vocal talents.  In fact, some of these tunes are a capella, and most feature only sparse instrumentation.  At any rate, these are enjoyable songs and a terrific introduction to the band.  RECOMMENDE 
 My daughter received these instruments as a gift last Christmas and took to them right away.  She was six months old at the time and they were easy for her to hold and shake to create the sounds.  We have lots of toys that make noise but these were some of her favorites, just the right colors, size and shape with just the right sounds!  She has turned one now and still gets lots of enjoyment from these toys.  They really encourage musical creativity in even the youngest of children 
 During his lifetime which spanned most of the 19th century, Menzel was perhaps Germany's foremost realist painter and graphic artist.  He illustrated both the great events of contemporary history, such as the 1848 Revolution in Berlin and the Franco-Prussian War, as well as the mundane events of daily life.  This catalogue, which was published to accompany an exhibition of the artist's works (and seen in Paris, Washington, DC, and Berlin) is the most complete English-language account of the artist's life and his art.  The essays are written by expert curators and art historians.  The volume is profusely illustrated, and include his key works, from his graphic illustrations of Frederick the Great to his Iron Rolling Mill of the mid-1870s.  The catalogue will be of interest to historians, art historians, and the general public alike 
 This is a great soundtrack. It has a great variety of music. I wish it had a few more songs tho, it only has 10. If you loved the movie, you'll love the songs from it 
 What a great read! This is a story of how Starbucks changed the world. Howard Schultz, the CEO, tells the history of Starbucks starting with its founding in 1971 up until 1999. Schultz tells how he came on board,later bought the company and its sky-roacketing growth.  Schultz was working for a Swiss compnay that sold kitchen items.  He noticed this small little speciality coffee store in Seattle was buying more plastic filters than anybody and he decided to see why.  What started as curiousity quickly grew to a obsession that he had to leave his job as VP, move from NYC and start working for them.  Schultz's business like sense and vision took the comapny to heights it had never imagined.  A critical point is when he visited Italy and saw how community coffeeshops with their baristas and cappuchinos were exactly what Starbucks needed.  The owners didn't think so and he left Starbucks to venture on his own. Later Starbucks was up for sell and he raised the capital to buy them out and merge his Italian coffeeshop idea with the speciality coffee store.    What you find in this book is a great leadership wraped in a compelling tale.  It reads like a novel but the lessons are like what is found in the best leadership or business books.  Schultz explains why it is worth it to take risks, value the customers, value the employees and stick to the mission no matter what.  Starbucks with its passionate leader changed the world.  Before 1971, hardly no one drank strong coffee, heard of cappichinos or believed you could build a company giving benefits to part-time workers.  no one but him believed Chicago or other parts of America would buy his what he was selling.  Yes, he made money.  But he started a revolution and changed the world.  The book gets a little slower in the 2nd half when Schultz has to defend his critics and stay on top.  But its compelling none the less.  I highly recommend it with a good cup of Gold Coast - my favorite 
 If you are looking for a book to inspire you and help you to set your priorities for life, this is the book for you.  Not only is Mary Kay's writing addictive, her message is wonderful.  I keep this and a few other of her books in a convenient spot so I can go back and read portions regularly.  I find that her writing keeps me on track in life.  Her idea of God First, Family Second, and Career Third; really made an impact on me.  I would recommend this book to any woman or man of any age, religion and social status 
 I have not heard most of these brilliant tracks since the seventies. The LP's are out of print and most folks outside of Texas have never heard of Rusty Weir. This CD brings it all back home. I was a teenage hard rocker when some friends cajoled me into going to a Dallas honky tonk called Whiskey River to see this genuine Texas troubador. After being exposed to the hard rocking "Sally Mae", the riff & twang of "Aqua Dulce", and the genre bending "Black Hat Saloon" I was hooked. The albums these tracks were culled from deserve to be heard by a new generation of country and/or rock fans. The songs fall comfortably in an acoustic setting and when the Fabulous Filler Brothers flat out wail. Whenever Wille & Waylon, Jerry Jeff or Michael Murphy are mentioned, Rusty Weir casts a giant shadow as a pioneer of the country/rock revolution of the mid seventies. And you know, it does make you wanna dance. Don't it 
 Clark opened me to Courbet (and later Michael Fried} for which I am grateful. Here, his sleuthing unearths fresh and welcome insights into another brace of 'old' subjects. His intimate relationships to key works makes for a rivetting and informative read. The spell of his writing issuch that, though I'm not attracted to any of the artists whose work goes under his scope, I found, in each instance, my sympathies were ellicited. If the questions asked of the art are, whose mentality is recorded by these paintings; what action or situation yields the views which painters perceive and represent as an aspect of reality; and who are the protagonists and atagonists reflected within the painting's points of view(as Clark has) then you have an enticing context in which to frame old fuddy, duddy David, the cumbersome peasant women of Pissaro, Cezanne's androgynous 'Bathers',the congested spatial tricks of Picasso's cubism, the nihilistic utopia of Suprematism, and the vulgarity of Abstract Expressionism/ The New York School(my abbreviations, not Clark's). The close raking over the painting's content, context & textures is first rate, and convincing. Highly recommended 
 I tried surfing for the best price at shoe stores, but Amazon found me the best price at Bealls, in Florida. I walk on hospital cement floors all day. Rockports are more comfortable all day for me than other brand names I have tried. Thanks Amazon.com 
 In a way all of Joyce's  themes are contained in miniature 'Dubliners' and ' Portrait of an Artist'. Both of these are included in this anthology. There are also in the anthology chapters from ' Ulysses' and from ' Finnegan's Wake'. One of the distinguished Joyce scholars of the previous generation Harry Levin writes the introduction. The reader of this volume will get in miniature the collective portrait of  the city Dublin, the story of the artistic  quest of the Joyce alter ego Stephen Daedelaus ( including the renunciation of church, homeland, and family) the attempt to transform all of life and history into a new language which the reader is required to read ' all the years of the nights of his life'. The vast Joycean ambition and enterprise, the magical lyrical verbal art, the maker - remaker - creator the giant of twentieth century and world literature is the lyrical taddy  carrying us along to one of the most brilliant of all literary toy fairs.  Enjoy it.   
 As a 20-something, native Angeleno living elsewhere, I absolutely loved curling up with this book - everything typically LA/Hollywood is in here - it was like I was back on La Cienega, stuck in traffic, and people watching from the haven of my Jetta. The truths in here are undeniable - messy relationships publicized on the covers of tabloids, young children blindsided by the confusion of divorce, and at-all-costs publicity stunts. Readers looking for a good vacation book and who are familiar with the LA celebrity scene should be very happy with "The Starter Wife." It's the closest I could get to buying a plane ticket to LAX and walking around Malibu in Uggs. 
 These guys are the best group out right now. Every single rapper is AMAZING even Bizarre who is not great so far as flow but probably has the funniest lyrics. This album brought me some of my favorite songs to date including Sh*t Can Happen, Pistol Pistol, Ain't Nuttin' But Music, American Psycho, Fight Music & Revelation. My favorite rappers are Swifty & Eminem but the fact is every one should have a solo album out by now (besides Em, only Proof (R.I.P.) & Bizarre do... which are my least favorite rappers in the group) Every song is great even the skits are enjoyable. If you don't have this yet, you are missing out on one of the best cds ever 
 Easy to set up and easy to use.  We recently upgraded to a different Kodak camera and have been enjoying the EasyShare dock.  Our previous dock for a different Kodak camera was going strong after 4 years.  Highly recommended 
 From the novels of this type (the romantic classics) that I have read, I would say this is one of the better ones.  Her other book Wuthering Heights (that I read few years before this), left me baffled at the notion that that was a love story.  Jane Eyre, however, is a true love story.  It is beautifully written, and Bronte does a wonderful job in developing the character: Jane.  By the end I felt I knew her.    The book is quite lengthy, which is its only fault.  There are many places in the book that could have been shortened.  I tried to read the book a second time, but I managed to get only a third way through.    It is a lovely story.  I recommend it if you hunger for a love story.  It is lengthy, so some patience is needed at times, but it is well worth it. 
 What a gem! You will be inspired by this book.  From the title you might think this was going to be another rant against the Left with the usual diatribe. Had I not seen Ben Stein's discussion on C-SPAN I would never have thought of buying this book. But he presented himself so well in front of a fairly hostile university crowd that I was compelled to read the book.   The book is as impressive as his discussion. He demonstrates a thorough knowledge of history which he effectively uses to debunk the rhetoric of the Left. But even more important you feel a renewed sense of pride in the America we thought was lost in the years of media glorification of all sensational.  What strikes you when you read the book is the sense of patriotism and fair mindedness that the authors bring. Stein's heritage and current mindset make him a prime candidate to be in the ranks of the Democrats - namely his compassion, concern for the weak, and his love of justice - and all of this comes out loud and clear. The authors simply lay out why such a position is more suited to today's conservative mindset.  Throughout the book we also are presented with quotes from a variety of the Left's notables which should appall any but the most fervent partisan. Most of the quotes are scandalous when you take your 'rhetoric filters' off, such as Sharpton's 1994 quote, "White folks was in caves while we was building empires... We taught philosophy and astrology and mathematics before Socrates and them Greek homos ever got around to it." - Sharpton makes white neo-Nazi revisionists sound intelligent. Simply put this book proves that our nation is under attack by the Left and is a more serious threat than the terrorists.   Even if you are not convinced that you should reconsider your affiliations, you will be forced to reconsider your acceptance of many assertions such as the degree of poverty that exists in our country. The coverage of the spectrum of topics is clear and readable. Stein's wry wit is in evidence and completely enjoyable, such as a reference to his performance in 'Ferris Buehler's Day Off'.  My wife also read the book and is in awe of the level of arrogance that leaders like Al Gore exhibit and that as many citizens of our nation could buy into his positions. She also finds as do I that Stein offers a more reasoned and practical approach to the important political issues that surround us today.  The promise of the book is not just to expose the lies we have been fed, but also to offer a solution and an answer to the question of 'Can America Survive?'. The answer is a resounding yes primarily through education. We are given great reasons to embrace reasoned patriotism, reject the self hatred espoused by the Left, and a sound bibliography of books and other resources to draw from to help in that renewal.   After reading this book I have a renewed respect for imparting to my children our pride in this great country and I also have answers to the ugly messages that are being sent by those who loathe us. My hope is that the book's message will so resonate with the American public that the Democratic Party will rebuild itself to become a worthy opponent to the Republican Party, since our successful political system is built upon the balance of two strong parties that seek the good and welfare of the people. 
 This is an O'Reilly publication, although it lacks their characteristic animal on the cover. It is a fabulous book. While most Project Management books focus on helping you pass the PMI test, this book is focused on real life and has extensive chapters on dealing with difficult situations and so-called "difficult people" 
 This book surpassed my expectations!  The 45 lessons are not only useful to teachers who use lit circles in their classrooms, but they will be useful to teachers who ever have their students work in groups.  I cannot reccommend this book highly enough. 
 Malgudi Days was my introduction to R.K. Narayan and frankly I have been wondering where he's been all my life. These stories are wonderful. They are the kind of stories that will stay with me for several days after reading them. Narayan brings you to a time and a place with each story. His characters are believable, his stories moving, his writing impeccable. Each story is full of humanity. I love this classic author! I really enjoyed this collection and look forward to reading more of his work 
 British producer Jack Good had an idea for a music show he wanted to launch in the States: the show would encompass performers from various fields of music and showcase them in the best and most exciting manner.   Thus one show had the Hondells, Bobby Sherman the Blossoms, of course AND  Clara Ward and her gospel singers! Motown also was a great part of the  Shindig! mix.  This edition will treat you to a young Mary Wells singing  "My Guy" with The Blossoms and The Wellingtons backing her up.   The Temptin' Temptations perform a live (not lip-synced) version of  "My Girl" that obviously had a lot of girls in the audience  revved up as they can be heard screaming joyously!  Martha Reeves and the  Vandellas perform a sizzling version of "Nowhere to Run" and the  Four Tops whirl through a kinetic "It's the Same Old Song."  I'm  sure you'll dig the Supremes as you'll see 'em standing high while  performing a fantastic "Stop! in the Name of Love," which was the  Shindig! Pick Hit of the Week! Also, Marvin Gaye delivers princely  deliveries of "How Sweet It Is," (one of the most elegant  performances I've come across) and the exciting "Can I Get a  Witness."  If there is any justice, Rhino will put out more of these  tapes (and if so, please include the Marvelettes! 
 My wife and I read all of the reviews about how bad the binding was on this book. We debated about ordering it and decided to anyway, despite the quality, because my daughter absolutely loves the stories.  Upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised to find the book was in excellent shape. I could see where the binding had originally been made poorly, but they had rebound the book very well correcting the problem. We are very pleased with it and I recommend this book to anyone with children young and old. I still like the stories even at 40 and remember when my parents use to read them to me. 
 This is absolutely one of the best systematic theologies out there.  Like Halden mentions below, this book (both volumes in fact) are useful in concert with Colin Gunton and Wolfhart Pannenberg, and to various extents Kevin Vanhoozer, especially in his notions of the dramatis personae of God's activity with us in history, His "dramatic coherence," (and in this respect, would be a good read alongside von Balthazar)  Jenson begins his prolegomena by outlining what he sees as a deficiency in traditional prolegomenal issues that see Christian thought as an inherently problematic enterprise that must be validated antecedently by "more secure" foundations (e.g. the processes of neo-protestantism bred by Schliermachers defintion of religion as a feeling of absolute dependece, or the so called "greek proof," where much of Christian thinking has been based on supposedly rational inquiry of the Greek period, which Jenson notes, is no more universal than the historically situated expressions in the Bible.)  Rather, with Pannenberg, Plantinga, and others (even Heidegger!), Jenson understands that if true, the Bible knows God, the one basic "fact" of all reality, and so theology must be either a foundational discipline or an illusion.  That said, the entire program of this book is based on overcoming basic theological notions that seem to have been held out from Greek antiquity, especially static unterstandings of God's immutability and eternity.  Rather, Jenson's emphasis is on an active and living God (thought one should not misread Jenson as a panentheist or process philosopher)   Other examples include Jenson's reorientation of our notions of infinity.  Much like Pannenbergs adoption of the Hegelian postulation for the "true infinite," Jenson shies away from traditional understandings (based on a large part on the aristotelian and platonic leanings of Thomist and post-Thomist scholasticism) of God's infinity as lacking all boundaries.  Rather, along with Gregory of Nyssa (and Duns Scotus, among others) God is infinite not because He lacks boundaries, but because He overcomes all boundaries.  This leads the way for Jenson's concept of eternity as an embrace of time, in such a way that we are led from a strictly linear conception (such as Aristotle's conception of eternity as an endless line stretching past and future) or as a static timelessness (like Plato and Aristotle's eternity proper, adopted in large part by Augustine) Rather, God is eternal because He is unbounded by past events, nor is He limited by future occurance, rather He (specifically the Holy Spirit) is the Future in that He unrestrictedly anticipates His ends and means.  In this sense we see that Eternity is a derivative of Jenson's concept of infinity.  He is unboundedly lively, "A Temporal Infinity," no temporal metric may keep pace with Him.  Jenson also formulates his notion in such a way that the embrace of time makes God's events in time their own presupposition in God's eternity, so that, strictly speaking, the power that enables Jesus to be resurrected, is in fact, that God unrestrctedly participates already in the resurrection of Jesus.  This seems circular, says Jenson, only if we maintain a strictly linear conception of eternity.  Rather, God's eternity is an eternal LIFE, rather than a static aloofness.  I have to criticize Jenson at this point, because it seems insufficient to merely term God's eternity as "temporal infinity," for, echoing Pannenbergs criticism of Jenson's understanding, God does not merely unrestrictedly anticipate the future, but rather that future is already achieved for God, nor indeed does the past slip away for God (as Jenson seems to say, while nonetheless modifying this understanding that God is not limited by the actualization of events in the past because of his infinite overcoming).  Rather I would adopt Pannenbergs understanding of eternity as the simultaneous possession (or authentic possession) of the fullness of life, so that we may adopt Jenson's positive insights without thereby falling into the trap of seeing a future that God does not yet actually possess (even if He anticipates it in an unrestricted way because the Spirit is the transforming future of God)  Other aspects of Jenson's work are quite involved (especially his sections "On One Being with the Father," and his chapter on the being of God, are particularly interesting for their interaction with philosophers like Heidegger and Aquinas)  Jenson's understanding of the Trinity as the dramatis personae dei (characters of the drama of God) is also illuminating, and Jenson has insights similar to others in the field (i.e. Pannenberg, Gunton, Grenz, Moltmann etc...) of the mutual reciprocities of distinction within the Trinity, so that each would not be themselves if not for the reciprocal distinction to and for the others.  Just so Jenson's Christology is similar to Pannenberg's when He understands that Christ defers reference from Himself to the Father, and is so doing is a perfect correlate to the Father.  He expands this in his own erudite way, explaining the destinctions with the other two as well, significantly noting the problem with traditional understanding of the Trinity is that the terminology and logic is couched in terms of relations of origin, rather than also considering the active relations of the persons in History.  An illuminating piece of scholarship as well is Jenson's discussion on the particular problems inherent in identifying a "three-in-one" God.  Why, when we have three instances of the Divine ousia (essence) do we not then have three Gods?  "God," says Jenson (following Gregory of Nyssa) "is a predicate."  and thus how many Gods we assert depends on how many subjects we attribute to it.  "There are three instances of the divine ousia but these are not three gods--as three instances of humanity are trhee human beings--because God is not a word for the divine ousia;...There are three instances of divine ousia does not itself imply there are three gods because divine ousia and god do not have the same referent.  Rather, God...refers to the mutual action of the identities...to the perichoretic triune life. And since all divine action is the singular mutual work of the Father, Son, and Spirit, there is only one such life and therefore only one subject of the predicate God."    On a final note, I have to also mention that despite Jenson's brilliance here with his work on the Trinity, he seems to maintain terminology of subsistant relation, attempting to re-utilize (in a clearer and more complex way) Augustine's psychological analogies.  While this isn't entirely innapropriate due to the context Jenson puts it in (which seems to recall Pannenberg's discussion of ecstatic relationships between the members of the trinity) Jenson nonetheless ends up calling the Trinity "a person," which, despite Jenson's complex argument, didnt convince me, and so I once again defer understanding to Pannenberg, who says that we cannot understand the Trinity as a person, rather the trinity is impersonal in the sense that Robert Jenson would use for "God," being a predicate of the Triune action instead of itself a referent.  This book is highly recommended especially for those who enjoy philosophical theology and explanations of historical evolution of thought in the church.     
 I seriously loved this album.  While people like Alanna Nash may refer to it as a "walking cacophony" and "mess," I found it diverse and a real stretch for Hill. I personally enjoyed this album the most when it came out.  I have been and always will be a fan of Faith's. She's got a real way of connecting with her fans and women, alike.  Of my personal feelings on this album, "Free" was a fun 70s-ish dance anthem, and I certainly enjoyed "Cry," a remake of the beautiful song by Angie Aparo. "One" was a reach out to the R&B side of country music, as was "If You're Gonna Fly Away" and "I Think I Will," which was admirable, as was "When the Lights Go Down". I thought "Beautiful" and "Unsaveable" were OK, but I really enjoyed the power ballad "Baby You Belong." And to all the nay-sayers who put down this album, there was "Stronger", a great old broken-hearted country ballad. As for her ballads, I seriosuly enjoyed "You're Still Here." I loved "Back to You" and "This is Me" and "If This is the End," although neither ever hit the charts, I felt they were the best songs out of the whole thing, they gave me chills.   I think maybe, some people's opinions of an artist in the tabloids contribute to their reviews of their work. And that's pretty sad 
 What a great book!  You will learn how Tark became a legend at UNLV by making a name for himself in the JUCO ranks.  However, the best part of the book is reading about how coaches around the nation take advantage of prospective student-athletes or "recruits".  Find out how John Wooden would "seal the deal".  Does your mother need a dentist?  No problem... if you are a top talent.  Seriously, if you are intrigued by stories of a coach talking about recruits, Frank Sinatra, Las Vegas, legendary coaches and the game of basketball, then this book is for you 
 I am reading this book aloud to my 4th grade class.  The students really love the story.  They often ask me to read another chapter!  I love Kate Dicamillo's writing style, which helps to engage everyones thinking!  
 Simply put, this was the album that made me into a jazz trombone player. Chicago VII was the last moment in time when this prolific band got together in Colorado and decided to really stretch and redefine its music.  Chicago VII defies categorization because it is jazzy, samba, rock and pop all at once.  And nobody should feel the need to make apologies for the pop tracks on this great double album...that was part of the landscape in those days, especially when the band was trying to show their range and musicianship.  The double album would have been worth the purchase price just for "Byblos" alone.  What a great song by Terry Kath that still haunts me to this day.  I still think that Byblos is the most under rated Chicago song of all time, and I've often wondered why it wasn't released as a single as well?  Can you imagine what an impact this song would have had during the mid-70s on the music scene had it been heard by a larger audience?    Chicago was never same after Kath's death later in the decade, but in reality, it was never the same after Chicago VII.  This album is just as vibrant today as it was on its original release date.  The band has become unfairly become known as a sappy ballad band, but those who really know Chicago's work know that "Chicago Transit Authority", "Chicago II" and "Chicago VII" leave a legacy of greatness for this group that can't be washed away by later disasters.  This is a must have CD 
 I have never read "urban fantasy" before, but the moment I picked this novel up, I fell in love.  Windling's portrayal of the southwest and its desert painted a clear picture in my mind and now I have a yearning to go there.  I always imagined this area to be dry, sandy, with cacti and rattlesnakes, but she made me feel that something spiritual can be found there.  I recommend this novel to anyone interested in fantasy, mythology & southwest literature 
 If you watch this movie, you must open your mind and expect anything 
 This is a wonderful movie. It had good acting, an original storyline, and the directing was oscar worthy. I think this might be Natalie Portman's best film 
 I'm surprised by the high quality of this album considering it is a product of the Idol franchise. You can tell a lot of effort and care was made into creating this first album. Anthony sounds terrific and really showcases his range in the songs. Especially "The Prayer" was arranged wonderfully and note worthy. I look forward to following this power-singer's career. It was worth the high cost of importing 
 Walking the busy malls to the multichannel Muzak of every old Christmas song interpreted in hiphop, jazz, idiosyncratic 'rethinkings' by famous soloists as well as replays of Gene Autry, Bing Crosby etc., it is a relief to return home (or if fortunate, to the concert hall) and hear the more uplifting music of the season through the ages. And despite reliance on some old favorite Messiah recordings, and carols by Kings College Choir, the one CD that seems to reign supreme is this Chanticleer release SING WE CHRISTMAS from 1995!    These twelve male voices create an ambience that can only be labeled 'spiritual', so resonant and  exquisitely performed are each of the generous works on this recording.  The moods pass through Praetorius, Victoria, Bach and traditional carols of unknown authorship to works by Ives, Billings, Holst, Guerrero, Howells and Sametz.  The repertoire is both familiar and rarely heard and the result of combining all these forms is the truest form of Christmas spirit on record: this is music to cleanse the Muzak blitz!  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, December 05  
 As a high school librarian I'm always on the look out for exemplary new titles for young adults, particularly for boys.  Black & White is one I'll be sharing a lot this year.  Marcus and Eddie are best friends and a force to be reckoned with on the basketball court.  Theirs is a story of racial prejudice, character, friendship, taking responsibility, and fairness. There's a bit of romance in it, too. There is much here for kids to talk about and the book is sure to spark discussion. While the ending is hopeful, it certainly isn't  tidy or predictable.   
 Why buy a book on Windows XP with VISTA coming soon?  Unless forced to, I am sticking with XP and not going to VISTA.  After several years of use, I finally have XP working the way I want.  I have spent many hours tweaking my system for improved security and efficiency.  Even so, this book which I bought in November 2006 has hundreds of tips I would not have discovered on my own.  Nearly all of the tips are useful to the power user.  The advice is solid and much easier to access than the Windows Knowledge Base or even searching the net.  Plus the book is not biased by the MS party line.  The book should be titled "How to get the most out of Windows XP".  Based on my experience, this book is definitely a best-buy recommendation.  While I am ranting, I should add that I bought this book after the napster cat appeared in my version of Windows Media Player.  It was either there all along, and I never noticed it, or it showed up after one of the ubiquitous MS updates.  I am a business user and not interested in outline content stores.  In fact, the cat is embarassing to me when I use media player in presentations.  I resent the fact that MS would build this commercialism into Media Player without an easy option to eliminate it for those of us who do not wish to be solicited.  I also resent the fact that MS uses OS updates to change my settings in favor of their own products 
 "Brand New Teacher" has really helped me in preparing to be a great teacher. If your elementary education read this book!  It helped me to discover the art or teaching.  I think it will help new and experienced teachers in the classroom. I'm new to the profession and have found it very helpful. I have read lots of elementary education books. This text seems to be the most practical I've found. It is also an easy read. I highly recommend this book.  
 'Birdhouse' drew me in with its sweet beat. Still not sure if it's a love letter or not, but great stuff. Their music is light with the briefest hint of vinegar--just the way I like it. However, the song that made me want to jump on the table was 'racist friend'. I heard it one night as I left a very similar situation at a friend's house. As an African-American girl, my lifelong devotion to this band started that night.To hear two white guys say they can't listen to someone's racist friend is supercalafragilisticexpialigocious. Rest of the album's great too. It only seems nerdy, but the lyrics are clever, offbeat, and unexpectedly observant. Go buy it now 
 In this collection, you'll AVENGERS VOL. 1 # 141-144, 147-149. #'s 145-146 is a different story arc because of deadlines I suppose.  Anyway, in this collection the Avengers are faced with double trouble: to intercept KANG THE CONQUEROR'S plan to rule the world by going to the 19th century and a crisis in the present time with the ROXXON CORPORATION. Issue # 141 is the set up of the twin crisis, #142-143 deals with the 19th century and 144, 147-150 deals with the climax of the SQUADRON SUPREME saga. THOR AND MOONDRAGON 9with IMMORTUS' assistance)travel back in time to find their teamate HAWKEYE in the western era. They encounter Marvel's greatest western heroes: TWO GUN KID, KID COLT, RAWHIDE KID, RINGO ETC in a struggle against Kang. The final one on one battle between kang and THE MIGHTY THOR was short but sweet as well as when they took the TWO GUN KID back with them to the 20th century. As a kid, this was one of the very first times I have really seen THE VISION against 3 Squadron members including their most poerful member: HYPERION, and quite literally ran over him. The other battles with CAPTAIN AMERICA, IRON MAN , THE BEAST & THE HELLCAT (this is also the very first time Patsy Walker donned the Catsuit)against DOC SPECTRUM, THE WHIZZER, AMPHIBION, TOM THUMB ETC(JLA RIP -OFFS). were also well drawn and quite fast-paced ala GEORGE PEREZ(one of my favorite artists) THE HIGHTLIGHT OF THIS COLLECTION I BELIEVE IS: Thor taking on Kang alone, The Vision taking on HYPERION(marvel's Superman rip-off)and the first appearance of the Hellcat. A good read for any 70's comic fan. It was well beyond its time.  Also: DO NOT MISS STRACYNSKI'S SUPREME POWER, starring HYPERION.  I have the comic collection, get the T 
 Another good read from the pen of Tony Hillerman!! Very enjoyable 
 This dvd brings me back to when I was growing up in the 70's. I am happy to share this with my kids.  Who can forget the baby puppets in the hospital window trying to figure out if they are boys or girls or Rosie Greer singing "It's Alright to Cry."  One of the highlights is the duet by Roberta Flack and a young Michael Jackson singing "You Don't Have to Change at All."  I am so happy I am able to have this piece of my childhood to share.   
 This book will certainly have you turning pages through the first 350 pages.  The last 100 or so seem a bit anti-climatctic, but this book is a gem anyway.  In it we have two main adventures.  The first part of the book is devoted to beautiful Luxor and tomb robbers, murder and mayhem.  The second part puts the Emersons right in the thick of World War I intrigue between England and Turkey, and puts all of them, especially Ramses in grave danger.  But as usual, through all the suspense you will laugh throughout.  These characters that Ms. Peters has created are so life-like that they jump out of the pages at you and inhabit your heart.  What a wonderful series this is 
 Hey, does anyone know how I can get the original version of this movie? That starts out with a long view of the sub barracks, gives a glimpse of Baldwin meeting Connery at an embassy party in DC, builds up the radiation badge issue, and so on.  I must have seen this movie before they trimmed it down for broad issue.  "Directors cut" does not appear to have this.  Any ideas?  As we all know, it's a great movie no matter what edition we view 
 The Anita Blake books are very, very good.  They are one of the best in this genre along with Kelly Armstrong and Kim Harrison.  With the exception of Micah and Danse Macabre, I have read the AB books four times in little more than a year.  I just got the paperback version of DM and this was the second time I read it (I don't like hardcovers, they don't fit in my pocket).  Before the paperback came out I reread the series again.  This time with all these negative comments in my head.  I admit, I am fascinated with all the malice that people have posted.  Honestly, I'm not getting what all the haters are talking about.  The series progresses smoothly.  The characters grow with each book.  In the beginning AB, was young and saw the world as black and white.  Sex bad, vampires bad, etc.  As she grew, she realized the world was actually grey and she changed.  Richard thought that once he became Ulfric that everything would be better, that he could change the world he didn't want to live in to one that fit his ideals.  It didn't work out that way and he is bitter and he can't just leave this situation.  All JC cared about was power, and didn't care about what he did to get it, but that wasn't getting him want he wanted.  So he changed so he can get the power and the girl.  There are more examples, but that would make this way to long.   I didn't see an abrupt change between OB and NiC when the arduer was introduced.  It didn't jar me and make me go huh, WTF?  It was a natural transtion.  In OB I interpereted her noticing Bernardo and Det. Ramirez more than usual as the first stirrings of the arduer, but it didn't manifist because she had walled off that part of her power.  When JC, Richard, and AB married the marks in NiC the arduer was out of the bottle.  There is more sex, but I like it.  LKH writes it well and I think that it doesn't detract from the story.  It's something new for AB to have to deal with.    Now, I'm not saying that the books or LKH are 100%perfect.  She does tend to reuse phrases throughout the series and there are editing errors, but really sometimes I don't notice them.  I read ID four times and didn't notice "isle" until I read about it in this forum.  If I do notice them, they aren't bad enough that I have to puzzle them out.  I know what was meant and move on.  People have a right not to like the way the books are going, even express that opinion, but the personal attacks on LKH are insane.  I didn't even know that she had an ex-husband and remarried until I read that bizarre theory here that her first husband wrote the first few books and when they divorced she had to write the next books w/o him.  That's just plain mean.  Due to the personal nature of the critism I understand why LKH is so blunt as to tell  people not to read her books if they don't like them.  She is right and I applaud her for saying so instead of trying to placate a small portion of people who hate the books.  In conclusion, read the books!  Don't let the negative commentary posted dissuade you from picking up these books.  In my opinion, people are more likely to take the time to complain than praise and that's why it seems like there is a lot of people who hate this book and the others in this series.  This is why I am doing something I wouldn't normally do and write a review.  I thought a positive voice should be heard 
 I ALMOST DID NOT BUY THIS DVD/CD BECAUSE OF THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS I READ ON AMAZON, HOWEVER AFTER SEEING MICHAEL BUBLE IN CONCERT , AND SEEING WHAT HE GIVES OF HIMSELF TO HIS AUDIENCE , I WANTED TO SEE ALL THERE WAS TO SEE AND BOUGHT IT, HOW BAD COULD IT BE? IT IS WONDERFUL , BESIDES HIS AMAZING TALENT , THIS DVD IS FUN, FUNKY , AND SO ENTERTAINING, YES THERE IS LOTS OF CAMERA MOVEMENT , WITH OFF STAGE ANTICS INTERSPURSED WITH ON STAGE MUSIC, NOT THE TYPICAL CONCERT DVD, FOR THAT GET THE WONDERFUL "CAUGHT IN THE ACT" BUT ANYONE WHO WANTS TO SEE ANOTHER SIDE OF THIS YOUNG, TALENTED, HUMBLE, GIVING, ENTERTAINER SEE THIS AND ENJOY !!! GLAD I DECIDED YES!!! 
 Ok, lets get past the fact that this girl will turn out to be the next gwen stafani - she's smoking hot. The music rocks too, the lyrics are heartfelt, they are not as cheesey as they appear to be, this is a solid release. 16-years-old, right at the prime of the suffring years - perfect for songs that tug at your heart strings. The whole band is talented. The song structures may be basic, but damn they get stuck in your head. And they sound just as good live - this girl can sing! 
 Everyone should read this book. If you live in rural America, or in a big city - or pondering the thought of commuting? - READ THIS BOOK. I couldn't put this book down once I got my hands on it. It is full of wonderful tips,  presented in a very "easy-read" and entertaining format. Jam  packed with common sense tips, some you might have known, some never  thought about it. I've seen it in many a bike shop, and even the most  experienced cyclist have agreed with me ... GREAT BOOK 
 In an insightful collection of memories, acute observations and multicultural folklore, Uruguyan writer Eduardo Galeano has recorded a witty and compassionate view of human nature in "Voices of Time: A Life in Stories."  Throughout this intriguing compilation of 333 vignettes, averaging several paragraphs, and none longer than a page and a half, Galeano has weaved together moments of his life, along with those of history, into an assortment of revelations and discoveries that can tug on the readers' heartstrings, or propel them into disappointment over the state of world affairs.  While it would be impossible for an author, even one of Galeano's stature, to make every story poignant, he does manage to have more hits than misses. His first stories center around the beginning of man's time on earth, when blue algae, after a million years, decided to turn green, and "...bit by bit, the green algae begat lichens, mushrooms, mold, medusas, and all the color and sound that came later, as did we, to unsettle the sea and the land."  Galeano's description on man's time on earth is equally thought provoking: "...the first human gesture is the embrace. After coming into the world, at the beginning of their days, babies wave their arms as if seeking someone. Other doctors, who work with people who have already lived their lives, say that the aged, at the end of their days, die trying to raise their arms. And that's it, that's all, no matter how hard we strive or how many words we pile on. Everything comes down to this: between two flutterings, with no more explanation, the voyage occurs."  Galeano has earned an international reputation as a fearless commentator on our social and political lives. The winner of the first Lannan Foundation Cultural Freedom Prize in 1998, he is one of Latin America's foremost writers, as well as a distinguished journalist and historian. He is the author of "Upside Down," the "Memory of Fire" trilogy (for which he won the 1989 American Book Award), "Open Veins of Latin America" and many other works.  "Voices of Time" follows the writing style he perfected in "Memory of Fire" by using sentences in a hypnotic poetic rhythm that mixes irony and moral judgment. Alas, Galeano doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of life, and the outcome of his tales don't always contain the bright uplifting finale we want our life to possess, as in the story, Father.   "Vera stayed home from school and spent the entire day indoors. At dusk, she wrote her father a letter. He was in the hospital, quite ill. She wrote, "You must like yourself, take care of yourself, look out for yourself, spoil yourself, forgive yourself, love yourself, cherish yourself. I'll like you, I'll take care of you, I'll look out for you, I'll spoil you, I'll forgive you, I'll love you, I'll cherish you." Hector Carnevale lasted a few days more. Then, with his daughter's letter under his pillow, he departed in his sleep."  Images of the art of Peru's Cajamarca region accompany many of the stories, leading the reader into deeper retrospection. According to Galeano, these works, painted, etched, or carved anonymously, were collect by Alfredo Mires Ortiz in the course of many years of exploration and discovery. Some of them are thousands of years old, but look as fresh as if they were made last week.  The vignettes in "Voices of Time" have many meanings, literally and symbolically. Galeano has bared his life's soul for all to see, and the view is quite remarkable. 
 I love Mindy Starns Clark's book. I have read ALL of her books and I love everyone of them. I hope that she writes more books. Lets keep our fingers crossed 
  If you were to read only one text dealing with the great Michelangelo and his art, this would be the book.  It is a succinct biography in which one also finds clear and well chosen discussions of the artistic works of the great Florentine.  It would be fair to say that Professor Hibbard is a graceful guide to these works--he shows us the key elements of the sculpture, painting and architecture that made Michelangelo the preeminent figure of the Renaissance.  And he presents them to us as the artist's life unfolds, so that we can understand the challenges met and problems solved at various stages in Michelangelo's development.  The book is filled with a large number of black and white photographs as well as plans and drawings which, together, help the reader understand each of the works being discussed.  Indeed, the reader would be hard pressed to find more than a handful of opposing pages that do not have one or more illustrations.  For those who are so inclined and long to see more of each work, they are titled so clearly that a quick search on line can bring plenty more to look at.  But the illustrations provided in the book are more than sufficient for the reader's understanding.   If you are looking for a shocking expose of Michelangelo the man, with all of his secrets revealed (warts and all!), then you do not want to read this book.  Professor Hibbard discusses Michelangelo's personality and personal life in detail, but always in the context of his creations.  He writes with a deft and gentlemanly reserve that allows the reader to accept the facts without drawing unreasonable conclusions.  The conversations about the well-known works - the Pieta, the David, the Sistine Chapel ceiling and Last Judgment - are all clear and helpful.  The on and off again relationships with various Medici and Popes provides a helpful understanding of how and why some of the artist's projects were unfinished, or completed in terms altogether different from their conception.  The discussions of the architectural contributions of Michelangelo are very good, and provide the reader with an appreciation of the sculptural qualities of these larger than life sculptures.  Indeed, Hibbard's discussion of the Bibliotheca Laurenziana stairway and St Peter's are the best sort of architectural criticism to be found anywhere.  At the end of the book, but separate from the extensive bibliography, is a section called "Notes for Further Reading", which, if followed, could benefit the reader who wants to know more.  If you find this review hepful, why not read some of my other reviews!  Happy reading! 
 Each victim is being bitten after death by teeth that seem to resemble  those that might be found on some monster. This is the story of a serial  killer set in Scotland that puts its hooks in at the start. I finished this  in two sittings because I couldn't wait to find out what was going to take  place next. A well-crafted mystery series. John Rebus, the Scottish  policeman is a wonderful and lasting character 
 This was by far the most helpful book in my preparation for the LSAT.  While I scored fairly high in several practice tests before I picked up this book, my scores varied by several points because I was inconsistent in the logic games section.  Learning and practicing methods for setting up the logic games helped to improve both my scores and consistency.  The logic games section is possibly the most learnable section of the LSAT.   This is the best book, hands down, for learning and practicing how to handle each game 
 I bought this book about a year ago and still go back and review. John's examples in the book are broad enough that it covers most people interests. His techniques and tips are clearly explained. I also LOVE his ability to create textures and brickwork. He teaches the basics but also covers basic design work. I currently own about 35 watercolor books and this one is still one of my alltime favorites. I would highly recommend this book. And also suggest that anyone enjoying his work, visit his website and check out his CD's. I own them both and love them 
 This book is a time capsule of a very different Las Vegas.  The Vegas of the late 70's and early 80's was centered around the downtown area, with none of the all-encompassing resorts on the Strip.  This is the heyday of Binion's Horseshoe, when Benny Binion was holding court at the most over-the-top gambling paradise.  Unlike other casinos, the Horseshoe had to limits on the bets it would accepts and played host to the most outrageous gamblers and bets of the time.  All the greats of poker legend appear here--Johnny Moss and Nick the Greek Dandalos in their 1949 many-weeks-long marathon multi-million dollar game, Doyle Brunson, wacky cowboy gambler Amarillo Slim Preston, and formidable strategist Jack Strauss, among others.  This is a must-read for any poker player.  For a modern look inside the World Series of Poker, try James McManus's Positively Fifth Street

I personally feel, work never has a dead end but life's frustration do! And this is where Robert's insights are really helpful to be a success and re-think over working Damn hard as its endless. There is a time for let-go and just do nothing sometimes to rejuvenate oneself again and Robert's book is a tip on ice-berg `Work wonders, work wise ways' and there you scale higher to achieve in this economy crunch  - all gains and no pains. I personally recommend this book for workoholic Businessmen and management leaders. A must rea 
 Okay, it's funky in looks - but the closest I came to an equivalent was 2.5X times the price with a LOT less features.  Its hammy distortion and echo are actually fun and replace a couple of external pedals and the unit connects easily with simple instrument cables to your guitar or bass guitar or keyboards or whatever.  You practice in peace and quiet.  But WAIT!  It comes with a mini-jack AND a set of headphones.  I've got an iPod and loads of headphones - these are actually a GOOD set of (stereo) headphones well worth the price of the unit itself.  It comes with its own battery - no disappoint-ment for a giftee!  But the other cool trick is that you can hook it and its "effects" back through to an instrument amp with an extra cable -  How Fun Is That? - VERY 
 This guy is one of the best in Modern Rap because Akrobatik has the dopest beats, and all with original, meaningful, and inspiring lyrics. Akrobatik doesn't rap about the Money, Cars, the Women, or the hood. Instead, he rebels against it. Hence, the title track, "Balance." The minute you hear that track, not to mention the rest of the album, you're listning to one of the most underrated rap artists today. The guy is also clever enough to include all the names of the album tracks rapping it all in one verse on the intro. And he's the best rapper I've heard represting BOSTON BABY, YEAAAH! Yes, it's true, this guy really would murder Benzino in a battle 
 As an aging hippie, this album brings back sooo many memories.  The songs are also extremely relevant today since so many of Leon's early works were protest songs over the Vietnam war.   The CD itself doesn't have the best sound quality - hasn't been enhanced at all - but it is as good or better than the old vinyl album.   If you want to get an old hippie on his/her feet dancing, put on this CD and crank up the sound all the way.

 The Devil's Disciples is well-researched study presented in a pleasant, readable style. One of the problems with many of the Salem witch trial books is that the authors try to ascribe the entire phenomenon to only a single cause. Hoffer successfully examines various possibilities and integrates them, showing how a multitude of factors conspired to generate and sustain the hysteria. The information he provides regarding the personalities and experiences of key individuals is particularly interesting. His assessment of frontier conditions at the time helps the reader take the perspective and mind-set of the town.  Well worth reading, especially if some of the older, better-known resources, such as John Demos' Entertaining Satan, are familiar 
 after listening to legend of the liquid sword, i was thinking gza has lost his fire. that was before i listened to grandmasters. this cd put my assumption in the trash can. gza came back and makin you bobbin your head. the tracks were awesome and with A+ production (muggs) pretty much untouchable. this is one of the top albums released this year hands down.

 The Year was 1991, Prince had released 2 consecutive albums that weren't that good. The Batman soundtrack and Graffiti Bridge to his movie that flopped. This time around he had found a new band "The Power Generation" and had added a new more hip hop influented sound. Basically, the days of catchy pop-funk were gone and he had joined the hip hop revolution. Read on to find out the result.  Diamonds and Pearls is a new chapter of Prince music, although we already had seen hints of that on Graffiti Bridge in 1990, it fully came out here. A very hip hop influented album recorded with new band the Power Generation. It does have other infleunts aswell and some songs still sound like in the late 80's but it's difficult to not point of the sound of hip hop he's added here, almost like a re-born Prince. The album "Diamonds and Pearls" was a big hit, and not surprising with all the good songs it has. Although his top albums of the 80's where slighyly better this got enough good songs to be called "Near Masterpiece".  "Thunder" is a psychedelic-funk song where the hook "Thunder - all thru the night,Promise to see Jesus in the morning light,Take my hand, it'll be alright, C'mon save your soul tonight" is defenitely about religion. "Daddy Pop" got hip hop all over it. If You like songs like "Get Off" you'll this one too. The title track is magnificient. It's a sensual ballad and yet somehwat pompous and duet with Rosie Gaines. Not surprising it was a big hit. "Cream" is one of those trademarks songs about sex, this funky number was another hit single. "Strollin" is a slow and sensual retro-soulish song where Prince sings in falsetto. It got these jazzy infleunces too. "Willing and Able" got gospel choirs in the back and accoustic guitars. A very good song on it's own right.  "Gett Off", with it's hip hop influented sound and introduction of NPG doesn't need further presentation. A big hit and a funky hip hopish number with very explicit lyrics. "Walk Don't Talk" is funny, and it's extremly catchy and it adds sound fom cars. "JugHeads" is hip hop sounding with raps and cool sounds, but it's one of the weaker songs here, but Prince raps on here. "Money Don't Matter Tonight" is a wonderful romantic ballad, it takes up issues like gambling, finding partners for invetsment and killing kids in order to control oil supply. The message is clear though, it's far more important to have a soul then to have cash. "Push" is another hip hop sounding sound, and like the other simular one's it's catchy but lacks a good hook. "Insatiable" is a great erotic slow jam with horns. Lush and beautiful. "Live 4 Love" is another hip hop sounding song, starts with an original robotic countdown. This one also offers a psychedelic guitar solo and a rap. A beautiful closer to a near-masterpiece.  Conclusion, Diamonds and Pearls was a new chapter in Prince's music, he joined the hip hop revolution of the early 90's where basically all hip music had a flavour of hip hop. However, not all songs are hip hop sounding, many still sound like the old Prince of the mid 80's. As a result this album is very rich and is full of variety. Psychedelics, Hip Hop, Romantic Soul and Pop. Perhaps it sound a little unfocused but in the end it's a fantastic album where Prince shows all of his sides, also a big commerical hit. Must have.   
 The speck skin tight cover is easy to put on and really helps protect from the minor bumps and bangs.  The screen protector is also nice, as it seems like it would be easy to scratch without it.  It does add some bulk to the Nano, but it makes me feel much better about tossing it in a pocket, bag or on a table...well worth the investment 
 This is a great book for a beginning guitarist. I have only been using it for a few weeks, and I have noticed a lot of improvement. As long as you do all the exercises several times until you get them straight, you will improve a lot. Because of this book, I will look into getting Vol. 2, also 
 I really enjoyed the simple and straight forward story of how the Nobel Prize winners Watson (the author) and Crick (who the book is dedicated to) discovered the genetic code.  It is a very readable story of how two scientists from different disciplines came together to reveal one of the great mysteries of life: how genetic traits are inhereted; and how this DNA makes all life on earth possible.  James Watson is a humble scientist and wonderful writer.  Science needs more like him and less of the other kind that unfortunately seem to dominate the field 
 I really thought this was a great book. True, as some reviewers have noted, the plot itself is a little predictable, though well constructed. But the value is not in where you go, but in how you get there. This book has so much insight into the game of golf and the world of professional golf that it more than makes up for any picky plot shots.  I enjoyed it thoroughly, great character development as well. I put it ahead of the Dan Jenkins book by about 325 yards 
 Oliver Sacks' An Anthropologist on Mars is a delightful and enlightening book that reveals the unparalleled complexity of the human brain.   Sacks, an accomplished neurologist and author, presents seven case studies that highlight different neurological phenomena.  In his case studies, Sacks follows a newly colorblind painter, a man who can create no new memories, a surgeon with Tourette's syndrome, a blind man who regains his sight, a painter obsessed with images from his childhood, an autistic boy artist, and a high-functioning autistic professor.  Sacks does not treat his case studies as dry medical oddities but rather discusses their neurological experiences within their broader human existence.  Unlike other authors who know their patients only distantly, Sacks works intimately with his case studies and develops meaningful relationships that translate into a deeper, more insightful understanding of his patients and their experiences.   While Sacks is clearly a brilliant neurologist, what makes this book so powerful is his ability to weave in medicine, science, history, and philosophy into a coherent narrative.  Every case study illuminates a series of important and thought-provoking questions that challenge the everyday assumptions of perception, reality, intelligence, and what it means to be human.  In the end, the reader emerges with a better appreciation of the complexity of the human mind.    The book is very well documented with copious footnotes provided throughout the book.  Occasionally, Sacks neglects to define some arcane medical terms, so readers would do well to keep a dictionary close at hand.  Overall, the book is highly accessible to the general reader who will find it intriguing and intellectually rewarding.  
 I saw Aslyn open for Chris Isaak last summer.  Usually the opening band is kind of interesting, but I just want them to get off the stage and make way for the main event.  But Aslyn sat at the piano and started belting out songs, and I was enthralled.  She had me laughing and cheering and completely amazed.  In a world full of people who want to be famous without having the talent or the drive, this girl is truly a star, and I can't wait for her next album.  If you have a chance to see her live, don't miss it 
 These glasses always attract attention (mostly when I'm not wearing them!) People are always amazed when they see me click my readers into place.  The lenses hang from a molded lucite-type back strap (this part is inflexible), and they pivot so that they point downward when not being worn. To put them on, just pivot the lenses to a 90 degree angle, lift them to your eyes, and voila, the strong magnet in the center joins the two lenses at the nose bridge. The side pieces adjust with a retractable extension that is encased in the lucite. I've lost so many pairs of readers, but these are always right there around your neck, not getting left behind at the coffeeshop counter! They are not at all compact, however, because as mentioned before, the backstrap is a molded piece. The neck/back strap also makes them a little hard to wear while reading in bed, so I put them on after getting settled in, and that seems to work just fine. And finally, even though they are not the most fashion-forward version of eyewear, their convenience and the fun of clicking them into place makes up for their clunky looks. 
 I finished this moving book a week ago, and still think about it often.  Beyond the horrors of war, so graphicly and vividly depicted so as to cure even the most hard-headed youth of war glory fantasies, I found myself haunted by the shell of the man the author had become after his experiences.  Haunted by the trauma of his experience, he has also found himself a stranger everywhere, loathed by most, and misunderstood by all, including his family.  He is a broken fragment.  He writes about relationships during the war, both romantic and friendly, with a cold finality, reflecting reality, which sticks in your gut, reminding you that life is not a movie.    I don't really have a true criticism of this book.  It is a wartime memoir of a German soldier on the Eastern front, and succeeds marvelously in this.  However, I would have liked to see a bit of reflection on what motivated Guy Sajer as a soldier.  Why was he in the Nazi army?  Did he ever question Hitler?  Did he realize that he was fighting to support a regime committing genocide?  I also wonder if he did not selectively censor out atrocities committed by the Nazis.  Buying eggs from Russian peasants, flirting with local Polish farmgirls, why the Nazis come off as downright loveable at times in this account.  I was also flabbergasted and intrigued at how he could have felt the Germans were somehow liberating France when they invaded and conquered it, and would have loved to read more of his thinking as to how he rationalized this in his 16-year old mind.   Overall, I highly recommend this book.  It is a tremendous addition to any WW II collection, and essential to understanding the other side of the conflict.  You'll have to look elsewhere though, for insights into the politics of the German army.    
 All Quiet on The Western Front is a story of World War II told from a very different perspective than we are used to, the perspective of a German soldier.  It is the story of Paul Baumer who, bored of his life, decides to join the army.  In the story the reader follow Paul from the front lines to his home and everywhere in between.  The reader also sees Paul's growth from a young up-beat teenager to a grown man who is stuck in the sort of depression that surrounds the war and everyone in it.  This transformation occurs somewhere between losing a close friend, being stuck in a trench for days of bombardments, and killing another man.  Paul's life is changed forever by this war and that is evident when he returns home and immediately becomes depressed because of how little the people there know about what is happening to all of the men in the trenches.  This story is a very tragic one and there are a lot of bad things that happen to Paul throughout his experience in the war.      This book shows us a lot about the German culture from which it emerged.  It shows us how the war created a sort of split society.  There were the people who didn't get involved in the war.  Their lives went on the same that they always had and to them the war was nothing more than a story.  But then there were the people who had fought in the war or had in some way been victimized by it.  These people's lives were changed forever.  They knew what had been going on and had experienced it.  Some of the things they had witnessed or been a part of would have had a huge impact on the rest of their lives.  Paul thinks about this split a lot and it is very clear that there is a split.     Erich Maria Remarque does an absolutely amazing job of painting a picture for the reader.  There are not many books where the reader can feel this close to the action.  We also get a great feel for the way that the soldiers had to live and what hardships they endured in their everyday lives.  There are many times when the reader will find themselves cheering for Paul and his friends which proves how good of an author Remarque is because these are people that almost everyone thinks of as the 'bad guys' of the war.  This is a great book and it has to be one of the better war novels ever written.          
 For a bilingual mother who is raising two children in three languages, and for whom our multilingual adventure has been a very rough ride so far, this has been one of the most fascinating and helpful books on the subject. I read this book with relief and the feeling that finally, finally there is a book that is cutting through superficialities to what really matters!  We parents have the choice of wrestling ourselves through tons of scientific publications, or reading yet another generalized introduction on 'what is bilingualism'. In the meantime I'm clear on what bilingualism is. But when there are problems, what then? There are very few, if no books out there, really, that dare venture into that area. Many books chew the same matter over and over and over again. They outline the typical models (one parent one language, minority vs majority language etc) as if reality is always that clear-cut for one model to apply; attempt to give a short solution ('be consistent') and leave it at that. Tokuhama's book is one of the very few ones that actually manages to go a step further and discusses in a compassionate, engaging manner the highly complex issues that a multilingual upbringing takes, taking into account the often difficult choices that we parents are confronted with.  Furthermore, there is a lot written on the topic of bi-lingualism, yet when it comes to dealing with three or more languages, the material is scant. Add problems and complications to the situation (what if the family has to relocate? what if there is speech delay? what if the child "loses" a language? etc.) and all that we have as references are tons of books on bi-lingualism which multilingual families are to resort to for advice.   Tokuhama's book with her focus on more than two languages, therefore, is a much needed book that fills a gigantic gap in the market. She not only writes with zest and humor but also with sensitivity and understanding. The cooking metaphor is witty and charming, and it illustrates well how our multilingual situation is indeed, very akin to cooking! Yet, raising multilingual children is not at all a piece of cake, and the author doesn't try to dish up Bilingualism with sugar coating, either. Instead, she reflects on her own experiences and analyzes complex case studies, provides practical advice and a plethora of resources.   With regards some critics' claim that this book is not scientific enough: Let's be honest. As a parent (and I am certain many parents share my viewpoint), I am neither interested in statistics nor lengthy, detailed discourses that attempt to prove the validity of one theory or another. Read an academic journal or other books if that is what you seek, there are plenty of them around. But don't expect a book that aims at giving advice to families to fulfill this purpose. Let me emphasize that this book is founded on solid scientific research; however, unlike many other writers, the author successfully manages to establish a link to the reality of her readers, which, to some critics, may appear to be unscientific.  As the author herself writes, her Windows of Opportunity theory adds to the already existing spectrum of theories by uniting other linguistic theories. They are not contradictory, but complementary. The Windows of Opportunity-theory gave me another, wider perspective to help me understand the complex phenomenon of multilingualism in our own lives. I found it to be a helpful and very encouraging, positive theory. Ultimately, it is up to the reader to decide which theory of multilingualism is most suitable to their personal situation.   Regarding case studies, I believe that there cannot be enough case studies in books like these. There are about as many forms of multilingualism as there are multilingual families, and by just focusing on two or three case studies to represent the majority, any book on the topic would be too generalized and superficial. _Raising Multingual Children_ , however, seems to have found just the right balance of case studies.   Given all this, I highly recommend this book to parents who seek practical advice on their multilingual situation, who need guidance through rough times, or simply seek an excellent source on further resources. If you can stomach some wit and humor besides, you will find this a rewarding reading experience. 
 Hi,  Hey, don't run to the repair shop just yet and don't kick that DVP/DVR to the curb too soon.......help is on the way!!! My DVR was giving me grief not reading or writing to discs properly until I fed it this Memorex CD/DVD Laser Lens Cleaner. WOW, it worked like magic!!! It's been nearly 3 weeks already and not a single error message and it plays and records like the day I purchased it. If you own a CDP/DVP/DVR a Memorex Laser Lens Cleaner may save you a costly trip to a repair shop......it certainly did in my case!!! Just my two cents.  -paul 
 William Ross provided the score for the 1996 movie THE EVENING STAR, which was a sequel to the 1983 movie TERMS OF ENDEARMENT. The movie is both funny and sad, a beautiful movie all around, so its no surprise there is also a truly beautiful soundtrack. Unfortunately, the soundtrack is out of print, but well worth it for those who enjoy soundtracks and or this movie. The music is stirring, it can elevate your spirits or touch your soul. Its an excellent companion to the movie, the instrumentals are breathtaking and beautiful. It might cost a bit to find this one but its worth the effort required 
 This is a very good book indeed. I found it stimulating, interesting, informative and, best of all, encouraging. It made me feel good about myself and forgiving toward others. I liked the style in which it is written - light, friendly. It is a very good book that should be on the shelf of everyone who wants 110% out of their life without having to buy into anyone else's philosophy - Mr Templar lets us make up our own mind about how we live - it's all down to the choices we make. An excellent book. 
 When the smoke of obscenity trials cleared in the 1960s, publishers were free to print well known novels like Joyce's Ulysses, Miller's Tropic of Cancer and Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover. The new freedom to write about sexually explicit topics subsequently led not only to a spate of sexploitaton novels such as Grace Metalious's Peyton Place and Harold Robbins's Carpetbaggers but also to a handful of honest, forthright novels that focused on men and women in their teens and twenties, including Thompson's Garden of Sand, Agnar Mykle's Lasso Round the Moon, and R. V. Cassill's Pretty Leslie. The sexual frankness of these novels so overshadowed their merit that they were doomed to a sniggering relegation to the back shelf. It is time to redeem them. I doubt any American writer, including Mark Twain and J. D. Salinger, has ever got inside the head of an adolescent young man more than Thompson in Garden of Sand and Tattoo. There is sex, yes, but also the ethos and the degradation of poverty and the wild hopes and expectant dreams of people without money, privilege, or an Ivy League education. Clearly, Thompson lovingly worked and reworked his writing, piling up detail upon detail, observation upon observation, all of which results in a novel much like a Breughel painting: having naturalistic characteristics but an elegaic tone. He reminds us of what growing up REALLY was like 
      Quite honestly, if you are comfortable with who you are (introverted/extroverted, whatever); then you obviously do not need to read "Party of One". If you are content and accepting of yourself as a "loner", this book is not for you.  However, if you are like me, and have spent your ENTIRE life thinking that there was something "wrong" with you because you simply prefer solitude over social interaction...then this book may change the way you feel (in a good way) about your personality. It may make you sigh with relief, "Oh my God, I am NOT the only one who feels this way. I am not a damaged person who needs to be "fixed"!  For years I have researched all kinds of social disorders, trying to find out what type of "problem" I have.  But none of them (antisocial personality, social anxiety, avoidant personality, schizoid, sociopath, shy, introvert, etc) defined ME.  This book helped me see that I have none of those mental health issues; and in fact, I am a completely normal person who just prefers to be alone.  I am now comfortable with my loner traits.     Loners are most energetic, creative, productive, happy and alive, etc. when they are by themselves. They get physically and mentally exhausted when in social situations (just as extroverts get 'energized' from them!) They don't need a therapist to "help" them.  They are not angry at society; they don't hate anyone; they empathize with the human race; they cry at heartbreaking news stories on TV; they have friends and family whom they love very much...        It's just the way their brains are "wired"...period. In most cases, healthy loners come from at least one parent who has/had loner 'traits'. They were simply born this way.       Who CARES about the grammar problems, sometimes "dry", "biting" writing style of the author, or the redundant topics! (as others have noted in their reviews).  And for those of you who commented about how "angry" the author seemed to be at all the non-Loners/extroverts of the world...I truly believe that she was just trying to create a feeling of normalcy, of relief, of solidarity for THOSE OF US who have felt like Freaks and Wierdos all of our lives.  Plus, she obviously, as a loner herself, has experienced deep pain (loners, who make up a minority of the human population, are often looked at as "Strange", no doubt!)  Coming to terms with herself as a loner in life's journey has sometimes generated 'angry' reflections on her part.  Nothing wrong with that!             If you are searching, like I was, for an explanation of your INNATE loner personality (or the personality of a spouse, child, parent, friend, etc...); YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK.  It may finally make you feel at peace with yourself.  Maybe you'll stop beating yourself up; and stop looking for a mental health "diagnosis".         This book has changed my life.  Good Luck to all fellow 'loners'... 
 I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  As with all of Ms. Didion's books, I take  my time with them, to truly cherish her writing style.  I am a huge fan of  her use of characterization, as well as her use of grammer.  (Besides this  book, I regularly recommend Play It As It Lays and Miami, two other great  books by Ms. Didion.)  Everytime I think of this book, I think of how the  brave narrator, in the course of the developments of the novel, regrets,  with the last line in the book, the opening statement she made in the  book's lead.  One of the all-time best books I've ever read, you have got  to give this book a read, too 
 Filmed entirely in NYC and some in N.J. "Donnie Brasco" is one suspensful realistic gangster film. Excellent classical soundtrack by composer Patrick Doyle. Great acting from Al Pacino and Johnny Depp portraying real life  gangster Benjamin Ruggierio, and N.Y.P.D. officer Joeseph D. Pistone. I swear at times watching this movie Pacino and Depp were the charachters and forgot that these superstar actors were acting. The late Bruno Kirby plays an excellent but lovable gangster. Mike Madsen plays a tough authentic, believable Boss Sonny Black. The story for "Donnie Brasco" was taken from the real eyewitness, and experiences of former cop Joe D. Pistone. From what I've read, and from what I've seen on tv documentaries on the real "Donnie Brasco", this movie is portrayed as close to the eyewitness accounts and experiences of Joseph D. Pistone as possibly could be portrayed. Director Mike Newell did an incredible job not only directing, but going to the real Little Italy in Manhatten and speaking to real life gangsters to get a real feel of the life that real mobsters lead. Newell really did his research on Donnie Brasco, as the result is one fine realistic gangster movie. Believe me there is nothing Hollywwood about this gangster movie. "Donnie Brasco" may not be as good as "The Godfather"  movies or "Goodfellas" but as I will tell you, it is more authentic than any of the afore mentioned movies. Donnie Brasco is gory at times. There is a scene were Donnie (officer Joe D. Pistone) was forced to cut up dead human bodies to get rid of the evidence. During this time, when the real Joseph D. Pistone was undercover (1976-1981) real gangsters in NYC were performing these horrible acts. During these times real life gangsters like Roy Demeo and his Gang were performing these violent acts at will and made quite a name for themselves in La Cosa Nostra. Even the N.Y.C. Godfather himself Paul Castellano was very intimidated by the likes of Roy Demeo and his savage gang. Castellano although intimidated, liked Demeo for his awesome earning rackets. "Donnie Brasco" brings this horrific gangster act to life as well as the illegal money rackets going on at this time. Director Mike Newell read up on Roy Demeo and his Gang and brought their actions to the screen and left Hollywood make believe far behind. All I can say is watching "Donnie Brasco" made me see the guts undercover officer Joseph D. Pistone had. It really took a special person to do what Joe did. For all his troubles, all Pistone got was a $500.00 check, a medal and a several year stay in the Witness Protection Program. Joe D. Pistone lives in annomity today as there is still a price on his head. "Donnie Brasco" is highly recommended viewing as it is portrayed realistically and authentically. Director Mike Newell definintly left the hollywood gangster out of this film........                                                                 
 This movie looks interesting from the cover but who can buy a movie based on the cover alone? Since there is no movie summary listed here, I searched the net and was able to find this:  When the Cromiers, a young married couple, move into their gorgeous new home in rural Lousiana, they feel like they've died and gone to heaven.  Unfortunately, the ghosts that haunt the house threaten to make t his a reality and as the number of inexplicable incidents rise, the family realizes they'll be lucky to get out alive. Horror. Not Rated. 85 minutes long 
 I ordered these for my father and ended up eating a few bags myself.  They are better than the ones at the candy stores!!  
 This book is more of a fantasy story then science fiction really. The tale takes the reader through multiple demensions seeking the truth about life, God, love and morality. I don't want to give nay spoilers but this is one of my favorite books ever, and it really opens up some great questions about the world we live in.  This is a great book for anyone who enjoys fantasy stories, science fiction or that generally has an open mind. It's an easy read and very fun though not light in subject matter. Well worth your time to read this 
 I learned to crochet on the Boye hooks and I couldn't understand why I was having trouble, then I realized it was the hooks.  As soon as I tried these hooks, I immediately noticed the difference.  In my opinion, you can crochet much better than with the other brands.   
 Every parent and person that works with youths should have this book. It is THE manual for understanding teenagers. Chapman does a fantastic job of explaining that a child's language does not change when they become a teenager, but they do adopt a different dialect. How fascinating! His advice and techniques are solid and effective. Get this book and watch the way it improves your relationship with all the children in your life. It is worth its weight in gold 
 This album takes me back to the good days of music better than almost any other album. Psychedelic dance groovy synth fun music. I love this on 
 Purchase this item as a birthday gift for my son and he was ecstatic 
 I'll admit I wasn't a fan of the original, but this revival has won me over. And now I really like both cast albums. The revival cast is just as good as the original, Banderas well cast as Guido. I prefer Chita Rivera over Lilliane Montevecchi  on Follies Bergere,(could never understand what the hell she was singing!) And while Jane Krakowski is not exactly the  (sadly) late Anita Morris, she is sexy in a different way and it works. I love Mary Stuart Masterson, who knew she was such a terrific singer? The whole CD is beautifully done 
 First, I have to reinforce what a previous reviewer said--this CD is a great value for what you get.  I used to do a little yoga years ago but was having trouble getting back into it.  I really like this routine--it is a good mixture of easy and challenging poses.  The music might bug you at first like another reviewer said, but if you open yourself up to it it actually becomes a great accompaninment.  My wife was making fun of Kurt's style but I have warmed up to him and like the pace and mix of his routine.  I am always looking forward to repeating.  I am glad I had some yoga background because I already know proper position and tilt but if you lack that background you will want to combine this video with some background reading or some real instruction.  I live way out in the country and I like that this DVD makes you feel like you are part of the class.  I will want to try some other DVDs or CDs in the future but I really like this one 
 This book is a pattern making book. I think it is wonderful because the patterns are drafted straight from on the body measurements. I have been frustrated with other pattern making books that assume that you have blockers in every size. This book starts from a rectangle and creates the patterns from there. If you want to create a custom sized jacket pattern, I recommend this book 
 I'm certainly in the camp of those reviewers who were favorably pleased with this collection of terrific old standards, handled in Scaggs' unique style.  But (and maybe this is part of the problem for some other listeners), I wasn't instantly convinced.  Scagg's voice is soft, somewhat delicate, and rather unique in timbre.  He can't (and doesn't try to) put a muscular, swinging spin to the tunes, but, instead, consistent with his vocal equipment, sings them relatively straight, quiet, and easy, in ballad format.  For those of us who a) listen to more traditional jazz singers and/or b) know Scaggs' voice from his pop material, one's first impression may well be jarring.  I first listened to the CD a couple of times, and then put is aside for almost a year before I picked it back up again.  This second time around, it all came together, and now it is on my regular play list.  He's found one really good way to approach these tunes, that fully fits his voice, and is expressive and effective.  It's also unique, and, as we know, sometimes uniqueness doesn't work for the listener right away.  I think the band is great.  I don't know what to say about comments about the drummer; I like his work.  He plays quite a bit on the bell of his cymbal, which gives it a, well, bell-like ringing sound, which I rather like, but it's somewhat different.  My system is all tubes and a bit soft at the edges; maybe that's why it doesn't bother me.  Is it too much to wish for a follow-up, or even two 
 This is a really fun workout for me. I tend to go for Pilates/Yoga blends and I thought this one was unique with the additional cardio component. I definitely "felt" the exercises, some were challenging (strength-wise for me) but I could still follow along without difficulty. I thought the instructor was perky and easy to follow. I think this workout would appeal to a wide audience 
 Peter Shaffers' Equus is an amazing tale of 17 year old boy who is torn between two total extremes, his father who is an Atheist and his mother who beleives in Christianity 100%. I can't begin to explain how absolutly disturbing this play. If you liked "The Pillowman" you'll love Peter Shaffers' Equus 
 The book has a nice pace.  It is not a fat book. Content is presented succinctly. The platonic-type dialog is as charming as it is civilized and effective.  There is something inspirational about reading a treatise previously studied by people like Bach, Haydn, Mozart, etc.  I would say that even the most anti-traditional composer-person might benefit from the straightforward analytic of it all, even if one's harmonic sensibility differs from those presented in this text.  All in all, a book to check out, if counterpoint intrigues you 
 This gorgeous coffee-table sized book would alone get my five stars for its detailed but clear maps and its breathtakingly diverse array of  figures and illustrations depicting the major events of over 3,000 years of Jewish history.  As it is, it provides detailed, well researched and very readable historical synopses of Jewish life throughout the world over this period, with each folio (two facing pages) a separate topic.  Each folio includes the historical synopsis, usually a map, a series of other illustrations, including photographs, art, and other figures, and at the bottom of every page appears a time line highlighting important dates relevant to the topic.  The topics range from the dawn of Judaism to present-day issues in Judaism, from Chinese Jews to the Jews of King Solomon's era, to Jewish farmers in Eastern Europe.  You need to see this book in its entirety to believe it.  If you ever wanted to an excellent and fascinating introduction to Jewish history, I don't think you can get better than this rare, colorful, scholarly and very engaging book.  I'm so enthusiastic about it, I've bought it as a gift three times over 
 My love of Hawaiian quilting attracted me to this book and Baltimore album quilting. The instructions and patterns are clear and the designs are awesome. I particularly like the simpler patterns like double hearts, fleur-de-lis, and you are perfect (a pineapple design). I think it may be possible to machine applique as well as hand applique these designs. Of course, there are many intricate designs too--many that require rouched flowers and curved stems and intricate applique that I can only imagine being quilted by the most devoted. The directions on how to cut out the  patterns with paper folding are clear and helpful. You could spend a lifetime making the quilts in this book--and what a beautiful life you'd have 
 I checked out the Brookstone version and gave them the opertunity to discount theirs from the $400 price tag with no help.  I truly believe this is the same unit exactly at a 40% discount.  
 I have been reading book after book for my upcoming police tests and this is by far the BEST book for interviews. The information I have learned from this book applies to almost ANY interview not just the police one. I found that I had already begun categorizing people so I knew how to communicate in their language in my interviews for my small business. I am excited to try these techniques in the police oral interview. I feel EXTREMELY prepared for the interview thanks to this book 
 At first glance this would appear to be a VERY serious movie.   The opening 1/2 hour or so reminded me of the movie BODY SHOTS, which is a rather disturbing film.   What is most intriguing about this story is that it is a complete farce and the movie seems to change colors like some sort of a chameleon.   What you end up with is something totally different than what you think you're getting in the beginning.  Reese Witherspoon stars once again as a sort-of young girl lost type persona.   She seems to be somewhat typecast for this type of role as in many ways her character is not so different from the ones she portrayed in TWILIGHT and FREEWAY.   While the present film is not quite as off-the-wall as FREEWAY, it is still pretty far out in left-field.  If you're a fan of Reese Witherspoon or films that are on the fringes of THE TWILIGHT ZONE, this one might be for you.  While there are many obvious clues during the film as to what's going on, I did not take them seriously enough to figure this plotline out before the final revelation.   Can you 
 I rank this as one of the best books I've ever read and am very surprised  more people aren't aware of it. The writing is top-notch: Robinson was at  the top of his game when he wrote "Piece of Cake." The characters  come to life, even if many of them don't stay alive very long. It is  laugh-out-loud funny at times, slyly humorous at others, brutal, honest and  thought-provoking -- often on one page. One must remember that Britain's  "Knights of the Sky" averaged bout 19 years of age when The  Battle was raging. They often behaved in a less-than-honorable fashion, as  most 19 years usually do. Finally, anyone who ever entertained the notion  that the air war was a "clean" way to fight will quickly have  that notion dispelled. Dying in a burning Hurricane, taking cannon fire in  the gut or waiting for the cold sea to steal all the warmth from your body  are just a few of the ways an RAF pilot could die in the autumn of 1940. In  spite of the controversy it generated, this book is a great tribute to the  RAF's Few and a fine work of literature 
 Please go into this purchase knowing that you aren't going to get the quality of a $1,000 camera for $350 and I think you will be pleased. yes, some things are annoying like the LED lights being spotlight focused on a small area and the "night mode" slowing down the shutter so it is choppy. BUT compared to the previous Canon I owned, it is great. Low light shooting is much better even with out the light, and the colors are much more vibrant and distinct. I burn my movies to DVD and the difference between this JVC and my Canon are substantial. There is VERY little to no pixelation or rough dithering in low light with the JVC.It is somewhat grainy but ALL cams are at low light. As for the drivers not working, as mentioned in some reviews, XP Pro AND XP Home both recognized cam as soon as I plugged it in and driver disk wasn't even needed. I work for a company that sells consumer electronics and 70% of the returns we get are NOT because the product is defective, but because the user can't figure it out. Go with a retailer who has at least a 14 day return policy and try it out. if you don't like it, return it and try something else. Just don't expect Corvette performance at a Chevette price and you'll be happy with this. 
 One fact that this DVD collection helps to realise beyond any doubt, is that Murrow had an unique TV-screen presence. I'm 23 years old Polish man, so naturally I hadn't anything to do with Murrow till now (I'm to write an essay on him--hance my watching of the collection). And so I wasn't biased in any way in my first contact with the material. Murrow's silky voice is not so much seductive, as it's reassuring--the listener cannot doubt that this man here really knows what he's talking about and is NOT constatntly thinking about his looks or presence.  Murrow's broadcasting and his performances are totally free of celebrity-bias that is common among our contemporary anchormen. There's wonderful line in James L. Brooks' BROADCAST NEWS (1987-and still not dated). Albert Brooks is introducing William Hurt to the subtle art of reading the news correctly. One of his tips is: 'stress one word in each sentence - it will give an impression that you know what you're talking about' (I may have misquoted this one, since I saw the film in 1998). And William Hurt's 'Tom' does exactly that: without, of course, knowing what he's really talkin' about--but making TV-viewers BELIEVE that he does know.  Murrow didn't need this kind of tricks. His calmness, his constant pauses, his left hand holding a ciggaret, and his absolutely disarming (if rare) smiles and (even rarer) bursts of laughter, make one feel that here is the man truly concerned with what he has to say.  My favourite bit in the whole collection is one short dialogue between Murrow and Grandma Moses. He asks her about death, she remarks that she's not affraid of it, and Murrow begins a sentence, which - we cen sense that perfecly - was to be something like: "Is then death something you long for?". But as he speaks he realises that it would be impolite, so he begins to stammer (he of all people!) and changes it to some other question. At this very moment he seems wonderfully vulnerable -- that one-of-a-kind man of a steady voice, which is so soothing to hear.  Micha³ Oleszczyk, Tarnowskie Góry, Poland 
 After struggling with being told to "be expressive" by music teachers and not knowing for sure what they meant, this book opened the door to my understanding. This is key information that should be read by all people who make music 
 I was pleasently surprised with this latest work from Covey. It is outstanding, history explained and it is clear and to the point. If you are a student of the gospel and the First Vision this is the best I've found in twenty plus years. I have read it twice and am now reading with my wife 
 I rightly say a must "have" because this is a fantastic book - not just to read (and forget ;-) ), but to keep by your side and imbibe the secrets into your everyday life!  I have been looking around for books on running meetings smoothly and everything that goes with - most of the ones I have seen were really trash. This one is rather different.   To be frank, not being from the US, the author is unknown to me - but what he writes is good stuff - and very practical.  What I have learned is that to be an effective manager - apart from having reasonably good "content" skills, what is equally, if not more important is people skills - and in today's management arena - one of the most important interaction is in the form of meetings - and if you can master that interaction - one can go a long way - and this is one of the first book that I found to really help me with that. 
 we homeschool and have 1st grader, 4th grader and 7th grader - they are all using the program and learning and enjoying - my 1st grader especially enjoys the fact that it's on an island since he's all about pirates. a great first program 
 This is a wonderful book to use with a unit on colonial life. I teach second grade and found the activities easy to understand, with a minimal amount of preparation needed.  There are so many activities that you can pick from with everything from games to food covered.  Everything is well-organized in a way that makes sense for lesson preparation.  The activities are easily adapted to fit the needs of all elementary grade levels. For parents wishing to enrich their children's lives, I highly recommend this book---especially if you are planning a trip to Colonial Williamsburg or Plymouth Plantation 
 Great Product - well worth the cost 
 AMPHIGOREY ALSO is another compendium of Edward Gorey's stories in the form of pen-and-ink drawings with pithy captions. While it doesn't contain his most notorious book--THE GASHLYCRUMB TINIES in the first AMPHIGOREY, I found this to be the most consistent amusing of his three anthologies.  The works here are of several different styles. You have relatively substantial stories, such as THE BLUE ASPIC. This tells the tragic love of the deranged fan Jasper Ankle for the diva soprano Ortenzia Caviglia and is full of jokes that will delight opera cognoscenti while probably eluding all else. Also in this category is THE LOATHSOME COUPLE, a delightfully droll tale of a man and woman who fall in love and discover their mutual passion is murdering children, and THE GREEN BEADS where an impoverished child meets a madwoman who turns out to be his long-lost grandmother.  Another style is that of drawings on some theme. The first book in the anthology, THE UTTER ZOO, is such a work, a collection of twenty-six drawings of imaginary creatures somewhat in the vein of Borges' BOOK OF IMAGINARY BEINGS. Then there's THE BROKEN SPOKE, purporting to be a collection of postcards about cycling, which is wickedly funny.  One will also find writings of totally random humour that explain the rumour that Gorey hit the bottle pretty hard. These include THE PRUNE PEOPLE, a collection of drawings where people go about their daily business and the only off thing is that they have prunes on their necks instead of heads. Also in this vein is LES PASSEMENTERIES HORRIBLES, where various people concentrate on some task unsuspecting that a gigantic passementerie is sneaking up behind them.  This is probably the best anthology to start with in uncovering Gorey's work--although I feel THE OTHER STATUE available on its out from Harcourt is the best introduction to this droll author. This anthology is certainly no collection of dead weight, and the quality of the reproductions is higher than in the other two 
 Albeit a native of Washington, D C., I nevertheless found this autobiography most absorbing. Intelligently yet personally written, including her own frequent self-analyses. Highly recommended, I was sorry to finish it! BBBS 
 If you can't run with this CD, you just don't like Neil Young and Crazy Horse. Long drawn out sets of gritty garage band grunge rock. My only problem with this CD is that there are only six songs. Not going to say it's better then Weld but that's just because of the song count. I love this CD and generally speaking I don't like live CD's. Prefer studio.   Buy it if you are a Neil Young and Crazy Horse fan. Period 
 The year 1963 was one of many trials and tribulations for eleven-year-old Eleanor Roosevelt Dingman, better known as Ellie.  After her fame-seeking egocentric mother deserts the family to chase her acting dreams in New York City, Ellie is left to take on the maternal role for her younger brother and sister.  At the same time, Ellie must endure the pangs of being seen as an "outsider" at school and the terrorizing acts of bigotry towards the "rejects" who live on Witch Tree Lane.  In the end, Ellie must come to terms with the one thing she has been dreading.  Will Ellie overcome this devastating blow in her life?  Most importantly, what will come of this troubled young girl, who lives on Witch Tree Lane, in the small town of Spectacle?    Once again, Ann M. Martin captures her readers through sharing the heartrending and genuine story of Miss Eleanor Roosevelt Dingman.  While reading this beautifully written novel, I found myself riding along-side Ellie on the "emotional roller-coaster" she calls life.  Ellie seized my heart and inspired my soul.  As a result, I highly recommend HERE TODAY 
 If you only own one book about needlepoint, then this is the book to have.   The layout, stitch explanations and illustrations are all excellent. The  color photographs of completed projects illustrate the beauty of going  beyond basketweave in stitching, and Jo's book clearly shows how a variety  of stitches are done.  Your immagination can take you then on to new  heights and turn the craft of needlepoint into an art 
 Allright. Maybe as far as the comedies go, I was spoiled by the exquisite comical masterpiece "The Comedy of Errors." But this is without a doubt my 2nd favorite comedy. I can not help but simultaneously laugh and feel sorry for poor Ford when he suspects his wife is interested in  Falstaff and goes into his jealous rages. One scene I could not forget if I  tried is when Ford feels bad for suspecting his wife, is humiliated in  front of everyone, and apologizes.Only a bit later he finds his wife was  with Falstaff and she has another arranged meeting with him! But this is  only a small part of the many laughs that await. Shakespeare only had a few  days to write this play, but this shows that even under pressure he wrote  great 
 This is a great recording. Quality is superb. Each song unique and musically sound. Especially Countronious Rex, a really unique tune flowing in and out of Be-Bop, Traditional Jazz and R & B. I recommend it highly. All the musicians on this recording perform to their highest level 
 1968's "Where Eagles Dare" paired veteran thespian Richard Burton and up-and-coming young actor Clint Eastwood in a classic action thriller adapted from Alistair MacLean's bestselling novel of the same name.  MacLean was prevailed upon to write the screenplay, and the movie sticks reasonably close to its namesake's storyline.  A American General who is a principal planner for D-Day is shot down over Bavaria in the German Alps.  An Admiral Rawlins of British Intelligence decides to mount a hasty rescue mission using a small group of his best agents, led by a  Major John Smith (played by Burton), and augmented by an American OSS agent (played by Eastwood).  The group is parachuted into Bavaria disguised as German Alpen Korps troops, there to storm a castle where the captured American General is being held.  It turns out, however, that one or more of the agents may be a double agent, leading to a complicated game of double-cross in which Burton and Eastwood must extract the general from the castle and make their way to a rendezvous at an airfield while evading what seems like a signficant portion of the German Army.   The plot, like the novel, lacks some of the emotional depth of MacLean's earlier efforts but more than makes up for it with a steady stream of thrilling action sequences, each more improbable than the last.  A solid cast of British actors augmented by Eastwood are more than equal to portraying the commandoes and their secret helpers in Bavaria, delivering punchy ironies while machinegunning the bad guys. MacLean managed to preserve the best plot twist from the novel for the final scene.  This movie is highly recommended to fans of Clint Eastwood and his action movies.  Fans of Alistair MacLean will find it a much better than average adaption of one of his novels 
 Alright, first off let me address the topic that Obie sophomore album, "Second Round's On Me", is not better than his debut, "Cheers".  Don't get me wrong, Cheers was a great album, one that i also rated 5 stars.  However, over these past couple of years since, Obie has gotten better in flow, delivery, and overall lyrical skill.        You know what i think, i think obie and the whole aftermath management f***'ed up when they decided that "Got Some Teeth" should be Obie's debut single.  They put out one of the worst songs on that album.  There were so many other choices.  That is why he is not in the mainstream of hip-hop right now.  However he does deserve it.  He already had 3 singles shown on tv before the cd came out, all of which are great songs... Jamaican Girl, Cry Now, and Snitch.  All 3 of these are definitely worthy of airplay of both tv and radio.  Obie doesnt get that though, he gets his loyal following from those who bought and liked his first album.  He is not that well respected as an artist because of that.       However, Second Round's On Me is one of the best albums I've heard in a while, probably since The Carter 2.  I think the highlight of the album is of course, song 18... "Obie's Story". He starts off... "It's such a beautiful thing, being raised by a woman thats a queen// with big dreams for the youngest sibling// O couldnt do no wrong, according to report cards Obie brought home//"  He then shows how the environment around him changes him, and that, coupled with his father leaving turns him into a soldier... "Now a ni**a's out in the streets// Two Nickel-plated 38's on me// Cant stay away from beef//"  Then he finally has a baby girl and it once again changes his life... "Had to slow my roll//Plus my PO's got a ni**a pissin in a bowl// Lower my temperament, cuz i see such innocence when i look in Kobe's Pup-ils//"       The Cd is great, not just that song, but almost every one.  I've been bumpin it in my car ever since i got it... something i couldnt necessarily do with the first one.  My advice, go get it, its unbelievable 
 This is a funny comedy. Shows how a couple can make it on their own without all the extras in life and how the neighbors respond to their way of life 
 As far as football games go over the last 3 or 4 years NCAA football has been the best. This year so far is no different. I got the Madden and haven't even started the season yet because it comes out so early none of the rosters are anywhere near close. I play with the Cowboys and had to create 8 players. Also the gameplay for Madden is so unrealistic a linebacker can intercept everything. To me since about 2003 NCAA has looked better and played much better than Madden. The players on Madden look so little for some reason.  You can control your players alot easier on NCAA. The trick to the momentum meter on this game is to try to get a good lead early and after that it is alot easier. One thing I dont like about this game is that for the past 2 years they have taken off the special intro's to add all that other junk. See i play with Miami and they always run thru smoke at the beginning but they took it out 2 years ago, why? Also they used to show Notre Dame walk down their stairs but they took that off too. Also for the last 2 years I havent won the heisman even though I had better stats. Other than that the game is solid, haven't played the Superstar mode yet. For football fans this game is worth a buy 
 I read Zora Neale Hurston's novel "Their Eyes are Watching God" and wanted to read more. Hurston (1891 -- 1960) had studied anthropology at Barnard with one of the founders of modern anthropology, Franz Boas.  With Boas' encouragement and funding from a private source, Hurston travelled South to collect African-American folklore.  Her first stop was Eatonville, Florida, an all-black community where Hurston had spent much of her childhood.  She then went South to Polk County, Florida and its sawmills and the Everglades.  She went further South to Pierce and Lakeland gathering folk materials before heading to New Orleans to study Hoodoo.  In 1927, she rented a small house in Eau Gallie, near Melbourne, Florida where she organized her extensive notes.  Her book, "Mules and Men" was published in 1935.  "Mules and Men" is an outstanding source of information about the folk-tales, called "lies", of rural Southern African-Americans. (Florida was a gathering place for African-Americans throughout the South because of the economic opportunities it offered.) She visited old friends in Eatonville, and won the confidence of people in the other communities she visited. The tales include animal stories ("why dogs and cats are enemies", "how the snake got poison," for example) stories of pre-civil war days involving a slave named "Jack" and his master, stories of the battle between the sexes, contests between "Jack" and the devil, bragging contests, and much else.  Hurston also collected songs and lyrics, including "John Henry", sermons, and hoodoo formulas while in New Orleans.  But this book is much more than a compilation of folk materials. Hurston brings her material to life by bringing the story-tellers and the communities she visited to life.  She writes with deep and obvious affection for the rural African-American communities of the South in the mid-1920s.  Hurston's folk-tales are embedded in a fascinating story of their own as she introduces the reader to the small towns, the parties, the sawmills, the jooks, and the life of her story tellers.  One of the characters that Hurston befriends is a woman named Big Sweet who lives with a man named Joe.  Joe cheats on Big Sweet, and Big Sweet puts Joe right in no uncertain terms.  Big Sweet and her enemy, a woman named Lucy, draw knives with potentially fatal consequences in a fight in a jook that involves Zora.  Big Sweet is a strong and convincingly drawn character in her own right.  The characters and communities in the book were for me even more convincing that the stories.  The first part of Mules and Men describes Hurston's collecting of folk tales, while the second, shorter part discusses her experiences with Hoodoo doctors in New Orleans.  Hoodoo played a large role in the lives of some African-Americans.  I was reminded of Memphis Minnie's blues song "Hoodoo Lady" and of Muddy Waters' "I got my mojo working". The founder of Hoodoo was a woman named Marie Leveau.  Hurston describes how she gained the confidence of several Hoodoo doctors in New Orleans, received initiation from them, and was in one case asked to stay on as a successor practitioner.  Hurston relays Hoodoo spells used to kill an enemy, to make an unwanted person leave town, to get a lover or to get rid of an unwanted lover, and to bring help to those in jail.  She recounts the stories of these conjures, of the Hoodoo doctors, and their clients with a great deal of seriousness.  I found this section of the book fascinating but troubling and different from the folk-tales and people discussed in the first part of the book.  The book is written almost entirely in dialect, but I found it easy to follow as the book progressed.  Hurston wrote this book to preserve an important part of African-American culture in the United States and to express her commitment to and love for this culture.  She believed this culture had its own strengths and could develop its own course and destiny internally.  This is a fascinating, moving book and a thought-provoking picture of one form of the African-American experience in the United States.   Robin Friedman  
 This book is the sequal to The City of Ember. You need to read City of Ember first though, because the books begins where City of Ember left off. I think The People of Sparks was a great sequal, yet not as great as it's prequal. It's not as adventerous as the last book or exciting, but it was good and it has a great message in the end. It think this book was great especially if you read the city of Ember first. If you're giving this as a gift, great choice! But I would give The City of Ember along with it 
 This beautiful book comes in a encased in an Alex Ross Kingdom Come cover art.  the books cover page, with the Spectre and Pastor Norman McCay is well, absolutely perfect, transmitting a great mysterious,dark and Gothic feel.  The plot is more about ourselves than superheros and this is why Norman McCay is so intrigual in the story.  With all the heros, it is amazing that Waid and Ross were able to satisfy so many fans and it is a testament that this graphic novel has withstood over ten years, being reformatted into new collector editions every few years.  The last section of the book is filled with notes, Alex's sketches and a message from his father, whom Norman McCay is loosely based on (as well as he was the model for the character).  This is a superior collector's edition 
 Ramon Lull spent his youthful years as a knight in his native land of Catalonia (northeast Spain). During that time, his life very much resembled that of an Arthurian champion, experiencing adventures of both  martial and amorous nature. In his later years, he experienced a religious enlightenment, and retired to the forest, to live as a hermit in meditation. He left all his wealth and lands to his children and became a hermit. Being an educated man, he devoted his time to writing a large quantity of books, in multiple languages. One of his most important books, is this one, a moral guide-line for the ideals of Chivalry. This is a treatise on the highest idealized standards of behavior for the Christian warrior. Within, Ramon Lull described the virtues a knight should aspire to, and the vices he should avoid. He describes the test a candidate for knighthood should undergo, the duties a knight owes to his liege and those he would protect, the ceremony of knighting, and the symbolism of a knight's weapons, armor,and equipment.  There was no precisely defined and unified Code of Chivalry, but it was a general concept of right versus wrong, and what we know of it comes from other such books and Medieval lore passed down through the ages. Some Orders of knighthood did establish their own particular versions of the code, but they all largely emphasized the same noble virtues. Not all knights lived up to this ideology, some, in fact ignored it completely. However, there were some knights who did indeed live up to this code as closely as a mortal man can.  In our increasingly cynical secularist age, with its concept of "moral relativism", the Code of Chivalry is needed now, more than ever 
 A great overall workout. I really liked the cardio section, and the toning was pretty good, too. I didn't care much for the yoga cooldown, though. I think it's pretty rediculous that they did that segment in shoes, especially with the balance poses they try. It also got a little boring because they repeated the same poses a lot, and I like more of a variety. 
 My wife kept raving on how good the books were. She was up to four read and kept talking about them.  I finished another novel and decided it was time.  What a interesting story. Especially living in Michigan all my life I found so much research had been done on all of Michigan and Canada also.  We in Michigan always have a close relationship with Canada. Many of us have one side of the family from Canada as the auto industry had once brought them here. The book certainly was interesting and the plot gave you great cause to wonder almost to the last pages. I would recommend it highly. 
 I'm not usually a classical listener kind of gal.  The only reason I stumbled onto this cd is because my favorite tune from a movie is on it. Sarabande is also played on the movie Persuasion (author: Jane Austen).  I wanted to have that tune.  Followed the links and landed on the Baroque cd.  Ordered it.  Sarabande is my favorite, followed by Canon, four seasons: spring, etc.  I love this cd!  It feels happy and light.  For me, as a writer and an animator, it adds extra emotional impact when creating as well as influencing my imagination more.  I recommend this cd when people want to feel like spring 
 Plot Details: This opinion reveals major details about the movie's plot.    Dario Argento's Opera was viewed by some as a sort of comeback effort after his 1985 film Phenomena (a.k.a. Creepers) garnered lukewarm reviews and failed to register with a lot of his fans. A lot of fans really looked forward to Opera since it got back to his giallo (Italian thrillers where most of the movie is shown from the killers point-of-view showing his usually gloved hands) roots and lacked some of the ridiculous elements of his insect thriller Phenomena. While Opera is nowhere close to Suspiria (1977)or Deep Red (1975) in terms of greatness, I felt that it was an improvement over his last giallo, 1982's Tenebre.   Opera deals with a beautiful young opera singer who is starring in an extremely avant-garde production of Macbeth. She ends up being stalked by an obsessed fan who ties her to a pole, puts pins under her eyes (so she'll gouge out her eyes if she tries to shut them), tapes her mouth shut and murders people right in front of her in some very graphic and bloody ways. The movie in some respects has a lot in common with Phantom of the Opera.   As is expected of a Dario Argento film, Opera is absolutely breathtaking visually. His camera moves fluidly and the movie features some insane angles and shots. The actual opera of Macbeth in the movie is equally visually captivating. Dario has mentioned that he always wanted to do his own movie version of Macbeth, but wasn't able to for one reason or another, so Opera gave a chance to sort of have some fun with it.   The killings in the movie are also very graphic and bloody, punctuated by some really bad heavy metal music. The first murder in particular has a very gruesome shot of a knife being shoved through a man's neck and into his mouth. I was also very impressed with the scene where a woman is killed while looking through a peep hole: the killer shoots her through the head through the hole, and the bullet continues out of the back of her skull, striking the phone that's behind her. Dario is one of the few directors who can take extreme violence and turn it into something of dark beauty.   Where the movie really is lacking is in some of the acting. I noticed that actors will act great in one scene, only to appear that they're sleepwalking through the next. This is especially apparent in the young woman playing the lead.   The ending also was very poor and seemed out of place. After watching the documentary of the making of the film on the recent Anchor Bay re-release, the filmmakers even admit that the ending didn't turn out the way that they were intending it to. If the movie had ended 10 minutes earlier, it would have turned a good movie into a great one.   Opera will probably go down as the last decent film that Dario Argento made. He went on to make some terrible films like Trauma, The Stendhal Syndrome and the atrocious remake of Phantom of the Opera. I haven't seen his latest film entitled Sleepless, but I've heard that it's a return to his Deep Red roots. Whether it's any good is another question, but I really like to think that Dario has at least one more great film in him. One can only hope!   
 This book will show you exactly how to get on with your new "free-lance" gun-for-hire work life in this age of outsourcing and corporate racing to the bottom.  The author very deftly and patiently gives full explanations behind his recommendations, and he is DEAD ON.  Company loyalty gets you nowhere these days, and you have to think like a sword-for-hire to survive...the book tells us how.  Become your own free agent.  Work to live, don't live to work.  Fire your boss, quit your career, and plan your exit strategy when you first get in the door. The only way to make REAL payraises is to keep moving from job to job, industry to industry, keeping you and the money/benefits at the forefront--regardless of the Protestant work ethic we've all been raised with. It's called "job fishing", and it's the new networking (cultivated from SOCIAL life leads rather than work life leads, and yes, you now have to get a social life!).  By always keeping your resume' circulating--and a pole in the water--job leads will come to YOU rather than you working for them.  You simply sort through what's found its way onto your hook.  This method, as brought to us in this superb book, cuts through all the interview and hire bull--all the superficial stuff, like appearance, politics (personal and other), power struggles, and the lowdown on starting salaries (such as usually being about $5k less than the last denizen of that particular post). We can negotiate our own employment tickets now, starting with money and chosen benefits, right down to termination agreements...putting back into our hands the power to determine exactly how we enter and leave a job.  It shows you how to prioritize opportunities according to YOUR needs instead of the employer's needs, and how to KEEP that job if that's where you really want to stay for more than a year, and how to keep the raises coming.  There's also a section on how to make the best use of temp agencies, headhunter agencies, and other "traditional" job hunting techniques.  If you're just starting, starting over, or merely wishing to move on, I advise getting this book to join the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd century method of job "security." (ha-ha-ha)  In the review style of Joe Bob Briggs, this book has: No breasts No aardvarking No physical attack styles No gratuitousness of any kind Lots of "money-fu" and "you-fu" Not nominated for any drive-in Academy Awards...  But Wenchypoo and FedUpWithLiars still gives it 5 stars!  Check it out.  
 Gerald's Game starts out with such dripping, rich detail that it makes the reader understand why Stephen King has millions of fans world wide.  The story grabs your attention and dosn't let go until the very brutal, nasty, ending.  Basically, Gerald's Game is about a man and woman trying different sexual ideas to spice up their sex life.  Gerald hand cuffs his wife to the bed posts and about halfway through the event, she decides that she dosn't want to do it anymore.  Of course Gerald is already caught up in the act and dosn't want to stop.  The story takes a nasty turn of events and a chapter later, Gerald is dead.  His wife, still hand cuffed to the bed.  What makes matter worse is that she is miles away from anybody and it seems like she's stuck in that situation for quite a while.  I won't go into too much more detail considering the story itself is "tied" up in those small details and it makes the read very interesting to the very end.  Fans of Stephen King will find much to enjoy here.  New fans will find their next favorite author after reading this book.  Check it out! 
 As a long-time, big-time Pentagram fan, I've been eagerly awaiting this release for awhile, so here's my take on this compilation of 70's recordings by this killer band. First off, the packaging is great, with very informative liner notes addressing everything from recording locations to the Kiss and Judas Priest myths associated with this band. Good stuff! Moving onto the discs, the first thing you'll notice is that this is more like a 1.5 cd set, as Disc 1 has only 7 tracks on it. Nevertheless, Disc 1 is the reason to get this release. Tracks 1 & 2 are from one of the band's demos/rehearsals recorded in 1974, while the remaining tracks are from their Underground Sound session in 1976 (when Iverson was in the band). To my knowledge, 5 of these 7 songs are not on any previous legit release, and they're some of the band's strongest, tightest tunes. The sound quality is also quite good, considering the age of the recordings. The one misfire is the cover of `Little Games', which is by far the worse thing in the Pentagram catalog, but the other 6 songs are essential for any fan of the Ram. As for Disc 2, all 15 songs come from rehearsal tapes recorded between 1972 and 1974. Most of these tracks have also never been on a legit release, and a few aren't even on the bootlegs or demo tapes that I know of. In my opinion, the songs on Disc 2 are not the band's best material- they're not bad, but not as strong as the tracks on Disc 1 and those included on the first First Daze Here collection. Thus, I'm giving it only 4 of 5 stars. Still, any true fan will want this collection The liner notes make reference to more tracks still sitting on tapes awaiting release, so a volume 3 might eventually come to pass 
 The Bride With White Hair 2 followed quickly upon the success of the original movie, taking up the tragic story of Cho Yi-Hang (Leslie Cheung) and his forbidden love Lien Ni-Chang (Brigitte Lin).  By betraying his sacred pledge that he would never doubt his beloved, Cho has unleashed a monster.  Ni-Chang's fury over Cho's betrayal drives her completely mad, transforming her into the white-haired witch who lives only to destroy every living member of the Eight Clans, especially the Wu Tang clan to which Cho belongs.  As for Cho, he has retreated to Mount Shin Fung, guarding over a mystical flower whose bloom (and it only blooms once every twenty years) can cleanse and restore the woman he still loves.  Ten years have passed since the deadly night that Ni-Chang went mad and almost single-handedly destroyed the Wu Tang clan.  Only two members of the clan survive: Cho, who has stood guard at Mount Shin Fung under blizzard conditions all these years, and Cho's nephew Kit (Sunny Chan).  With Kit's impending marriage to Lyre (Joey Maan), the opportunity to further the bloodline exists - and so it is that Ni-Chang crashes the party, kidnaps the young bride, and takes her back to her own private castle full of man-hating, deadly women.  There, Lyre is indoctrinated in the witch's "See a man, kill a man" philosophy and programmed to kill Kit with her own hands.    The Eight Clans send their best warriors to try and kill the witch and rescue Lyre, but they are all almost defenseless against Ni-Chang, who uses her deadly hair as a most effective weapon (sounds weird, I know, but it works really well).  It soon becomes clear that the only person who might be able to defeat the white witch is Cho Yi-Hang, and this sets the stage for a most unforgettable reunion between the two former lovers.    This sequel is a more direct, action-oriented film than the original The Bride With White Hair, and for that reason I actually found it more enjoyable on the surface.  Still, though, it lacks the depth and beauty of the original, largely because the two lovers do not meet again face to face until the final scene - although that meeting is well worth the wait.  Most certainly, if you've seen and enjoyed the original, you'll want to experience this sequel 
 Steve Oedekerk (the writer of the film BRUCE ALMIGHTY) directed, wrote and starred in this quite silly kung fu spoof. Though one hesitates to call it groundbreaking, KUNG POW is genuinely remarkable, in that much of it is composed of scenes from a 1977 Chinese film with modern actors smoothly and digitally inserted into them. Watch the credits at the end for examples of what I'm talking about.  Because of this creative juxtaposition, KUNG POW manages to create a comedic atmosphere that is uniquely its own. It really does "feel" like a vintage martial arts film, yet the dialogue is so extraordinarily silly and the timing is so odd, it just wrings laughs out of you.  SIDELIGHT: The entire movie is dubbed, and Oedekerk also did all the voices for every character (except Whoa.) To further the bad dubbing effect, Oedekerk wrote a fake script of gibberish for the modern actors to repeat on-camera 
 Dahl makes an ingenious twist by setting a predator as the hero.  (After all, unless you're a vegetarian, you're no better than the Big Bad Wolf.)  There are a few weaknesses in the book, though:  What makes the farmers think that one place is any better place for a stakeout than any other place?  Anyone who tries to catch a burrowing animal knows that anywhere in any direction is fair game.  Dahl tells us that the farmers are despicable because he wants us to see the fox as the hero.  However, he might have done a better job of characterizing the farmers as despicable.  Yes, they are fanatical in their effort to catch the fox, but that is not enough.  I still say "Matilda" is my favorite 
 It's not a Jack Johnson disc but he does have a heavy influence. It's great music overall, by several different artists, each of them having a very varied style and when it is all put together makes for a great compilation of new music. There isnt a bad track on the disc, whcih is why it gets my designation of perfect record. 
 Dr. Preston's book has been an invaluable source of information and help in my practice as a psychologist. He is a wonderful presenter and when possible I also attend his workshops. He makes it easy to understand psychopharmacology in order to better help my clients. 
 Thriller fans will find all the usual suspects here: cartoony bad guys, hot babes, dashing secret agents. But Trevanian takes all the cliches and turns them around in a genre-shattering book that both parodies and transcends the run-of-the-mill. Shibumi offers real food for thought in with the fun and thrills, and Trevanian writes like a slumming poet. Well worth the time. 
 Duane Bradley (Kevin Van Hentenryck) checks into the hotel Broslin in NYC w/ his incredibly deformed, psychic, and psychotic brother, Belial. Together, they plan on hunting down and killing the quacks who surgically separated them years earlier. This is done in gorey detail, with splashes of hysterical humor tossed in! I especially enjoyed the demise of Dr. Kutter (check out her identical twin nurses). Actually, this movie is about the love between two brothers and the jealousy / anger that develops when one of them falls in love. There is a certain warmth beneath all that goo! Along the way, we are treated to many scenes of mutilation and depravity, as only Frank Henenlotter can deliver (The last 15 minutes or so are downright disturbing)! I think BASKET CASE is a classic, and recommend it to anyone w/ a taste for the outrageous and bizarre...      
 _One must know when it is right to doubt, to affirm, to submit. Anyone who does otherwise does not understand the force of reason. Some men run counter to these three principles, either affirming that everything can be proved, because they know nothing about proof, or doubting everything, because they do not know when to submit, or always submitting, because they do not know when judgment is called for_      Blaise Pascal found his faith to be the basis of reason. In this collection of his thoughts, the Pensees provide a glimpse of how he may have arrived at this concept. Further, he expresses the impact of this revelation on his own thinking in a way that transcends time and place. People throughout the centuries, some of whom have never known of Pascal's other contributions, have found encouragement in the Pensees.      The introduction by A. J. Krailsheimer provides an excellent background of the life of Pascal and his influences. The argument which Pascal uses to fortify his faith is given a thorough development that provides a course and direction to the otherwise often disconnected thoughts. Professor Krailsheimer points out that Pascal is in a paradoxical position of appealing to reason in order to communicate truths which, on his own showing, are outside its province. The paradox is that only reason can persuade reason of its own inadequacy.      Pascal's starting point is that the temporal world is inadequate to demonstrate eternal truths. Further, Pascal believes that a choice about the eternal is imperative. To leave the decision untested is to actively not decide and to fall into the category of skeptic. Pascal did not hold that ultimate skepticism was possible, maintaining that a _perfectly genuine skeptic has never existed. Nature backs up helpless reason and stops it going to so widely astray._       On the other hand, Pascal does not condone dogmatic acceptance of unsubstantiated presumption. _Is he, on the other hand, to say that he is the certain possessor of truth, when at the slightest pressure he fails to prove his claim and is compelled to loose his grasp?_ Neither certainty not uncertainty can be ultimately proved nor disproved in Pascal's world.      Our friend appears to have painted himself into a corner. Indeed, Pascal has and intentionally so. He appeals to a leap of faith to establish the legitimacy of a faith. Pascal's argument hinges on the concept of prevenient grace. _We shall never believe with an effective belief and faith unless GOD inclines our hearts and we shall believe as soon as he does_ (380).      Pascal's argument benefits from his own miraculous vision that occurred on 23 November 1654. In that experience, he saw the light that guided him the rest of his life; a vision of the Messiah that brought him certainty and joy. This is, at the same time, both the strength and weakness of Pascal's argument.      While I respect the experience of Pascal and others who have witnessed eternity break the temporal barrier, not all of us who faith in the spiritual have this to fortify our convictions. Since there is no way to manufacture such an experience in my own life (neither do I feel that I need to) the type of intensely personal apologetic that Pascal's work represents often strikes a hollow chord.  At the same time, I do find encouragement in Pascal's validation of a personal experience while upholding the certainty that dogma and skepticism will not be silenced.  This is the decision to which I am drawn regularly on my spiritual journey as circumstance comes into conflict with my convictions.  I agree with Pascal that the capacity to acknowledge a spiritual relationship has its source outside of the temporal realm.  This is the stuff of life.  We choose a course without guarentee of the destination.  Each step brings us closer if for no other reason than our experience has grown.      Whether or not one chooses to wager on the side of eternity, as Pascal purports as the only sensible bet, I find the Pensees to be important for it's unique position in the then nascent era of Science. Pascal's contemporary, Descartes, at whom Pascal points some of his arguments, took a completely different path to establish his faith. Neither of which provides eternal certainty, and thus, both of which are questions still pertinent for today.      PEACE   Catrin 
 For those of us who have labored in the vineyard of Women's Studies and Spirituality for most of our adult lives, it is thrilling to embrace the next generation and celebrate their vision. The authentic voice of Sera Beak in The Red Book uses the spiritual lens of metaphysics and scholarship to illuminate her life experiences.  She brings an "old soul" wisdom to contemporary culture.  She is definitely a woman of substance to watch as her vision unfolds. Reviewed by Penelope Rieck, teacher of Jungian Psychology, Winnetka, Illinois. 
 Everyone should own this product. I receieved my item on the day I was told it would arrive, and it looked exactly like the picture 
 This is a great set make sure you read all three in order 
 Personally, I think that we would all be better off if we spent more time in our education process teaching people about the realities of their economic lives.  This is especially true of their choice of careers, managing those resources, and preparing for their "golden years".  I could nominate a few topics I think we could cease teaching in order to have room for the necessary classes to provide people with real life financial management skills that can have a direct impact on the improvement of all aspects of their lives.    This book, "Personal Finance - Turning Money into Wealth" is a fantastic tool for students and ANY interested reader.  I wish everyone would work through this book (or one very much like it).  While it is never too late to develop these skills, the younger a person gets a plan for their economic life in place, the more power it has and the better off they will be long term.   I like the way Prof. Keown emphasizes basic principles (he has 15 of them) and planning.  He begins the book by providing the foundation of financial planning, teaching the student how to measure their financial health and using that to inform their plan, understanding the Time Value of Money (a topic so vital that no one should graduate high school without knowing, in my opinion), and the basics of tax planning.  The author then provides some great information on managing money by understanding the realities of cash and liquid assets, credit cards (open credit) and the traps it represents, using consumer loans in PLANNED BORROWING (another important topic that is almost unknown to most consumers because of the misuse of open credit), and buying homes and automobiles.  I really enjoyed his next discussion on insurance.  He talks about the various kinds of insurance, the kinds of protection they provide at what costs, and especially the situations in which buying insurance makes sense and when it does not.  The section on managing investments is good, solid, but BASIC information.  Anyone doing anything beyond a few basic retirement plans will need to study other materials.  This section is the one where I have a tiny quibble with the author.  He differentiates investing and speculation by saying that investing involves putting money in assets that provide returns - stocks, bonds, etc - but that speculating is putting money in things like baseball cards that only have a price based on what others are willing to pay.  I sort of understand what I think he is trying to say.    However, all investing is in some sense speculating.  The buyer and seller have different views of the future (speculating about the future) and so they make opposite choices at a certain price.  Either of them would change their view, presumably, at some other price.  Stocks do not have a built in return and many do not pay dividends and too often nowadays their residual value is zero.  Too often people buy stocks simply because they are going up (the greater fool theory) and get badly burned as we saw in the Internet Bubble collapse in early 2000.  In any case, the caution the author advocates is sufficient and sound.  I am just concerned that others use the terms "investment" and "speculation" differently than the author and might confuse those trying to enter the fray for the first time.  This fine text ends with a discussion of life cycle issues such as retirement planning, estate planning, and how all the pieces studied fit together into the grand plan.  The author also provides online helps such as problems, quizzes, and especially many useful spreadsheets that the student can not only use, but study to help them build their own that will be tailored to the student's specific situation.  There is also a workbook with the basics of using a financial calculator and the worksheets called for in the text.  This is a superb text on a vital topic.  Strongly Recommended for general readers as well as students in a class on this subject (which EVERY college student should be REQUIRED to take - or pass out of by test) 
 Richard Ellmann obviously knew just about everything there was to know about Oscar Wilde; what is amazing is that he was able to put most of it in his Wilde biography and still make it a graceful, engrossing read  completely free of boredom or didacticism. Wilde was one of the truly great  personalities of all time, and Ellmann not only brings him to vivid life,  but demonstrates why he was one of the most important literary figures of  the 19th century 
 I knocked off a star because this release is SO bare-bones--no commentaries/reminiscences, no extras, and no subtitles or captions (it has an insert, though!). The special itself (I remember when it premiered on CBS), however, is five stars all the way. I have a particular soft spot for The Homecoming because my parents are from Appalachia, albeit the Alleghany Ridge (not the Blue Ridge, which is where this little drama takes place). Having spent every summer of my childhood in Pennsylvania near the West Virginia line, the nostalgia of The Homecoming is delicious--I invariably laugh, cry, and allow myself to float along on a cloud for an hour-and-a-half. It's hard to believe that so much can be contained in  a mere 98 minutes--the result of the excellence of Earl Hamner's craft, based on his writing what he knows. He means us to know it too, and he succeeds in spades. The image looks fine--a bit soft, but this was shot for TV, after all. ALL performances are stellar--you'll meet wonderful, colorful characters--people you'd like to know in real life. And guess what? You'll feel like you do! Make yourself comfortable, pour out a glass of "The Recipe," and if you haven't already done so, make The Homecoming part of your Christmas tradition 
 if you are a beginner to the field of pro blackjack, don't buy this book. buy "blackjack for blood" and learn all you can until you achieve high skills at this game. then, and only then, you can go to this book which is a treasure to expert players - it sharpens your game, gives you mathematical backround to your methods, and can especially give you an edge on the hard-to-win-but-fast-to-play internet blackjack games 
 I bought this game not as a video game but so I could have my own personal trainer without paying for a gym membership.  I am two weeks into my 12 week routine and I LOVE it.  The software is very well done and it really does have "real time feedback."  If I'm leaning forward when I'm not suppose to while doing an exercise the trainer will say "try standing up straight."  I am definitely getting a great work out.  10 more weeks and I'll let you know if it did any good or not.  So far it seems to be helping.    I love that it builds on itself so that by week 12 you are doing more routines that are more intense.  The one drawback is the camera is really sensitive - I have to make my kids leave the room because if they walk around in the background it picks up their movements and lowers my score.    If you hate the gym but have always wanted your own personal trainer "Kinetic" seems to be the way to go

 This book has become part of the intellectual apparatus of the modern mind, and no liberal education can be complete without understanding it. However, in the end its effect on society has been largely pernicious. Rawlsians should consider:  1) How can equality itself be a value that the state pursues? Assume we are considering a starvation-wrought country. Assume a social welfare function increasing monotonically over  a range of goods, one of which is equality, and one of which is rice. Assume we are considering a village, A. In A, half the people are starving, and the other half have just enough to be above starvation. If equality is itself a value, then no matter what relative weights you give rice and equality, I will be able to construct some set of holdings such that, by burning some extra rice, maybe even just a grain, I am increasing the welfare of society. I consider this a reductio ad absurdum (but there may be some holdouts who don't, I know).  2) Rawls says two things have value, and then orders one lexically over the other. What sense does that make? As long as you admit that both things have some value, then trade-offs become necessary. I cannot say, "I have a $100 bill, and a pile of pennies, but the $100 bill's value is ordered lexically over the pile's." There is SOME pile of pennies worth more than a $100 bill, as long as pennies have any value.  3) The underlying assumption of the book is that there are just these goods that come into this world, waiting to be distributed by the state. Some goods have such features. For example, Congressional Medals of Honor: they have no distribution prior to the state. Letters get distributed by the state, too. But Rawls writes as though ALL goods have this feature, when they don't. For example, self-respect, wooden benches, and love affairs all show up in the world with some initial distribution. Rawls glosses over the fact that talking about their "proper distribution" is a euphemism for, "using state force to coerce someone."  4) What does the phrase, "social justice" purport to mean? I know that if someone breaks my window I can get redress: this is, "rectificatory justice." I know if someone breaks a contract with me I can seek compensation. I know that if someone walks up and breaks my nose it is also a matter of criminal justice. I understand what "justice" is as it applies to how I relate to other people. But why assume that, besides all these matters of individual justice, there are some greater issues of "social justice" that float over the others? It seems like a fallacy of composition: "I have a bike, you have a bike, they have a bike, everyone in society has a bike, therefore in addition to our individual bikes there must be some 'social bike' to worry about." There is not. There are just the individual bikes.   All that said, this is a great book with which to inform your own intuitions about how you should behave in the world. Just remember that as a political platform it is pernicious. 
 It's no secret that people who are trying to sell you something will be very careful and sometimes dishonest when it comes to the actual words and phrases they use to describe their product.  In TALKING RIGHT, linguist Geoffrey Nunberg examines the use of language manipulation as it has been used in modern American politics and the effect it has had back on the language itself.  Since the birth of advertising, sellers would spend many hours writing and rewriting slogans, bumper-stickers and sales pitches to make sure that each word had the desired impact on the listener.  But Nunberg's research is more interested not just in how language is utilized by the political salespeople, but how certain words and phrases in the vernacular have ended up being subtly changed by constant repetition and reenforcement from politicians, pundits and spin-meisters.    While the word "liberal" is obviously where the book hangs its hat, other words and phrases have also migrated to take on different meanings and connotations.  For example in a political context, when someone refers to "values", they actually are only discussing a small subset of possible moral issues, regardless of their position on other subjects.  Even a word as old as "Christian" is taking on a more restrictive definition.       TALKING RIGHT is written in an easy-to-read style.  It's breezy and almost conversational without feeling shallow.  I found to it be a little repetitive at times (odd, considering the relatively small word-count), but I forgive it because of all the little facts that I hadn't know.  I had, for example, recently noticed Republicans referring to their opponents as "the Democrat Party".  But I hadn't realized that the deliberate shortening of "Democratic" has been a tactic going back over 70 years.  The book is told mainly from a liberal point of view.  This is because of Nunberg's thesis (and I think that most would agree) that the right-wing has been far more successful at branding words and phrases as belonging to their side of the national discussion.  Nunberg picked up on a lot of things that seemed familiar to me.  Things that I had noticed but hadn't realized that I noticed.  It's a very illuminating book in that way; it crystallizes a lot of things I had only half-realized while listening to left-wing and right-wing talking heads exchanging insults on cable news 
 Tanenbaum's "Underground Harmonies" is simply a beautiful and intelligent study of subway street musicians.

 This is our second year using Story of the World as our history spine for my K and 4th grader.  The activity guide is similar to Vol. 1, although the difficulty level of work has increased slightly.  This guide is written for 2-5th graders.    As in SOTW 1, this activity guide has review questions, sample narrations, additional reading suggestions, map work and hands on activities, with review cards every four chapters.  What I love best about SOTW is that I can read the main story to my children and use this activity guide to pick and choose what *we* want to do with our history lesson.  They provide the base, yet I have the flexibility to do what works best within our school.  If we are interested in a subject, we can do more activities, or we can skip most and move on.  I take the suggested reading lists to the library, where I can either choose from what's on hand, or I can find additional books on the same subject.  I appreciate Susan Wise Bauer's notations on grade level appropriateness for the books, so I can know ahead of time if it's something my 10 yo can read on her own, or if it's something I'll be reading from to both of my kids.  I generally ask review questions of both my children, then my 10 yo does the written narration and map work.  Both kids do the coloring pages, and my younger child listens to some of our additional reading.  Permission is given in the book to make copies of pages for a second child within your own family.  This book is taking us longer than a year to complete, but that's because we are having a lot of fun with it.  I am enjoying history as much as the kids.  The activity guide is a marvelous addition to the base book, and I wouldn't want to do history in any other way.  As commented in reviews of the Vol. 1 activity book, there are more typographical errors than one would expect.  This is unfortunate, but I appreciate the effort made to get these books out as quickly as possible.  
 It's been a while since I've read the prior books in this series, and I didn't have the time (nor inclination) to go back and reread them prior to starting this one.  In any case, I think the book is written in a manner that reminds you of the prior history without being redundant. I really enjoyed this book, although there were a few spots where it dragged on just a tad.  (hence the 4-star rating rather than 5.)  But still, it's a great read and very hard to put down once you've started.  If there's another one in the series, I will be buying it as soon as it comes out.  Carol Berg is a very entertaining author

 I am the CISO of a regional Latin American Bank, and I used this book almost inmediately to define a project of defining  information security roles in my organization.  Even though some of the roles have to be changed due to the nature of the organization, and the internal politics that are at stake, I consider this book almost a "best practice" for information security.  It helps you implement Information security infraestructure, and to show the importance of it to top management.  Now, my organization is paying more attention to InfoSec, and the roles of the people are clearer in respecto to InfoSec 
 How I loved this book! Diana Vreeland was one of those people whom we call a force of nature. This book captures her spirit so well it's just like chatting with her in person. Be warned, this is not a standard biography. It doesn't start with little Diana being born and growing up. It's a collection of stories from her life, odd thoughts and and arch observations and it works magic 
 "When I closed my eyes and swallowed, I could even taste that black cherry wine. I knew then it wasn't never gonna be any different. I was always gonna be drunk, whether I was dry or out there juicing. So in my head I wrote a song about it. I could hear all the notes, the riffs, a stand-up bass backing me up. I worked out the lyrics for it, too -    You can toke, you can drop,    Drink or use.    It don't matter, daddy,    'Cause you never gonna lose    Them mean ole jailhouse    Black cherry blues." - Dixie Lee Pugh, herein, remembering a song he wrote after two days' DTs in solitary  BLACK CHERRY BLUES, the first Robicheaux novel I ever read but third in the series, makes clear from the first page that the reader is entering a new episode of an ongoing story. Robicheaux mysteries are definitely *novels*, in which characters' personal problems often aren't fixed by the last page.  Dave Robicheaux and his adopted daughter Alafair, for example, are still getting through the first year after Annie Robicheaux's death (HEAVEN'S PRISONERS). Robicheaux's former partner from New Orleans Homicide, Cletus Purcel, has found a way around *some* of his problems, but his police career is still lost to him, and he too has more problems than his flippant exterior would at first lead one to believe.  Much of the story - as opposed to the mystery - has to do with Dave's commitment to Alcoholics Anonymous while coping with Annie's death. He *has* fallen from grace occasionally, but sticks to the principle of coping with one day at a time, refusing to let one fall be his downfall. As in some other entries of the Robicheaux series, Dave is haunted by the memories of his dead - Annie's memory has joined the ranks of his old platoon mates from Vietnam who visit his sleep.  Dixie Lee is another side to the problem, a blues singer who hasn't found a healthy way to cope with his alcoholism or his prison record. Pugh is reminiscent of various real-life music stars with troubled pasts. He even has a cousin who's a player in Louisiana state politics (appearing in a later book).  The mystery is really another problem to be solved: finding out what kind of trouble Dixie Lee has gotten into through his ex-cellmate, a mid-level organized crime boss whose thugs roughed up Dixie Lee after he renewed his acquaintance with Dave. Whether or not Dixie Lee needs or deserves rescuing, Dave soon faces a trumped-up murder charge in consequence that he'll have to clear up before it ever gets to court, since he can't afford a private investigator or a really good lawyer.  Drive-in totals: - death threat to pet raccoon - at least four dead bodies, including fire and explosion, not counting post-traumatic flashbacks and nightmares - some sexual content - road trip to Montana 
 This is a terrifically pared down version of the cartoon episode of the same name. It leaves out the scarier and harder-to-understand [for young children] elements of the story without actually changing it, and the sentence structure and choice of words is short, simple and perfect for the age group it is intended for. I can honestly say that I would be thrilled to share these books with my baby brothers, especially since I know they'll actually understand what they're reading (unlike a great many 'childrens' books today) 
 Sorry, after reading some negative reviews I just had to speak up.  This movie was one of the best movies I have ever seen.  I still to this day watch it over and over again.  Well directed, some of the best acting I have seen, and my god the cast in this movie, the list of stars is endless.  The courtroom scenes were so intense, I envey anyone who has not seen this yet.  The story was perfect and so many surprises and turns.  Really well done.  This movie is worth every penny, I just wish I would of got to see it in the movies.  It is the most powerful movie I have ever seen, how can anyone say this movie was not good, I guess they just can't handle the truth.. 
 I really love this book and have re-read it a few times already.  It's sensual and cheery and great for the self-esteem.  It reminds me to enjoy and celebrate my femininity.  An absolute joy to read.  The recipes are great too! 
 It is odd -- Tony Schwartz loves to think and talk about what he thinks; he's singled out what he thinks are important disciplines on the American spiritual landscape and, oddly, skips several influential traditions of the  last few years: Tibetan Buddhism, Kabbalah, Tai Chi and related moving  meditations; why?  I'm not sure; he attempts a review of Vipassana  Buddhism, or Insight Meditation -- he speaks to Jack Kornfeld (a leading  teacher of Buddhist meditation and headquartered in California) but makes a  final assessment based almost exclusively on Jack's opinions as to why  traditional Buddhism just doesn't work in this country; sadly, Tony  confines himself to meditating roughly 30 minutes a day and never signs on  for a retreat at East Coast Insight Meditation mecca, Barre, Mass. (or  anywhere else); he researches little in the tradition and appears to be in  too much of a hurry to throw himself at and into Ken Wilber and the hot new  discipline of Transpersonal Psychology; while Ken's practice includes  considerable meditation, it is primarily one of Jnana, or thinking on  things spiritual, emotional, psychological -- and how Tony grooves on that;  Tony likes talking up the spiritual life and sampling the initial highs; he  is not in it for the long haul; his transformational path is apparently one  of words -- and he is unusually articulate (as is Ken Wilber); while I am  gratified for much that Tony has given -- and his gifts are concise and  appetizing (I am pushed to look deeper into the Enneagram, for instance,  and it was wonderful to remeet Baba Ram Dass), I am left feeling as if once  he cornered his subject -- What Really Matters -- he found he had a taste  for little more than what he'd begun with -- a high, high-minded gift for  gab and unwillingness to commit.  Try again, Tony 
 De Pree presents a philosophy that while in many ways is timeless, is never a cliche.   His emphasis upon people, their potential, and the elements present in strong, enduring organizations, will appeal to leaders working in any industry.  De Pree offers the reader refreshing thoughts about the importance of service to others in an era of forgotten virtues.  It is one of the most elegant and inspiring books I have come across lately 
 In the 20th (now 21st) century, there lies before us a truly tremendous and difficult problem, that is, if we have had direct spiritual experience in a world that does not officially recognize such. But that is only half of the problem. Are we to also conversely and in turn deny the truths disclosed to us by science and rational human knowledge?  This is the problem; how to bridge these two aspects of reality if we KNOW that they are BOTH real? For these are no longer simple times that we live in. There is simply too much legitimate "smarts" out there in science, philosophy, psychology, anthropology, physics, etc., etc. to simply deny them and still be honest with yourself. Yet again, to the contrary of that, what to do if you KNOW there is more?  Tortured with this problem and trying to wrestle out even some sliver of a solution myself, I finally came to the conclusion that the world of the 21st century needed something very unique and special; not just another scientist and not just another mystic. It needed an absolute, super high IQ brainiac genius with a super-compute mind who ALSO had legitimate spiritual experiences. Only such a person could ever solve the problem.  And then I remembered Ken Wilber.   I happened upon this book some ten years ago and the result was nothing less than sheer joy. I highly recommend it to all who might be interested and perhaps tortured by all of the same ideas I mentioned above. This is indeed a wonderful introduction to Ken Wilber's work. 
 "Fortune" is a classic on the newsstand, and is as vital and important today as ever. "Fortune" generally caters to people with a managerial bent, especially upper-level executives, but also offers excellent analysis on current events in the business world, the global and national economic climate, and forward-looking technology and trend information.   Each issue is normally organized around a theme or major story, like the Enron trial, or the 100 best companies to work for in a given year. I do enjoy the articles where they rank things, but more than the rankings themselves, I am always interested in the justifications they use for their rankings; while I don't always agree with the magazine, I do always find it good food for thought.  The features are generally very polished and accurate, and the lessons are conveyed in a straightforward manner that is as useful to a CEO as to a college business student. I particularly appreciate the interviews that "Fortune" has with key players in the financial industry, and also appreciate the very useful index of companies and individuals featured in every issue.   The magazine will probably not be the favorite for investing advice because it also covers so much other financial terrain; small investors may also want to read a more specific magazine like "Kiplinger's." Nonetheless, the investment advice and insight "Fortune" offers should generally be held in high esteem.   I also appreciate the coverage of key trends, and in particular want to note that "Fortune" has been in the lead with excellent reporting on the pension crisis in America: coverage of this sort is what makes me a loyal reader.  Many other financial magazines are available and are competing for your money; while there are several I would recommend, "Fortune" remains a reliable source of information on macro-level trends, and should be a part of everyone's business library 
 I found in this book a really bright analysis for any organization. I like the approach, and I've found a lot of very useful tips for my proffesional lif 
 I discovered the Fox family when I went away to college and encountered some new strips in the local newspapers.  It's been almost 10 years since then, and I still love this strip.  This book collects 2 years worth of strips into one book.  These strips were previous released as "Your Momma Thinks Square Roots are Vegetables," "Who's Up for Some Bonding?" and "Am I a Mutant, or What!"  What I appreciate is that Bill Amend is still able to find the humor in situations we already know.  After all, has anything changed in this family since the strip started?  Nope.  Yet I found myself smiling, giggling, and laughing my way through this wonderful collection.  As always, current culture and daily life are offered up with humor and satire.  I've always been a sucker for Jason's over the top reactions to movies, and here we get the first two Lord of the Rings, Spiderman, Star Wars Episode II, and Harry Potter.  That week in particular is funny with the inclusion of Eileen into the mix.  On the home front, we get Peter listening to "The Odyssey" in his sleep, Rodger making a trip to Costclub for Halloween candy, Peter getting sick right before Thanksgiving, and Paige getting an autographed picture of the Backsync Boys.  Truly great comic strips seem to be hard to find these days, so I really treasure the ones I find.  This is one of the best and will entertain anyone looking to laugh at themselves and our culture 
 I didnt read the book. But I thought the movie was really good. I guess all the people that are rating this movie as bad are just the typical ''Good-book, bad-movie'' folks, they are mostly everywhere and no matter how much beauty lies in one film, they will always stand in their monotonous position 
 This is a good old fashioned dyke romance, in the best sense. It's well written, being in the same class as the work of authors like Cameron Abbott, Jennifer Fulton and Karin Kallmaker, who all know how to set a story and who write very good characters. There is gentle humor, a nice build-up of tension and real charm in the story. My only criticism, and the reason I'm not giving five stars, is that the book was maybe too short. I think this excellent writer could probably have made it even better if it was longer. I'd have liked to see more of Pat and Carly in the nature setting that sparks their romance 
   This book is excellent! I would suggest this book for anyone who is young at heart, or has a wild imagination. It is about a woman who has very unique cures for the most stubborn children who won't behave. To parents, Mrs.Piggle-Wiggle is a miracle-worker. To kids, she is a friend who always has time to stop for tea. She is one neighbor anyone would want to have 
 I purchased the stroller sight unseen, no one around here has it in stock yet.  I have a 20 month old and a 7 month old.  YES, it is STILL heavy, but Graco never claimed it was LIGHTER, just more COMPACT, so I just figure it will help tone my arms up!  It gets around great!  The only two things I found I would change on the stroller are 1) the cupholders are small in diameter and do not accomodate most of my sons sippy cups....and 2)  I have a hard time lowering the cargo basket, maybe its just my model? I received the stroller with the brake shattered, but called Graco and they immediately sent a replacement free of charge.... great cust service.  I'd spend the money again 
 This is a good album.  The best song on the album is track #8 "I Am That I Am."  This song had to be written under the spirit, because I don't see how somebody could write all those words and make them flow so well.  They performed that song on Bobby Jones Gospel a while ago.  Well, y'all need to get this album, especially for "I Am That I Am!&quot 
 This gun is amazing.it's speed is awesome.you could hit hit people with good force from a good distance. its a little heavy at 6-7lbs. it has decent aim and great power. the bipod works great. i would definitly reccomend this gun 
 OK, I have tried to make a couple of things from this book, and must say that the instructions were hard to follow in those particular cases, and for one item, the gauge was impossible to get.  I wrote to the publishers asking about corrections a couple of times, and was completely ignored.  I am seriously annoyed, and will never buy a book by this author again.  Old review..... I have to echo the previous reviewer (Bronwyn) - I'll probably just make the tank tops from this book - and maybe the cute chenille robe - and the net sweater - oh, and the cute little top from the cover (hey! that's more than I'd make from most of my other books!).  I knew what to expect from having read the blurb, but ordered it anyway even though I knew I would never wear a knitted bikini.... because I wanted something DIFFERENT.  Some of the designs are way too bare for me, but it's fun to have something completely different.  And I must say that they are really not vulgar.  To wear the bikinis, you need to have an amazing figure, and to live on a beach - but I can see the bikini tops as little tops under transparent or gauzy tops - much cuter than either of my two usual options - boring skin coloured bra or obvious pretty bra a la Carrie Bradshaw.  I think it's a little bit unfair to criticise a book for living up to its name and cover 
 This book is a wonderful help in understanding how cataloging fits into the MARC format. The author takes you step by step and note by note on how to enter, what to enter, and what it needs to look like. I am a catalogin student and I found this book a great help in getting my classes done. (p. s. I got an A-  
 Yes it is the CD for people who don't like rap, but really dig songs like Walk This Way; White Lines; Humpty Dance.   Good party C 
 I love, love, love this CD. Very French. Very romantic. If you're looking for traditional accordian music, you may not appreciate this CD. The music is more like classical waltz music. Very beautiful.  I only wish I could find more music like it 
 I received this book as gift from a fellow statistician about two years ago, since then it was never more than three steps away from the place I was working. I continued to search for other Marketing Research titles,  from Amazon and other Web dealers to Chicago libraries and bookstores, I  didn't find any other title wich such a clear and up-to-date approach. Of  course there other respectfull titles, as ESOMAR's Handbook of Marketing  and Opinion Research, but the last is, as the name says, a handbook,  presenting all techniques and where to find them (it's perfect if you want  to use something and don't know where to look for the article) but it  doesn't get into applying the stuff. That's the MARKETING RESEARCH major  merit, it get's into applied statistics - it describes a technic and  explain in wich analytical context it would fit better. Even in the last  chapter: "Additional Data Analysis Techniques" - that was dealing  with improvements that had just been added to statistical programs as SPSS,  like Segmentation Trees, Neural Networks and Structural Equation Modeling,  they were able to discuss each technique in a few pages, without being  superficial. Last, but not least, the book also presents lots of output  examples, full featured in SPSS, SAS and other major statistical programs 
 This is a great compilation of funk-infused shoulda-been-golden oldies. Many of these songs are full of style, personality, and have lovable lyrics; highlights include "I get lifted," "funky cat," and the lovely "don't let the good times go bad." The only reason I didn't give this CD 5 stars is that I feel Soul Jazz Record's "New York Noise" compilation is a more captivating CD as a whole. Heck, just buy both 
 Benjamin Franklin is what I wish America was today-hard work mixed with good marketing. Unfortunately, to paraphrase Thomas Edison, Americans don't want real success today because it's hard work wrapped in overalls.  Bubble this, bubble that.  Get rich through the internet, get rich through real estate.  The mythical instant success.  Through Mr. Isaacson's fine book we are reminded that true success is built over a lifetime; through helping others we help ourselves.  Marketing is fine, self-promotion, too-as long as it is supported by substance.  A fine, easy-reading biography of one of America's true patriots.  
 This book is a wonderful guide to what happens after breast cancer treatment is over.  Just trying to figure out what to call ourselves is difficult.  I'm in the phase after chemotherapy and after all the doctor's appointments when you feel as if you are on a cliff waiting to go over.  Ms Schnipper's book gives the feelings relevance and acknowleges that just because you are through with treatment many fears and concerns persist.  I certainly recommend this book to anyone who has been diagnosed with breast cancer as well as anyone who is close to someone who may be going through this stage.  Her view as a health care practitioner and someone living with breast cancer gives her a unique perspective 
 Cool toy. I'm sure my daughter will enjoy it more after we figure out how to download. I tried downloading from the free videos offered thru Tiger Electronics, but I can't get thru their parental controls to download 
 "Andrew "Radaar"" wrote;  "Things have changed a lot since 1982, that is if the movie "Fast Times At Ridgemont High" is any indication of what the times were back then. Man, it seems as though things have calmed down a bit. I guess things weren't really like that though."  I graduated from High School in 1982. I don't know how things are now, but this 'is' the way they were when I was in school. This movie could have practically been a documentary of my High School. Several of the things in this movie have either happened to me or were personally witnessed by me. Of course some of the things in it are completely over the top, for instance ordering a pizza right to your classroom, but this is supposed to be a comedy, after all. Great movie, a must see 
 This book along with the two prior books were sent to me as a birthday present.  These books are simply the best present I have ever received.  I have read and re-read them time and time again.  I finshed this third book in two sittings it is that terrific!  Breathtaking beautiful,lyrical, and beyond description - it's what great classics should be.  Thank God my brother-in-law sent them.  Order them now, sit back and enjoy the timeless realm, battles, conflicts and life of ancient Japan.  You will not be sorry 
  For a long time, the City Watch has been ruined and what was once many men is now three. Captain Vimes the drunkard kind hearted leader. Corporal Nobbs, know one really knows his species. And Sergent Colon, shy, timid and has a letter relationship with his wife.  And now we get to Carrot. He was raised by dwarfs and has just entered Ankh-Morpork and has just joined The City Watch. Then sudenlly a dragon is terrorizing the city and it's up to the City Watch to save the city. A story full of Dragons, mystery, accion, flatulent fire and summonings.  I REALLY enjoyed this book. It was funny, and it was just plain great. I really liked the Carrot character becuase of his charisma and his personality.  A DEFINITE FOUR STARS 
 This is a very good keyboard for games 'cause it's cool to have bigger directional keys, very comfortable. It's kinda hard at the beginning to type because now u have like a reduced version of ur keyboard in the right side, but it's just a matter of time and practice. Very good keyboard, I really like it 
 Well, why I say it is a perfect guide, it is because it covers all the cars, tracks and the process of each stage.  For example, in this book, it tells me I need like 6 stars to get to stage 4, 9 stars to stage 5 and 10 stars to stage 10 and to beat the game.  For the tracks, it tells me pretty in detail of how long, how to run and how to win a race by these tracks.  For the cars, it tells me which is good and which is not good.  Basically, this book tells me a hint of how to play it.  
 This is another incredible book by Koontz which I found very difficult to put down.  The story revolves around Susan Thorton, waking in a hospital bed after a car accident, having been in a coma and suffering now from amnesia. The terror starts when she slowly encounters dead men from a horrifying incident 13 years earlier.  Each time Susan feels like she's starting to understand things, the rug gets pulled out from under her feet, and you're right there with her, baffled at each new turn, and feeling her terror with each encounter with the dead men. As she slowly questions whether she's slipping over the edge into insanity, you also question her sanity, and what is real and what is illusion.  Koontz's prose is excellent, truly putting us inside of Susan's head, making you wonder how YOU would react if put in the same situation.  An excellent read and a definite recommendation 
 Selling Sickness shows us the organizaitonal chart for what patients already know; We don't need all the prescription drugs we are taking.  Drug companies are master marketers - second to none and they work the system of physicians and patients to create a money making machine that should make Microsoft and Budweiser sit down and take notes.  The book is a quick read and makes its point powerfully; don't trust the system (unless your 401K is mostly Phizer and Merck... 
 I am right in the middle of the book and had to stop and write a review. This book captured me by the first page. I found my self stopped middle of the room reading it rather then waiting the six paces to get back to my chair. I fyou like Jeanne Dams and the Dorothy Martin series (an expatriate ex-teacher from Indiana now living in England) you'll love this book about a retired librarian from New York now living outside Oxford. All New Grandmothers will nod and chuckle to themselves over the mother daughter issues of raising the grandchildren. I personally really like the culture shock of Americans living in England. I find here development of the victim especially interesting and can't wait to see how it ends. I will be waiting for Slaying is such sweet sorrow with great expectation 
 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED 
 "Modigliani" is a very special and beautiful film about a love story in the 1920s' Paris, and one of history's greatest painters.  Garcia is masterful, and Elsa Zylberstein is wonderful as his devoted "wife" and lover, Jeanne Hebuterne.    What a lovely yet ultimately sad and tragic story.  Richly filmed in Romania; written and directed by Mick Davis.  It is entrancing to hear Edith Piaf sing "La Vie En Rose" once again, as part of a film that is beautifully done, to say the least.    It is a UK/German/Romanian/French/Italian co-production, not the usual trash that Hollywood produces 
 These "15 Minute..." foreign language series are wonderful. They're accessible, convenient, and simple. It doesn't bog you down with too much information on one page or section, nor does it give you phrases that may be a bit too informal or just ridiculous. After reading over one section at least 3 times you acquire the phrases and the words naturally without thinking too hard. Also, the colorful illustrations make it much more realistic and fun. I'd highly recommend it for those who may travel to France or those who are learning French. I like this series so much that I'm going to buy a 15 Minute German for my friends. 
 David Livingstone Smith presents Why We Lie as a beginning step in the direction of an evolutionary psychology of deception.  "Nature is awash with deceit," he claims.  He produces many fascinating examples of deceit in nature (jumping spiders, for example) as a survival strategy and points out that "although we claim to value truth above all else, we are also at least dimly aware that there is something antisocial about too much honesty."   Smith gives an evolutionary account that in a nut shell goes as follows.  As our evolutionary ancestors began to gather in larger and larger groups, the increasing complexity of group dynamics led to an "arms race between deception and detection [that had] huge implications for the evolution of human intelligence."   The advent of language upset the balance between deception and detection and gave a huge advantage to the liar.  "Most of us are embarrassingly inept at spotting liars."  The problem is that we tend to privilege speech over raw observation, and thereby miss the clues that give the liar away.   "Once our ancestors learned to gossip, they could form secret alliances, deceive each other far more effectively about where they stood in relation to other community members, and stab each other in the back."    Under Smith's account "the power to deceive is our main weapon in the struggle for social survival."  Self-deception was an adaptation that enabled us to better deceive others.  The result for us today?  Not so good.  "Self-deception has been a wonderful gift, but it is now destroying us.  Our taste for it resembles our craving for sugar and animal fat."  Further, "the most dangerous forms of self-deception are the collective ones.  Patriotism, moral crusades, and religious fervor across nations like plagues, slicing the world into good and evil, defender and aggressor, right and wrong."  Smith's book is, as he admits, thin on evidence and light on research.  Even so, it is a quick, easy read with enough interesting insights to nudge the reader a little closer to that ever elusive goal of self-knowledge.  After all, shouldn't you know whether, at the most fundamental level, you are a self-deciever?  It's worth thinking about. 
 From start to finish I still get a rush when I play this album. I own all her recordings, audio and video, and have heard different arguments about over-production on her earlier efforts. This album is a standout from a remarkable songwriter. Check out Wonderlust for a taste of her live performace 
 This book gives all the information you will need about each drug, it's approved use, approved dosages, and different forms for each species.  A "must have" resource for any serious breeder 
 A great book that requires you to think.  Examine a story from many different perspectives and realize that there is no true view of any events 
 This is absolutely the very best book I have ever read - and my list is unending.  To travel back in time to the body and life of my grandmother - to see my ancient relatives that I never knew - to have that grandmother transported to today and my life --- what a gripping story.  I couldn't put it down and got angry when interrupted by dogs, dinner and telephones.  If you NEVER read another book - you MUST read this one.  If time travel is on your mind -- you MUST read this book.  If you ever wondered what your distant relatives were like - you MUST read this book.  It is wonderful and the writer is unbelieveable.  No ends are left dangling - no thoughts left hanging.  Please read and re-read 
 Geoffrey Wawro writes a fast paced, fact filled account of one of histories most analyzed conflicts. It is a Tour de Force from the very first page.   In  the ususal military style, the author, a Professor at the US Naval War College, writes a no -holds barred account that is a withering indictment of both the French and German Commanders. Despite Von Moltke's gift of military genius and improvisation his commanders nearly wrecked his best laid plans, and, the French Officers, regrettably,  deserted there men and snatched defeat from the jaws of an almost victory.   In comparison with Michael Howards book, Geoffrey is more blunt and has a slighly narrower focus on some of the key events that lead to war. In comparison with Michael Howard, his first three chapters are not as comprehensive, but compliment Sir Howards work. Never the less, the strategic and operational analysis that Wawro renders is first class, brutally frank and objective in the first degree.  There are only two books that you will ever need on the Franco-Prussian War or to have as a reference on your book shelf; this one, and the one by Sir Michael Howard 
 I love Nicholas Sparks' books. Like all his books they are an easy read. Just cuddle up on the sofa and begin. As always he mixes tragic and love. This one is especially sweet with a child who lost his mom, and his dad finding new love. There are twist and turns in the book and some are sad. You won't be dissappointed. 
 This reviewer has recently been on a regional-retro film fest of my own, watching the Minnesota branch of the Graduate's off-spring: (the Heartbreak Kid; Foolin' Around,) and decided it was high time to revisit their roots.  I'm glad I did.  The Graduate is still prime Boomer comfort and soul food.   And I learned a lot from the extras on this "Special Edition:" For instance: Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin and Director Mike Nichols are  *not* attempting some grandiose JesusChrist Superstar (Oops! Wrong Movie ;-)  symbolism when Ben is pounding on the upstairs window in the church - it was a pragmatic solution to the real parish pastor's  concern that they were gonna break his beautiful bequested glass if Dustin/Benjamin continued pounding on it like he had at rehersals - better to disperse the pressure! All in all, still fantastic after all these years!  /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer 
 We bought this chair for my 3 year old son when he was born and we are still using it!  So when my daughter was born 8 months ago we kept thinking that our son would be ready for a "big" chair.  Well, he informed us that he was not giving up his chair so we had to buy another one for our daughter.  I love how easy it is to clean, that it reclines, and that the tray is so easy to get on and off.  Also, we don't have a lot of room in our house, so this just sits in one of our chairs and if we need to take it somewhere, we can do that too 
 buy this book.  then by The Perennial Philosophy. both will change your life.  in a most descriptive way it describes that "All you need is love."  A simple but extremely difficult concept to master and live 
   Nicholas Nickleby was written in 1838-39 by Charles Dickens riding the crest of his monumental success from writing Pickwick Papers and Oliver Twist. The lengthy novel is filled with memorble characters, an exciting plot and the incredible genius of England's greatest novelists.   The story concerns the adventures of Nicholas Nickleby (the least interesting character in the book!, his sister Kate and his fatuous and longwinded mother the widow Mrs. Nickleby.   Nicholas works for a time in the infamous Dotheboys Hall for boys in Yorkshire. The schoolmaster is the evil Wackford Squeers, his odious wife and his ugly daughter Fanny who becomes infatuated with Nicholas. it is here that we meet the pathetic mentally challenged lad Smike who is assisted by Nicholas and along with him leaves the horrid school.   One of the most hilarious parts of the book deals with the time NN spent with the Vincent Crummles theatrical company. Dickens loved the theatre and loved to act in amateur theatricals.     Katle Nickleby is employed at the Madame Mantalini milliery shop and becomes a companion to a wealthy and ridiculous woman. She is pursued romantically by the scoundrel Sir Mulberry Hawk.   Dickens draws a vivid portrait of corrupt evil in the wicked uncle Ralph Nickleby a usurer whose wiles and schemes for fortune pull the many threads of the plot into a well woven plot that has a crackerjack ending as secrets are revealed and all ends well for the Nickleby family.    This is still in many ways an work of growth for the budding novelists. It resembles a picaresque novel of the eighteenth century in following Nicholas and Kate through many scenes and situations. The genius of the novel lies in Dickens peerless ability to draw memorable characters that will live in the reader's mind long after the complicated plot machinations are forgotten.   The Penguin Edition is excellently edited with copious notes and a learned introduction. The original illustrations by Hablot K. Browne are also included (Phiz). This is a pageturner which will entertain you for hours. It is a good novel to begin with if you have not read Dickens. The Dickens world is filled with all those marvelous characters which shall live as long as literature. Great 
 This book is fabulous not only because of the easy to read simple content but because of the wonderful photos. This book is captivating for children and adults. Even if you do not know how to read, this book will be your favorite simply because of the pictures. You will have a new appreciation for frogs and toads 
 A classic, everyone must own it, even those that would not describe themselves as Led Zep fans.   Nothing more to be said.  You must own this CD.  If you like the hard-rock, riff-driven songs on this CD, I recommend Led Zeppelin II - it contains Zep's best riffs 
 MOUNTAIN MAN continues to be a classic in American Western literature.  The major foundation for the movie, Jeremiah Johnson, MOUNTAIN MAN tells the story of Samuel John Minard, a mountain man known for his physical prowess and for his quick and educated intellect. A renaissance man who has chosen the life of the great American West.    In his adventures Sam meets up with Indians of various tribes, other mountain men and a crazy pilgrim woman.  HIs marriage to an Indian maiden leads him into a one-man war with sweeping consequences for himself and for his enemies.  MOUNTAIN MAN, as is the case with most books upon which movies are based, considerably outshines JEREMIAH JOHNSON in its story and characterizations.  But, hey, I love the movie as well.  I guess that says a lot about what I think of the book.  THE HORSEMA 
 Though a little dated now, Mr. Vallejo's book is no less informative now as it was when he was first making waves in the world of fantasy illustration.  The techniques he espouses are useful and relevant to any  illustrator, not just the ones in the genre.  More than any other  reference, this book kick-started my own fantasy illustration career.  For  me, Mr. Vallejo's most valuable lesson is that an artist's portfolio is  only as strong as its weakest piece... which he so wonderfully demonstrates  by combining his most dazzling work side-by-side with some of his earlier,  not-so-spectacular work.  A thousand thank-yous for this book, Mr. Vallejo 
 I almost didnt buy this book.  There were mixed reviews and the general tone of the negative reviews were that the book was superficial or possibly inaccurate.  Well I bought the book in spite of those warnings.  I am very glad I did.    To begin with Prose has done an outstanding job of weaving together 9 separate and unique lives.  She does not claim to have written the definitive work on artisitic influence or motivation.  She did not claim to corner the market on thoughts of Eros and Art.  What she did was describe nine woman and the artists they inspired.  It was clear from her references and asides that she had done research on far more than these women.  She freely borrowed from other muses and interests in other relationships and wove together not only nine separate stories but craftily connected them into a thread that takes us from the most simple and reticent muse -- Alice Liddell to a modern woman artist whose own identity and influence is lost in the artist and his in hers, not always in a positive way -- Yoko Ono.  I found that Prose walks briskly through each life but also is telling us a greater story.  A story of feminine influnce and the evolving way women have been viewed as muses, lovers, artists and people.    Often I stopped to examine or reexamine an artist or their work.  As Prose open a new semiotic eye on a work, not from the reader's perspective of the work, but from the artist's perspective and intent.  Not so much to say what the artist was trying to describe to the viewer, but why he was creating it at all.  I can't say if Prose' work is accurate or inaccurate.  I dont know enough of these lives.  I do know that I have a new perspective on some of the artists and a desire to learn more of these women and their influence.  Buy it and read it 
 I had to read this book for a class titled, "The Historian's Craft."  Although Lynn White Jr's book contained many foreign languages (all translated in footnotes and endnotes), and refered to many historical events (events that could easily be looked up in a history book), I thought it was put together quite well.  I had to give a fifteen minute presentation on Lynn White Jr. and this book, which I stretched into thirty minutes because there was so much to talk about.  Great book 
 a look into the lives of different people. it makes one think that one in simular cercumstances is not alone.A infomative book that shows real people in real lives.  well done!!  It does need though, more family portrates of  transgendered people. Im glad I waited over two monthes for this book 
 In each serious field of human endeavor there is one preeminent book--Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, McCormick on Evidence, Fowler's The King's English, etc.  For card magic, this is the book.  I bought my copy almost 20 years ago, and I still refer to it all the time.  No, I'll never be able to do everything in this book--a 100% perfect second deal will forever elude me. But the wealth of material here is staggering.  You get a chapter devoted to each sleight, such as false shuffles, palms, lifts, and passes.  You also get chapters with amazing routines using the sleights.  If you conscientiously study this book, there is very little in card magic that you will be unable to do.  That said, the book has sparse diagrams and a writing style from almost 60 years ago, which means you really have to concentrate when reading it.  I was disappointed to see that the beautifully bound Dover edition is out-of-print.  If you see a copy, grab it.  Don't hesitate; the world of advanced card magic awaits you 
 I can't get enough of this CD! As well as my significant other 
 Thanks to this book, we are able to keep abreast of the latest information in cosmetic ingredients. It's too bad people use misinformation to convince their friends that cosmetics somehow end up in the bloodstream. They aren't drugs and shouldn't be treated as such. Please read this book and stop being paranoid 
 This book has no doubt been the best book I've ever read.  I credit this book with saving my marriage.  My husband and I had filed for divorce (all we had to do was sign the bottom line) and decided to give it one last chance.  My mother sent us to a marriage conference featuring Dr. Chapman and his book.  After the conference, I just had to buy the book and I read it through almost non-stop.  The principles found in this book are not just applicable to marriage but carry over into every other relationship in your life.  Awesome!  
 This book is excellent for the engineering student.  I recommend it for the beginning student of fluid mechanics or for the advanced student wishing to refresh his/her knowledge of fluid mechanics.  The collaborative effort by the authors produce a beautifully explained text.  The material is clear and concise and the additional software included with the book is of great use for illustrating important concepts 
 I am an attorney (shyreslaw.com) and I highly recommend this book for those who could use a simple trust and want to avoid probate.  Even if you decide to hire an attorney, this book is invaluable because it offers great insight into trusts and avoiding the probate system.  Attorney Denis Clifford wrote this great do-it-yourself book which provides everyone a way to create their own simple living trust.  A CD-ROM is also provided so you can easily input your information and print it out.    For a more complete estate plan, the book introduces the importance of pourover wills in case the trust fails to encompass all the property.  You may want to peruse Mr. Clifford's Simple Will Book as well (another recommended buy).   
 This is one of the best books I have read in a while about writing. It is not just for screenplay writers, but for anyone who is interested in writing stories. The practical tips on structure are excellent and very helpful. 
 Have you read, and loved, Lois McMaster Bujold's Curse of Chalion, anything by Steven Brust, or some early Robin Hobb? Then read this book. Or, if you've read Reimann's first two Tielmaran novels, you won't need any convincing. This is easily the best of the three -- the only problem was how long it took to write it! Return readers will get some things they expect -- fast action, powerful magic, and a beautiful sense for wild, rugged terrain -- and some things they may not -- new, ah, developments between Gaultry and Martin, and some great new characters (the Climens family, Agrat and Elizabeth, were my favorites). And of course, this book ties up the other two to end the series (for the moment anyway). Good that Reimann resisted the temptation to milk these great settings and characters dry for a hundred books, but I still hope she'll come back to them. There's plenty of magic and adventure left in this vivid world.Maybe some more stories about Agrat and her children? We can only hope... anyway, great book 
 Really good intro to ideas and concepts needed to redesign an organization in terms of its structure.  Best if you already have some degree of experience in do it so you can really apply the concepts 
 Moliere's Tartuffe has been a great favorite of mine for years. It's just so witty and so truthful. Moliere's satire hits religious hypocrisy harshly, and that's such a valuable message, even several centuries later. Moreover, Moliere's play isn't anti-religious; there is instead an appeal to true religion and toward the development of virtue. So few writers have ever been as witty as Moliere either. There are so many hilarious scenes here, my favorite being the table scene. And the dialogue throughout it just extraordinarily clever as well, particularly during the exchanges between Orgon and either Cleante or Dorine.   Wilbur's masterful translation just enhances the joys of Moliere's classic play. It's a terribly difficult thing to make the couplets of Neoclassical France tenable to a contemporary audience, but of course, Wilbur has made them so. All of the sharpness, the liveliness of the lines is preserved, making Tartuffe accessible, intelligently, to today's audience. Of course, Wilbur's other translations of Moliere are excellent as well.  Wilbur's translation of Tartuffe is really one that can't be missed. The combination of the master French playwright Moliere with Richard Wilbur, a modern poetic master in his own right, is just superb. Wilbur's Tartuffe is a total pleasure 
 I was so enamored of this book, I obtained the "sequel" (Wild Card Quilt), as soon as I knew it was available. I have only one relative who describes herself as a "cracker" and, wanting to know more about just what she meant, purchased this book. This extremely candid account of Ms. Ray's childhood and coming-of-age in poverty and the obscurity of southern Georgia resonated (sometimes, too much), with my youth. This is NOT Mayberry, RFD. It is a marvelous quilt of stories, often funny, often sad, but always compelling. The people in her narrative(s) are rather larger than life - making a living for their families in the 50's and 60's in this part of America - truly took the work of some "Giants in the Earth". Perhaps my closest association with the book, was her narrative of her father's illness. I, too, had experienced the uncertainty of growing up poor, with our family breadwinner often unable to work.  Ms. Ray also has an environmental axe to grind - and I am in sympathy - as I worry for the future of my own Adirondacks - just as she fights to preserve what is left of the pine forests unique to her part of Georgia. Read the stories. Enjoy the unique folks. Savor the wonderful writing. No matter how or where you grew to adulthood, share the lives of these unique people and I will bet you get an urge to chronicle your own childhood memories for the generations who follow you. Hopefully you will provide them with an insight of their own roots and give them reasons to look backward and reflect. 
 John Foley's approach to combining brand identity with corporate values  and culture is a worthwhile strategy to assimilate into one's company. Everyone is aware that a brand will get a customer 'in the door' but Foley's strategy for identifying key stakeholders and keeping them engaged, is a strategy every company should learn how to employ and practice. I would highly reconmend this book to all who are interested in advancing both the mission and bottom line of their companies. This book would have particular appeal to young people entering the work force as a tool for staying engaged with their comapany's customers. 
 Maybe too much time has passed since the release of this album to have encouraged everyone else to give Public Image the five stars it deserves. It does seem to pale next to other, later post-punk sprees that occurred in the 80s and 90s. Still, nothing more brilliant had come from Lydon & Co.'s head since this release. With his typical voice, which sounded like he'd gargled with broken glass, John Lydon created his most caustic vocals ever. Jah Wobble's bass lines are beyond bottomed-out--I can't imagine how many speakers got blown to pieces that year. This album was a good-bye ... to punk. I only wish I could be more enthusiastic about the rest of PiL's output over the year 
 Ennio Moricone is one of the greatest composers in Modern music. I fell in love with his music at the age of 12 when I saw the greatest Spaghetti Westerns of all time fearturing the only actor who could pull it off...Clint Eastwood was excellent as the "Man with no name" and Morricone's music only made the experience more thrilling.  But, I do not know if you all have had the pleasure of watching John Carpenter's classic "The Thing" in which Morricone composed the creepiest soundtrack I have ever heard. The Thing is a fantastic alien film and Ennio's music made that movie an unforgettable cult classic..........I beg the execs at CD now to bring back that soundtrack or does anyone out there know how I can obtain it? As I was told it was out of print 
 This is my favourite smooth jazz album. I like the upbeat tempo, and especially the tracks: Bueno Funk, Who's that lady. No,I take that back, I love all the tracks. Also check out Walk on by on his album Reflections 
 The wisdom contained in this book is incredible. It is a must read for all people who think our society is too focused on materialistic achievement. Heschel's call for a day of rest is desperately needed. My favorite book 
 This is an excellent book for Florida fossils.  It is profusely illustrated and, though academically thorough, is easy for the layman to use and appreciate.  It is the best reference for the fossil vertebrate fauna of Florida I've seen.  The only thing I would change is to see a more detailed index 
 Raymond Brown (1928-1998) was probably the best-known Catholic biblical scholar in the U.S.  He was controversial because his views on the Bible were center to left, yet nonetheless his books earned the imprimatur of the Catholic Church and he even was appointed a member of the Pontifical Biblical Commission.  While Fr. Brown appeared to support most of the Church's teaching, it's hard to imagine that his "critical" approach ever did much to increase the faith of Catholics.  AN INTRODUCTION TO NEW TESTAMENT CHRISTOLOGY (1994) is an excellent introduction to Christology from the "centrist" perspective.  Brown hits on many of the standard topics in Christology such as the "titles" of Jesus, the resurrection, the messianic expectations of the Jews, and the like.  (It is an introduction and therefore does not cover topics that are found in longer works.)  What is most frustrating is that while Brown discusses other views, he generally limits the options to the center/left perspective.  For example, the synoptic gospels report that on at least three occasions Jesus predicted his death (Mk. 8:31; 9:31; 10:33-34 & par).  What does Fr. Brown say about these?  Well, "it is difficult to decide about Jesus' foreknowledge of his passion, crucifixion, and resurrection."  [P. 49.]  Now, if these predictions were simply "retrojected" by the early church, it is at least interesting to note that: (1) Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of man" in these passages - an expression which does not appear in the early church; and (2) there is no mention of the crucifixion or the atonement in Mark, which one might expect if they were later theological reflections put in the mouth of Jesus.  Considering that Mark was probably the first gospel written, such arguments should carry some weight.  They might not persuade non-believers, but if Brown is going to mention the findings of skeptics such as Todt and Higgins, at least he could find space for a paragraph or two to discuss the arguments I just mentioned (which, of course, aren't original to me. 
 I have worn out two copies of this in my professional days, and I am doing so again with my 'hobby' copy.  It is much handier that the on-line references for NACA data and for doing the 'quick flip through' when thinking about design. It is not, however, for either the mathematicall un-initiated, nor for the first-time designer.  The book is both thorough and rigorous in its treatment of the topics it covers.  All in all, along with the other standard texts, it supplies the needed data ad information when thinking 'I wonder if that will work... 
 Dunn recommends opening the book at a double page and just reading that spread in one sitting. And this is how I approached my "dialog" with the book. Though sometimes I found myself reading on, particularly when the following pages enlage on the concepts presented on the first pages. I have taken many courses on composition, design, and the use of materials. But somehow Dunn encourages rethinking. Have I thought of these aspects or techniques in my last painting? Could I make that next painting different by trying to apply this approach? An inspiring book that enourages one to try harder and to turn again and again to the many thoughts and examples presented 
 Other than a good edition of the plays, this is the one reference that you absolutely must have. It has tremendously enhanced my reading of the plays.  I no longer have to wonder or guess what a word means.  I believe that it was linguist John McWhorter who pointed out in one of his books that some of Shakespeare's words have changed meanings over the centuries; some of the words don't seem to fit into the context because they meant something different then.  Crytal's book clear all that up.  Whenever I look up a word, I jot down its meaning in the play.  This makes reading and rereading simpler and better.  Add to this the Arden complete plays, a fine edition and cheap in paperback, and Margaret Garber's Shakespeare After All, a readable scholarly introduction to each of the plays, and you have an inexpensive trio of books that are really all you need to enjoy reading the plays 
 I've been working about slavery for years, and that made me read lots of books that can be called an "ecologic murder". This book is the best that you can find about slave revolts in the United States. It  fulfills two purposes, the first one, tell the truth about a subject  that've been full of lies for more than 200 years. Second, make people  think why this subject' been full of lies for more than 200 years.  An  accurate bibliogrpahy helps to understand all things that matter about  slavery in the states 
  "Prayer is a state of the intellect (noia), actualized only through the light of the Holy Trinity by means of ecstasy." Evagrius Ponticus   As soon as I identified the authors name, to whom I read one book, I picked up the book which upon examination proved to be a compendium on prayer, the core of eastern Christian spirituality. In his second volume on Eastern Christian spirituality, he explores in depth the final two chapters of his earlier book; 'The Spirituality of the Christian East: A Systematic Handbook.'  Fr. pidlík follows John Cassian's methodology, in writing his Conferences, while he surveys in a systematic western style themes of eastern orthodoxy, tracing their history, with prayer as its exclusive theme. He  shares and exposes the teachings of many generations of eastern monastics through their spiritual writings, but he does not advocate a particular pattern of prayer. In nine chapters and a conclusive summary, in which he underlines theological and liturgical issues, and methods of prayer, stressing the unceasing instruction. He stresses contemplation pre-eminence, and how God's rememberance was in the thought of Basil, concluding with John of Kronstadt that, 'Prayer is therefore the life of the Spirit.'   Fr. Tomá pidlík is one of the greatest experts on the spirituality of eastern Christianity today, and has been a professor of patristic and eastern spiritual theology at various universities across the Atlantic. Lately, he was elevated cardinal by Pope John Paul II. 
 I first bought this album on tape znd wore the tape to shreds. The Look of Love what a perfect rendition, its far better than the original. My Favorite is Calling You .... Patti Austin delivers everytime.. I probably need to purchase an extra copy of this as I know I will wear it out....Enjoy.... 
 The Berenstain Bears have always been favorite books of mine. I loved reading these books as a child and could not wait to buy these same books again for our son 
 The Passion Test is a GREAT book to help you clarify what is most important to you.  If you follow the book and take the test often it helps keep you focused.  You will never be successful if you don't know what you are passionate about and keep that passion fresh in your mind 
 This is the first big book I read on trading. At first glance I thought I would fall asleep trying to read this thing. To my surprise, I find it extremely interesting and read it in no time at all. Love the stories of the famous trend followers and there successes and Misses and why. Also the book is filled with insightful quotes.  Anybody interested in trend following as a strategy then this book is for you.  P.S. For Investools followers you will find this book a little contradictive to what has been taught. Please bear in mind that this is a different strategy than you were taught and therefore has different rules it follows 
 I picked this book up because I liked the cover and I thought, however right or wrong, that a publisher would release a collection of this length to only a quality writer.  I was not wrong;  this man is a master.  I have read "The First Seven Years" at least fifteen times, and I have my classes read it all the time.  I wish I could have met Malamud.      
 Edward Colimore's The Philadelphia Inquirer's Guide To Historic Philadelphia takes the reader on twelve walking tours through city neighborhoods that have preserve history and culture through the generations. Walkers can visit buildings, streets, gardens, and parks that date back to the colonial period and the Victorian era. The Philadelphia Inquirer's Guide To Historic Philadelphia is arranged in a logical, easy-to-follow format, and includes maps, touring and public transportation information, parking tips, recommendations for nearby restaurants, and more. Enthusiastically recommended for armchair travelers or walking tourists - for anyone who either vicariously or personally wants to follow the footsteps of Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin 
 Mathewes-Green writes in an easy manner. This book is a quick read that presents the practice of Orthodox spirituality in a way that the reader can begin to enhance their relationship with God in an Orthodox way 
 I was knocked over by this DVD!  Some of the facts presented, especially about how the vast number of stars in our entire universe being necessary for our survival, nearly brought me to tears.  God reveals himself to be more awesome with each year of scientific discovery, and I do not see any way in which the Bible is contradicted by it.  The Hebrew word for day (yom), as I look in my concordance, has many meanings, including "a period of time", "time", "days", "lifetime", "course of time", etc.  The seven "yom" creation, therefore, makes perfect sense in light of this.  Jesus said the Kingdom of God was like a seed that grew to be a small shoot, and then a mature plant. It takes time.  We can look at the singularity from which God grew the universe the same way - as a seed.  Interestingly, as we learn in "Journey", the first thing emitted from the seed after the explosion was light.  "Let there be light".  Science merely explains what God gave to us in His Word, that up until now, had to be trusted on faith.  
 Having purchased this book in the hope of adding to my medical i was sure surprised when i finished the first chapter of the book. A truly capativating read, adding so much more detail to what i have learnt in university 
 This should be on the coffee table, magazine rack, bookshelf, and waiting room of every serious national leader. Conscientious voters should also read this in order to understand what it takes to make political peace in the world. But Stassen is not merely political, he's actually biblical first of all. He exegetes like a biblical scholar while making applications which only a leading Christian ethicist like he could. Just peacemaking shows that "just war theory" can lead to peace while restraining war, and that passifism is an extremely ACTIVE practice. EXCELLENT 
 Elkind shows a keen insite into the brain of youth.  A must read for parents concerned about the progress of their child 
 2002's "Alice" and "Blood Money" sound like etheral dreams. Harsh but beautiful nightmares. "Blood Money" was one of the first 3 Tom Waits records I purchased (I have about 15 now), and was instanly a favorite of mine. This stands out as a return to "Franks Wild Years" and "Black Rider" after the excellent and raw  "Bone Machine" and "Mule Variations". Lryically was far more interesting imho on "Mule Variations", than on this record, but here the instrumentation is lush and full. Kathleen Brennan (Tom waits co-producer/writer, Wife) has said Tom Waits writes "Grim Reepers and Grim Weeepers". That is true for this cd, the evil-barked songs are "Misery Is The River Of The World", "God's Away On Business" and "Starving In The Belly Of A Whale". The Weepers include "Coney Island Baby" and "All The World Is Green". But my favorite number here is "A Good Man Is Hard To Find", which literally sounds like a dream and is a tribute of sorts to Louis Armstrong. There is alot of  ideas here from early american music (Coney Island Baby) that is hardly ever used anymore if at all. Essential Puchas 
 I haven't seen the book, but i have a feeling it will be gre 
 While I have not purchased this book from Amazon.com, I have reviewed it at a local bookstore.  The book itself speaks more on the psychiatric area of "Nazi-medicine" rather than on actual experimentation.  For  those interested in a more focused book on the Nazi's "bio-medical  vision" they should read "The Nazi Doctors" by R.J. Lifton.   It is an excellent and descriptive book, giving accounts from survivors.   It is careful to give actual accounts instead of fabricated stories, at the  same time not glorifying Nazi science.  I disagree with the comment about  this book being reviewed.  In my personal opinion, it does not glorify Nazi  science.  I have read many books on this subject and say that this book  deserves credit, but not enough for five stars 
 The underground-dwelling homeless people of NYC have been exposed to toxic chemicals and have mutated into cheesy-looking but highly amusing monsters who periodically come up to street level to gobble up human victims.  My reception to this 1984 horror picture, when I initially reviewed it at imdb.com was lukewarm, but it's grown on me since that first viewing.  (I know, I have to accept that people will attack my credibility if I keep changing my mind on films that I disliked at first.)  It's still glorified 1980's style horror junk, but it's ENJOYABLE junk.  When you listen to the side-splitting commentary by stars John Heard, Daniel Stern, and Christopher Curry, director Douglas Cheek, and original writer Shepard Abbott (what kind of name is that - SERIOUSLY?) the value easily goes up a notch.  The film was obviously a labor of love for all concerned - this junk was made with HEART.  Things I didn't know: Cordis Heard, who plays the policewoman Sanderson, is John H.'s older sister, and Laure Mattos, who is the very first victim of the movie, is Stern's wife.  Also, Stern's brother David was one of a handful of production assistants.  Just listen to the guys talk over the closing credits - when David's name comes up, Stern playfully snarls, "a**hole!"  As many of you know by now, what is truly incredible is the wide assortment of familiar faces throughout the film, including some prolific character actors (you may not recognize future film slimeball Jon Polito - he's much thinner and has a full head of hair!) and some future sitcom stars, some of whom were personally selected by the leads.  In fact, Christopher Curry, an unknown at the time, wouldn't have gotten his role if his friends Heard and Stern hadn't insisted that he be cast.  The commentary alone makes it worth buying.  Also included are the obligatory theatrical trailer, and a decent behind-the-scenes photo gallery, including the original C.H.U.D. design concept.  This DVD gets four out of five from me 
 This book was given to me on the last day of High School in 1972 by a girl friend.  I've kept this book ever since and it ranks up there with my all time favorite books even though I agree with one other reviewer that this is not the best example of Lawrence's work.  However, with that said, this book also has a heart and tenderness that really meant something to me.  I'm amazed no one has ever written a screenplay of this work since it's worth it.  It was the only book Lawrence ever won a prize for, which says something about it.  Take a chance and read it 
 I too must compare this to one of the greatest albums ever, Mezzanine. I don't, however, feel like they are trying to imitate. This album contains an incredible amount of variety but none of it reaches too far beyond the expected moody-down-tempo. Backslide and Blueskies is a little on the jazzy side while In the Blink of and Eye is down right Techno. But Crazymoon, Falling, Future and Bound are just perfect. Unfaltering back beats, good bass with female melancholy lyrics.  In my mind there are three albums woven together by three of the best songs of the genre, Portishead - Roads, Massive Attack - Black Milk and Soma Sonic - Crazy Moon, so it would be difficult not to compare them. In the end though all the songs on this album do work well together. Soma Sonic - Future just feels good 
 "Rex Appeal" is the amazing story of one of the most significant fossil discoveries in the last fifty years. The story of "Sue" the fossil Tyrannosaurus Rex discovered by Peter Larson's associate Susan Hendrickson spins a web of intrigue from the moment the dinosaur's bones are discovered. With splashy headlines and national press coverage "Sue" becomes the darling of science, then the bane of Larson. The landowner from whom the fossil was "bought" cries foul. Maurice Williams who is one eighth Lakota Sioux had put his land in trust with the United States Government. When Williams realizes the fossil may be worth many multiples of the $5000 he was paid for its excavation, the United States Government gets involved and when that happens it makes an IRS audit look like a todler's birthday party. The problem for Larson is that he is not strictly a scientist, but has established a for-profit organization called the Black Hills Institute. Not to say that Larson has nothing to contribute scientifically to the study of dinosaurs. His science is outstanding by current standards. But, the government suspects that Larson has nefarious intentions and pursues him with the fury of, well, of a pissed off T.Rex. "Sue" is seized by the FBI and the South Dakota National Guard and the ensuing legal battle is extremely one-sided, according to Larson of course. He is confronted with an over-zealous prosecutor and a biased judge. Without hearing the other side of the story its impossible to pass judgement on the veracity of the case against Larson. But it is safe to say that the judge in the case certainly defied all logic when he declared "Sue" real estate. 65 million year old bones hardly qualify as real estate, especially if the landowner was paid a handsome sum for their retrieval. In the end Larson winds up in prison for nearly two years, his marriage to co-author Kristin Donnan dissolves, and his Institute is nearly bankrupt. Somehow Larson manages to emerge at the other end of the tunnel a changed man. He still pursues fossils with vigor after learning what many who have gone before him could have told him, "you can't fight City Hall". The only criticism of the book is the complete lack of any intimations about Larson's relationship with co-author and ex-wife Kristin Donnan. Donnan is a free-lance writer who covers the "Sue" story and eventually falls in love with, and marries Larson. There is nothing in the book about their affairs. Whether that is intentional or not it would have at least contributed something to the story and clarified some of the events.  In all the book is highly recommended. Larson's theories about T.Rex and other issues related to dinosaurs are well thought out and informative. This book is a must for all us amateur paleontologists who can't get off our couches to go out west to do a little digging ourselves 
 I LOVE this book.  So much I read it twice and am currently reading another of his books.  So far this one is my favorite.  Some of it is "fluff"  but he makes you see that it is a joke keeping all the stuff you probably should throw out.  It makes you laugh and say yep I do that!  Since reading this book, I haven't been able to totally dejunk my home; however, before purchasing anything - I really think about the item and where I would put it in our home 
 I have a tendency to not like more than one album by an artist, but tracy bonham is as firy and passionate on this cd as she was on her first. her wit and sarcastic edge are not lost either.  from the feminist feel-good song of the century "behind every good woman", which jars it's way through your brain as it is undoubtably catchy and interesting, to "jumping bean", a bouncy, exhilarating song of self-proclamation, to the pensive and meaningful "give us something", this album will take you places 
 This album will not disapoint. Though many of the tracks sound a lot alike, they're all gold. It combines techno/electic with a metal like sound. There are no slow songs on this album so be ready for fast pased, high energy, sexy songs. Enjoy 
 The novel "The Things They Carried" is based on Tim O'Brien's military service during the time of the Vietnam War.  It is told using fictional characters whose story was inspired by O'Brien's own experience.  Each person carried something different whether it was love notes, bibles, ammunition, guns or even tranquilizers.  However, not only did they carry tangible items, they also carried the emotional burdens of the war.   O'Brien was born October 1, 1946 in Austin, Minnesota.  He studied political science in college and protested against the war.  Therefore it was very difficult to accept his draft notice which he got as a graduate student in 1968.  He served in Vietnam from February 1969 until March 1970.  This novel made me realize the true horrors of war.  For example the medic Rat Kiley became so terrified that he began to feel as if bugs were crawling all over him.  He shot his toe off so he could go home.   Death came in many gruesome ways -  those I expected like land mines, and those that surprised me, drowning by sinking into mud.  The one positive feeling I got from the book is that friendship can be very strong and hold us together even in the most trying of times.  I would recommend this book to anyone who wonders what war does to ordinary people.  
 film.  Terrific use of lighting and camera work.  If you like HBO's 'Deadwood' series you'll see where they got there story line here.  Leonard Cohen's songs fit perfectly with the story.  Cohen, so it goes was very taken with Altman's work on 'MASH' and after 'McCabe' was finished gave the song's to Altman to use.  That's right gave.  He didn't take any money for hits like 'Sisters of Mercy' and the 'Stranger Song' 
 This is a book contains loads of great information.  It is a great intro to the origins of country music.  However, the amount of information is overwhelming and the writing is very boring.  Still, its unlikely that any book will give be as comprehensive as this one 
   Christian de la Huerta's insightful book digs deep into the reality that anyone: straight or GLBT people can be lead spiritual and religious lives.    For anyone who has just come out, or has been on this journey for a long time and is trying to reconnect or catch up with spirituality and trying to lead a life that is meaningful, "Coming Out Spiritually" is a must-read book.   This book has shown me that I can make a difference in my own, personal world and in the world at large.  And I can achieve through my own spirituality and personal religious upbringing.     A great book to help anyone understand what it means to be a spiritual or religious person in this vast world we live in 
 RESPIRO is one of those Italian treasures of a film, this time written and directed by the insightful Emanuele Crialese, that isolates humanity in a place where all the joys and  foibles of living become cogently the entire point of the story.  RESPIRO mixes the gut-level Italian response to life with the surreal flights of fancy made famous by Fellini.  Lampedusa is a Mediterranean island between Sicily and Tunisia that is baked by the sun and is far enough away form the culture of Italy to be a return to the native.  The population is all involved in fishing.  On this picturesque island lives Grazia (the beautiful and talented Valeria Golina) who appears to be a wonderfully free spirit but is actually a bipolar personality.  She lives happily with her fisherman husband Pietro and her children: teenage Marinella (Veronica D'Agostini), Pasquale (Frncesco Casisa - a very fine little actor!) and Filippo (Filippo Pucillo).  The boys adore their mother and their father and often make excuses for their mother's wild behavior patterns to the villagers who view her as a menace.    When Grazia's actions come under scrutiny by Pietro and he considers the advice of the grandmother (Muzzi Loffredo) who occasionally gives Grazia tranquilizing injections when her manic side surfaces and suggests Grazia needs psychiatric help in Milan, Grazia runs away to hide in a grotto, her whereabouts are known only to Pasquale.  The little village mentality merges and the people search the waters for what they feel must be the death of Grazia, only to discover on St Bartolo's Day that Grazia is blithely swimming in the ocean.  How this affects the village and the lives of this tender family is the secret of the movie: revealing the ending would dissipate the joy of RESPIRO.  Suffice it to say that the closing footage will simply take your breath away!  This little treasure of a movie has some of the most imaginative photography - both above and below the surface of the surrounding ocean - of any film you'll see.  The music by John Surman is pitch perfect and atmospheric.  The way director Crialese  captures the folklore-like behavior of the youngsters' games, and the married-to-the-sea philosophy of the villagers, is utterly magical.  This is a movie that celebrates those raw emotions of being human that seem to be eroding into the cultural pablum of contemporary society.  RESPIRO is a glowing reminder of the worth of a return to Eden.  In Italian with English subtitles.   Grady Harp, November 200 
 This book came in as a most accurate guide in a moment of crisis. I kept worrying so much about my husband's bad health - he has heart insufficiency - that it ate me up. Changing the focus to appreciate how precious and rich is our relationship now and taking each day as a gift instead of apprehending it as a loss has changed it all. It is hard work though and I am most grateful to the expertise skilfully shared with us by the authors to help me forge the right kind of vibration to get through fear and reach new grounds where hope and life prevail 
 A book well worth reading, but it may not be what you expect.  The title is a bit misleading as Jean Godin is not truly a mapmaker nor is the book mostly about his wife.  The first half of this book is almost entirely about the French expedition to colonial Peru in the early 1700's, the politics and science behind it, and the different personalities which comprise it.  I did find this reading enjoyable, but I became a little frustrated when each time the plot seemed to get rolling again, Whitaker would take 10 pages to explain the geography of Peru or the history of Spain.  If you're science minded, like me, you'll get a good dose of history that you would not have otherwise chosen to read or learn.  The story, what there is of it, is adventurous and entertaining, especially for the outdoor enthusiast.  The history, politics, geography, and bugs he talks about do truly add to the understanding of the fate of the characters.  He has brought to life a story that has been handed down only as legend.  Whitaker does his best to compile all the facts, but there are still some things about this tale that we will never know.  I also felt misled by the subtitle, "A True Tale of Love, Murder, and Survival in the Amazon."  Though it was all of these, it was written more like a history book than a novel.  So if you're looking for romance, you won't find it here.  The facts are laid out one by one leaving you to make your own pictures as to what the people looked like or the dialogue they had.  One ironic note: for a book titled "The Mapmaker's Wife", the maps are rather simplistic.  No scales, keys, north arrows, or even a list of maps in the contents.  There is a list of maps in the index, however, along with other helpful information.  The author also includes a list of characters and descriptions at the back which I referenced many times.  Hopefully, this information will give you a better idea of what to expect and make your reading of this legendary tale more enjoyable.  It's well worth your time 
 This book is at the top of my list as a must-read for all of my coaching clients trying to negotiate the slippery slope of mid-life transition.  For the first time, we learn not only that we are different at mid-life and exactly HOW we are different.  Inventing the Rest of Our Lives is both reassuring and instructional 
 With a wonderful presentation format and very engaging writing style, this book informs and guides leaders who want to roll out change initiatives in their organizations. Critically, it provides information on the most important steps to take, how to build momentum, and the variety of issues that prevent your desired change from happening. This book will prove most useful when there's a good idea, someone wants to champion it, you (as the leader) want it to happen, and you need to know what to do next.  The only real thing that I'd like to have seen was a few more examples of real-world cases where change failed surprisingly due to not following the steps. Sometimes knowing the smoke signals to look for is important as knowing the success metrics to track 
 I love these murder mystery cooking books. The stories are good & the recipes are great. Diane Mott Davidson is one of my favorite authors. 
 Squarepusher, aka Tom Jenkinson, is a 21st century jazz pioneer.  That said, I'd like to compare his creative trajectory to that of John Coltrane (stick with me here, I realize that 'Trane is in a class all his own).  Coltrane's sound evolved from the melodic to the angular to the downright unlistenable.  But he always searched for new ways to express himself.  Compare his work on 'Kind of Blue' to his free-form freak-out on 'Om' and you'll understand what I'm talking about.  Now, Squarepusher, who also is in a class all his own -- but not in the same league as Coltrane -- has a similar approach to sound experimentation.  Some of it is more melodic and some of it is like a soundtrack to a gruesome murder.   But, like Coltrane, Squarepusher is always searching for new ways to express himself through sound.  Compare his earlier work to that of 'Go Plastic' and 'Do You know?...' and you can trace his relentless search for new sounds yourself.  Some of his more abstract stuff works, and some does not -- but that's what you get from a truly inspired artist.  So now comes 'Hello Everything,' which in some ways is a return to his more playful past.  It's accessible, melodic, and downright funky at times.  Heck, I might even be able to play it in on the stereo while my wife is home (she bristles at all things Squarepusher -- you either love him or hate him, so fair enough), instead of only in the earphones.  It's a return to form and melody and showcases his bass virtuosity.  I really wanted to like 'Ultravisitor,' but this new album I think exposes just how poorly produced that album was, even if it had great potential.  Simply stated, I love this album.  Not for pushing new boundaries, but simply for its clean and well-produced sound 
 This is one of the essential yoga texts. No serious yoga student can be without it. It was originally published privately in a short run a few years back and sold thousands of copies with no advertising. The new edition has a helpful new forward by the translator that gives more in-depth info on how Jois came to study yoga inthe 1920's. Beautifully designed, flawlessly translated, and amazing historical photographs. With all the silly yoga books out there, we should be grateful that Jois and some others still maintain high standards 
 I loved the movie Get Shorty, as well as the other Leonard books that have been turned into movies (Rum Punch, Out of Sight), so I had to try out this book.  It's a great read and much of the snappy dialoge from the movie is taken right from the book's narrative.  The dialoge works great both on screen and in the novel.  I appreciated the subtle differences in the plot line between the movie and the book, and the differences were enough to keep me interested in the book despite knowing much of the movie by heart.  Leonard is a master at writing dialoge.  He uses grammar that precisely captures the way people speak, and each character has a unique way of talking that is personally identifiable.  The character descriptions were so similar to the movie that I had to wonder if Leonard wrote the novel with certain actors in mind!  I recommend this as a companion to the movie.  They can be enjoyed together as the same story via two different mediums, each with its own richness 
 Its a good movie, however, its not the same version as the one on Cinemax.  Don't be disappointed that many scenes are missing 
 THE GOOD:  The Haunting of Alaizabel Cray is, overall, a great book.  The plot is intelligent, and the sequence of events keeps you at the edge of your seat the entire way through.  I couldn't put it down.    THE BAD:  I was hoping for a more original ending.  Until I reached the last few paragraphs, I was disappointed with the happiness of the closing chapter.  It just seemed too abrupt for a book filled with dark images to suddeny be so happy.  Luckily, Chris Wooding brought back the dark feel of the book in the last few paragraphs and the story ended on that note, making it satisfactory.  ROUGH SUMMARY:  Thaniel Fox is a 17 year old wych hunter.  At the start of the book he is hunting an exceptionally brave wych called a Cradlejack.  While hunting the Cradlejack, he runs into a girl who calls herself Alaizabel.  His mentor and friend, Cathaline, believes that the girl is crazy, but he disagrees.  He vows to help this girl, but he soon realizes that he is going to be getting a lot more trouble than he bargained for as the trio gets pulled into a deadly ritual that could destroy the world.  And who's going to try and stop it?  Them, of course 
 "Father--you know it's hard to be hungry, and if you do not know it we poor Indians know it... We did not think the Big Man would tell us things that was not true."  --The Delaware Chiefs to the Indian Department  Horrific--sad times in U.S. history.  Eloquent writing style, with beautiful observations of nature and the Indians exotic rituals.  Powerful, moving, disheartening, and wretched tale of the American Indian extrication from the east to the west, with the insertion of eye witness reports.  Extensive references and bibliography.    Gloria brings in some history of the early settlers.  The Red Eagle incident was the catalyst, bringing in the gradual manipulation and removal of the native tribes.  Because the Indians weren't united, the removal and relocation was made easier.  The exile to their new lands were wrought with strife and death with little morose by the military.  The white man's fire water reeked tremendous havoc.  The false promises--deception; the warring among tribes contributed to the extermination.   The story of the Black Hawk war in Wisconsin is particularly interesting and heart wrenching.  When I now hear the Indian names of Wisconsin it will be with somber reflection.  "They [white man] valued possessions and used people; Indians value people and used possessions." --Seminoles  Wish you well Scot 
 This book provided me the opportunity to step back and see myself and my children in a different light, it isn't about feeling like a failure as a parent--there is a better way!!! 
 More than a testament to Native American artistic vision and ingenuity, this book is a delightful resource for survivalists as well as historians - and for those who would just like to find ideas for less technological ways of building simple dwellings. Well illustrated with diagrams, photos and how-to drawings for constructing shelters in many different climates and with various resource limitations. Excellent, fun to read and full of eye openning ideas 
 These cookies are one of my favorites.  They are very light and are excellent with milk or coffee.  I can't wait for them to go on sale again so I can stock up! 
 I had the great fortune to study under Michael Walker at the College of Santa Fe. He is definitely one of the brightest lights around - a teacher and writer of the first caliber. If you have any access to his mind, via lecture, this book, online, or otherwise, and you have a true desire to write and write well, take that opportunity. Power Screenwriting (then in a mimeographed and spiral bound form) was the first book I was exposed to on screenwriting and it continues to be the ONLY one that I refer to again and again. Well done, Michael 
 Well, folks, here it is: the debut album by Destiny's Child!  This is the album that would make Beyonce a star, and it has hits like the amazing "No, No, No (Part 2)" remixed by Wyclef Jean.  Master P and Jermaine Dupri are also on this album.  Believe me, you NEED to get this.  It's a historic recording that's a must-have 
 This is my second reading of Armadale and I enjoyed it no less, although it is a chilling expose of the mind of murder.  The diary, a tool that personifies evil and temptation digs into murderous passions intertwined by the hope of true love.  Just when it looked like love will win out, boredom, neglect, common jealousy, and fear of exposure fans the flames of Hell and uncovers the evil within.  The book is not without humor in its caricatures of the gullible fool, the peevish young lady, both of whom were made for each other, so lacking in social graces and oblivious to the feelings of those around them.  It was hard to feel sympathetic to these intended victims, so buffoonish and self-centered they are.  The one character that fully evokes your sympathy is Mr. Midwinter, who is fated to atone for the sin of his father.  He is smart, sensitive, over-wrought at times, suspicious, street-smart, and suffering.  Other memorable characters, Brock, the Milroys, Pedgifts, Oldershaw, and especially the bashful Bashwood and the evil Dr. Downward complete this complicated story of intrigue, espionage, coupled with brotherly love and redemption 
  One of the most enjoyable of the MGM Technicolor musicals, ON THE TOWN (1949) was produced by Arthur Freed and co-directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen.  The witty Betty Comden and Adolph Green screenplay, based on the Broadway musical, stars Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Jules Munshin as three love-starved sailors given 24 hours shore leave in Manhattan.  The movie goes non-stop from 6:00 a.m. until the following 6:00 a.m. and benefits from a lot of rare on-location filming.  (CAUTION:  PLOT SPOILERS THROUGHOUT THIS REVIEW!)  First of all, the guys fall in love with a poster of Miss Turnstiles of the Month (Vera-Ellen) in the subway, then find her for real and do not let her out of their sight.  Kelly is paired off with her for some sensational dances.  Sinatra sets his sights on a lady taxi driver (a wonderful Betty "Come Up to My Place" Garrett) as the gang heads to the Museum of Natural History.  There, Munshin moons over anthropologist Ann Miller ("Modern Man").  Before you know it, the gang is doing "New York, New York" on top of the NBC Building in Rockefeller Center, with its spectacular aerial view of Manhattan.  (The gone World Trade Center towers were not even built yet.)  ON THE TOWN boasts rich color and imaginative production design as we move into nighttime.  The sextette meets on top of the Empire State Building at dusk, then in a hilarious series of restaurants with waiters fawning over Miss Turnstiles, and finally Coney Island in the middle of the night and a nutty police escort on the Brooklyn Bridge in the pre-dawn hours.  (The dinosaur has collapsed at the Museum of Natural History.)   Fear not, though, there is a happy and romantic ending (a reprise of "New York, New York") to this tuneful and rather underrated musical delight.  The six actors have seldom been better or more charming.  (Reviewed from videocassette)  
 In college I was given one week to read "War & Peace."  Of course I never got through it, but in the manymoves around the world that I've made I have carried that book with me thinking someday to read it.  I thought it would be difficult to read, not only because of the Russian names but of the time in which it was written. I read Constance Garnett's translation, the only one available in my 50 year old book.  I was delighted with how easy it is to read. I'm amazed to find it was a page turner.  One of the few classics that's really readable.  Tolstoy was a psychologist long before Freud/Jung.  His insight into people is fabulous.  I, who hate war and violence, thought his war scenes amazing. I read them all.  I enjoyed his philosophizing about life that had little to do with the story line.   Actually, I have to say I was thrilled with this book and sorry it took me 50 years to get around to reading it.  It's truly a masterpiece, an enjoyable, readable, delightful one 
 I'm a big Tom CLancy fan and i just loved every minute reading this book very well done. Very well written couldn't have been done better. Mr. Clancy always kept me on the edge and he is able to put in alot of great info and he knows soo much about alot of what he writes in his boo 
 The best thing about this grill is that it has two "swing up" surfaces for holding your platters or foods to be prepared.  A great work surface, easy cleaning, and no cold spots within the cook area make this top of the line.  Looks great too 
 This toaster is a great product and I especially love how the bagel feature allows you to toast only 1 side of the bagel.  Also love the retro modern style 
 This book is great! It covers the kids, the wives, the boys, and the girls. It has great ideas, and answers all those Dad questions that you never want to ask your wife 
 Yes folks, this is pure black metal. Quorthon is a black metal god, and this recording proves it. He is the only one in the band, and his raw style of extreme music started a legion of extreme followers. Quorthon was deeply influenced by Venom and there is evidence of that here. You don't know black metal if you don't know Bathory 
 Antonio Tabucchi (1943) is the most European and international of modern Italian writers, comparable only to Umberto Eco, with whom he has an ongoing literary discussion on the intellectual's role in society. Eco is convinced that the artist/intellectual should only organize knowledge, while Tabucchi stands up for the right of the artist, in presence of preoccupying political evolutions, to ring the warning bell when necessary. This ringing of the bell is only one of the many keys to use when reading Tabucchi's 1994 novel "Pereira declares". This lyrical short book, probably inspired by the life of a true Portuguese journalist, narrates in an unusual testimonial third person style (maybe a police officer?), an apparently insignificant (?) episode that happened in Lisbon in the summer of 1938. Pereira, the editor of the cultural page of an afternoon newspaper, meets and befriends a young anti-regime political activist Monteiro Rossi that is willing to do anything (also write beforehand necrologies of famous authors) for a little bit of money. Monteiro Rossi, naturally gets into trouble dragging with him the at first reluctant and then convinced Pereira. The book's plot, that is the true driving force because of its fast and at the same time deep pace, is only the excuse to face the real topic. This is Pereira, his personality, his times, freedom of press, the author's love of Lisbon (where he lives for half of the year, being a professor of Portuguese literature in an Italian University), Portuguese history during the last years under the Salazar regimen, Europe's plight when dealing with fascism then and now. All these themes are precisely the reason that determined the selection of this book of Antonio Tabucchi, among his many other beautiful works, as the intellectual flag of political opposition in 1994, against the press tycoon Silvio Berlusconi's entry in the political arena. However, even if this made the book famous twelve years ago, and history has gone overrunning its the apparent actuality, as all works of art this novel is still enchanting to read and its subtler merits constantly emerge.   First of all we must consider modern Italian literature, greatly unknown or not translated for the English speaking public, that has most of the characteristics of postmodernism. Italy is a country culturally and sociologically removed (that considers itself as backwards) from the rest of Europe and the U.S. Italian literature reflects this belief and Italian authors think that all has been already written, so they privilege citations, irony, satire, mingling of literary types, "pastiches" and they reach their best satisfaction when "found out" or "discovered" by their cult readers that appreciate their citation abilities. "Pereira declares" is full of these citations, beginning with the authors Monteiro Rossi writes obituaries for (in Italian these are called "crocodiles", like crocodile tears) like for example Garcia Lorca, who at the time of the novel hadn't yet been killed, but would be soon, up to the French novelists of the Nineteenth Century Pereira loves and translates picking out their present meaning. The short story of Daudet's "Contes du lundì" on the Franco-Prussian War is the emblem of political frontiers and intestinal war in Europe and retains its actuality for Pereira at the moment he is speaking (1938), for the Author (1944), and for us reading now in 2006. All the Authors Tabucchi cites, Balzac, Bernanos (now long forgotten for many), Maupassant have some eternally true intuitions, but we must know them well to fully appreciate what Tabucchi wants to convey. The same must be said for Pessoa (1888-1935), the great Portuguese poet, studied by Tabucchi, which introduced the great season of poetical "avanguard" and sang of the all Portuguese sentiment of "Saudade" a yearning or nostalgia made up of suffering and sweatness, a longing for the past and the future together, a category of the spirit "that is at the same time a form of suicide" (Tabucchi). Pereira longs for and constantly relives his love for his wife and his youth in Coimbra and finds them again in Monteiro Rossi and Marta, his girlfriend. Tabucchi, like in other novels of his, utilizes a journalist, police like approach and with this literary technique he remembers Leonardo Sciascia and Frederich Durrenmatt, that have explored this literary stile before him with great results.  If you can find it watch the 1995 movie "Sostiene Pereira" directed by Roberto Faenza with Marcello Mastroianni as Pereira and Daniel Auteuil as Doctor Cardoso, that faithfully follows the book and helps to visualize Tabucchi's poetry. Read this book to have an idea of the best of modern Italian literature and to taste some of the greater European problems of yesterday and today. 
 This book, first published in 1959, is mostly devoted to cornering, and this is the best publication about turns on flat surfaces with high adhesion, used in sport racing, and this information is still valid.  It has a pretty little chapter on physical training of a driver, with the schemes gymnastic exercises recommended for a motorist.   The details of driving position and handling of a steering wheel are mentioned, but not covered well enough.  Nevertheless, the cornering is explained fairly well, in 69 pages full of formulas, schemes and illustrations.  If you need a deeper text-book about fast and safe cornering, which is not only applicable to sport but also to driving on public road, and which covers slippery surfaces like ice, snow and dirt, I would have recommended a published work by Professor Tsygankov 
   A Diet For A New America is delicately written showing the soft side of the author, John Robbins.  He starts by telling cute and encouraging stories about the protective nature of many different species of animals.  He continues that flow by showing you how precious all creatures are.  This is a nice way to argue you view of things but I tend to like to read the opposing views as well, since it can help to justify what it is you have to tell the world.  He writes a lot about health and nutrition but only from a one-sided view.  I am a nutritionist myself and I found comments like telling women with osteoporosis that an intake of too much protein is the cause of their condition when this might be true but is rare.  Osteoporosis has a lot to do with the diet but more so with ones hormones.  So other than a one-sided view, I found the book delightful and still informing with a gentle side to offer.  This book is very geared to vegetarians and vegans but will still provide a ton of information for those who do eat meat as well 
 Julius Caesar was one of the truly pivotal people in recorded history.  Most non-historians know him as the one who was stabbed by Brutus on the Ides of March. It is almost as if Caesar sprang full-grown to grab the reigns of power from the Senate in Rome.  Yet Caesar had a fairly long life before he became First Citizen of Rome.  He was a successful general and a talented historian who saw world events with the dispassionate eye of one who felt supremely confident that his tenure as an army general was but the last stop before his ascension to ultimate power.  In his CONQUEST OF GAUL, Caesar uses the third person point of view to punctuate his tacit assumption that unfolding events ought to be divorced as far as possible from the one witnessing them.  This writing technique also served to symbolize his stated goal: to conquer Gaul.  To him, Gaul was a land of barbarian tribes, with each possessing formidable numbers and fierce fighters.  These tribes and their leaders were enormously emotional, wildly unpredictable, and more dangerous as individuals than as organized units.  Caesar knew that to beat them, he could not be as them.  They were emotional, he coldly calculating.  They were not efficient in massed groups, his legions had to be. Caesar was the ultimate practitioner of the divide and conquer school.  He picked off his enemies one at a time, like bobbing heads on a shooting gallery.  The Atuatucii, the Nervii, the Helvetians all fought ferociously, sometimes winning minor victories, but it was Caesar who won the ones that counted.  He transformed his legions into extensions of his personality.  They fought well as masses against overwhelming odds, not for their pay, or hope of plunder, or even for glory, but for their commander.  Caesar's iron will and resolve filled his legions with hope and his enemies with despair.  It was only when Caesar was recalled to Rome that the Gauls decided that now was the time to seek a new leader to strike down the Roman eagle.  During this battle against Vercingetorix and his earlier ones against lesser chiefs, Caesar sees each battle as the logical working out of a master plan, that when combined with the bravery and training of his troops in co-ordinated combat, could crush a loud but awkward foe.  As he writes, one can visualize his intended audience, not the reader of this review, but the purple-robed senators back in Rome sweating out the increasing victories of a man who seemed fated to return to the Capitol to tell them their business.  His calmness in battle was matched only by his calmness with a stylus.  It is truly ironic that it was this same calm that led him to discount the excited warnings of a Mark Antony, who tried to tell Caesar of plotters, that led to his downfall 
 In the very late 1960s and 1970s, Chicago was one of the hottest musical groups in the world.  A tight horn section, Lamm's piano, Kath's bass, Cetera's vocals - the whole cast was right on the mark with their albums and single releases.  Like others, I had all their albums and played them until the phono needle screamed for mercy.  Then Terry Kath died and, I believe, like other major groups that have had the untimely death of a key member, the music (and group dynamics) changed so that the Old Days couldn't be put back together again.  After a couple more albums, I never bought another Chicago album - until this one.  It has the great old songs on it, the ones that I went off to college with, and the newer ones that I never really could get into, although many were very popular in their time.  I think that's why I would recommend this album: it would satisfy the fans of the old and new Chicago sounds, the old harder edge and the newer softer edge, but also give an insight of the songs that the old and new fans might not have, opposite the time that they enjoyed listening to the group.  
 I have a 4 y.o. boy and this produce is right up his alley.  we have a lot of rescue heros and this product brings them al together.  this is what he has been wanting to play with all his men and vehicles.  the mission command center is easy to put together and is very durable.  My boy loves to destroy toys and he cannot tear this up. 
 This, quite frankly, is the best poem of the 20th century, and it gets better everytime you read it. From the apparent darkness of the first stanzas of Burnt Norton to the broadening towards lucidity of the last lines, there is much to love, much to admire, and much to quote. You will find lines that speak to the heart directly: you will also find, after numerous readings, splendid little details, which reveal the craftiness with which Eliot handled this superb adieu - for it is the last great work in poetry he has written.  The greatest achieve of Eliot in Four Quartets, is the way he manages to reach out to the greatest poet in history, who lived a number of centuries ago, and have the language speak with his tongue, simultaneously admitting that Dante's world view cannot be copied in today's world - but that does not mean that his form of structure and vivid allusions should not be employed:  in this poem, the Trecento and the century of the atomic bomb have found common ground to behold each other as not quite congenial, yet deeply related brothers. The past is not dead - it's not even past yet 
 Anthony Trollope spends so much time doing the things that well-meaning creative writing profesors now tell one never to do--his editorial voice peppers each novel, he avoids subtle foreshadowing in favor of telling you  essentially what will happen next, and he consistently drives plot towards  a theme.  Yet Trollope, a consummate Victorian, seems intrinsically modern  whereas many more "literarily correct" modern humorists grow  antique in a week or less.  The secret, of course, is character, an eye and  an ear for class distinctions, and a skewering wit combined with tremendous  fellow-feeling for the foibles of his characters.  Miss MacKenzie contains  much of Trollope at his best--the title character is a beautifully observed  genteel poor spinster-to-be suddenly visited with the misfortune of  fortune. The author assiduously exposes flaw after flaw in Miss MacKenzie  and her social milieu, and yet we like her better for the harsh light.  In  this world of tremendous unkindness, it is nice to remember that one can be  honest without being brutal.  Trollope, a writer of genial works of whimsy,  brings the quiet honesty of literary fiction home safely here 
 This book for very young children is a presentation of Old Mac Donald's farm animals in delightful colors page after page. Fleming's style of "pulp painting" which she used to create images is very inovative. On each spread is an interesting combination of sculpture, painting and collage using bright colors. Among other natural materials, she used colored cotton pulp, ground coffee, kernels of oats and a piece of burlap potato sack that rendered texture on her artwork that one can almost actually feel and smell!  In Barnyard Banter, the cows in the pasture moo, the hens in the henhouse cluck, and the pigs in the wallow muck. While she started the book with familiar animals. Fleming added new animals like the mice in the grain bin that squeak, the peacocks that shriek, the pigeons that coo, the crows that caw and the crickets that chirp. The little readers may have difficulty distiguishing the pigs from the background, but once they  find the pigs' eyes and snouts, they will see that the pigs are having fun wallowing in the mud. Adults and kids will have fun sharing this books as they read, play and sing with it. Infants who are attracted with different sounds and voice intonations will be fascinated with the different sounds of the animals, not to mention their bright colors. One-year-olds can start pointing to the animals and later on imitate their sounds. The two's and three's can identify the animals and create their own sounds. Fleming also invites the kids to look for the goose that is hiding among the different animals in each spread. Children between one and two years old ae capable of spotting details and older kids will enjoy looking for partly hidden objects. Fleming made this game more interesting by showing only parts of the goose in some pages. For instance, in one page, only the beak of the goose in showing on the corner of the page. It will also be interesting to see, if the children will notice that a butterfly always hangs around with the goose. Infact, it was the butterfly that sort of provided the prelude and the postlude for the book because it was the only creature in the title page, and at the last page, the butterfly was being chases by the goose. Different kinds of games and activities can be shared between the child and the parent/adult with this book.  Fleming's choice of types and size fro her text is also appropriate for the very young readers. Black bold and simple types were used to make it easy for the kids to identify the words or letters. The simple short sentences telling where the animals are located were written on straight lines on the top of the page, but the sounds that they make are written all over, which added interest to the page. The text are interesting and predictable and made use of various letter sound combinations like muck, cluck,moo, coo, caw, haw, squeak and shriek. It will be interesting how kids will react to the words wallow, paddock, hayloft and rafters which may not be common to city children's vocabulary.  The bright red color for end pages easily attracts attention and provides a glaring contrast to the sunshiny yellow of the title page and the end page. The book might be too big for small hands but will fit perfectly on adult's lap. The size of the book, the big text and the bright pictures will be good for small group reading. As in other books on farm animals, it will be nice to end the reading with the singing of the old time favorite "Old MacDonald Had a Farm, e-i-e-i-o.. 
 I picked up this book in a used bookstore, again instinctively, after having read Veronique's The Art of Doing Nothing & William Anthony's The Art of Napping. Although the book does not offer really cutting-edge stuff, I find it fascinating, as it offers some useful advice for the peak performer.   The subject of optimum performance technologies always intrigue me. Imagine we spend a third of our lives on sleeping. So naturally I want to find out how to do it better so that I can stay awake longer.  Despite the author's tendency for mundane rambling throughout the book, I find the chapters explaining the golden rules of sleep & introducing the twenty great sleep strategies are the most interesting.  I recommend this book, as complementary reading to the books mentioned at the beginning of this review. Another book to read is Jeff Davidson's Breathing Space. They offer great (stress relieving) stuff for our time-pressed, over-achieving society.  
 I'm an artist and art teacher, and after discovering this book, I ordered copies for my middle school ART students!  While it's an easy read for students of this age (5th through 7th grade), it's packed with understandable text and pictures.  It's a great reference for the various art projects that my students are doing as part of our study of the Middle Ages, and the kids have really enjoyed it... 
 An excellent overview of the history of economic thought.  I used this text in my course on the history of economic thought.  I highly recommend it!  The authors cover, in great detail, such critical items as the  preclassical areas of thought, mercantillism, Malthus, Marx, Ricardo, and  the transition to Neoclassical  economics.  The discussion of the modern  Microeconomic Theory is also a must for any fan of economics 
 This book is very easy to read and allows for easy digestion of complex principles.  I find it to be very useful in understanding torts 
 Great anthology.  I already have the first boxed set, so this is just more fun reading 
 This book is very impressive because of the writer's attitude towords the world. Good for everybody who read this book 
 Easy to install, clear instructions. Very good quality and resolution.  Would be better if had one more input.  Overall rating - very good. I have recomended the same item to my friend after I have received and tested it. Am happy with the purchase 
 ****THIS COMMENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!*** Anyone who saw this growing up has a soft spot in their hearts for it; I've encountered enough people over the course of my 37 yrs who perk up at the mention of it to be aware of its place in a lot of our memories. This has been satirized on the Simpsons, which proves it has embedded itself in the national pop culture consciousness. Anyone who has read the book its based on, the incredible "I am Legend" by Richard Matheson, knows that this film has very little in common with it beyond its intial premise--and even that is not followed too closely. All of the criticisms of THE OMEGA MAN are valid: It is very dated and not at all scary or intense and some of the stunts and special effects are laughably, ludicrously cheesy; the villains--who should have been more terrifying than even Romero's zombies--are just crazed albino hippie Luddites and the last half of the film, once Chuck hooks up with Rosalind Cash and the kiddies, is really a let down. But the scenes that open the film of Heston hefting a cool-looking machine gun while decked out in Austin Powers-style finery (!) staring in angst at an old calendar or losing his mind for a moment hallucinating the sound of telephones ringing in the deserted city still pack a punch. This was the second movie, after 1959's THE WORLD,THE FLESH, AND THE DEVIL, to successfully pull off the eerie effect of being the last living human being in a huge empty city. Both films established the visual motif of streets  filled with blowing waves of newspapers and swirling trash.After years of seeing this on tv -- a guaranteed late September or early October event every year for a few years on the local tv station during my Pacific Northwest childhood in the old dark ages before CABLE TV and the videocassette revolution, its nice to see this movie on DVD with a beautiful widescreen transfer. It looks and sounds great. As a child I always liked the music, particularly the "surprise party" theme that plays when the villains make thir first appearance. It rocks here in all its xylophone and funky electric organ and horns glory 
 The Beastie Boys are certainly one of my favorite rap groups of all time, mostly because they're so unique. Though they were obviously influenced by Run-D.M.C. and other oldschool rap groups (mainly for Run-D.M.C.'s signature style of the rappers cutting each other off), they still stand out creatively and commercially. What they did is essentially blend in hardcore punk with hip-hop, creating a surprisingly addictive and fun album (or series of albums, basically all their other ones are great, too)! They may not be the best MCs on the planet, but they are certainly very recognizable and have great charisma. They have a punkish sounding accent that somehow works with the material. The lyrics tend to be pretty much about nothing, but they somehow remain funny, interesting and definitely catchy. "Hello Nasty" is arguably their most accessible album as two great hits came off of it ("Body Movin'" and "Intergalactic"). These are great tunes, but the rest of the album holds up really well. It might not necessarily be for everyone (mostly due to the hardcore punk sections), but people will probably like most of the album. Highly recommended!  Highlights include: the entire album 
 This is the first thing one should buy after purchasing any type II vehicle. It's an invaluable guide to all your mechanical woes. Most vehicles bought today are modified in one form or another. This book covers all the stock components. With this book in hand, one can conduct a thorough inspection of their vehicle and determine what modifications have been made. Restoration or repair, read this book. This manual should be in every Type II owners tool box. Gary Ino San Francisc 
 Physical fitness is not just for the "young and beautiful" as Ann Smith ably demonstrates to her video audience. She performs each of the seven stretches with enviable grace and flexibility. I told my spouse, "If that old woman can do it, then so can I"; he thought that would be a good name for the tape! Ann demonstrates each exercise twice - the first time she provides a voiceover describing what you're doing; the second time you do the same exact exercise (the same clip is shown twice) with no verbal cuing. I would like her to talk a little more about form as you're doing the exercises; visual imagery helps me figure out what I'm supposed to be doing and whether I'm doing it right or not. I also wish she would talk you through the second time as well, because when I'm twisting away from the screen or hanging down my head, I can't see what she's doing, and I either fall behind her or worry that I will. Even though these are very short stretch exercises meant to be done each morning, it also works to combine them all for a nice 20-minute stretch. And it feels great 
 Williams has taken us into the mind and soul of a slave and recreated Dessa's experience with a searing feeling of authenticity. This is a notable piece of fiction; it should be part of history courses studying  slavery 
 This is the last major novel of Edith Wharton (1862-1937). She was a New York writer who moved to France in 1910; and, she wrote six well-known novels starting with "The House of Mirth" in 1905.  The present novel won a Pulitzer Prize in 1920. I bought and read the Penguin Classics Red version. My version had the text only and there was no analysis. The edition posted here for sale has additional comments. The red version is slightly cheaper and from what I can determine ít is the same novel. The 363 pages are a fairly quick read and I read it in two evenings. The prose is straightforward and there are not too many characters. It is a well-constructed novel, i.e.: it is medium length, it has a good plot with interesting characters, well balanced, and it has some mystery.  The setting for the novel is a bit reminiscent of Henry James or F. Scott Fitzgerald. Wharton's characters are a bit more level headed and easy going than those writers. The characters do not go through violent swings of emotion as one sees with the Fitzgerald characters.  Without giving away the plot, the story is set in post WWI New York, among the wealthy social families. It is a love triangle among three wealthy people: two women and one young man. The man is Newland Archer, a young New York lawyer. She describes their balls and dinners and nights out at the opera. We follow them to Boston and out into the country on vacations and weekends off. There are no "common folk" here among the characters. They are all in a few related and wealthy families.  The novel is very well written. It is clear, concise, and it is an interesting and a compelling read. She generates enough interest to keep our attention throughout. Once you start to read, one will look forward to getting back to the novel during breaks. The main three figures are sympathetic characters and mostly an interesting story.  Wharton has an easy going and clear style that is easy to read. Most will enjoy this novel.  I recommend the read: 5 stars. 
 These shears really do the job. Plenty sharp and with enough leverage to easily cut through bones. The hand grips are very comfortable and handsome 
 Being a  sceptic takes courage.  Scepticism means assaulting dogmas - read "entrenched stupidity" - and coping with the reaction.  Shermer, who puts his scepticism on public view in his magazine, isn't lacking courage.  With a flair for investigative journalism and a fine prose style to render results into words, he is always an informative and entertaining read.  This collection of his articles is a delight, unmarred by the passage of time.  Each one addresses a topic of enduring interest, guaranteeing a "read again" condition for these essays for some time to come.   Shermer displays his mettle up front by taking up roles in performing in the "paranormal".  He "reads" Tarot cards, palms of hands and the stars.  All of these experiments demonstrate the gullibility of those too inept or too lazy to learn how hollow these techniques really are.  Why people believe such phenomena can answer the problems of everyday life remains one of our great mysteries.  Shermer isn't addressing these topics from an "intellectual high ground" but from real experience.  In his youth he was a Christian, buying into all the contrived legends and empty myths that superstition perpetuates.  Discovering reality, he abandoned the trappings of deceptive teachings and struck out against them - all of them.  This collection of essays isn't only a display of his experiences, it's ammunition we may all use in dealing with other misleading or manipulative teachings.   As a collection of writings on various topics, this book is naturally difficult to categorise.  He  discusses the difficulties the "secular humanists" endured with the creation of The Brights.  The Brights are an attempt to coalesce the various non-theists in our society.  While the name is logical, especially given its true meaning, American society has granted it the rank of a slur on those who refuse to accept easy dogmas.  Essays on "heresies of science" and "spin-doctoring science" are a depressing indication of how the public lacks understanding of what science does and has done.  If a particular column must be selected as noteworthy, it's Shermer's discussion of the Cancer in the Classroom, "intelligent design".  Although much has been written on this insidious threat from Christians attempting to destroy scientific education, Shermer's essay "The New New Creationism" is an excellent overview.  He summarises the history and tactics of the movement, recognising that only reality can counter it.  Understanding of reality comes through education.  It's a vicious circle.  Shermer concludes the collection with an adulatory essay on Stephen J. Gould.  It's almost embarrassing to read.  Shermer recounts John Maynard Smith's assessment that Gould's ideas were "so confused as to be hardly worth bothering with".  Although intending to praise Gould, Shermer then goes on to prove Maynard Smith correct.  Following the US academic theme of "publish or perish", Shermer does his sums - even to the level of word count.  How much did Gould publish and on what?  After gathering his numbers, Shermer goes on to shuffle them around by categories.  We are given line, bar and pie charts as tokens of Gould's worth.  That Gould had wide interests is a given.  Baseball, a topic that puzzled Maynard Smith, loomed largest.  Evolution, of course, was a major theme, with history of science close behind.  What Shermer omits is Gould's approach to these topics.  He enjoyed lifting people from obscurity and defending the indefenisble.  Shermer notes Gould's resurrection of Jimmie Ussher's reputation [while misspelling his name], but ignores Gould's constant chipping away of Darwin's or Wallace's.  Perhaps Shermer should have included a category for this approach in his counts.   This flawed essay is the low point of the book, yet it is well presented and informative.   Gould was a friend and Shermer's applause for him is understandable.  [stephen a. haines - Ottawa, Canada 
 A favorite YA author of this reader since picking up her terrific Walk Two Moons, this is the third or fourth of hers I've read.  It's a short, sweet book, but what makes it sweet also makes it not easy to understand.  That's by design.  A boy is visited by ghosts. The one this story focuses on is his uncle, not his first choice of ghosts since his father passed away not long ago.  Anyway, the ghost uncle had a stroke before dying and has not overcome the barriers of expressing himself since joining the hereafter.  He has quirky speech, consistent, but only to himself, and slowly to his nephew.  It is a paradox for the reader, too.  What DID he mean by that?  The nephew takes on helping the uncle with three requests.  He also deals with a bully who has his own issues, and the deceased uncle's wife, who has a new romantic interest  It's good, pleasant, and I'd recommend it, but it's a far cry from Walk Two Moons' wonderfulness 
 Finally a book on reincaration that resonates with the soul. This is a life-changing book. The author skillfully poses important questions, and provides many answers wrapped in thrilling tales, leaving the reader contemplating the nature of life after death. After reading "This Side of the Gate" I had several dreams which I am convinced represent memories from past lifetimes.   Along with the "Power of Now" this is the most thought-provoking book I have read in the last few years. Both books are hard hitting and challenge us to move towards soul-consciousness. Both of these authors inspire us to live with the highest ideals and dedicate ourselves to a life of service and gratitude for the miracle of life.   One of the concepts that I found the most helpful was that no matter what mistakes we have made during the course of our lives, there is always another lifetime with opportunities to make amends.    Beyond being a spiritual book, this book is full of swashbuckling adventure in the spirit of Wilbur Smith.  My favorite chapters are the lifetimes of the warriors, which have the epic feel of Crouching Tiger Hidden Draggon and House of Flying Daggers.   This book challenges us to live a deeper, more meaningful life, lest we get stuck on what Johnston calls the "Wheel of Rebirth." I highly recommend this fresh and fascinating book. 
 Anyone with a child should buy this book.  Anyone without a child should also buy this book!  I've used this book in a number of situations and first came across it at a retreat for those young Franciscans Friars in Religious Formation.  It launched a wonderful discussion on our images of God.  It is masterfully written and beautifully illustrated.    The way in which Sasso presents the variety of our images of God and how they all are equally useful and beautiful illustrates how we can move beyond our differences and become a sign of unity.  A great book to have in the house.   
 We really enjoyed this film, it was very close to the story in the bible. Great cast, set and storyline. 
 The book "Basic Photographic Materials and Processes" is separated on 16 chapters.  Very useful chapters for everybody, both for beginners and professionals are chapters: 1) Light and Photometry, 4) Photographic Sensitometry, 5) Photography Optics (there is an instruction how to build the pinhole camera with exact calculation a diameter for different pinhole cameras and how make the lens testing), 8) Black and white Photographic Developments (with a paragraph about anti-foggants, special black-and-white process), 10) Tone Reproduction (Objective tone-reproduction curves for motion pictures, transparency etc., Luminance values of an outdoor scene, Flare factor, The making of negative, The making of Positive, the equations for average gradient for different quadrants of tone-reproduction diagram, ......), 11) Micro Image Evaluation (with much examples og graininess of films of different producers), 13) Filters with their influencies on different sort of films, 14) Color, 15) Color Reproduction and 16) Digital photography. This book is very useful and its content is very comprehensive one. I photograph since 1960 and I admire Mr. Anselm Adams, that is to say I very, very recommend this book for one, who has serious interest about photography and different cameras with their optics. The book has many pictures, useful tables and diagrams. (Rene Novak, studio ER67, ... 
 "Your personal growth is your core asset and therefore has the most leverage. Making a small investment in your growth can lead to extremely large dividends over time in both personal growth and your other assets." ~Michael Simmons  Michael Simmons founded his first business, Princeton WebSolutions when he was only 16. He has written numerous articles about student entrepreneurship and they have appeared in College Bound Magazine and Whizteens in Business. His unique perspective appeals to young audiences and in The Student Success Manifesto he guides students towards a success frame of mind.   The list of successful college-age individuals is worth the price of the book. He lists companies like Hershey Foods, Dell, Federal Express and Subway. There are many more examples and he also includes a list of statistics like: "Over 50% of millionaire entrepreneurs never finished college."   Some of the highlights include:   The Fifteen Endeavors Core Challenges Elimination of Obstacles Competitive Advantage Rituals you can ignore to Excel  Michael Simmons seems wise beyond his years as he explores possibility and writes about following your passion and embracing learning for personal growth. The Student Success Manifesto contains some of the best ideas I've ever seen for pursuing a life of prosperity and success. The ideas are logical, the points well organized and the format intellectually appealing.   ~The Rebecca Review

 I am a self taught programmer, and there were large gaps in my fundamental knowledge of computers and how they operate.  This book did a fantastic job in filling that void.  It should be required reading for any aspiring programmer.  There are a few typo's, but nothing major.  The authors walk you through a basic understanding of computer architecture and binary logic, all the way to understanding C language.  An easy and interesting read.  It really helped me a lot 
 My son is 3 1/2 and I had been trying to potty train him for about a year and he was not getting it. I was very stressed out and reading lots of books for parents that were never a help to me when I decided to try this book to read to my son. Within a couple of days he was potty trained and he was very happy and proud to be like Caillou. I will always be grateful to this book and I will forever remember Caillou for helping my son. This is a wonderful book. I highly recommend it. 
 I Bought this set to replace a broken champagne glass.  They are more solidly built than other glassware/flutes -  which is great since they have less chance of breaking.  The real bonus is that they are dishwasher safe which saves having to hand-wash them...    
 This book has helped me choose a drastic career change I was almost afraid to reach for ten years ago.  Since then, I've bought the book numerous times as gifts for friends who then share it with others.  It's simple to use and relevant each time I go back to it.  Whether you are looking for a career change or to better understand how to position yourself where you are, this book is extremely helpful in helping you realize your strengths and weaknesses, likes and dislikes more clearly and based on that, how to find a fit in almost every situation.  The author's other books are insightful too for relationships and advising your children 
 Joseph Ellis understands that it is what happens between, under and over the events of history that make it interesting.  He has mastered the art of drawing out the implications of character, relationship and motivation.  He brings the story to life by immersing the reader in the lives - the ideals, emotions, short-comings, likes and dislikes - of the characters that shaped the events of the American Revolution.  Ellis doesn't just tell us that "they [all the major players] were making it up as they went along, improvising on the edge of catastrophe," he makes us feel it.  The founding brothers were not a unified group.  They did not speak with one voice and in many cases they did not like each other.  They were honorable and disloyal, self-sacrificing and opportunistic.  They were often petty and sometimes heroic.  They created the Union, but couldn't (didn't?) rid it of slavery.  "The Adams style was to confront, shout, rant, and then to embrace.  The Jefferson style was to evade, maintain pretenses, then convince himself that all was well."  Adams is elevated.  Jefferson's "sphinx-like image" is tarnished.  Burr and Hamilton add drama.  Washington, though human, manages to stay above the fray.  Madison stays calm.  They left us with lessons for today and words of wisdom.  Washington admonished "that no nation is to be trusted farther than it is bound by its interest; and no prudent statesman or politician will venture to depart from it."   Ellis credits Washington with "the strategy of enlightened procrastination."   Staying alive against a superior force will ultimately make victory possible.  If Washington were leading us today, perhaps we (The United States) would not have blundered into a costly and futile occupation.  We become trapped in the cross-hairs; the enemy only needs to survive.    The reader wants to give Ellis credit for bringing the story to a happy close by resolving the personal tension between Adams and Jefferson with poetic timing.   Of course, Adams and Jefferson actually resolved the tension themselves, but Ellis beautifully tells the story.  Founding Brothers is a masterpiece. 
 As a child I was never satisfied with the Christian religion I was exposed to.  A vengeful God just didn't seem to fit, it didn't feel like truth.  I've spent a lot of spare time studying religions and philosophies. Bits from some disciplines seemed to be right but I couldn't find the perfect fit for me.  This book did!  Although I'm rather  pale, I must have the soul of an American Indian.   I was especially interested in his research that connected ancient Europeans with North American natives. His reasons for why our world is out of balance are quite accurate, and unfortunately returning the balance in the near future doesn't seem likely.       
 Enjoyed the movie and the music.  John Williams, Yo-Yo Ma, Itzhak Perlman, what's not to like 
 I've decided he's too good and too prolific for me to write a brand new review every single time I read one of his books. Discworld currently has 34 titles and every one of them will probably knock your socks off. His mind bubbles and flashes like a boiling pot of electric eels, and I simply can't get enough of his writing.   A reviewer has compared him to Geoffrey Chaucer. He reminds me more of Douglas Adams, or perhaps S Morgenstern. Great company, isn't it? He's an extremely skillful and imaginative writer, damn funny, clever and observant to boot. He's also very easy to read. A master of characterization, and if there's anything else you like about reading that I didn't mention here, assume I simply forgot. He's awesome.   Another reviewer mentioned Jonathan Swift and PG Wodehouse. Why such hallowed company? Because Pratchett belongs there! Truly, I'm enjoying my quest to read every book in the series. You should do the same, and begin your quest at the library because he's got to be there. He's awesome!   Yet another reviewer said Jerome K Jerome meets Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that works too.   Why do we, as reviewers, compare authors to other authors? Because it's easier than thinking. In the case of Terry Pratchett, it's probably because we'd otherwise wind up quoting the guy. He's so unique that we just don't know how else to cope with his greatness. Even this paragraph sounds like foamy drool raving, doesn't it? That's how all readers react to Pratchett. Reviewers simply don't have the good sense to keep it to themselves.   I could call his writing fantasy, but I could likewise call what Douglas Adams wrote science fiction. In both cases, I wouldn't be wrong, but I'd be neglecting so much and just totally missing the point. A rare few authors transcend a genre to such a degree that you know they're shouting out, loud and proud, a big fat "Bite me!"   I love Terry Pratchett's writing, and I completely understand why some folks refer to him as their favorite author. Or favourite, I should say, since we're being British. He's one of those authors that makes you want to grab whoever's in hearing range and start reading passages aloud. I'm simply thrilled that there's such an extremely talented and prolific author who's been working for years without me being aware of him. Now I have much catching up to do, and I will love it.  
 What I thought would be a another B movie turned out to be a good action flick.  Good actors Annabella Sciorra, Michael Biehn and quite a few other good tv actors.  Worth the money and time to see it. Characters were developed and you knew who they were and what purpose they served.  Good plot, even kept the interest of my grandchildren.  Can't find too many directors or producers that can make an interesting plot and keep it moving.  Dr. Lily McKee played by Annabelle Sciorra discovers a massive asteriod hurtling towards the earth and tries to get Feds to help and believe her. She notifies FEMA in comes Jack Wallach (Michael Biehn) he plays his role well -- better than Annablle Sciorra, sometimes she looks like she is confused...but carries her role well.  Good flick I think you'll enjoy. Good special effects.  
 This book is rich in detail about playing positions, tone reproduction, and practice techniques.  But while there are some pictures showing posture, fingering, etc. in Appendix A, it would be difficult for a student who has never studied music theory or played the violin to truly grasp the concepts.  For intermediate or advanced students, however, this book will reinforce the instructions of teacher-led study and help the student enhance their playing skills.  If you are an adult just starting out with violin play, I suggest you instead pick up The ABCs of Violin for the Absolute Beginner 
 I ordered these clubs for my twin 7 year olds for Christmas.  They are a little long for their age, but will be a great set for them to use and grow into.  They can carry the bag, which has it's own stand and a nice cover over the driver and irons.  They have already used the clubs and really like them.  I was really happy with them and they made a great gift.  
 I discovered Gary Soto's poetry in a public library in Nebraska. Then I read his short stories, my favorite being "Baseball in April." Like his poetry, these stories are beautiful in that they reveal a child's inner thought life; they also show the challenges that teenagers go through.  Soto takes us back to his childhood in California. The stories occur in sunny Fresno, which is in the Central Valley. The characters, dilemmas, and emotions that he evokes are so real that I often read them over saying, "Yes, I remember feeling like that."  I mostly read adult literature but have been reading a lot in young adult literature, because I often forget what it was like to be a young boy. Soto has a gift for recalling these events and making them come alive again. I've read this collection three times and have read all of Soto's poetry. I hightly recommend "Baseball in April," as well as the poetry collection "Black Hair."   Also recommended: The Gospel of Arni 
 When I was in high school (and that was a LONG time ago) I decided to participate in one of the school plays.  I just had a "walk on" part but it was very interesting to be a part of the production from first rehersal to the closing curtain of the last preformance.  The play was one I'd never heard of; "The Man Who Came to Dinner" by Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman.  I got to play one of the cops that show up at the end.  Although I learned later on that the play was made into a successful movie years before, I never gave myself the oppotunity the watch it all the way through...until last night.  The star of the film (although 3rd in the billing below two bigger names) is Monte Woolley.  He is the quick-witted, acid-tongued Sheridan Whiteside who literally stumbled into an extended stay at the home of an unfortunate, well-to-do family.  Whiteside takes over the place and trades barbs with all the "normal" folks while bringing in an array of eccentric characters.  There is a love story that arises from this chaos and it serves to pull everything into, well, into a more orderly and purposeful chaos.  Bette Davis and Jimmie Durante give excellent preformances as well in this fast-moving movie.    Thirty-five years is a long time between my brief appearance on stage and viewing a quality version of the same play but I guess it was enough time to allow me to appreciate each for what it was and is.  Both were a lot of fun but in much different ways 
 I was extremely unhappy with the number of books available for children on this subject. I realize it is difficult to convey such a complex subject in simple terms that children can understand; however, that I why I'm looking for a book on this. If it were so simple, why would I need a book to help explain it? Anyway... this does a nice job and in a non-evasive way to expaining the situation that my child faces. He's 4 and totally incapable to comprehending the situation, but he does relate to a couple of the examples put forth in this book (eg two homes, two rooms, etc). Overall, i'd buy this book even if there were a plethera of books available. I'd recommend it for a child(ren) a little older (maybe 5-10). it is well written and overall a very good book. 
 I was/always will be a Coney Island kid myself, and reading Charles Denson's accounts left me breathless.  This book will transport you to a place in time that few people really know well.  The writing is flawless and magical--a treat for all of your senses. Memories you never knew you had will be awakened.  Thank you, "Charlie from Building 3," for this wonderful book. It was like reading an exerpt of my own autobiography. It is a work of art that will be treasured for generations to come 
 I have over 400 cookbooks and this one is one of my favorites...It really allows you to do what the title says...I have used this while teaching cooking classes and it gives easy instruction, uses familiar ingregients and the results are amazing. The desserts are special treats. This is a great gift for the new bride the busy homemaker or those of us who want our friends to think we spent hours preparing a meal for them.. 
 Before I begin this review, I'd like to take this opportunity to offer the disclaimer that I am a hopeless George fan, and very biased in this review. I adore his cool style, his unique yet beautiful voice, his singing slide guitar, his poetic words and stirring music...and I miss him deeply. And few albums make me miss him more than this one.   "George Harrison" might best be described as a sort of "mystical folk" album. A magical, almost sparkling sound seems to emit from the instruments, and the result is spectacular. The songs have been finely crafted, and George's voice is in splendid shape all around. Words, melody and music come together in just the right way to make an excellent disc that (I think) everyone ought to have in their collection.   The mood is mostly mellow for this album, but that doesn't mean that the songs are dull! Not in the least. From the soaring melodies of "Faster," "Blow Away" and "Your Love is Forever" to the slinky groove of "Not Guilty" and "Soft-Hearted Hana," -- the elegant styling of "Here Comes the Moon," "Dark Sweet Lady" and "Soft Touch" to the feel-good sound of "Love Comes to Everyone" and "If You Believe" -- nothing on this disc will fail to enchant. It's the creme of Harrison's crop.   Although I recommend everything George has done, I recommend this one especially highly. It'll make you feel like you could fly through the clouds...and it might make you cry. It's that beautiful. 
 I bought this for Christmas for my 32 yr. old daughter. She loved it. 
 I am SO thankful I bought this book.  It has been so helpful for understanding further what Biblical Equality means and its practical applications.  It covers the gamet of thought in reference to equality, as well as addressing the "other side of the fence" in a very gracious manner. Think of it as a response to "Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, Reaffirming the Patriarchy." There is also a chapter dedicated primarily to being gracious and focusing on that which we do have in common, which of course is Christ.  Mud slinging helps no one.  The book  is laid out like this: I. Setting the Stage (The Historical Backdrop) II. Looking to Scripture (The Biblical Text) III. Thinking it Through (Logical and Theological Perspectives) IV. Addressing the Issues (Hermeneutical and Cultural  V. Living it Out (Practical Applications)  I think by far, my favourite chapter in the book is "Equal in Being, Unequal In Role".  Its a very fascinating look at the "roots" of how women are viewed in the church.  The thinking is not "Christian" per say, but Aristotilian. I also like how she answers critisism she recieved from others about this way of thinking. Aristotle viewed women as "other",that men were considered the normal and fully human, and that carries into complementarian thinking. Basically, complementarians deny the full humanity of females in their ideology (not sure what to call it, as its not theology in my opinion). The language complementarians use sounds acceptable to modern ears, but essentially are saying the same thing.  Women are ontologically subordinate to men and are only created to be supporters of men in this world.  Of course, it makes no sense when obviously women have been endowed with gifts of leadership.  What I also struggle to understand from the complementarian camp, is that how can THE FALL bring about something that Christians should promote?  Just because something is evident everywhere, does not make it RIGHT.  If Jesus redeemed creation with his life/death/life, why were women the only people not to be fully redeemed?  Complementarians are still partriachal, whether or not they like the label. Overall, the book is full of useful information. Its has a lot of answers to commonly used arguments of complementarians, which sound quite lame when put up next to the academics of this bunch. Its an easy read because it all broken up into essays although I really wished it was a bit longer though, in spite of its length all ready.   But aside from that, I think its a book that should be used as a text book, as a balanced look at what is taught in Bible colleges across the nations.  A good way to look at it, is when people learn this stuff, it cleans up the water and leaves life teeming in its midst.  Life for all genders 
 As a graduate of New Trier High School, I feel that this book did a wonderful job illustrating some of the feelings I had during High School.  I thought Cohen's writing was captivating and entertaining, and I am very interested to read his other books.  "Lake Effect" is a must read 
 Don't be intimidated by what you may have heard about John Cage; his music can be much more accessible than that of many other 20th-century composers, and perhaps even some earlier ones (I'll take Cage over Wagner any day).   Drury plays Cage's early piano music, some of it written as dance  accompaniment, with knowledge and respect. The title piece, which opens the  album, sounds superficially like new-age music, but isn't the least bit  boring--it's as boring as a beautiful woman, or a view from a mountain.   More idiosyncratic and humorous (Cage *always* had a great sense of humor)  are the "Music for Toy Piano," which shows Cage's ability to see  more possibilities than the rest of us, and the short "Prelude to  Meditation," which says an enormous amount with a few light touches on  the keys.  There's even an organ piece, which provides a nice variation.   Please forget what you may have heard about Cage and buy this CD 
     Somewhere along the line after the release of his Music Is Rotted One Note album, Tom Jenkinson lost me a bit. In the time since then, he's released a whole shedload of music, and while he's certainly put out a fair amount of great work, he's also seemingly not a very good editor of his own material, bogging down albums with too many filler tracks and needless diversions. Part of the problem could possibly simply be that the market is a lot more crowded than when he started, but with recent releases it seems that Jenkinson has largely been going through the motions.      Although it's just as scattered sounding as several of his past albums, Hello Everything seems to be cut from a slightly different cloth. Perhaps it's the more playful album artwork throwing off my perception, but it really does seem like Jenkinson is simply allowing himself to have a bit more fun on his newest effort. His insane bass playing is back and prominent on most tracks, and in addition to slamming several tracks with completely wicked beats, he manages to throw a few curves out that work as well. "Hello Meow" opens the album with some seriously infectious melodies (dueled-up on vibes and synths) some chopped-up Amen breaks, and some of the best bass work from Jenkinson in a long time.      From there, the album is all over the map. "Theme From Sprite" goes downright lounge as slappy bass and guitar mingle with chimes and live drumming while "Bubble Life" is some sly mixture of past tracks, throwing together squealing analogue synths, tinny beats, and more funky as hell bass. "Vacuum Garden" arrives about halfway through the disc and veers into complete left field as layers of manipulated sine waves make for a six minute slice of eerie drone. "Circlewave 2" is one of the bigger surprises, as Jenkinson mixes heavily-reverbed live drums and keyboard drones with super expressive bass and guitar playing that sounds almost Morricone-inspired.      A large part of the rest of the effort is Jenkinson working the drill and bass angle to varying degree. "Planetarium" is dark as heck and howls with a deep analogue bass and squiggling melodies over the top that keep the mood slightly lighter while "Plotinus" builds into one of the more trippy and dense things that he's ever done, with layers of cascading synths and bass work spilling all over one another while rapid-fire beats shell the surroundings. The eleven-minute closing track of "Orient Orange" is sort of a good summary of the album as a whole, even though the more experimental piece doesn't really have much in common with the rest of the album, as it has its moments, but could have used a touch of editing. That said, despite the inconsistencies, Hello Everything is one of the best things that Jenkinson has done in some time. If you're a fan of his work, it's well worth seeking out.

 As teacher of an Environmental Engineering course (at Ariel Academic College, Israel) and as consulting engineer, I find the book useful, but... Some areas are weak: Population and demand prognosis, Resource planning, Economic evaluation and optimization, Advanced water treatment (membrane and ion exchange technologies, for example), Desalination of brackish and sea water. Each chapter has a well explained exercise, a very useful feature, but most are non metric. All in all, I know of no better textbook, and it is worth its money 
 The Age of Exploration brought spices, slaves, gold, opportunities and a ravaging illness.  With voyagers running before the wind to India, the Western Hemisphere and Australia, sailors that once hugged shorelines were now sent vast distances.  Maritime nations engaged in fierce competition for "discovery", conquest, and resources.  The competition meant extended journeys taking months and years at sea to complete.  The result, beyond the obvious dangers, was the debilitating illness of scurvy.  Medical science hadn't come far when Britain and other sea-faring nations launched mighty fleets manned by street scrubs and displaced yeoman.  Long journeys, poor food and rare stops for fresh vegetables laid low thousands of sailors in British ships.  Bown examines the impact of scurvy and the hit-and-miss efforts to curb it in this highly readable account.   Bown explains the extent of scurvy, noting that due to its cause it wasn't limited to seamen.  With so many accounts of scurvy-ridden voyages, it's easy to lose sight of that fact.  Opening with an account of the 18th Century seafaring world, the author goes on to relate some early findings in dealing with scurvy.  Cartier, exploring the Saint Lawrence River, discovered the Native Americans were aware of scurvy.  They also knew how to overcome it.  Other travellers in distant lands away from fresh fruits, also suffered.  It is, however, the British experience Bown draws on for this story.  Britain's Royal Navy, charged with expanding their role in protecting commerce from France and Spain, became the most vulnerable segment to scurvy.  The Navy overmanned ships to make up for expected losses.  With little knowledge of scurvy's cure and even less of its cause, keeping the ships operating simply meant having enough sailors on board to do the tasks.  Overcrowded ships were considered the only solution.  Many efforts were made to cure the ailment, but most were misdirected, based on poor information or unverified.  Scientific testing was almost unheard of, as Bown points out.  Even when rigorous methods were applied, results were still questioned.   The first of Bown's "heroes" in this medicinal epic was James Lind.  Lind took a group of scurvy victims of HMS Salisbury and treated them with various prescriptions.  Carefully recording results, he found that citrus fruits actually cured even severe cases.  Lind, regrettably, failed to follow up on his find, becoming embroiled in "medicinal politics" in his later years.  Bown shows how Lind's work found a more focussed champion in Captain James Cook.  Cook's massive Pacific voyages in the 1770s were virtually scurvy free, something the Royal Navy might have seized upon, had it been more attentive to the records.  By the time of Cook's death, however, the Royal Navy was busy fighting the rebels of the North American colonies.  Not long after came the Napoleonic Wars adding to the burden.  That era saw the rise of a new investigator, Gilbert Blane who had both a practical sense of how to keep sailors free of the disease and the clout to apply it.  Bown shows how Blane's efforts, applied forcefully to Royal Navy ships, improved sailors' health, leaving British tars in shape to fight and win the significant sea battles of the Napoleonic Wars.  Bown's book is a good explanation of the impact of scurvy and how the problem was addressed in the British Navy.  He presents his characters fully and depicts a few in illustration.  A map of Cook's voyages is provided, which is pleasing, but adds little to the point.  He also provides a table of fruits and vegetables with their Vitamin C content.  He outlines the steps taken by researchers to find and identify, then artificially produce this indispensable compound.  In all, it's an informative book.  It's only blemish is the overly attentive focus on the British circumstance.  The title indicates a comprehensive study, but we're not given that.  Since Bown recounts that scurvy hindered the French and Spanish crews fighting the British at Trafalgar and the Caribbean, we might have expected some relation of what their scientists attempted to identify and cure scurvy in their own navies.

 "The Dragonslayer" is the fourth volume in the Bone series.  The story really moves quickly in this book.  Even the humorous sections are focused on the storyline, which wasn't always the case in the previous books.  This is another outstanding volume in the series.  We learn a lot about Thorn in this book; her relationship with Rose, and with the Dragons.  She questions her abilities, and her resolve, but ultimately she rises to the occasion.  Fone sticks by her loyally throughout, but the most interesting relationship has to be between Rose and Thorn.  Thorn is very critical of the way Grandma Rose has kept information from her, and she does not hold back her opinion.  Rose is dejected, and disappears fairly early on in the book.  Phoney Bone continues his plotting to scam the villagers and return to Boneville after taking their stuff.  Lucius is trying to locate Rose after she disappears, and Smiley Bone continues to provide some lightness to the story.  A continuing mystery is the cloaked men, who show up periodically, but arrive just in time at the end of this book 
 I first discovered Denise Hildreth when I picked up and read "Savannah from Savannah" and I was hooked. That southern flavor permeated the pages, and I adored the quirky family she had created.  Denise gave me three wonderful Savannah novels.  So I was a little disappointed when I found out "Flies on the Butter" was a departure from the beloved characters I had grown to love. But, as Denise herself says, "...sister needed to know that she could write about something other than crazy people from the South."  Well, sister can know for sure...she can write, powerfully write.  "Flies on the Butter" is the story of Rose Fletcher, both who she once was and who she is today, and how the two finally merge into the person she was meant to become.  The story bounces between present day and Rose's memories of her childhood growing up in the South. A stark contrast is created immediately between the two, and it is obvious that Rose is running from the girl she once was, creating a new and improved Rose that is sleeker, sharper, and able to keep her emotions under tight reign.  As the novel unfolds, we learn slowly (isn't that how everything is done in the South?!?) just why Rose feels this need to be so different, and why anything reminiscent of her childhood sends her running the opposite direction.  You can sense foreshadowing of events to come...like a spectre of hope tinged with foreboding...And I love it. It kept me reading long past lights out, and longing for more of Rose's memories. How sweet to picture her wrapping her arm around her granddaddy's head and rubbing that soft spot on his ear, falling asleep as he rocked her on his lap on the porch swing...but Denise writes it so much better than I do!  There's a sense of something highly spiritual (the world would describe it as mystical) going on as well...divine encounters with strangers that leave glory-bumps on your arms and a longing for God to love you like He obviously loves Rose.  Can you tell I drank up this novel like a parched soul on a hot, dry day?? I do believe this is a "read once a year" novel for me...when I need to be reminded of God's love for me and His divine plan includes where I came from as well as where I'm going?  I cannot recommend "Flies on the Butter" any more highly...get this book. Pour yourself a glass of sweet tea, sit on the porch swing, and enjoy Rose's journey...it will make your journey so much more fulfilling....  Happy Reading!  Deena [... 
 I carry this book with me too work all the time to remind me and give me inspiration to strive for more and never quit in reaching my financial goals 
 There are people on this web site giving "Forty Signs of Rain" 1 and 2 stars because the book is basically a bunch of people sitting around in different locales discussing science. Most of them have political opinions that are classified as "left" (some are center-left, some are lefty-left, but all are left). Some have complained that this isn't a fair or balanced look at abrupt climate change. Phooey. Kim Stanley Robinson has always done an excellent job bolstering his arguments. He doesn't need to give lip service--in a novel, of all places--to the counterargument.  Now, I loved this book. It IS a bunch of people sitting around in different locales discussing science. It doesn't have much action. It reads like it is the first 1/3 of the trilogy he's writing.  So why couldn't I put it down at night or wait to pick it up again the next day? Robinson's sense of pace, his flair for characterization, and his ability to set a mood or describe a place are all in top form.  If you want a book, as my review title says, that is both long-winded AND fascinating, that is clearly a left-inspired polemic and good science, then "Forty Signs" is for you 
 Dr. West and his guys did a fantastic job writing this book. It reads like a novel and takes you to the pits of despair and slowly, teasingly, brings you out and into life, his life. For the neophyte therapist it is a great book to sink your teeth into and remember becuase you will run into someone who dissociates...BUY THIS BOOK and read it 
 Pat's the most influential jazz guitar player of the last thirty years, and Brad's the most important jazz piano player since Keith Jarrett.  So if you care about where jazz is at these days, you sort of have to hear this.  Is it fun to listen to?  Not exactly.  It's awe-inspiring: the conception, the interaction, the technique, etc.  It's not all hard work, though, since Jeff Ballard plays drums on a couple of tracks.  Another nice thing about this album is that Brad actually sounds happy in his liner notes, with none of the petulant grandiosity we have come to expect.  (Brad, if you want to know how lame your liner note philosophizing sounds to a real academic you should hear me play ballads on my Yamaha P-150. 
 This book was helpful when we traveled in Tennessee over Christmas. It gave information needed to view the highest point and was user friendly 
 Usually when reviewing a DVD-A, I review the music first and then discuss the advantages of DVD-A over CD.  Here, I'll approach it from the other direction simply because of the sheer beauty of this recording, which is absolutely lost on CDs.  After listening to DVD-As for some time, I really have gotten to dislike listening to CDs because CDs sound harsh and brittle. It is hard to explain the subjective difference between the sound produced by SACD and DVD-Audio and the sound produced by a CD. It is like trying to reproduce cool seaside air with the dry brittle air blowing out of an airconditioning nozzle in a jet airplane and a spray bottle full of table salt and water. In a very literal sense, the CD format is like playing a violin with a hack saw -- there is simply no way to smooth out the saw teeth sufficiently to make it sound correct. SACD and DVD-Audio fix the problem by giving you enough data to filter out the audible errors created by digitizing analog sound.   Fourplay's music is easy listening, airy romantic light modern jazz (without the heavy DISCO thump).  The music is more complex than usually heard on new age/light smooth jazz KWAVE-FM stations, but not so complex that it requires an advanced degree in music to appreciate.  While the recording has the warmth of new age fluff, the music is much more satisfying.  The music draws you in, and you can close your eyes and sink into the silky guitar and keyboard work.    After buying this DVD-A, I fell in love with the music of this band.  I then purchased the Best of Fourplay on CD and did some digital magic to this disk to convert it to CD format for the car. My teeth hurt from listening to the CDs.  This music needs to be heard on DVD -- it seems to thrive on the inner detail and warmth that DVD-A returns to music.  Enjoy 
 What a joy it was to read this book beside the fire with my friends and family.  A unique and wonderful story of Christmas from a distant place in history 
 I loved this book! The kids I read it to also loved it. They really got into it. They tried to guess how much money the pigs would find and they were adding up the money as the pigs found it. They liked the menu when the pigs were at the restaurant because they were pretending that they were ordering too. But they were also figuring what the pigs could order to not go over their budget. They really enjoyed the drawings. I would recommend this book for kids because it's fun and educational 
 Sick Puppy lives up to its name.  Hiaasen is as zany as ever, displaying his hilariously twisted sense of humor from the cover (by which this book can be judged) to the last page.  As usual, the heroes are eminently loveable in a deeply flawed and unstable sort of way, whereas the villains are far more respectable members of society--though equally eccentric and not nearly as loveable.  It's pure Hiaasen--a book by, for, and of sick puppies.  
 This book made me realize that there are still good people in this world.  When everything seems to be going wrong and hatred between mankind seems to be the controlling factor in society, it helps to see the generosity of selfless people 
 Wendy does it again!  I won't repeat the story details here as you've heard them or can read the book description.  But suffice it to say: Wendy is very, very smart.  You know her, you love her, give this one a try!!  It's worth it 
  There IS a newer greatest hits available now that tries to span this bands entire studio career on one disc. Eventually they may try to span a whole live career onto another?  THESE ARE THE EARLY GOODS, AND THE ONES THAT BEGGINERS NEED TO KNOW.  TRUCKIN, was my first glimpse, and was like my favorite song when I was about seven.  GRATEFUL DEAD taught me that skeletons in the closet wasn't a scary thing at all (as long as there was a blonde with him and he was smoking a big fat joint.) They were in fact, quite peaceful.  YEAH, if you have no clue about the DEAD start right here. It's cheaper than the new "greatest" package and it has the best material crammed onto one disc.  If you need more info than that then...

 Bad Company's 1974 debut is probably one of the best examples of the state of popular rock music in the 70s: The songs all have a definite blues influence, with shades of country, folk, and soul thrown in for good measure. But instead of gritty and raw, these songs are catchy and instantly listenable. In a sense, Bad Company combined the most accessable elements of American roots music. This may not sound like such a great idea, but it actually works quite well: The music is lean, muscualr, and catchy, the band is tight and professional, and the overal feel is that of watching an experienced group of rock and roll veterans jamming together. "Can't Get Enough" is the big hit, and deservedly so: With its chunky power chords and strutting vocals, it's a seventies blues-power-pop anthem. "Ready For Love" is a smoky ballad with some surprisingly touching vocals from Paul Rodgers. The title track is a rumbling country-western anthem, "Seagull" is a dreamy accoustic number, and the funky "Rock Steady" just plain rocks. Mick Ralphs' guitar riff on the latter song is probably the coolest thing ever. EVER.  Still, Bad Company isn't a perfect album. While there aren't really any bad songs, there's nothing particularly life-altering, either (well, except for "Rock Steady"). This is simply a really good blues-pop album from a superb professional band. If you like good ol' fashioned r'nr, buy this album right away. As long as you're not expecting the greatest record ever waxed, you won't be dissapointed. And be sure to listen to "Rock Steady." Have I mentioned "Rock Steady?" 
 As with other "Style" books, this one is *not* meant to teach you UML 2.0, but rather to bring some consistency between / among stakeholders when actually applying its usage in the real world to increase effective communication. For example, UML models are used to explore and communicate your requirements, architecture, and design ideas, and by following the guidelines described in this book you increase both the quality of your models and the chance that others will understand what you mean.  This book is a valuable reference for anyone using the UML 
 this album is not the best i have ever heard, but it does bump.  i love THE PROS with daddy-o.  i love the rawness of it.  i also dig WRATH OF MY MADNESS the other raw, aggressive joints on here.  that kid who dissed latifah needs to listen to his 50 cent and just forget about this because this is HIP HOP!!!!  kid, this is not for you.  this is for true HIP HOP HEADZ and those younguns with open minds.  if this applies to you, then you will really dig this as i do........perhaps more 
 This book was recently updated as it seeks to include all of the presidents. The fact that earlier editions of this book have been in print for several decades is a testiment to its fine quality. It is written for the late elemntary to middle school grade level but is a nice quick reference even for adults. The book tends to whitewash certain controversies and treat presidents in a more favorable light than might a longer, adult oriented book. Still, the book gives the basics of major scandals in the presiencies of Grant, Harding, Nixon, etc. Furthermore, the book gives the reader a basic understanding of who each of our presidents was and what the basic issues were during the presidency of each. Knowing the basics of each of our presidents is important for good citizenship and this book fills the bill nicely. I hope that this book will encourage readers to want to read full legnth biographies of some of the presidents profiled or, at least to delve deeper into their presidencies by reading a more complex, adult level book of this type. I highly recommend this great introduction to our presidents 
 I have been faithfully reading the Amelia Peabody series, and I must say, really enjoying them.  It was a bit of a shock when I first looked at this book, because it appeared to go backwards in their remarkable history.  But Ms. Peters carries this off with her usual aplomb, and she's written another cracker of a book.  These books always seem to end too quickly, don't you think?  Anyway, this book is a look back at a place that Amelia and her brood visited ten years before (the Lost Oasis).  And when they go there again they uncover a whole new list of nefarious criminals, but some good friends as well.  The book had me quickly turning pages until I finished it, and left me hungering for more.  I know that this series is nearing an end, but I hope Ms. Peters finds a way of keeping it going for some time to come

 Peter Blood, an Irish physician recently settled in Bridgewater, England after serving in the Dutch navy, goes out to attend a patient and finds himself thrown into prison for his trouble. Blood's patient was fighting on the Duke of Monmouth's side in rebellion against King James, and that makes Blood equally guilty of treason in the law's eyes. Instead of being sentenced to execution, he's "lucky" enough to be shipped off into slavery. In the British colony of Barbados, Colonel Bishop buys him and sets him to work as a physician rather than as a field hand. That gives Blood a great deal easier life, but slavery is still slavery; so he still takes the opportunity for escape when it comes.   As a fugitive slave, he cannot return to England. Blood, who served the Dutch as a sea officer in wartime rather than as a ship's surgeon, bases himself in the pirate haven of Tortuga. He's soon known throughout the Caribbean as Captain Blood, the most feared and yet most curiously honorable of pirates. Whose flagship is called the Arabella, which happens to be the given name of his owner Colonel Bishop's niece.  I'm told that this novel defined its genre when it was first published, well over 80 years ago. I can well believe this. It's historical fiction solidly researched and accurately written, a rousing adventure tale, and a romance in the best old-fashioned sense of that word, all rolled into one. Tremendous fun to read! 
 Some people call this the apex of their career. I wouldn't be inclined to disagree. Their first three albums showed a band moving from lazy funk onto a more funk-rock sound. However, filler and low running times (a limitation of the vinyl era) made them good, but not overly satisfying listens. 1989's Mother's Milk had a producer-induced funk-metal muscle that some have scorned. I happened to like this machismo, but still, the album was short and had its share of weak, unecessary tracks. Then came this 1991 album. Wow, it could've been a double LP! What about the filler? Well, this thing is pretty darn consistent. Tracks roll on and on, yet nothing sounds forced or out of place. The funk is at its funkiest here, and Rick Rubin let's the band perform as they please. It's good and natural fun. Often its in your face. Sometimes its not. Either way, its a fantastic snapshop of the band at its incendiary peak. Later efforts, like the overly-metallic/somewhat-psychedelic/mellow/akward One Hot Minute and the three post-return-of-Frusciante albums all show a band that can't belt out the funk with the same reckless abandon shown here.  Hightlights include: all those singles you know, plus "Mellowship Slinky in B Major," "The Power of Equality," "Funky Monks" and "Sir Psycho Sexy."  I'd suggest you immediately buy this if you simply enjoy music. 
 I bought this a year ago when it was first released,and I still find myself listeneing to it everyday,and falling asleep to it everynight. The ballads on here are beautiful and touching. Especially,"I'm Not in  Love"by 10cc & "I Wanna Know What Love is" by Foreigner.  I recommend this album to everyone 
 This book should be mandatory reading for any clueless neocon supporter or Fox News drone who blindly supports a thouroughly corrupt Neocon regime simply based upon a party name or slogan.  The Bush reign as President has been an exact duplication of his past life in the corporate world.  A career bought and paid for with daddy's money,  political favors and an ongoing display of gross negligence,  a complete inability to think or manage on his own,  or even display reasonable judgement.  It should come as no surprise to anyone that he allowed himself to be surrounded and "guided" by Neocon string pullers like Cheney, Wolfowitz,  Feith and Rumsfeld.  Afterall,  this is an individual who proved over and over during his corporate "career",  if you could call what he did a career,  that he is little more than a bumbling,  poorly spoken puppet, lacking in any serious decision making or management skills.  Three cheers to Paul O'Neill who has the integrity and courage to point out many of the utter untruths and fanatical ideology of both Bush and his Neocon war mongering string pullers.   Bush will go down in history as being the most fiscally irresponsible,  most environmentally damaging, and most corrupt President this nation has ever had.  His foreign policy will get graded as poorly as his fiscal policy.  His domestic policies regarding healthcare,  tax breaks for the ultra rich, and attempts to take rights away from law abiding citizens and condoning torture will also be recorded and judged in history accordingly.  
 Based on the biographical sketches of the authors, it was hard to believe that this book would have much more practical value than the typical skim-the-suface theoretical treatments that come from people with strong academic backgrounds.  This book is an exception, perhaps *the* exemplary exception to the rule.  Outstanding value, worth a spot on your reach-it-with-the-dominant-hand-without-getting-out-of-your-chair reference shelf.  Whether you are a student, a freshly-minted wannabe engineer with a hole where you wish your experience lived, or an old rusty crusty know-it-all who hasn't re-invented a wheel in years, this book is a gem, and we can all learn a lot from time well-spent flipping through it.  There is value here, not just in the hard/soft/firm/wet-ware nuggets that are scattered throughout, but from the clarity of expression and informal style of the textual presentation.  Buy one for a techy you love:  (s)he'll love you right back for the gift

 For a single day's battle, it is hard to think of any that is greater in consequence than the Battle of Hastings in October 1066.  If it had gone the other way, and it was a very near thing, we would, for instance, be using a different language now, the descent of royalty in England would have been decidedly altered, and English and European (and therefore world) history would be unrecognizable from where we are now.  The classical depiction of the battle is on a long piece of linen, and the cloth's story is told in _1066: The Hidden History in the Bayeux Tapestry_ (Walker Books) by Andrew Bridgeford.  Everyone who has looked at this extraordinary work of art has tried to see one scene after another, as if it were some epic graphic novel, to tell the story of the invasion.  If you don't know much about the history that has been taught from the tapestry, Bridgeford makes this a fascinating introduction, examining each scene and coordinating it with the written histories of the time.  He is not, however, a professional historian, but a lawyer, and he has a case to argue.  The tapestry has been interpreted the wrong way, he explains, and he means to set the matter straight.  There is a good deal of guesswork and supposition in his explanation, but it is generally well-argued, and will make little difference to those who come to the tapestry without having been drilled in the old interpretations.  Bridgeford does bring the tapestry to life, with its depictions of valor and brutality, and anyone reading his work is going to want to get to France someday to see the real thing.  The tapestry is not a tapestry at all, really, but an embroidery; the pattern is not in the weave of the fabric, but stitched into the linen.  The illustrations consist of hundreds of human figures, plus horses, falcons, and dogs, set within forests, churches, castles, and ships.  It is about 75 yards long and one yard wide, and was sewn almost a millennium ago.  The battle depicted in the tapestry was brought about by the death of Edward the Confessor in December 1065, an event depicted about a third of the way along the tapestry.  William of Normandy expected to be made king, but Harold Godwinson was given the nod by the dying Edward.  William set forth to get the throne he thought was his, and of course when Harold fell in the Battle of Hastings, he succeeded.  The view of the tapestry ever since has been that because the Normans won, and because victors get to write the histories, the tapestry is "a work of Norman triumphalism," made by Normans who wished to celebrate their just conquest.  Bridgeford has taken scholarly works of the latter twentieth century to demonstrate that the tapestry necessarily tells of the Norman victory, but it gives an English version of events.  For instance, the tapestry never refers to William's claim to the throne, showing Harold's nomination as lawful; Harold is not the usurper whose actions would have justified invasion.  Harold is referred to as King Harold when he is depicted, but he was almost always in other Norman documents referred to by his former title Duke.    There is an enormous amount of evidence for this new hypothesis, attractively arranged and argued with legal skill.  Part of the problem is that the tapestry is from so long ago, there are no written documents from its own time that refer to its story or how it was made, and there is an enormous amount of confusing and strange inclusions on the cloth.  It thus has many panels that can be interpreted in various ways.  Bridgeford knows this, and wisely includes many times a phrase like, "One further piece of intriguing evidence should be mentioned, though its import is unclear."  The case, full of suppositions about spears that point to particular letters and animals on the cloth's border that illustrate a fable from Aesop that might apply in some way to the goings-on in the main pictures, is an interesting one, but for most people, the new ideas Bridgeford presents will be secondary.  His book primarily serves as an excellent introduction to the tapestry and how mysterious it is, with many large voids of information about and within it.  He also has drawn from other sources to describe a strange and turbulent time, and his descriptions of side issues, like the process of becoming a knight, are useful to the main story.  The book is illustrated with small pictures to show the whole cloth, and enlargements of the panels to which Bridgeford pays particular attention.  As an appreciation of a spectacular work of art, the book is fine guide, particularly in its explanation of symbolism that appealed to the medieval mind 
 What a great way to introduce our kids to Dr. Seuss.  It can be interactive or not-so, great for toddlers or babies listening to someone else make the noises.  My 2 year old has loved this book since we introduced it to her around 19 months.  She can remember most of the sounds almost exactly-it's awesome 
 This author is one of my favorites!  She clearly knows and loves Italian food and offers wonderful recipes for the home cook.  A black olive and goat cheese torta to be served alongside salad is so easy and takes minutes to make.  A bean sauce for roast chicken is -- as she says -- wonderful on it's own and can be on the table within 10 minutes.  Her tastes are clear and fresh, her recipes are sound and well written, her book is a wonderful addition to the shelf of any cook who loves the food of Italy and is looking for new but uncomplicated ideas.  Even a beginner can make headway with this volume and dazzle family and friends with tantalizing cuisine 
 I rarely find a book I just Cannot Put Down.  One of the rare ones was The Lovely Bones--and it wasn't just the plot.  It was the language, the crystal-clear voice-in-your-head narrative that spoke and spoke of pain and sadness and resolve.  It was infused with a realism and was both beautiful and haunting.  Like the lean, hard and seemingly lengthened muscles of a runner, Sebold's voice is discernable above the din of modern fiction yet it is not haughty or self-involved... Hearing her voice is like the moment you know you are going to be really good friends with someone you just met:  comforting and clear, it makes you want to lean closer to absorb it.  It made me a devoted fan of Sebold as I am sure you are, too.  After having read Lucky, I now feel I know where that voice originated from.  This book is the literary equivilent of an armor-piercing bullet, and I found it beyond interesting that she took time out from writing The Lovely Bones to expunge her own memories from her narrative process--in other words, she felt she had to tell her full story in order to complete Susie's authentically in Susie's voice.    To say that this was a gripping narrative, to say that it was moving, to say that it was a good read seems trite.  It was more like a shock to my system.  It made me more careful with my decisions as a woman and a mother and made me realize the profound effect of such violence.   Sebold's voice, like Melville's, is so full of astonishing truths that it cannot be ignored nor should it be missed simply because it isn't fiction.  There are real truths in this book that everyone should know.    Keep in mind that this book is not for the faint of heart; it does indeed open with an extremely descriptive narrative of her rape and the subsequent trial.  Sebold details the capture, trial, aftermath and survival of her rape in such detail it cannot be described in a review--it has to be experienced for oneself.  Please read this book:  it is a revelation.  Not a kind one, but a necessary one for both the author and ourseles.  I am immensely grateful to have found it, and for Sebold for having written it.  You won't be able to put it down 
 This movie starts a little slow, but builds quickly into a suspenseful thriller.  Bridges does an excellent job playing a psycho and masterfully pulls off that little "thing" that just makes him creepy.  Typical of an early 90s thriller, this movie is sure to entertain.  If you liked "Fear" then you will like "The Vanishing" as well 
 This may not be my ABSOLUTE favorite studio Dead album, the five just before it are a notch or two higher overall in my mind (see my Dead list: "The Ship Of The Sun Is Drawn By The Grateful Dead" if you are curious how I view the original Dead releases), but it IS a very strong and satisfying one for me and I have always loved it. It is worth pointing out that I started going to Dead concerts around this time (my teen years), and this material was highlighted of course, so for me this was a signpost to the trippy world of the Grateful Dead. Once you've heard Terrapin anthem live, in that special state of mind, with the beautiful lights blending, you're a Grateful goner trust me (a dancing turtle and friends boarding the Terrapin Flyer on a gloriously sunny trip to anywhere the music plays)!   Weir's punchy Estimated Prophet begins it with a BANG as Garcia's signature slick (envelope filter) waahhhlll of joyful guitar bliss weaves between Weir's sharp chordal harmonic permutations and Lesh's tight ventricle vibrating bass thumpings. Kreutzmann & Hart are "on" here, laying down very interesting beats as if from a single four-armed monster. This was the new "hit" back then and is possibly Weir's biggest one ... "firewheel burnin' in the air". Tom Scott provides lyricon and saxophones for soft landing toward the end.   Dancing in the Streets is a fun little cover song, and the band are clearly grooving here. Lesh is especially noticeable with jazz-fusiony butter runs, spreading a tasty overlay to the what might have been a less than tasty disco-beat foundation (Mickey's interesting world beat is a shade of things to come for him). Smile big as Garcia and Weir wink at eachother parodying the times with their "brand new beat" jangly pop guitar musings - FUNNY! Horns are provided to rescue the somewhat pretty melodies getting lost in this hyper SNfever dance. God bless 'em, they tried valiantly to bring the Dead dance hall into the platform shoe era.   "Firefly, Can you see me, Shine on GLOWING, Brief and brightly ... PASSENGER, DON'T YOU HEAR ME?" - This song (Passenger, by Lesh) kicks your[...] in a happy, sweet and innocent way, but yes, IT ROCKS (at least briefly - short song at 2:48 min)! Garcia switches between bouncy melodic talkative storylines and slide-guitar exclamations as Weir holds down a pure rock 'n' roll structure with Lesh and the high-hat bashing rhythm section - very catchy and fun song that sticks with you, permanently.   Samson & Delilah (arranged by Weir) starts out with great drums and Garcia having fun tweaking the intense chord progressions with walking blues finally wailing out with a patented (amongst deadheads) twangy guitar lead. Strangely intense & mellow.Samson, tell me where your strength lies???   .. As a lead in to the incredibly beautiful melodic song by Donna "Sunrise" that I believe was created for the funeral of a friend. It is sung so tenderly, even thinking about this siren song can be emotional, as you get lost in the hymnal beauty. It's darn close to her crowning achievement with the Grateful Dead (although her work on Cat's Under the Stars is on par and equally gracious). Yes, this sweety did add a few precious things to the Dead continuum, despite the ambivalence of some fans to her live work.   And now we come to it, with thumbs up high ... Please may we get to Terrapin? THIS SONG IS JERRY'S MASTERPIECE if you want to know one fans opinion. With all else thrown out, the albums worth is paid back right here: "Since the end is never told, We pay the teller off in gold, in hopes he will come back ... but he cannot be bought or sold" (Lady With A Fan). The way I look at it, with Jerry gone now, this will have to do.   His most ambitious musical musings are stretched out and played with in this elaborate song. Pretty cerebral! Can you hear the myriad influences played out in this 16:10 minute opus? Since I have been a big progressive rock fan simultaneously with my Dead years it isn't hard seeing where ideas may have been found; English prog - Canterbury style rock/folk, Tull, Yes, Gentle Giant, Caravan, King Crimson and many others seem to be somewhat represented. And I do know Jerry had a bit of an American orchestra fetish (that he tried to explore solo) that is layered in. Even some classical aspects get a little attention compositionally. The Grateful Dead members were voracious consumers of ALL world music and it shows here more than most.   What a piece of work! Jerry (and the band) cooks all over this multi-layered diamond, and not just him, but the writing with Hunter is wonderful: "Inspiration, move me brightly, Light the song with sense and color, hold away despair. More than this I will not ask. Faced with mysteries dark and vast." All members put it all out for this song - it is just too much to get into the details - just turn it up, lay back and dream your way to Terrapin (it is a delightful state of mind while you're there). It is a melodic/harmonic paradise to my ears. Enjoy!   P.S. The extras on this Rhino remastered version are great generally: an excellent playful Peggy-o; a nice LONG and much improved jam on Dancin', a fun Ascent into Jerry jam land; Fire on the Mountain getting ready for the next album; A strange little song called Equinox (by Lesh) that is promising in an unfinished outtake; and last but certainly not least a GREAT Catfish John pulled from Garcia solo material that should make you want to go out and get all of the five newly remastered Garcia solo albums, filled to the brim with extras that are a true delight. Go get 'em while your still young!  
 I heard the title The Man with the Golden Arm long before I ever read the book or saw the movie.  It's a beautiful, evocative title, but it also makes you think of something grotesque: a man with a shiny prosthetic. When I got older, and knew the story centered on a junkie, the connotation became even more disturbing: an arm jaundiced by the hypo.  I was never much into addiction stories and Algren's book (purchased as a shiny new softcover back in the early 80s, when I was spending the greater part of my college loan money on the creation of a private library) sat on my shelf for more than 20 years.  It turns out that the book is quite a good read. Algren locates the source of dealer Frankie Machine's addiction in his WW2 service-he was wounded and got hooked on the morphine that eased the pain of his injury. The novel also makes clear, though, that in spite of his friends' admiration and awe of his Purple Heart, Frankie was no hero.  A grunt's grunt, he remained three years a private.  While the novel tells the story of Frankie's several attempts to kick the stuff, what we get out of it is the tale of a loser in a community of losers, people the American dream has left behind: small-time swindlers, dwellers in fleabag tenements, drunks, and sweet girls who can't get a break  Among the sad detritus of this universe, located around Chicago's West Division Street, Frankie Machine shines like a star, with his big talk and his talent (the "golden arm" refers to his sure skill dealing cards, which he hopes to transfer to playing the drums in a big band).  Still, his life spirals downward. And although the drugs are central, you can't help feeling that if it weren't morphine that did Frankie in, it would have been something else.  At bottom, he doesn't believe he's worth saving; one of the achievements of the novel is that you end up feeling they're all worth saving, not just Frankie, but also his grimier fellows.  Algren draws his characters with such vividness that he takes you beyond pity and amusement to pure empathy with their humanity.   
 This book has really helped my step-son and many of the kids in my chiropractic practice - naturally.  Tbe advice is sound, and although you must be disciplined to follow the diet - the results are well-worth it.  Best of all...the only side-effect is better health expression for your precious children.  Read this book!! 
 Enclosed among these "Reflections on Photography" is a provocative theory of art in general, of what gives art the power to keep us looking. Barthes speaks of what he calls the 'punctum,' that aspect of a photograph (or, by implication, of any image, visual or textual) that pierces the viewer's consciousness, that wounds us like a dart of desire and leads to a blurring of the line between the aesthetic and the erotic. Here is an answer to Sontag's call for an 'erotics of art.' (Barthes and Sontag were friends, and it's quite possible that they influenced each other.) A great image, great art, has the power to wound us and fascinate us like a lover. And we as viewers must open ourselves to this power, like people in love. Indeed, one of the things Barthes is doing in this book is 'cruising' photography in the same way that he, a gay man, might have 'cruised' attractive men in the beaches, bars and baths of the 1970's. A wonderful book that deserves to be more widely read 
 The artist is a master a lighting up watercolors.   Easy to follow instructions, informative and enlightening.   Suggested great reading for the novice watercolorist and exceptional reading for the master 
 Way too much has been written over time about what was going on in Johns life when this record was cut.The painful seperation from Yoko,lost weekend,etc.For those who didnt try to figure out the complex Mr.Lennon,the news is good for rock and roll.This album just cooks.Some great songs only John could write,and tight players to lay it down.2 things set this apart for greatness:1.the terrific band and guests(Elton,Harry Nilsson)and best of all-2.no Yoko.I agree with those who say this is JL's best record.A must 
  I saw the movie "Love Comes Softly" before I knew there were books. I prefer the film over the book because of the interaction between  Clark's daughter Missie,and Marty is hilarious,as well as touching,where in the book,Missie is just an infant when Marty and Clark get together. One case where a film is better than the book. I did enjoy the whole series of books,however. They are wholesome,exciting and edifying,which I cannot say for the "Amish-Themed" books by Beverely Lewis,which seems to deliberately portray the Amish in a very bad light.Too much focus on negative characters in her books. Jannette Oke's books will uplift the reader 
 The tapes are exactly what we wanted ... great entertainment for our son 
 I read "Ficciones" when I was younger and was blown away by it, but didn't actually understand anything in it.  I have recently reread the entire work and am once again blown away.  I still don't understand quite everything he says, but even getting past that the stories are incredible.  My favorite is 'Theme of the Traitor and Hero,' but I also like 'The Library of Babel,' 'The Circular Ruins,' and 'Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius.'  His style is so concise it amazes me- an idea that would take an enormously long novel to examine satisfactorily if given to another author takes Borges a mere four and a half pages (as in 'Theme').  This might sound detrimental to the work or discouraging to the reader, but that is not the case.  It is discouraging, however, in the sense that you want to read more- you almost wish it was a 400-page novel (a novel that would probably be the opus for any other writer) and not a short story that the reader is through with in five minutes 
 Great Book for any artist, author etc.  Julia Cameron is in my opinion one of the best encourager for all people in the arts of any field... would highly recommend any of her books.. 
 While I love Jessica Mitford's writing style, I must admit that now that I am older I can say I see the value of a nice funeral.  They are for the living and I think even the lowliest life deserves memorial.  However, this book does point out things to be wary about and shows the options (many available due to Ms. Mitford's first book).  
 We just got back from a fantastic trip to London. We brought several guide books with us but Time Out London proved to be the only one we needed -- except for the fact that the type size in the index is microscopic -- and therefore completely unusable.  I mention this because anyone over the age of 30 will have great difficulty using this index without a magnifying device.  It's too bad they do this to save a couple pages, because the index is crucial to getting the most out of this guide book 
 This second greatest hits cd includes all the major omissions from the first one and then some. All of the big Prince hits not on the previous cd are here (except for "Batdance", which isn't needed anyway), including "Controversy", "I Wanna Be Your Lover", "Delerious", "Little Red Corvette", "Raspberry Beret", "Kiss", "U Got The Look" and "Cream", as well as lesser known tracks such as "Dirty Mind", "Head" and "Gett Off". Once again, the sound quality is a bit flat but other than that this is an excellent compilation 
 if you like mafia storries I would stronglly recommend this book. It is worth reading and much better than the movie 
 I decided to check out the Top 10 guide for Barcelona given the excellent experience I had in London with a similar guide on a past trip to the UK. I noticed the same compelling points with this guide as I'd noticed with the London guide -- a concise list of things to do in city, a list of various neighborhoods, list of best cafes/bars and sample itineraries for spending an entire day in each neighborhood, the top 10 things to look for at each attraction, and the best feature: the compact size of the guide.  But I was looking for more than just the above -- I was traveling to a city where people don't talk in English after all. What I really liked about the guide was the main map that showed all the important street in an uncluttered fashion, and the mini-maps that were included in the assorted Top 10 lists, making it a breeze to locate the attraction or cafe/bar. I also loved the list of the Top 10 drinks you'll find only in Barcelona like the "Orxata", the "Granissat" and of course, the "Sangria" that is refereshingly different from what you might have had anywhere else. There are similar lists for food items (definitely try the "Pallela"), shops, etc. These are the things that make you blend in with the locals with confidence.  I also loved the section on Streetsmarts -- when you're in a country where English is not the first language, you sometimes need a helping hand with even the simplest of things -- like what is the best deal on the Barcelona Metro? Should I buy single tickets or a "T-10" for 10 tickets? How do I make a local phone call? What should I avoid? (Answer: touristy scams at La Rambla). The Top 10 guide's Streetsmart section covers many of these "small" things on your mind and also include a few pages with popular Spanish/Catalan phrases with translation in English, eliminating the need to carry a phrase book, if any.  With this guide, I was able to see Barcelona according to my schedule and tastes. I took in all the touristy attractions and spent time exploring specific neighborhoods like El Raval, Eixample and interesting detours. Not a day went by when I wasn't glad for having this guide by my side -- and at under 10 bucks a pop, I'm quickly acquiring a collection 
 Musically, Wynton is at his usual best on this CD and it is a great production. I would have focused this review on the music on the CD, however, Wynton's comments in the video had very little to do with the music on the CD, so this review is mostly about his comments in the video selling the CD. If Wynton is to be a political spokesman, than I wish he would be honest and do his people a favor by refraining to blame white America for all of the hardships that they face. Unfortunately, Wynton will always be an unhappy black man and a racist. Maybe this is a good thing because it might be his main driving force for creating such great music. Once again, we see that social problems of the black community will never be solved because of distortion of the truth and problems consistantly involving bad choices being blamed on others. Come on Wynton - tell your people to step up to the plate and hit home runs like you have instead of wallowing in their failures. It is now time because nobody new is buying the old excuses any longer. Buy the CD but don't buy this racist retoric. 
 This novel is classified as a mystery, and works pretty well on that level. There was some awkwardness in the use of standard mystery devices such as false clues, or other obvious devices for building suspense.  This was especially noticeable to me at the beginning of the book. But that is a minor flaw in what is otherwise an intriguing,moving and largely believable story.  The setting is a small village in Quebec which is re-inventing itself as a haven for artists, while also maintaining a traditional Francophone culture.  The strong points of the novel for me were the deeply sympathetic portrayals of the effects of grief and loss as experienced by the friends of the victim. I also admired the way the author gave lots of insights into the local culture and political history of Quebec, including its Anglo/Francophone rivalries, without getting pedantic or preachy. The main characters are either artists living in the community, or outside investigators who have arrived from Montreal and are required to learn the local customs and penetrate the community's deeply buried secrets. Again, the book develops interesting paralells and divergences in the ways these two groups analyze and solve problems,  yet it all seems natural and not at all formulaic.  I read this book in one sitting, and aside from the occasional intrusion of unnecessary mystery-writting cliches, it was a wonderful reading experience. I am looking forward to the next book by this author

 This is an interesting collection of World War II stories that are both fascinating and true. Almost every story is an obscure gem that seizes your interest and will not let go. There are tales of intelligence and behind-the-scenes war stories that should make any history buff or person casually interested satisfied. I enjoyed this book a lot, and I would recommend it to anyon 
 I thought the author came closer than is usual in the sequels to remaining faithful to the characters of Austen's Darcy and Elizabeth (in too many of them, Darcy and Elizabeth are almost unrecognizable...even absent entirely). Lady Catherine and Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are also drawn very true to their originals, and I was very happy to see Mary Bennet brought into the story - none of the others really include her. The author came wonderfully close to P&P's humor, especially in the scenes with Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, and Lady Catherine. I agree that the verbatim use of some of Austen's phrases and the editing were jarring - I like a well done run-on sentence, but it was plain that many were different sentences simply missing .s or ?s. Oddly enough, this seemed to clear up suddenly about halfway into the book. My distractions were three - where did all these other suitors come from? They seemed to drop into the story and be accepted as fiancés and husbands in 2-3 pages, with no lead-up whatsoever! I can't imagine this happening in either Austen world, real or fictional. The rehabilitation of other original characters was equally sudden and even less believable, and Darcy's faithful characterization begins to wobble from his involvement. Finally, I felt having a character pop up toward the end selling the entire plot of a Brontë novel was overly droll and unnecessary. For me the sequels are near to taking on the personalities of P&P characters - the Darcy and Elizabeth of them has not yet been written. Still to go back to the beloved world was enjoyable as always. In future, with a better editor and attention to pacing, I think this author could rise to the top of the sequels. 
 One of John Hughes best films,Ferris Bueler made me laugh harder than any other Hughes film. The though of one high schooler having an entire town behind his back makes you wish you were him.I love this film 
 I have had this CD (or parts of it from earlier records) for quiet a while. As a guitar lover and record collector, I judge these performances as the alpha and omega of guitaristic art. They are a world of their own, both in terms of interpretation and instrumental technique. These recordings are from Manuel's earlier years as a performer. I find him better than on his more recent recordings, where he seems to have lost some youthful enthousiasm. If you are interested in guitar music, not just the candelight type but prime art, this is the CD that will change your perspectives for ever 
        I'll start by saying all those people who think that american animated series are as good as it gets animation wise have been living under a rock since this series started 11 DVDS ago, and it continues with this volume. As for the episodes themselves, They were a good addition to the season because with the next two discs, everything comes to a head and resolves. Looking back on the four episodes, the only perceivable problem was that there was no real explanation as to why the major and batou were compelled to go to berlin with everything that was going on at home in Japan. This was not enough for a point deduction. At the end of the day, anyone who likes a good series or animation that is technically perfect shoud buy this discs and all of the discs from both seasons. You will not be disappointed. 
 I heart this book!  (That's a fancy way of saying "I love this book!") My name is Nanci.  It used to end with a "Y" until I changed it to Nanci with an "I" in the 3rd grade because it looked fancier!  Fancy Nancy is the best!  Wonderful illustrations and a fabulous story make this a new classic 
 THE BIG HIT is a pretty funny crime caper, buoyed by a remarkably gentle performance from Mark Wahlberg as a hit man who can't stand the idea of not being liked.  Add Lou Diamond Phillips as a foul mouthed, testosterone-driven lunatic; Robin Dunne as as stuttering idiot; Antonio Sabato Jr. and Bokeem Woodbine as buff buddies; China Chow as a spry kidnap victim; Avery Brooks as the smooth crime boss; Christina Applegate as a daft fiancee; and Elliott Gould and Lainie Kazan as the Jewish parents from Hell and you have all the ingredients for a lighthearted if somewhat violent film.  There are some stupendous action scenes but it's the movie's humorous ambience that makes it refreshingly original.  
 Chambers tells of his experience as a Communist spy in the United States without skirting the conclusion that was obvious to him later in life, that Soviet communism was an evil that must be defeated. It was a long read but well worth the effort. 
 "War & Peace" it ain't, but if you like Danielle Steel or serial romances, you will like this book.  It is a quick read and has good flow between the perspectives of the main characters 
 Few social climbers are as surreally despicable as Edith Wharton's Undine Spragg, who doesn't care what happens to anyone else as long as she can shop and party. And "The Custom of the Country" is the perfect example of what such people do to the people around them. It's nauseating and brilliant, all at once.  Undine Spragg is a mesmerizing beauty from a tiny town, whose parents made a small-scale fortune and have moved to the glitzy world of New York. Undine wants the best of everything, more than her family can afford, but she thinks it's all worth it -- so she marries a besotted son of "old New York," but it doesn't take long for him to realize how incompatible they are.  And he doesn't realize that Undine is hiding a (then) shameful secret -- she was once married and quickly divorced from a vulgar businessman. In the present, Undine continues her quest for a life of pleasure, moving on to a French nobleman and getting just as dissatisfied with him. The only way to succeed lies in the one man who sees her for what she is.  Undine Spragg may actually be one of the most despicable, selfish characters in all of classic literature -- she literally doesn't care about anyone but herself, or who she hurts. You'd think a book about someone like that would be dreary, but instead it's one long needle at the people like Undine, who care only for money, status and fun.  But it's also about the changing fortunes in late 19th-century America (and Europe). New money -- symbolized by Undine and her shrewd, megarich ex-hubby -- was squeezing out the old guard, who were never terribly rich to start with. Wharton's observations on their rise and decline have a sharp, biting edge. Although compared to the anti-heroine, the old traditions seem pretty innocent.  Lots of celebrity socialites could take a lesson from Undine's story: she's a snob of humble stock, thinks she's a great person, and utterly selfish -- if her husband shoots himself, that's great! She can marry again without the disgrace of a divorce! Yet in the end, you know that Undine will always be craving something more that she thinks will make her happy, but she will never find it.  The characters around Undine are usually nice, but blinded by her nymphlike beauty -- and even her parents, who know what she's like, are too beaten-down by her whining to resist. Only her ex-husband, Ralph Marvell, is really right for her -- not only is he obscenely rich and just as grasping as Undine, but he's smart enough to know what a monster she is.  "The Custom of the Country" is a wickedly barbed, brilliant piece of work, with one of the nastiest anti-heroines ever, and a great look at the rising tides of "new money." A must-read 
 Hunter's words, the inspiration, soul, and backbone of the Grateful's Dead's songs, are here collected in all their subtle grace.  His songs read like poems, and his poems burst like songs.  Vital reading for dead-heads and poetry lovers alike 
 Just a note--I can't find as anyone's caught this. The soundtrack for this film is by Benjamin Frankel, a serious British composer whose symphonies are highly regarded, and is one of the best film scores Ive encountered in some time. In fact I'm surprised it isn't better known as it approaches the quality Sir William Walton reached in his Shakespeare scores for Olivier. I'd buy this DVD just for the music.  Otherwise this is an absolutely wonderful flick and, as an exercise in humorous cynicism about how the modern world operates I'd double-bill it with Wilder's absurdly under-rated "One, Two, Three. 
 I read this book when I was in 6th grade and I am 22 now and still skim through it. This book really got me back on the reading track and I started enjoying reading again. Cherie is a terrific author, and if it weren't for this book and her many sunset books, I don't think I'd be reading as avidly as I do today! Two thumbs up 
 This well-researched "ecohistory" helped me discover -- and rediscover -- some of Chicagoland's special places.  Looking through new eyes, I was able to gain a new appreciation for my favorite spots, as well  as explore some hidden gems.  I highly recommend this guide for both  visitors and residents 
 I first read this book when I was in the second grade and remember it bringing tears to my eyes, but at the same time making me smile at seeing the wonderful bonds that can occur between humans and animals. I am now 16, and still read this book on a regular basis! It is a MUST for anyone considering it! Also, it is a great gift for anyone you know who is involved with PETA, the ASPCA, or any other animal lovers 
 This is a great book.  John Robbins starts with one farm animal at a time and tells how that animal is sentient, can be characterized with what we might call human qualities, and then tells how that animal is treated on the factory farm.  Each chapter begins with a quote you can use to further your campaign against factory farming.  The middle section is about the environment and the impacts the factory farm has on the environment.  This is useful to sway those who think they are saving the world as environmentalists, without concern for the "humanity" of animals.  The final section covers the nutritional aspects of a vegan diet.    I believe Robbins is a beacon of light in animal welfare.  He might not achieve the vegan ideal, but I think he is definitely worth a look, and for those who are new to the movement, the words he writes are earth shaking.  The only thing, the factory farm has unfortunately become even more brutal for animals, workers, environment, and our health since this book has been written 
 Flight from death is a "must see" documentary. I saw it three times since i've received the DVD last week and each time i discover new aspects. Images are beautiful and the commentary (narrated by Gabriel Byrne) is just outstanding. Before seeing it, i was a little bit anxious to see how they can translate in a documentary the rather complex thought of Ernest Becker. As a reader of Becker's books for many years i can tell that Patrick Sean and Greg Bennick had done a fantastic job. Each important parts of Becker's understanding of the impact of death anxiety on human behavior are explored and very well explained. I understand now why this documentary won seven prizes. Please do not hesitate to buy this DVD you won't regret it!   
 This book is a compilation of funny writings by prolific American writers. Betwixt a strange look at Pokmon and a letter from the Census takers, there are great things, like the periodic table of rejected elements, and 100 favorite body parts. This book is hilarious, and I recommend it to all people, except for people who make census, and the creator of Pokmon 
 Have you ever wondered what will happen during and after the rapture? Well this book takes a look at the rapture through the eyes of those who are left behind after God vacuums up all the righteous people with an 800 horse power whisper quiet shop-vac.   The main characters include an airline pilot, his daughter, a journalist, a flight attendant, and a new world leader with devilishly good looks and charm. The main characters are all intelligent people who are trying to figure out what happened to there loved ones and what that great sucking noise was right before a third of the populace vanished. The people left behind theories seem to include alien abduction, spontaneous combustion, and God. But since all the righteous religious people are gone they are a little fuzzy on the god theory.  The book is entertaining enough, but it is mostly build up with no satisfactory release; a bit of a tease if you will. For my money I want something a little more satisfying, like a manwich or a 16 oz steak of a story. In the beginning there does seem to be the promise of steak but all you get in the end is a tiny greasy vegetarian appetizer and a bill for $ 14.99. 
 I just got this book for my 2 year old.  He and I have read it for 3 nights straight...he picks it out every time at bedtime.  He enjoys saying along with me..."no millk" as each page ends in that blurb.   Repetition is fun for little readers, and this book is cute and funny.  I  recommend it for city kids and farm kids alike. : 
 Ah, I am a virgin to true science fiction, one of stories written of outer space and its realms.  And I was not disappointed.  This is partly due to the fact that Benford is a professor of physics himself, so he is well versed in his field and the logic behind other fields.  The Zand are an altogether great fictional alien race, one that captivated me from the beginning.  The Darksiders not so much, and the Beings had to warm me up before I accepted and believed in them.  All in all it is a believable future, a believable notion of the sciences involved in interplanetary exploration and discovery.  The book itself focuses more on plot than it does character development, as the characters are rather one sided.  As well at times the plot moved forward too easy.  The Beings would say or do something, and the next chapter was the cosmonauts, within the first few paragraphs, talking about exactly that.  Or at times the alien races are not alien enough.  The cosmonauts looked upon the Beings as dragons when they first encountered them, and then the Beings called the spaceships dragons.  Huh?  Why use the same notion twice, especially when it is an alien race using it?    I expect there is some kind of sequel in the works.  Why else would Benford have Instigator, in the last few pages, mention an altogether different Being named Venturer, who there was no mention of at all, that went inbound and was lost just the same as Incursor?  I suspect the insinuation is that Venturer is the Being behind Earth's life, just as...  Well I won't spoil the story for anyone.  Minor inconsistencies, though.  All in all, the book was enjoyable and I was involved with it, felt like continuing to read the book from beginning to end.  Benford does a great job in marrying science to fiction.  Although character development is lacking, the science goes well with the story, which compensates.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  In fact, time to try another of Benford's books!  3.5 Stars. 
 This is a good primer on the Pretribulationist position. But since I am of this view point...it is like singing to the choir for me.  The gem hidden for Pretribulationist in this book is the section "No Fear of Misguided Attacks" and covers...  * The Pre-wrath Myth (Dealing with VanKampen and Rosenthal)  * McPherson's Vendetta (Dealing with his hatred of the Pre-trib doctrine)  * The Most Absurd Charge of All (Dealing with Robert L. Price attacks calling belief in the Pre-Trib Rapture "cultish")  * A Case Against Slander (Dealing with attacks against Dr. Ironside's)  *Target Number One (Attacks against J.N. Darby)  *Why Do They Do That (Deals with possible reasons opponent attack the Pre-Trib Rapture)  The opponents say frequently that the pretribulation rapture did not start until 1830 from J.N. Darby, of whom was influenced by Irving and the vision of Margaret Mc Donald.  I would start with the chapter Target Number One. The truth is that Darby in his own words said he started his dispensational view (that lead to forming pretribulation rapture doctrine) in 1827 when he was recovering from a broken leg while riding his horse.  From that time he left the Church of England and joined with the Plymouth Brethern. But Darby made enemies because of his forceful personality. In 1844 he and B.W. Newton had bitter strife over the issue concerning the status of the church during the Great Tribulation. Eventually Newton was excommunicated for heresy for his faulty view of the person of Christ.   In 1855, Newton and his brother in law S. P. Tregelles attacked pretributionism as from "Judizers" and in 1865 changed it to a spirit utterance in Mr. Irving's Church.  It is from this poisoned well that McPherson drew to attack pretribulationism. In turn other opponents like Vankampen and Rosenthal quote from McPherson slanted research without question as being true.  These chapters will answer these charges and show them as biased and lacking credibility. From these chapters you can do your own research and come to your own conclusions.   
 The Oregon Trail by Francis Parkman is an account which further enforces the history of the Oregon Trail we had learned about in [U.S. History] class. The book portrays what it must have been like to travel on the Trail, never knowing what the next day would bring. The buffalo hunting which took place throughout the book became monotonous and boring after the first exciting few, but other than that repetitiveness, the journey was well depicted. I especially enjoyed Parkman's in-depth descriptions given to the reader of the people he meets on his journey and his observations on their actions as well. His vivid imagery of scenes from nature such as animals, prairie landscapes, and the weather, place the reader right next to Parkman in his adventuresome expedition. There are some dull, repetitive points in the observations made by the author, but aside from that his autobiographical telling of his journey is unforgettable. 
 I do like this book and I'll probably refer to it often but I'm not quite as enthusiastic about it as the other reviewers. The history was very interesting but because there was so much of it, there wasn't as much coverage of suitable plants as other books. On the plus side of that, the author also didn't go into "information overload" and provide umteen-zillion varieties of every possible rose that could be planted.  He did discuss some rarely used plants that I definitely want in my garden and he knows how to grow them, too, which is a plus.  He also included some recipes for some of the unusual vegetables.  And the pictures are wonderful 
 I love the old fairytales that are still around.  The old stories are read and reread.  It is a magical time in childhood that is always fresh in our minds.  All some of the old favorites to your library 
 ---------------------------------------------------------- No animal may drink alcohol "to excess"  A fairy tale or a nightmare? It all began with a dream by Major, a Middle White boar, of equality, and freedom from oppression. Maybe not in our life comrade, but eventually.   The dream brings a song. Intolerable conditions lead to revolution. As time passes things change; not exactly as planned.  There are two striking parts to this tale that stand out. First when Boxer is sent to the hospital and Benjamin reads the side of the van "Horse Slaughterer." Secondly there was a party in the farm house as the pigs were playing cards with the men, two aces of spades showed up. An argument ensues.  Then a realization was drawn by the creatures outside looking in as they "...looked from pig to man, and man to pig, and from pig to man again..." ---------------------------------------------------------- Deviates corrected for their own good  In a society that has eliminated many imbalances, surplus goods, and even class struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith is one of those. He starts out, due to his inability to doublethink, with thoughtcrime. This is in a society that believes a thought is as real as the deed. Eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex and even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan.  If he gets caught, he will be sent to the "Ministry of Love" where they have a record of 100% cures for this sort of insanity. They will even forgive his past indiscretions.  Be sure to watch the three different movies made from this book:  1984 (1954) Peter Cushing is Winston Smith 1984 (1956) Edmond O'Brien is Winston Smith  Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984) John Hurt is Winston smith 
 There are no easy answers to questions about the existence of God, especially when such questions are framed around the very unobserved origin of our universe.  Drs. Craig and Smith provide helpful insight into the theistic and atheistic viewpoints on matters pertaining to the much-neglected "kalam cosmological argument."  This work is a valuable resource for those seriously interested in a scientific and philosophical analysis of one of the greatest questions of all time:  Does God exist?  The book's point-by-point debate format gives the reader anticipated answers filled with rich information no one can do withou 
 The music collection is nice but the sound of it...hmmm.....'do badly".........:-)   Written by:  Dr, Prof (PhD) Ang Poon Kah TC submission for 'this'/money government. Imagine entertainment for Da Vinci Code. DNA production for notes on a scandal...all can just have it.... Syncast for Mystery of the Nile.

 When this film was playing in the movie houses, I saw it at least six times and have viewed it on home video many more times.  Now that I have a DVD player, I can enjoy the beautiful scenery, costumes and the amazing story with even more clarity.  The overall view of the time from a woman's perspective is so rewarding.  Most of the history movies use the lens of the victors (i.e., males) so to be carried on the wings of this amazing story revolving around a woman's experience, is gratifying, to say the least 
 During a very difficult stage in my life the Lord led me to this book. It is without a doubt one of my favourites. I HIGHLY recommend it to everyone. Why? Well it teaches on lust and the reason we are sometimes tied to others in relationships that may sometimes not even be God's will for our lives. This is the first review I have ever written for any book I have read - and I do read a lot - and I am doing so because I truly feel that this book holds such vital information. 
 Dub War.  I think those two words can give an average person plenty of words to think about.  To me it says metal, reggae, punk, and mixed.  It is just really awsome.  The way they fuse together everything is just  absolutely but kind of terrifyingly delightful!  BUY IT 
 This is one of the finest cd's I've ever heard. I have a collection of over 400 cd's (and ever growing) and I would rank this one in the top 5. This cd is to drum 'n bass what "Kind of Blue" is to jazz, the standard by which everything else is measured. Goldie composes these songs with great finesse and tremendous emotional impact, at one moment subtle, the next lush, even trippy. The singing is beautiful and ethereal, the instrumentation well crafted, and effects are used smartly, such as the sounds of ocean surf and seagull cries in "Sea of Tears" that help impart a sense of loss, these effects blend in seemlessly and it's sheer genius. I've listened to this cd for 2 years now and it never gets old. The three part song "Timeless" alone is worth the price of admission with it's slow steady build, frenetic middle piece, and ghostly, delicate ending, just a wonderful musical movement. The flow between songs is superb, the production is excellent, and the song structures are inspired. If I had to sum this cd up in a word it would be "haunting". Hauntingly beautiful 
 It's an educational book to read. My child and I like reading it together 
 NOISES OFF is the hilarious play within a play about a group of actors performing a touring edition of a British farce entitled NOTHING ON.  The reader (and performers and audience members for that matter) are only allowed to see NOTHING ON from the first act.  The first time they see it, it is the night of the dress rehearsal.  The next time they see the act it is from behind the stage several weeks into the company's tour.  The final act of the show is once again a performance of the first act of NOTHING ON, but seen from the front of the stage several weeks later.  The hilarity involved ensues from the interactions of the performers and their relationships with each other.  NOISES OFF displays that as funny as a play might be from the audience, sometimes it pares in comparison to the hilarity ensuing behind the scenes 
 A low budget film, yes, but it really works and I really enjoyed it which surprised me no end.  Once again a plot that is not rocket sciene which is good when you want something ease on the brain to watch.  A washed-up 80's pop star Paul Kerr (Craig Ferguson) who moves to Wales on a spur of the moment decision and in doing so discovers that he has a teenage daughter, Olivia, (Charlotte Church) living in his new backyard.  Olivia was the result of a weekend affair he had with her teenage mother during the height of his fame and his arrival in the small Welsh town unsettles the orderly but now very boring life of his ex-lover Rebecca (Jemma Redgrave).  We are treated to fun galore as Paul tries to get to know his daughter whilst trying to woo her mother back into his arms.  Olivia in turn is having her own problems with her mother, Rebecca doesn't want her to become involved in the music industry, her own father is an aging rocker who is always on the road with his band and the man she loved seemingly abandoned her for his career.  Anthony Head (Giles in Buffy the Vampire Slayer) as Paul's foul breathed manager is a treat, there are some great funny moments, like when Paul finds out that his best friend's girlfriend is Scottish and she just happens to be called Nessie, the scene on the motorbike when Paul and Rebecca race to London to "rescue" their daughter is hilarious, you can see the sparks of attraction flying between them and the scene in the hospital is hysterical along with the pub scene when the locals worry about the possibility of "Americas moving in," not to mention the soundtrack to the film is lovely, especially with all the songs that Charlotte Church brings to life with her glorious voice.  This is a lovely film with a cast of fine characters; look out for Joss Ackland as Rebecca's rock-a-billy father, Phyllida Law as Olivia's teacher and Imelda Staunton in rippingly good form as the po-faced Dr Bridget 
 works flawlessly, speeds up my computer noticeablely.  helps with multimedia production programs that I use on a DELL 600 
 This is a brilliant work.  Peck divides his book into two approaches. One is his thesis that evil is divided into two types: those who are sliding into evil and those who have attained it. I would venture to say that most peole who read this book will find themselves, at least sometime in their lives, in the first category. Those people who belong to the second group would of courese not be reading Peck.  The writing is concise, lucid and even entertaing 
 This book is adorable.  The pictures are colorful, the text rhymes and the story is simple but enticing.  We enjoy this book almost every night these days.  Some of the dinosaur names are hard to say, but we still love it 
 This is really a horror movie and also horrible.I can't bear to see that poor little boy hit by a truck.But I keep faith that it'll stay fiction. To many people,cemetery is a sacred place.To some,it's a monument to recall the love ones. Once,somebody said to me that he accepted a challenge from some folks to pass thru' a graveyard at twelve midnight sharp.So he did entered and walked through from the entrance to the exit.It was a forty minutes of silence thru' the tombs.After three days,his hair turned white. I said to him,I would like to do the same,but I hope that after three days,my hair would turn to black again! 
 Even though Ilan Stavans is an OED man and I prefer the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, he is still one of my favorite writers and Dictionary Days is a great pleasure to read.  The book has its origins in an improvised talk Stavans gave in Ann Arbor, Michigan [Ink, Inc.] and the essays in Dictionary Days all have a stream of consciousness, jamming on the dictionary and word theme feel.  Desert Notes by Barry Lopez and Einstein's Dreams by Alan Lightman cover very different subjects from Dictionary Days, but they're the books that came to mind when I finished reading Dictionary Days.  If the reader is looking for a scholarly book on words and dictionaries, this isn't it, but one hopes Stavans will write that book someday. [And since we're on the subject of dictionaries, I recommend that all dictionary freaks check out a copy of Glossary of Geology, Fourth Edition (4th ed) by Julia A. Jackson (Editor), a technical dictionary with a twist. 
 This book is very informative and easy to navigate.  I was able to ready it over a 2 day period on my spare time and breakdown the vacations that would best suit what I am looking to do 
 The main character of this book, Dr. John Berry, seems a heck of a lot like Robin Cook's Jack Stapleton.  In fact, this book is a lot like a Cook novel except the conspirators that are usually after the hero as he methodically pieces together the clues, are noticeably missing from this book.    Berry is investigating the death of a rich college co-ed who died from an apparent botched abortion.  Berry's friend who clandestinely does abortions (this is the pre-Roe vs. Wade era) is the main suspect.  Berry uses his medical credentials and general ability to intimidate people to interview everyone that might have known the co-ed or who could be a lead to where she went to have her procedure done.  The author gives a lot of explanation to many medical terms and the book is a fairly quick read.  I would have rated it higher but I felt that the lack of the suspense that normally exists in a Robin Cook novel where the main character has to fight the bad guys, slightly detracted from the book.  
 "Prisoners" is an engrossing book on many levels. It is a personal story about the author's evolution from an idealistic adolescent into a realistic, principled man, while simultaneously serving as a lucid chronicle of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Historical references abound, written clearly so that the reader does not need extensive background in order to understand complex issues. The writing is wonderful, with vivid scenes, memorable characters, and quite a bit of humor. The book begins in 2001, and after a suspenseful end to Chapter I, flashes back to the first Gulf war when the author, serving in the Israeli army, guarded Palestinians in an Israeli prison camp. The narrative moves seamlessly through time and across continents, detailing the tenuous friendship between the author and one of his former prisoners. I had to keep reading, and found the ending hopeful and very moving.  All in all, it is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  It is Mr. Goldberg's first book, and I hope he writes many more 
 ... and for the price, I loved 'em too.  Great for a surprise gift.  Hopefully, they'll hold up over time 
 Not a bad book, a bit of a challenge to read and that's comming from someone who is well versed in the literary field. I'm sure it makes good arguments, I'm just waiting until I can stay awake past the introduction. Still, though, I reccomend buying this book as it is a cornerstone of American history 
 Mahatma Gandhi said, "Our life is a long and arduous quest after truth." This book is a multidimensional expose` of that quest. Ronne Gleason in a masterful and brilliant way applies play by play action from high school sports as spiritual metaphors to emphasize the necessity for embracing the inner spiritual life.   Drawing from a broad range of ancient wisdom with vivid, colorful imagery, the author turns the senses inward.  It is here in the inner spiritual realm of the soul with the tools of The Work  Gurdjieff & Ouspensky teachings (Esoteric Christianity) he guides us on a journey that brings us to the questionnaire. The questionnaire helps reveal ourselves to ourselves and when earnestly answered gives us the means whereby we can begin to see ourselves at deeper psychological and spiritual levels. After answering the questionnaire myself, I know much better now what Jesus meant when he said to take the log out of your own eye first, before you take the speck out of your brothers eye.  In total, no spiritual seeker or sport enthusiast should miss the profound made practicable through the personal letters, essays and poems of this book. There are so many levels of understanding presented in it, that each time you re-read a chapter a deeper understanding is revealed. The author's gifted perception of natural disasters, wars, death and why they happen is profoundly enlightening. After reading the chapter Why Death? (The Case for Self Denial), I feel a strong responsibility for my actions. I know much better now what the Apostle Paul meant when he said,  "Walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wisemen."  Reading this book is a journey that has an ongoing life changing experience with each chapter read. It has changed my life by making me more aware of the consequences of my own actions. Each consequence vibrates throughout the whole universe and contributes to make it what it is. It has energized my spirit to work even more diligently on myself to awaken out of this mechanical vertical sleep called consciousness into the higher state of self-remembering.  Can the discipline of sport be an essential condition to the long and arduous quest after truth? Once you have read this powerful and compelling book, you will never perceive sports in the same way again.   This book with its' vast array of metaphors that coordinate athletics with the spiritual journey is genuinely  unique and perfect for classroom discussions in high school and especially college. A magnificent masterful tapestry of essays, personal letters, and poems inspired from real play by play sport events at Anchor Bay High School, addressed to the school psychologist, librarian, coaches and especially those exceptional athletic students who made it all possible, to help them along the arduous path of life in the quest for truth. It is full of every good thing, and will most assuredly inspire and benefit everyone who reads it.  I have found the book to be a friend indeed. It is a book for all eternity !  Moments at Anchor Bay High (Souls On Fire).   												-Donald H. MacDonal 
 "From Ideas to Assets" remains the "go-to" book for intellectual property executives & businesses. It is essential reading for inventors, Boards of Directors, senior & middle level executives, investors, analysts, bankers, R&D departments, CTO's, IP attorneys, licensing consultants -- anyone whose mission is to derive shareholder, business or personal value from intellectual.    "From Ideas to Assets" provides a comprehensive overview of precisely what intellectual assets are, how they work and what you need to know about them to succeed in today's competitive business environment. This is especially relevant today, 2006, when business economics if not corporate survival demands that institutions have access to critical information about their intellectual property along with the know-how and means to exploit it.  Corporate governance mandates that Boards and senior corporate management fully understand their company's intellectual property, its value and positioning ... or suffer the consequences.      This book remains an informative, intelligent, accessible and easy-to-follow resource and roadmap for understanding, evaluating and maximizing returns on patents and other intellectual assets.  It has been my experience that the biggest stumbling block to successful exploitation of intellectual assets has been the very absence of a clear-cut understanding of what they are, how to exploit them, and why intellectual assets must be an integral part of the institution's overall strategy.  "From Ideas to Assets" is a must-read book to bring about this understanding 
 I love this book!  I'm in to landscape photography and this book is some of the best examples out there 
 In the last quarter of the nineteenth century the British government was prone to regular spasms of alarm about the possibility of invasion by a European power .Fortifications were built for the defence of London and a chain of fortresses were constructed in Kent and Surrey ,and intended to be the centres of resistance to the invader .The enemy was usually assumed to be France ,the UK's traditional enemy in war and main commercial rival in  peacetime . While sharing the view of the need to arm against invasion Erskine Childers was of the view that it was Germany not France that was the likely rival and set out to dramatise this concern in The Riddle of the Sands .The book is openly propagandist in nature being written to convert military and public opinion to the dangers of German naval expansionism .It did so successfully and the book caused a hugh sensation when it appeared in 1903 .His warnings gained credibility partlt because Childers was not a professional novelist but rather a respectable civil servant ,a Committee Clerk in the House of Commons . His novel is the work of a man with a powerful romantic imagination -he devoured Fennimore Cooper and Dumas as a child -and he applied this together with a passion for sailing in a well written and propulsive narrative .The genesis was a trip he took in 1897 ,a sialing trip to the Fresian islands where he claimed he saw signs of German preparations for invasion .The book was cast in the form of a novel the better to engender interest among the general public .It also found a strong advocate in Admiral Fisher ,the only British maritime leader to warn about German naval strength at that time . These controversies are long dead and ,truth to tell ,the topical passages are the heavies-going in the book ,So ,why still read this book if all it is is a historical curiousity ?Well ,it is more than that .It is a tale of adventure ,and conveys as few books have ever done the zest and enjoyment of sailing . The two stalwart heroes are Carruthers and Davies who are on a sailing holiday in the Fresians when they stumble across a German plot to invade England .They must evade capture and return to England to warn the authorities of their discovery . The description of their fog bound journey in a dinghy through the narrow waters of the Memmert Balje is a superb piece of writing and the atmosphere of the islands is brilliantly captured .The two men are adequately characterised heroes and in "Clare Dollman " he created a spirited and personable heroine . The book is a precursor to the modern spy story and memorable for that reason amongst others . The book is no longer topical but it is still eminently readable 
 This is what we wanted.  Exactly what we wanted.   If you run a coven or wish to start one, this book will be invaluable.  No, of course its not a guide how to start a group or a coven.  I know that!  The book doesn't tell you how to do that either : but :  This book is, as others already said "straight to the point".  There is no fluff.  No nonsense.  Just sensible advice.  Sensible information.  Sensible ideas.  Sensible practice.  Sensible all the way through.  It is without dogma. Which is very important.  The last thing you want when you are taking a new trainee into a coven is to find that their head has been filled with all kinds of nonsense.  This book just cuts through all that and presents Wicca in a clear folder.   As such it is now the first book we recommend to newcomers to our coven.    As such it is also a book we would recommend to anyone who wish to think about what they are doing.  Solitary practioners who are eclectic, who have learned their Craft from nothing but books, should find this little book a valuable friend.  The authors are also teachers.  One can tell from the way they approach the subjects that they are used to being asked questions.  Their website (Avalonia) is filled with goodies which should be of interest to many reading this too. 
 I am a huge fan of John Fogerty's solo music and his music with CCR. If you enjoy his roots-rock style then I strongly recommend that you check out the following:  1) 24 Hours A Day by The Bottle Rockets  2) Chooglin':  A Tribute To The Songs Of John Fogerty 3) Banjos and Sunshine by Sixty Acres  4) Trace by Son Vol 
 I am using this book as a tool for teaching kids the building blocks, or"grammar" of Art.  The elements of Art are taught chapter by chapter, and are easily grasped when doing the projects, all which are well explained and fairly simple.  There are several projects to help teach each element of Art, and the required supplies are inexpensive and easy to obtain.  While the kids need to follow the specific requirements of each project, there is plenty of room for creativity.  This book does not teach the technical skills of drawing or painting.  It is designed to teach the building blocks of art.  It will help a child think more about how artists use these elements to draw the eye in to a work of art, and will help them as they create their own pieces.  A very good book 
 Barnes' interpretation of big A's "Metaphysics" in this book is the best I have seen.  It really was right on que, and a very easy read, which if you know Aristotle, is as hard to imagine as saying Dr. Seuss is complex.  The section on Psychology interprets "De Anima" quite nicely.  Barnes also edits "The Complete Works of Aristotle, Vols 1&2", so if you are looking for an excellent commentary on Aristotle, want to read Barnes' work, but don't feel like reading over 2000 pages, get this.    
 tom of finland has great power for manipulating people fantasies and opinions about sex.and it s eccentric kitsch style is supported by powerful  drawing 
 Y'know - I don't care what anyone else says 'bout this film. I liked it so there... :g: It was a good bit of childish fun at times, as well as a lot of drama. I cried my eyes out for those children because of their father being at war.  It's got funny stuff with the cousin and "It", which Eddie voices ever so brilliantly... and I loved the aunt.. I knew she was something special, siding with the children and helping them. I loved her! Kenneth Brannagh was hilarious as well. I don't know - I just loved it. I think you should give it a dry. I think it's a good mix between a typical family movie that has a good thing to say to the viewer and a fanstasy like CS Lewis or even Tolkien at times.  the moral of the story... wishes can't last forever... but you'll just have to see the movie to see what I'm talking about, now won't you? : 
 Severe, recurrent depression virtually ruined me for 4 years, and nothing helped nearly as well as this book. It's not just an incredible accomplishment as a book on depression, it's a model for how self-help books should be written.   It culls all the best knowledge regarding all aspects of depression, from all the most proven fields, condensing and synthesizing this information in an extremely efficient, powerful way. Out of the sea of books and information on depression, and the enormous amounts useless info, this is definitely the best of the best. It doesn't waste your time in any way, and details only the most usueful data of all.  I honestly live by it, and rebuilt my life with it more than anything else.  I was sleeping up to 20 hours per day, bereft of all motivation and willpower, ruined memory and concentration, overwhelmed with hopelesness, financially ruined, socially ruined, and unable to imagine enjoying anything,or to even remember what it was like to enjoy anything. Somehow, in some lucid episode, I came across this book, and committed to reading it just a half hour a day. That's how I began finally climbing out of the cluster of vicious spirals which had been overwhelming me.  This is the first time I've been motivated to write a review on any book -- for, while I have consistently good motivation nowadays, I'm very busy working, socializing, and studying 
 Gavin de Becker is not "just full of hot air".  He knows his criminals and was also taught a great deal from his own personal experience.  Being a victim of abuse myself, I can strongly relate to the information given in this book.  Had my family read this book years ago, I *KNOW* it would have prevented my abuse.    This book covered everything you could possibly imagine - the telling signs, how to prevent situations, child safety, and was just extremely empowering.  Some of the classic 'how-to's' about child safety are seriously nonsensical and even dangerous ("Don't talk to strangers" - really not a smart thing to tell a kid).  This book shows why and gives better alternatives.  I have been very paranoid about things happening out of my control, and my DH was afraid that reading the book would make me worry more, but it was more empowering than I could imagine.  I feel prepared and confident rather than worried. Anyone who has children of any age should read this book 
 The author wrote a column for _Natural Language and Linguistic Theory_ for six years; this book collects them, with new prefaces to each essay.  The tone is light, often frivolous, sometimes bitchy, occasionally educational,  and always entertaining.  The title essay demolishes the idea that Eskimos  have many words for snow (there are two), and traces the myth's origin.   Others contain a dialogue between Noam Chomsky (the linguist) and Spock  (the Vulcan); a discussion of perverse punctuation (which many newsgroup  writers would do well to read); a searing but hilarious attack on the  English First people ("Here Come the Linguistic Fascists"); and  "Some Lists of Things About Books" (my favorite: "Four  Extraordinarily Ignorant Claims About Language in Books by Linguists";  all four come from the same book).  Some of the humor is too  linguistics-insider to be easily deciphered, but for the most part this is  a highly amusing bunch of little articles from somebody who clearly loves  language, and is fortunately willing to share his love with us 
 The No. 1 Ladies's Detective Agency are always uplifting books in their praise of the simple life lived by its characters in Botswana. In thisnovel, again there are a couple of mysteries that are cleverly presented and solved with the focus on the human beings behind the stories and their feelings. The cases are what you would expect in real life as items that would need solving, but the presentation is what makes this series of books a joy to read. 
 Margaret Danielak's "A Gallery Without Walls" gives artists clear, valuable and down-to-earth insights on how to market their art. Margaret gained practical experience while representing the paintings of her father, Robert G. Stevens, a talented artist of the plein air school. Realizing the need especially for up and coming artists to be able to successfully launch and market their work led to her own business, Danielak Art and this great guide for artists. She now represents a growing collection of artists in diverse medias from her "Gallery without walls" in Pasedena, California. Highly recommended. 
 This book is very thorough, includes most all of the songs from the show. Chords are provided for less advanced musicians, but the piano score is quite difficult - not for beginners! Intermediates will be able to play about half the songs easily. True to the soundtrack, and all the parts are provided as well as the lyrics and details about which character is singing. Love this book 
 This book is the ideal book for absolute beginners and/or people that already have a basic understanding to build on your knowledge. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to learn about Web Design and HTML 
 I bought an HP-7410 all-in-one color jet printer with wireless capability about 13 months ago, and had to replace it because the scanner feeder is totally gone.  I swore I would bever buy another HP product, as I felt for what I paid the printer was constructed rather cheaply.  The Brother MFC-8870 laser printer has been a pleasant surprise.  I never had really considered Brother before, but because of the features, and given it was in the same price range as the HP-7410, I went ahead and got it.  It has performed above expectations.  It is very well constructed and functions as promised.  The setup and menu are much better than the HP, and the quality is the equivalent of a made for commercial unit.  I would have liked another color printer, but have decided to stick with a laser printer for home office use, given the frequency pf cartridge changes and the ridiculous price of HP colorjet cartridge replacements.  If you're looking for a multi-function laserjet printer that is well contructed and performs as advertised, you can't go wrong with the Brother MFC-8870dw 
 This book is always recommended in Brazil for undergraduates and it gives an overview of Latin America's main countries. It is a great factual book, so don't expect deep analysis of history. It is highly reccomended for  anyone that doesn't know a thing about the region and it is very simple and  clear 
 This book has been one of my daughter's favorites for a year.  We first got it from the library when she was 6. She loved it so much she wanted her own copy and got one for her birthday. Now she reads it to me!  My daughter loves the smart, polite, yet mischievous Matilda.  She laughs out loud at the funny passages in the story.  Be prepared; this is a typical Roald Dahl book, and the humor is a little quirky.  Matilda is the exceptionally gifted daughter of parents who think she is a "twit" and a "scab."  They either ignore her or verbally abuse her.  Matilda gets back at them by playing tricks to "punish" them.  My daughter says that I should warn you that your child might learn some tricks from this book.  These punishments are things that you would not want your child trying at home!    Matilda finds a heroine in her teacher at school, though Matilda becomes a heroine to her teacher, rescuing her from her own problems.  We won't give away any more of the story, but good triumphs over evil in the end 
 The DVD version of you are not alone is an improvement on the VHS version. Better clearer subtitles, much better picture quality. The relationship that blossoms between Bo and Kim is very realistic, passionate and touching. The movie gives glimpses of the other boys relationships, such as the boy making out in the cellar with an older girl staff member and later he is seen by BO french kissing and making love in the shower with another slightly older boy, it showcases the boys bi-sexual identity. Though most of the movie follows Kim and Bo. The shower scene with Bo and Kim is a favorite for me as is the final scene with them french kissing, I like this because I know very few American film makers would touch the subject let alone have a nude scene. It is my favorite coming of age movie or gay youth movie. Watch with an open mind and enjoy. The closing scene is very passionate, lots of kissing and hugging, just the thing to make the conservative anti gay crowd reel. I love it.  Steve F 
 This book is a well illustrated distillation of the large volume of books on leadership, management, coaching, project planning, strategy, budget and accounting, sales, marketing...whew!  It does cover a lot of important issues in a very concise manner, without compromising on the essence. For those who want to go beyond the quick reminders and tips offered in this book...at least, they will have an idea of what they need to look for among the countless books about management.  This book is well worth it to get the big picture on developing skills, styles, effectiveness and success in management 
 Some great songs, delivered in a low-key but satisfying and convincing way.  Enjoyable right away, but grows on you with repeated listening 
 This book is really excellent and as others, I couldn't put it down in the next few hours. I actually went to the "Bangkok Hilton" and visited a prisoner there. The situation isn't improved much, but probably better than what described in the book, at least nobody checked my axx when I went in the Bangkwang Prison. But I have to say, Mr Fellow, I know you have suffered a lot, I sympatize your father and mother, when I read about them (through your description) I felt very sad that I even wanted to cry, but why on earth did you put yourself and your parents in a situation like this? This book is a very good read, but I think Mr Fellow tried to steer some blame away, please remember, he has the sole responsibility to prevent everything from happening. I'm not saying you deserve everything you have suffered, but again, this was preventable. 
 I listened to an abridged version of this book on CD so my comments are specific to that edition.  The Big Year is the story of three birders who undertake a "Big Year" in 1998.  For birders, the big year is a once in lifetime event where a birdwatching enthusiast spends a year trying to see and document his/her sightings of every bird species native to North America (over 650 species) PLUS (and this is the key in a competitive Big Year attempt) all the "accidentals" that they can--the non-native birds who show up somewhere in North America by accident, blown by storms or just being contrary (like the hummingbird wintering in British Columbia in the 1998 big year).    The three birders whose stories are told in this book come at their Big Year from three different directions.  Sandy Komito is the previous big year record holder, taking another run at it (turning his once in a lifetime event into a twice in a lifetime one); Al Levinton is a retired businessman who celebrates his retirement by finally fully indulging his birding interest after placing it on hold for 40 years of a lucrative career; and, most fascinating to me, Greg Miller, a recently divorced and distraught guy who holds down a full time computer coding job while attempting his big year, almost on impulse, with little of the planning and resources that Levinton and Komito put into their attempts.  The adventures, triumphs and frustrations of these three men became very real to me, a non-birdwatcher, and I rooted for all three of them as the book went on.  The details of their personal lives and how they integrated their birding obsessions (or didn't) into the rest of their lives added a lot of dimension to the story.    But the real stars are the birds--the subtropical ones, the arctic ones, the commoners, the rarities, the seabirds who almost never touch land...I defy anyone to read or listen to this book without having at least a momentary urge to take up birdwatching at some level, even if it's just putting up a feeder and learning to identify the birds of your own backyard.  The audiobook version that I listened to was abridged, but the abridgement was pretty seamless, I never noticed a big gap or a "huh?" or a series of choppy transistions that can sometimes mar an abridgement.  I enjoyed the narrator's reading although his enunciation and emphasis sometimes reminded me of Casey Kasem on the old American Top 40, reading those letters with the special requests.  If that sort of reading style bothers you, this narrator might too, but I liked him.  Oh, and an added benefit of listening to the book rather than reading it--I KNOW I would have given in to the impulse to peek ahead and see which of the three men won the Big Year competition.  Since I listened to it, I couldn't "peek" and the suspense/surprise was preserved.  I recommend both this book and the audio version of it 
 Boy or girl, young or old, readers will love reading about Tiger Woods' inspiring rise to the top of the golf world. Overcoming racism, economic hardship, and personal limitations, Tiger leads the pack at an incredibly young age. My 9-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter and I read this together, and we were all equally enthralled and inspired by Tiger's story. It was accessible without being overly simple. We're looking forward to reading more entries in Matt Christopher's biography series. 
 Cece Caruso's latest biography is of Carolyn Keene, or more accurately, the women behind the pen name.  She's been invited to give the keynote address at the annual Nancy Drew convention being held just down the road in Palm Springs.  Even better, she and her friends Lael and Bridget have been offered the use of a vacation home while in the area.  Cece's only met "blue" Nancy collector Edgar Edwards once, but she won't turn down a free place to stay.  Unfortunately, their weekend out is brought to a sobering conclusion when they find Edgar's body in the master bedroom.  Combine that with the vandalism that Cece has been experiencing, and you've got a case that would make Nancy proud.  Can Cece find the clues to solve it?  Ok, I confess, I'm a fan of kid's series mysteries.  As a result, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book.  It did provide plenty of Nancy trivia, just enough to whet the appetite.  I like the way the author used Cece's research to further the story.  The biography wasn't just a gimmick but part of the plot.  The story itself is a real puzzler.  Once again, I didn't figure it out until the satisfying conclusion.  There did seem to be a few snags were the story stalled a little, but overall it progressed well.  This series has a unique premise and some great puzzles.  I can't wait to see where mystery author biographing takes Cece next 
 This book fulfills its claims.  I found useful its review of numerous alternative approaches to MS.  Clearly western medicine has not figured out the perfect response to the disease.  This book is a way to be imformed of developments in both traditional and alternative medicine. Part of the nature of the disease is that no single treatment works for everyone.  This is a good book for an overview of what options exist and whether they seem to work 
 Oleanna is a two-character piece. For the most part, the dynamics are played out in a series of rooms on an unnamed  college campus.  Carol approaches the professor for help. She's failing his course. Instead of giving her conventional advice, the professor explains to Carol his entire philosophy of education. She is offended by some of what he says, and they argue, but their eventual parting seems to be amicable, in the beginning.   Bolstered by a group of nameless, faceless supporters, Carol is no longer the nervous, uncertain girl of as the movie plays out. Her self-assurances waxes, the professor's wanes.  An intellectual sparring match where there is no absolute truth.  The dialogue is strewn with inuendo's through out the latter part of the movie, though neither is lying; it is the subjective rather than the objective element of their account which is unique to each who witness this movie unfold.  Ultimately, perhaps the question in Oleanna is not whether sexual harassment has been committed, but exactly who is persecuting whom.   Although there often appears to be a play with graduated English literal terminology, Carol often demeans the language to lower the standard in conversation; though apparently fluent in it's use.   As the movie progressors it's possible in the beginning to see Carol searching for understanding, then toward the end simply using it as condesending weapon or retaliation, in attempt to belittle and demean the professor; as she feels, was done to her and not just in terms of conversation but her grade. There is constant reflective quality of a word meaning, that within the cofines of using a word and within the sentance structure, which is acurrately used, becomes a tool to change the structure of intent and meaning.  The most annoying aspect of this work,is the constant interruption and it's not the phone ringing during critical pauses in conversation, but the constant incomplete and interupted sentances and 'Flight of Thought'; by both the professor and Carol.  In some ways, the progression of Oleanna is more like that of a psychological thriller than a drama.  As the movie goes forward, there is the revealation that Carol has filed a protest against the professor, accusing him of sexual harassment. Her charges have some part of fact, but neither intent nor context are considered within the charges laid forth. They are not meant to be real, in fact.   This is essentially a play of a student failing a class and is looking to get even, easily reflected in her attempts to document each and every word; which in its self is taken out of true context, thus proving a play on words without a witness,is nothing more than words -Accurate as they may be. Having noted that, the turning point of the whole movie, was made in the most simple fashion..."Don't call your wife, baby", one will have to see the movie and then consider context and intent of that small phrase and the impact relationship.  Oleanna is a about mind games and I would feel confident that there is the possibility to see more than two versions of the whole, in the end. Much of the interpration is left open for judgement.   For myself  I see a student, feeling threatened with failure, seeks guidance with the express intent of obsolving herself; only the situation gets out of control and that's remarkable, the movie is about control, although the word 'Power' in transgressed into the theme. In order for the student to give conscience to her appeal, she drives herself deeper into a disconsolate mood and is not helped by the professors ideology of himself and that education is his to manipulate. Neither one listening to the other, the result is the student breaks down the barriers, using her notes to have the professors tenure dismissed, without any involvement on his part officially; the professor was over confident and should have seeked School counsel.   The end result was in fact more than words, but the physical act of lost control and indeed a crime, pushed and goaded he cracked.  I'm always taken by those that subverse others with dreaded "Social" crimes, with no real merit, equally the self imposed Rightous types; we have both in this drama.  Michael 
 When I read this book I was taken away to a different land. It is about six schoolchildren who go to a school in the fishing village of Schora.  They set off on a bold adventure to help brings storks back to Schora.We see that each character takes a different approach to the project.  It's a real page-turner and I can't get enough of it.  My favourite bit is when Lina gets stranded on a boat and the whole village gets a cart to bring her back 
 I picked this cd up for a bargain, and I am so glad I bought it!  It's amazing music.  Comes in at around 45 minutes to an hour I think 
 I highly recommend this book. I have tried 4 recipes so far and they really were easy and tasty. I wasn't able to make the crepes because my equipment wasn't very good but I just substituted tortillas!! It is a little more work than I am used to in the kitchen, but it is worth it because they food is so much more interesting with just a little more effort 
 I recently watched this made for TV musical on video and then bought the soundtrack.  Bette is perfect as Rose, when you place all of the women who have played her side by side, Bette is number two next to Ethel Merman; too bad Bette never has played her in any Broadway revival.  Everyone was perfect in the TV version and on this CD also.  If you like Gypsy, this is a must have version 
 I purchased the 2007 NOVEL AND SHORT STORY WRITER'S MARKET because I 2007 will be the year. Of course I've purchased the 2003, 2004, 2005, and 2006 versions of the short story and novel edition or the overall WRITER'S MARKET for the same reason, because each year: 2003, 2004, 2005, or 2006 was supposed to be the year. I've since realized that getting a manuscript to work is not as easy as I had thought and 2003, 2004, and 2005 were unrealistic at best.   Now I don't see purchasing the book as wishful thinking. For one thing, if I do complete my manuscript this year and have it ready for publication, it is important to have accurate information regarding the publishing world and each edition of THE NOVEL AND SHORT STORY WRITER'S MARKET provides up to date information at the time of the edition's release. However it's not the listing of publishers, magazines and journals that the book provides that is most helpful--it's the articles that are included in the edition. This particular edition includes articles by some great writers. Steve Almond, author of the bestselling book CAANDYFREAK, as well as two short story collections, and the co-author of the novel WHICH BRINGS ME TO YOU talks about his transition from journalism to writing fiction. An interview with Mark Childress, author of ONE MISSISSIPPI (a book I'm currently reading) is also included as well as the stories of five new authors. The book also includes articles about writing craft and the business of writing. It also contains some specific information for mystery and science fiction writers as well as writers interested in Christian and spiritual literature. THE NOVEL AND SHORT STORY MARKET is a helpful guide for the entire writing process, from beginning a work, getting it published, and knowing what to expect if and when a work is published.  As I've mentioned in reviews about previous editions of the various WRITER'S MARKETS each guide contains practical information, but the guides are also a means of encouragement. The WRITER'S MARKETS remind me of what my ultimate goal in writing is--to get published. I also know something else too. If I find myself looking at where I can send something to be published, at least right now, I should be putting it down and getting back to the computer because I'll never get anything published if I don't sit down and write!   
 Though saying "my favorite book ever" isn't saying much, this really does deserve to be a best-seller. First, if you are new to Jurassic Park, watch the movie first, it will make a lot more sense. Now, get into this.  There is quite a bit scientific stuff going on, much of it is with Dr. Wu so if you don't care or don't know what the heck he is talking about, you can skip it. There is plently of action and suspense to go around. I assume you know the plot but if not: a crazy old man creates dinosaurs from DNA they thought was gone. He invites some scientists and others to test out the park before it opens. But a worker there tries to profit from the new-found animals and he corrupts the park to move on with the heist. Unfortunetly, the fences go down and the dinos are let loose...with the people inside.   The characters are many, and all have a distinct personality. Ian Malcolm, a mathematician, is SURE, even before he sees it, that the park will fail and he describes (MANY TIMES) Chaos Theory. The park creator, John Hammond is an arrogant old man who does not listen to the others concerns. Now, the way this differs from the book is many deaths are switched. Some survive here and die in the movie and vice-versa. Also Hammond in the movie is a sweet grandpa-like charcater, not a jerk. And in the film the kids ages are switched. Which reminds me, Lex here is extremely annoying and should have been dropped.   Anyway, this has so much more stuff then the movie did and at 400 pages, there is a lot of stuff. The carnivores are terrifying and even after reading it 3 times, you still fear for the people in danger. So now, I say go get this or at least check it out from the library. I loved the movie. But this blew it out of the water 
 I really enjoyed this movie and I really enjoyed the book.  I think it is hard to adapt a book to the screen and capture every aspect of the story.  The thing about the movie that I really enjoyed was the fact that some of the more graphic parts of the book were done in very good taste.  This is a trait you do not see very often in movies these days.  Would recommend this movie 
 An absolutely twisted and deep film. I immedaitely conencted with Lynch's dark take on the stresses of impendig fatherhood, and the visceral disturbance that this movie conjures is simply unparalleled. Lynch's first and possibly best work 
 I so enjoyed this book. It gave me great insight into African culture. It shows how people's belief systems are such, that if a culture is completely unlike our own, we feel that we must change it. This book creates a dramatic example of causing more harm than good when missionaries work to change a civilization. If my son had not been required to read this book in high school, I never would have found it, and what a loss that would have been 
 The City of Falling Angels, by John Berendt, is an excellent book.  The evocative prose really puts you in Venice.  The book is literally a feast for the senses; in that the vivid descriptions of the sights, sounds, and smells of Venice are described in great detail.  The book which centers around the burning of the famous opera house La Fenice, is much, much more than s imple mystery.  We are introduces to various characters and political machinations involving Venice.  I found the book very readable and enjoyable.  I highly recommend this book.  I have yet to read Berendt's Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, but this book has inspired me to do just that.  A solid 5 star read. 
 this cd was good the sportscenter mega mix should have been there but if there's another jock jams jock rock or slam jams coming out i hope it will be a little more up to date with a mega mix,maybe a mega jam,& a few  oldies if any 
 Hats off to Pauline Stafford for even attempting such a book as this one!  Both Queen Emma and Queen Edith lived in a world so long past, so shadowy to us now, that it is indeed an undertaking to explore their lives!  I would love to see more of the same type of work.  For those of you intrigued by these women, there are some works of fiction out there that you may enjoy:  Gildenford & The Norman Pretender by Valerie Anand; A Hollow Crown by Hellen Hollick; and Lord of Sunset by Godwin Parke 
 Very portable, inexpensive, quality product. Plays just like the arcade and is just as difficult so you wont get bored of it quickly. Get more than one because it is an excellent gift idea and you wont want to part with yours, it's that good 
 Maeniel has brought his mate Regeane and his pack into dealings with humans.  They are the alphas of the pack.  The setting is at the end of the glory of Rome and chaos abounds.  Maeniel is a powerful and very wealthy lord now and his fortress is in a very important location.  His cooperation with Rome is needed.  There is more focus and background on the secondary characters than in the other two wolf pack novels, but they never shadow Regeane and Maeniel.  Too bad this is the last novel about them and their pack to date.  
 Product is as described, good quality.  Gloves are not lined, therefore are not as warm as hoped for 
 I borrowed this book from the local library for my sports loving 2-year-old daughter, and since then she has asked me to read it every night. This is the first story I've read to her that has captured her attention for more than 15 minutes (it takes us about 20 minutes to get through the story). The illustrations are wonderful, especially for the younger set, because I can point to those things, like the different pieces of goalie equipment, that may be new to her vocabulary. What I found to be most amazing about The Goalie Mask is the way it captured her interest about the great Habs team from the late 50's, who would have thought that a two-year-old could be fascinated by the legend of Jacques Plante?!?!?!  
 I'm ordering Cracker's The Golden Age, which, for some reason, I don't own, and I started reading the reviews for Kerosene Hat. It's very validating to read that others feel like I do--that this album is pure brilliance from start to finish. I've had it for years, of course, and keep returning to it again and again (along with the 3 other Cracker albums I own). It's one of the 15 or so CDs I have that never get to rest for long. One of my best memories of it, however, came only a couple of years ago when I discovered that, like me, my cousin is a huge Cracker fan. A few months later, a group of us were walking to a free Cracker show at the Empire State Plaza in Albany, New York, and he and I started singing "Take Me Down to the Infirmary" at the top of our lungs. Every time I listen to the album, I hear something new to love. The songs are so well written and executed while sounding spontaneous and real, not slick and manufactured. I like that Cracker is not hugely popular. I don't want to share with just anybody. In conclusion, here's a great description of the band I read in some online review a few years ago (can't remember where, or the exact wording, but thanks, whoever you are....): "Cracker is the most normal weird band out there and the weirdest normal band out there. 
 I am so excited! I am a new clerk with the government. Thanks Arco you guys have all the right info 
 Hi MotoGP fans. I am the Director of Sales for Standing Room Only, which released this DVD.  First. thank you for your interest in the 2006 Review. It was one of the most exciting years in some time.  Please allow me to address a misapprehension on the part of one Amazon reviewer; that this title might have been better if developed and produced by Dorna, the rights holder. In fact, it was produced in its entirety by Dorna; Standing Room Only distributes the finished product without any modification, straight from the source.  Customer comments are always important to us, and we communicate them promptly to the actual producer. Needless to say, we want to put out the best product possible. In this case we have no authority to alter the program in any way, should it be appropriate.   That said, I think you will all find this to be highly exciting and enthralling viewing, with a close contest between Rossi and Hayden, and a large number of extra scenes and interviews. Thanks again! 
 This is a no nonsense guide without too much "over the top" doomsday portrayal.  It addresses the reality of existing without services and recommends things to store, things to have on hand, and things to enhance your survival when things go wrong.    Money well spent, even if to review basics.  If you have already done a little planning, it is a good book to have for those who haven't, and to check your own plan 
 The tubing works perfect as you would expect from Medela.  However, I received it from the seller in a zip-lock bag, literally.  No factory seal, no mention of Medela name anywhere.  This came with a flyer advising me that if I open and use the product, (it being single-user only), it's not refundable.  However, there was no way for me to be sure that noone used it.  And, it basically came already open 
 Wizard and Glass has to be the most memorable books in the series which introduces you to Roland's youth and what launches him on his quest for the Dark tower and the man in black. King will introduce you to a few new words and way of speaking. I caught myself using his high speak a couple times during this read, as I'm sure you will as well.  King's Story of a world that has "Moved On" is extremely entertaining. A Post apocalyptic lovers Dream Book! Set in the far off future ware were not shooting at each other with Laser beams but Hard Caliber 6 shooters. Roland is a Gun Slinger, a Law Giver on a quest to find the Dark Tower, a nexus point that holds millions of time lines and worlds in check. Roland's quest will sling shot him back and forth between the present, future, and Past. All of Kings Books tie into this Dark Tower in some way or another. When you finish the Story, your going to want to re-read the Dark Tower series Again, & Again to catch the subtle nuances that tie everything together 
 I had always heard that this short story by W.W.Jacobs was one of the great classic Victorian ghost stories.  I was recently reminded of it when Stephen King mentioned it in his new e-book, "Riding the Bullet".   So, alas! - I finally got my hands on it, and it is indeed worthy of it's  acclaim.  A visitor brings a magickal talisman - a monkey's paw - to his  hosts' home; the macabre dismembered simian apendage is charmed with the  ability to grant wishes.  But the visitor who leaves the object with his  hosts, also leaves their premises with a strong warning of the outcome of  the things wished for

 Released originally in 1957, newly restored this year, Louis Malle's ("Pretty Baby") gorgeous "Elevator to the Gallows" ("Ascenseur pour l'Echafaud") is ultimately more flash than substance: many scenes were filmed with natural light (shades of Dogma95?) and Jeanne Moreau's penultimate scene walking down the Champs Elysees light only from the glare of the shop windows that she passes is stunning in its simple, shadowy beauty. Paris, in many ways has never looked more beautiful or more sinister. The plot revolves around two couples: Florence Carala (Moreau), her paramour Julien (Maurice Ronet) and two juvenile delinquents, Veronique (Yori Bertin) and Louis (Georges Poujouly)...who steal Julien's car. The quartet meet only at the conclusion of the film though their actions definitely affect each other earlier. There is also intrigue involving Julien and Florence's husband Simon Carala (Jean Wall) and their participation in war profiteering in the Indochina War (it is 1957, after all). But the plot takes a back seat to the mise en scene as Malle's camera and the mood take precedence over plot development and plot logic. "Elevator to the Gallows" (a very witty title, by-the-way) is at times breathtakingly beautiful to behold: Decae's moody camerawork and Miles Davis' score and trumpet work are brilliant. And as a precursor to the emotional depth, flash and profundity of what was soon to arrive, "Elevator to the Gallows" is an important piece of the wonderful puzzle that was to become the French New Wave a few years hence.  
 To read mactans' review of the book with its glowing quotes by the trial judge (see his review with quotes from the judge), one would think that Irving won his suit. He didn't. Just as Irving selects bits of source documents and claims they absolve Hitler and the Nazis of the atrocities they are accused of, mactan gives only part of the story. Remember, Irving sued Lipstadt. He not only wanted damages, he wanted HER BOOK REMOVED FROM CIRCULATION. Talk about a dangerous precedent. Lipstadt did not say that Irving should not partake of his first amendment rights. As far as I know, she did not call for his books to be removed from library and bookshelves. Irving apologists want to frame the case as a dangerous attempt to sqaush a valid interpretation of history. Coming to different conclusions based on historical source material is not the issue here- misrepresenting source material to support a pre-existing bias or prejudice is. The same is true for book reviews. 
 This book is an absolute must read for someone who knows little or nothing about BPD. If you want to know more be sure to order this book you will be glad you did 
 Welcome to Bossa Novaville!  This is Bossa Nova music at its loveliest. Put this CD on and listen closely, sit back, relax, stay comfy and savor the beauty of this wonderful kind of music. Close your eyes and picture yourself in the pristine beaches of Rio on "Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars."  This is an impressive collection of Bossa Nova tunes made popular by musical legends, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Sergio Mendes, Laurindo Almeida, Ray Anthony, Walter Wanderley, Cannonball Adderley, among many other artists.   Laurindo Almeida shines and shows off his guitar artistry with his renditions of  "Meditation," "Girl From Ipanema" and "Manha De Carnaval" (A Day In The Life of a Fool). As you listen, you will be delighted with the magic guitar of Howard Roberts on his performance of "Triste" accompanied by percussionist Claudio Miranda. Billy May and his Orchestra's take on "The Look of Love" is also a highlight and so with the last song and a bonus track, Julie London's charming version of "Fly Me To The Moon."   Wanda De Sah's voice is one of the loveliest voices I've ever heard. Her versions of "So Danco Samba" and "So Nice" are two of the tracks to beguile with. Her vocal style on "So Nice" blends perfectly with Sergio Mendes' brilliant piano playing.   You will also discover the artistry of trombonist Zi Zentner's and saxophonist Bill Perkin's with their interpretations of two of the most enchanting tunes from this collection, "Desafinado" and "Baia," respectively.   The most beautiful tune from this collection, to me, is "Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars" (Corcovado), saxophonist Cannonball Adderley shares the spotlight with Sergio Mendes in creating one of the most beautiful instrumental version of this gem of a melody.  I could listen to this track endlessly and enjoy every minute of it.   Give it a listen and experience that fascinating sound that took America by storm in the sixties . . . "Blame it on the Bossa Nova!"  
 This book is merely a sample of Dr. King and his words of wisdom.  Originally penned in 1964, it expresses King's views on pacifism and why the time was right for the civil rights movement.  King proves to be a gifted writer as he use metaphors and concrete examples to state his case.  It only leaves reader to wonder how Dr. King would feel if he were alive today.  The one problem I had with this book is that it became redundant at times.  In order to restate a point, King uses a virtual plethora of metaphors and examples.  While I think his argument was very well stated, it read more like poetry at times.    I was able to gauge the feelings of Dr. King a lot better after reading this book.  I also learned facts about the movement that I did not know.  For example, I had no idea that the start of the civil rights movement was exactly 100 years after the Emancipation Proclamation.  I suspect other readers can also learn a lot from Dr. King and this book.  All that he lived for and taught are far from obsolete.  
 Nothing will ever compare to the poignant strains of heartbreak in this CD.  Reba was never more appealing and one just wants to reach out and hug her!!  First class offering all the way.  Every song is a jewel!!!  A sparkling jewel!! 
 This is one of the best books on Mathematics I have read recently;reading it gave me pleasure similar to I had felt while reading classics such as Hardy's Pure Mathematics and Titchmarsh's Theory of Functions about 30  years ago. Starting with a thorough and encyclopedic treatment of Gamma  Functions , the book develops, rightly, the thesis of grandeur and  ubiquitousness of Hypergeometric Functions,to then cover some of the most  important special functions known today. And the beauty lies in precise,to  the point, yet historically complete and 'multi-angled' as well as  rigourous treatment of every topic covered, with a large number of  exercises of nontrivial nature dealing successfully with details which  probably could not be included in the main text because of desire to keep  the size of the book within reasonable limits. Nonetheless, the authors  have delightfully and almost magically been able to cover a lot of ground  in a mere 600 odd pages 
 This book is very informative. It answered a lot of questions that I had about female sexuality--the kind of questions I don't even feel comfortable asking my close female friends about. I had never experienced an orgasm prior to reading this book, and I didn't think it would ever happen for me--I thought I was inorgasmic. This books points out that I was pre-orgasmic--and what do you know, I was about halfway into the book when I crossed over. I am now able to orgasm fairly regularly! 
 I think this is a fresh approach to religion and the theological world. It gives one pause to reflect on past dogma and what is really needed in today's world to sustain our faith.  I feel this book will benefit every religion and I hope many will read it.  Patrick Murph 
 This has all the basic forms you need.  I had them on the CD and was able to "fix" them up to fit my needs more precisely.  It was quick and user friendly.  When you give a person a contract to sign, you want it to look professional.  When done, I removed everything from my computer, and thereby, didn't use up memory 
 This product is needed to charge my Cannon camera.  It is very small, easily fits into purse or pocket and works very well 
 Since it was a gift I did not mind spending the money on this set. Even though I may have found it somewhere else for a bit less. It is the exact color scheme I was looking for.  They were shipped almost immediately. They are cotton and fairly absorbent, so definately functional as well as pretty 
 I love all things shoegazing and, indeed, Slowdive perfected the sound. MBV might have technically started the engine (in some ways) but Slowdive really did it justice with lush, lush harmonies and gauzy, dream-like guitars and keys. All else under the moniker "shoegaze" is merely a shadow of their sound. That said this collection is a great overview of the band. (The one caveat here would be the exclusion of "Primal" from "Just For a Day". Even though the album wasn't as critically successful as "Souvlaki Space Station", "Primal", I  believe, is the ideal shoegaze form. . .but no matter. . .)  I do think that there is too much reliance on using the studio material from--especially their first two--full-length LPs. This is most prevalent on the second of the two-disk set. I would have liked more b-sides and rare material, but overall--and especially if you need to invest in one Slowdive album as an introduction--this is an excellent gem. Beautiful.    
 A year after Roosevelt lost a third-party bid for the White House in 1912, he decided it was time to take on an adventure of a different color. So, he tossed together a group of people, including his son Kermit, and headed down to South America for a journey down an unexplored tributary of the Amazon known as the "River of Doubt." Leading the group along with Roosevelt is Brazil's most celebrated explorer, Candido Mariano de Silva Rondon. Rondon had made several attempts down the River of Doubt, most resulting in the deaths or near-deaths of dozens of his team members in a variety of terrible ways. For not only is the river packed with rapids and piranhas, but the Amazon itself is a killer rainforest full of hundreds of horrific ways to die. It's got everything from bugs to animals to snakes to bacteria to extremely angry natives with poison-tipped arrows. In fact, it's almost like the rainforest itself comes alive as a single predatory unit. And unprepared, unknowing explorers like Roosevelt and his team soon find themselves its prey.   This book is packed with fascinating information about the Amazon and its animals and people. But what's more, it tells an absolutely gripping tale of adventure the likes of which I haven't encountered in a very long time. Once I got into this book, I found it nearly impossible to put down -- I couldn't believe what Roosevelt and his team were going through, or that they kept on going even after the Amazon nearly took them out dozens of times over! It's brilliantly written, extremely well-researched, and just damn entertaining. Highly, HIGHLY recommended (and man, somebody needs to turn this into a movie ASAP!).  
 Get this book and absorb it! I have reviewed it for two publications and still marvel at its contents. This man changed my mind about the subject of peace, so give him a chance to reach you. Even if you are a diehard military person (I'm a former sergeant of the 101st Airborne) you will still see the common sense in what this man is teaching. His solutions will work, but only if enough of us heed his words and apply them. I wish every person in the world would read this book 
    This is the album what i expected from Unearth, more metal and less metalcore, sure they pleased the old school metal fans like me but their loyal base fans from the metalcore scene will be dissapoint. This album is full of blistering solos, incredible drumming and the vocals sounds really good. In my opinion is better than the "Uncoming Storm". Recommended!!! 
 This playset is great - my son loves it.  You do have to be careful with the open sides - it is very easy to fall off.  My only complaint was puting it together.  The instructions are horrible and have no words - only pictures.  The parts are hard to tell apart (the color-coded bolt caps all look the same in the instructions) and the pieces are hard to handle.  Give yourself extra time to work through the instructions and get a couple of friends to help.  Also, a power screwdriver should be a required tool to get the screws into the plastic 
 Willhelm has written an interesting take on the implications of cloning and the loss of human individuality. Set in a world where environmental factors have forced a large extended family to create a kind of end-of-the-world compound where they can work on curing the eventual sterility of the entire human race by cloning, the author explores what it means to be human, and the importance of natural sexual reproduction. The 3 main storylines deal with subsequent generations of this family clone farm.  Most chilling is her hypothesis on what status "breeders" will hold in a world where everyone can be genetically manipulated for a particular job (yes, there is a little Brave New World flavor here). Those who bear children are looked at more as cattle to keep the gene pool diverse than as the revered few able to reproduce. In the end even the clones become like cattle to those who can control human reproduction with a few twists of a dial and then use conditioning to turn them into whatever kind of human (or non-human) bests suits the needs of the "community".  Overall Where Late the Sweet Birds Sang is an enjoyably quick and thought-provoking read, with a bit of a fable-like quality throughout. 
 Alright, so I have never read this book.  I am actually just writing this hoping to knock off the review at the bottom that irritated me.  I like Pynchon quite a bit, and would heavily recommend Vineland.  I am sure that this is a good book, just haven't gotten around to it yet.  Per the complaints that annoyed me when I came here to see how much the book cost, if you have an intellect and attention span that can only handle Stephen King, John Grisham, Dean Koonts, so on and so forth, don't read this.  Yes this is arranged differently than novels you will find in a grocery store.  It is harder to read and takes more effort than books with half naked people on the cover or books for people who have the attention span of small children.  For the record I like Stephen King, but if this material is above your reading ability or mental capacity at least have the decency to admit your shortcommings and don't blame the book.  Blame the public education system that failed you or your own laziness.  Either way, go back to your playstation and leave Pynchon alone.  If you can't muster up an even slightly interesting criticism, just own up to your fifth grade reading level and keep quiet.  There are simply far too many people in this culture that seem to believe that everything should be at a level of effortless ease that a child could grasp.  It is nice to know there are still grown ups who can appreciate material that challenges as well as entertains.  Not sure if this book does that, but hopefully I accomplished the goal of not having to view the painfully ignorant review of a mind who probably "reads" Stephen King by watching the movie. 
 Do you remember the part in the movie "Amadeus" when the great Mozart played one of his operas for the King of Germany (I think)? The king said it was brilliant, but, well, there were too many notes. This is how I feel about this book. I enjoyed this book very much and highly recommend it. It would be better for me if there were fewer laws. For practical application, 21 are quite a bit to remember and apply. Five to Seven laws would be better for me. In fact, I read this book for continuing education and in my report I highlighted seven of my favorite laws. Mozart replied to the King, "Which notes would you like me to remove?" (Or something similar). Later Mozart said the piece was perfect, there are no more or no less notes to add or subtract. Well, this may be the case here too.   
  I think I was born wanting to go to sea. I had never even seen an ocean as a kid, but I instinctually seemed to have a knowlege and a love of ships and the sea. As I grew older it puzzled me that the Merchant Marine wasn't considered a viable career choice. It also puzzled me that I never met anyone who had worked in the merchant service later than the early 50's. There was also the fact that the world's biggest industrial powerhouse seemed to have so few American flagged vessels..... Well, this book explains things. You can't get a berth on an American flagged ship for the same reason it is becoming impossible to find a factory job inland- the corporations decided that it was cheaper to hire cheap foreign labor and flag their ships in third world countries to get around taxes and decent working conditions.    That is why reading this book is a bittersweet experience. On the one hand it is great reading about famous captains or modern day pirates, but on the other, you realise that you'll never know any part of such a life. Pretty hard to get a sea card when licensed officers are being "shoved down the hawse-pipe" to serve as deckhands....     When I finished this book I dug out my old Bowditch and sextent and thought about what could have been. Maybe I couldn't have cut it, but damn it, I deserved a chance to find out 
 It is a good book because it tells about the Revolutionary War. We learned things about a long time ago. The sad part is when John was shot. He said, "I'm shot!" and they took him home and put bandages on him. He was afraid. He was fighting for freedom 
 This is a great novel. It is easy to ready but not easy to get into since it is a little bit slow and dark from the first page. However, the story evolves and slowly grows on you.  I found the book a great description of one perspective of love, an unsatisfied love that keeps growing until it finally consumes the lovers.  Some of the paragraphs are great to read in the way they explain the emotional struggle of the characters.  Highly recommended 
 Man, this is a great record it moves and grooves and just suits you like a long motorcycle drive or a nice fitting glove.  Just kidding I don't ride motorcycles, but this music just makes me dance crazy with a pocketful full of soul.  It can't be helped how it revs the motor of your mind to jump on a motorcycle but the music is your engine, moving along the road and laughing the whole way cause the ride's fast and nothing stops it till you crash or run out of gas 
 The best out of the three Julie books, in my opinion. This one is focused on the wolves point of view, showing the same lessons that humans face but from a wolves point of view. Love, rivalry, interaction with different species, and disease. Recommended to anyone who loved the other Julie books. 
 I am newly married and found this book a bit disappointing.  It didn't include anything on STD's, infections, birth control or address problems that you may run into.  Because of these missing pieces it is not a book I would refer back to and keep on my shelf.  The book does give recommendations for other book that we have read and we found those more helpful. I would recommend "intended for pleasure" instead because it is more complete.    
 Although this book isn't all-inclusive (after all, the title is 100 old roses), this is the book I reach for first. It's great when I'm trying to find out more information on a rose in a catalog, or looking for an old rose for a specific spot. First of all, I can't resist the pictures (but they may be slightly misleading as in the case of Blanc Double de Coubert which I've never seen growing with the great cutting stem as shown). Second, the text makes for amusing reading. It's oppinionated, and I like that. Third, there's the handy Index of Old Garden Roses by Color in the back. It's actually a little summary: flower style, plant type, and class e.g. Madame Isaac Pereire: cupped, tall, Bourbon. Very handy. The only thing that would make this better is if it had scratch and sniff (unfortunately not realistic)...since scent is such a subjective thing (I was so hot for Louise Odier until I smelled her and was surprised to find that I didn't like the fragrance) 
 This book and The Horse By Any Other Name" was brilliant i could imagine all of the scenes written, i wouldn't usually read a book about horses as they usually are about little girls and their ponies called doll  or something stupid, but this was brilliant....i hope that you have more  influences to write a third one in the mini series or continue writing  wonderful books for children thankyou from Hannah Musso 
 This poem is a fascinating example of the poetic genius of Poe.  While it is often thought of as a poem for younger readers, anyone who appreciates the subtle tragedy that is Poe will be deeply moved by this piece - in fact, only a muture reader can fully appreciate all of its' complexity.  A must for any fan of Poe, good poetry, American literature, or just plain good writing.   Furthermore, you don't have to be a scholar to appreciate this one.  Its' appeal is universal, and its' understandability is high.  It's just a darn good read 
 The only reason I did not give this book the full five stars is because I feel there was more of a sameness to this selection of photographs than is true of most of Helmut Newton's work. This "sameness" is of uniformly high quality, exhibiting the inventiveness and playful sequences characteristic of his images. On one page, a group of stylishly attired women appear in stationary or moving poses; on the next page, the same women in the same pose appear nude.  Newton has a taste for this sort of dress/undress contrast, as he does for incongruous assemblages:  a woman lying in the midst of seaweed thrown about by incoming waves on the beach; another nude lying on an expensive fur coat, while sprawled on the lawn; cords tied in a pattern across the torso of a woman gesturing with her arm in a bodybuilder's pose.   Occasionally, Newton produces a truly outstanding photograph, even relative to his own standards; such an example is that of a woman caught mid-breath as she inhales cigarette smoke.  The sensuality of this is immediately present on viewing, catching the reader/viewer's eye irrespective of the less-than-appealing reality of smoking.     All of these photographs are in black and white, all of the women are caucasian, and all appear in attire and settings that suggest wealth and ease.  In this respect, Big Nudes is similar to another of his collections, White Women, which I have separately reviewed here. The photography is always of the highest order, and the selection of nudes is not of the cookie-cutter "perfection" that so often fills the volumes of this genre.    This is a book worth viewing and having, especially if you are fond of Newton's work.  
 This book probably should not be treated as "capitalist manifesto" a la Marx but more like an attempt to present a position opposite to famous Galbraith "The Affluent Society" (1958). Reading the book without reading Galbraith first creates an impression of cheap advocacy of capitalism and unrestricted market almost in best libertarian (anarcho-capitalist) style. But as a polemic with Galbraith vision of post-capitalism (post-industrial society) the book looks like an interesting historical document.   In his book Galbraith stressed that to become successful, post-WWII America should invest heavily in infrastructure (highways, phone infrastructure, etc) as well as education using funds from general taxation and government intervention. At the same time he felt that the government power should be balanced against the power of capitalists using some countervailing forces (he mistakenly assumed that unions can play such a role). He also noted that large companies are actually exempted from competition on a national level because they are closely linked with the state and competition is limited to small companies (and most of their profits are expropriated by banks, landlords and state). In essence he argued that the USA society is no longer a capitalist society but some different dualistic social organization that combines elements of socialism (planning) for the largest firms and government (macroeconomics) with limited "free market" capitalism for small fish (microeconomics). Many argues that GM troubles proved that Galbraith was wrong. But if you look at GM problems it's clear that it was not national competitors who squeezed Detroit.   Friedman definitly was the most intellectually astute opponent of Galbraith post-industrial society vision. He pointed out that the great virtue of the market is that it enables people who hate each other to cooperate economically. But most of the content of the book is detached from reality and looks like a draft of yet another utopia. Sometimes the level of radicalism of this advocate of "free market" suggests that he is closer to socialists (especially Trotskyites) then conservatives and from defender of "status quo" turned into promoter of a new and dangerous social utopia, a new economic messiah who preached that free market + fiat money used with a specific rule of money stock expansion (3-5% per year ) will save mankind. Freidman's libertarian-style absolutization of the market ("In Goldman Sacks we trust" using Galbraith catch phase) as well as advocacy of fiat money (he played a role in the USA unilateral withdrawal from gold standard) in a way makes Friedman's views very similar to Marxists (extremes meet), although his utopia proved to be definitly less costly for mankind. It's funny that the latest administration that proclaims "market, markets" and praise Friedman actually behaves more like "Military Keynesians" then "free market" advocates. The same was true for Reagan. Still it was during Reagan's years when conservatism had grown into more and more dangerously utopian social vision ready for dangerous experiments with society.   Freidman's arguments that planning is unnecessary and that market forces have built-in checks and balances and can do wonders if they are freed from any and all government intervention can be understood seriously only in context of polemics with the representative of the opposite extreme views (statists). For readers in 2006 and especially European readers it's clear that Friedman's views of the market are anti-historic and "free market" described in the book never existed and probably will never exist in human history. Market never exists in vacuum and always is intrinsically connected and always experience significant level of control by the government (level greater then roles of an arbiter of disputes and the provider of the currency presuppose). The opposite is also true and market tend to influence government in many ways, especially dangerous if there are large national firms which depends by-and-large on government contracts (military industrial complex). Some proposed in his book "solutions" like eliminating medical profession licensing in the name of free market are pretty bizarre.   It looks like the main problem with Friedman's book is that unlike Galbraith he did not understand the importance of balancing government power with the freedom for market forces. Extreme positions that proclaim advantage of a single social force always look extremely dangerous. For example if everything is just a "free market" why buying politicians should be prohibited ? Is not this a discrimination against free market? (the same question is applicable to judiciary). What about the danger of natural creation of heredary elite by market forces and resulting "natural" conversion of parliamentary democracy into oligarchy (like "Iron law of oligarchy" presuppose) ?   Failing to address those problems makes his book mostly irrelevant for the reader in 2006, but still important as a historical document that criticized Galbraith views (it was Galbraith who coined the term "countervailing power".) Today we face the fundamental question: at which point "laissez-faire" capitalism/"unrestricted market" and associated with it corruption of government should be stopped (and some too hot and/or crooked practitioners probably jailed) and where and when unchecked state powers expansion should be stopped (preferably with similar type of punishment) to prevent sliding of society into also stagnant and completely corrupt version of "well developed socialism, Brezhnev's style."  Society probably needs to deal with the market the way tennis players deal with tennis racket: if player holds it too tightly his game suffer, but is he/she holds it too loose he cannot play well either. In this respect "former socialist countries" were not so much socialist (the famous joke in the USSR was that any "capitalist" European country contains more communists then the whole USSR) but countries with too powerful and unbalanced by any other forces government. And it was probably the internally grown oligarchy and not initiated by Reagan arm race (" military keysianism") that eventually defeated communist party control of the state, the oligarchy the was naturally created by the state after WWII and consisted to a large extent of party members in high positions. They were direct beneficiaries of the system collapse that happened with blessing (and probably financial help) of those oligarchs under the weight of economic problems and siege of nationalist forces. In a way we can believe in the "theory of convergence": both unrestricted "free market forces" and unrestricted government control eventually lead to the rule of oligarchy.   I am not an economist but it looks very strange that an avid advocate of "free market" is at the same time a proponent of demonetarization of gold and usage of fiat currencies. In this sense his Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (often incorrectly called Nobel Prize in Economics) looks somewhat strange. With fiat currencies  all businesses are hostages of the government.  And the ability to switch money printing press to full speed any time the government finds convenient (usually to cover war expenses) provides an easy way of confiscation of wealth of people by government without any communist coup d'ï¿½tat. How stable is the world of fiat currencies remain to be seen.   It should be noted that lately Freeman himself abandoned his "monetarist views" (and that makes chapter III, one of the central chapters of the book just a historical curiosity). But unfortunately Britain already serves as a guinea pig for his utopia. As for implementing his and other economic utopias I like the quote attributed to German Iron Canceller Otto von Bismarck about suggestion of one of German parliamentarians to implement socialism; I do not remember exact wording but it sounded like this: "OK let's do it, but let's first choose for this experiment a country, that we do not care about". 
 First got introduced to Grover back in the early 70's. I still play my original copy of Mister Magic regularly and love it just as much as the day I bought it. Now if someone could help me find another GREAT album of Grover's on tape or CD called "Soul Box", which was put out in 1973, I'd be in 7th heaven 
 I used this book in a class on "social diversity" that I took some time ago.  It's easy for people to claim that they are simply free from discrimination and prejudice, but everyone has something to learn from this collection of diverse readings 
 Hi All, I studied arranging for guitar for 5 years with Ted Greene. He did integrate every chord in Chord Chemistry and Modern Chord Progressions. As well as all the chord runs and licks in his Single Note Soloing books. Teds books teach you how to play beautiful chords on your guitar and what to do with them. Yes, some of the chords are hard to play, but they can all be learned and then are easy. Happy Guitars, MidiVo 
 I read several reviews about the JJ Cole Essentails Sling Diaper Bag before I chose to purchase it.  The reviews did not let me down!  This is a great diaper bag that even dad will be proud to carry around.  The compartments are large enough to hold a days outing worth of supplies for your little one and even a few items for yourself.  This bag is large enough to work as both your diaper bag and purse while being small enough to not feel as if you're taking your whole nursery with you.  The best feature of this diaper bag is that it is a sling.  You won't have to fumble around anymore like with the usual shoulder bag that just doesn't stay in place while toting a little one on your hip or over your shoulder 
 This is a great book to have for anyone taking an organic chemistry lab. It is very informative and comprehensive, and while you wouldn't think it because it is an o-chem book, it is also very readable and even funny at times. This is a great resource and I am glad I purchased it. It has certainly helped me to understand lab activities better. 
 The matcha tea is exactly what i expected.  Extremely green, great flavor.  Keep in mind i'm in no way a matcha expert but from my limited experience with this type of tea (starbucks, etc.) it was great.  Got the product within days of ordering it far before the estimated date of delivery.  Highly recommend this seller 
 Try to name some of the greatest debut rock albums.  Let me give you one ground rule though:  It has to be from a band that put out at least five albums (so no Stone Roses, Sugar, Verve or Jane's Addiction, e.g.).  Here are some of mine, off the top of my head: Led Zeppelin I, In the Court of the Crimson King, Days of Future Passed, The Doors, Boy (U2), C.S.N., Can't Buy a Thrill (Steely Dan), Ten (Pearl Jam), Murmur (REM).  I'm sure there are a number of others that I'm forgetting.  Oh yeah, one more: the incredible "Ferment," by Catherine Wheel.  The harmonies and swirling lush guitar sounds created by Rob Dickinson and Brian Futter, the compelling rhythms generated by Dave Hawes (Bass) and Neil Sims (Percussion), it just all works, and is comparable in every way to the extraordinary "Nowhere" by Ride (not quite as great as "Loveless" by My Bloody Valentine).  Unfortunately, C.W. never quite matched the power of "Ferment" with their subsequent releases.  The best song on the album is "Black Metallic" ("it's the color of her skin/ her skin is black metallic") which soars up to the sky, floats in the wind, lands, and soars again.  Clearly, "Black Metallic" clocks in as the band's "Stairway to Heaven."  The second best song on "Ferment" is . . . well that's where it gets tricky, and demostrates how great this album is.  There are no weak or even average songs, and I could see where anyone of the others can be considered as a runner up to "Black Metallic."  Put a gun to my head and I would have to go with "Shallow" or maybe "Tumbledown" or perhaps, if I'm in a more pop oriented mood, the danceable "I Want to Touch You."  Although, last night, as I was listening to the album in preparation for this review, I thought of how strongly it closes with the trio ""Bill and Ben," "Salt" and the uplifting "Balloon" ("ba-ba-ba-ba-balloon").  A wonderful album.  Perhaps not in my top ten, but definitely in my top twenty (tied with the aforementioned "Nowhere") 
 What a great book.  It's an easy read and will reinforce to most parents that they are doing the right thing.  Parents tend to have excuses for spoiling their kids (you can't give them too much love, it helps their self esteem, I don't want them to not like me, etc.).  This book addresses all those "theories."  Bottom line: Kids need direction and their minds are not developed like adults.  They literally do not have the capacity to think like adults and our role as parents is to help shape that competency in a healthy way 
 I bought this for my 15 year old son for reference and for his information.  His father won't talk to him about sex and he is too embarrassed to talk with me.  In fact, I had to leave it in his room and he swore he wouldn't look at it.  That he had learned everything he needed to know in 1 week of sex ed at school (!)  2 weeks later he thanked me for buying it.  Still trying to keep the lines of communication open but at least now I know he is armed with knowledge.  
 Terry Glaspey grasps at many of the unique features of Lewis that other biographers have not done.  Lewis and Glaspey in many ways are cut from the same cloth.  They both challenge the reader to go into your own resources  of a personal walk with God that remind you of other great minds like  Rushdoony, Yamauchi, and Francis A. Schaeffer. The book is worth reading  more than once 
 I really enjoyed this book.  I was intrigued by Shayne Lee's positive review in a religion journal and so I decided to read it and wasn't disappointed.  I could relate to many of her findings and she quite perceptively discussed how women in the church are at times oblivious to Womanist literature and how sexism is so pervasive in the black church.  Although I don't live in the South, I really think she tapped into my experience with her nice discussions about the daily issues Christian women face.  Thanks for such a thoughtful look at both positive and negative experiences of women in the black church.   
 But, they run kinda small.  Order 1/2 size up.  Why isn't there a 9 1/2 
 My husband and I just returned from a 16 day trip, and this book was definitely worth the money!! It is the most up to date Belize guidebook you can buy right now, and almost all of it's information was right on. We also bought the Belize Moon Guidebook, and comparing the two, I would say that Fodors is more upscale. Usually, it's assuming you're going to rent a car and hire guides for your trips (both of which cost $$$), and it does a better job of describing more expensive hotels and restaurants. This is great if you have the money, but we were on a budget, so this info was useless for us. The Moon book did a better job covering places and topics for a budget traveller (like what to do if you get a GI bug--something no one wants, but when it happens, you're glad it's covered in the book!). That said, Fodor's was still really helpful because it's the most up to date, so it's maps, attractions, restaurant, and lodging recommendations  could usually be relied on (Kudos for the Fodor's recommendation for Tradewinds in Plancencia--this tip alone made me glad I bought the book!).  Overall, it's the perfect book if you are planning a more upscale trip, but it's still very helpful (4 star) if you're a  budget traveller and I would defintely recommend purchasing it along with the Moon Belize book 
 My daughter is 1 and she loves it would be nice to come with a little more food but overall it's great and my 8 year old son thinks so to a great starter kitchen..........   
 My son loves his webkinz tree frog. The website is fun too.  Very creative.  Learning and creativity can be fun.  Highly recommended.  One warning...make sure your camera and microphone are disabled 
 I love this  doll house and all its furniture. It was very average no fake looking dolls and I loved the office furniture for the doll house. We have had a lot of fun playing with it including me. It is good for my daughter and I to spend time playing together. 
 when we are looking for a new perspective to see architecture. this book is the one. paul oliver offers an inclusive, and balance view to see architecture. no more from western point of view.  i think, this is in tune with rudofsky's 'architecture without architect'.  i recommend those books to my coleagues as great and a must be read book 
 "If you contact the authorities, we disappear. You will never see her again. We want two million dollars. There will be no second chance." It is this ransom note that sends Marc Seidman on a mission to find his kidnapped daughter Tara, and solve the mystery of his murdered wife, Monica. No Second Chance is a thrill-filled adventure with plot twists and suspense that will put all other books in this genre to shame. This is recommended to anyone who can read. Seriously. 	 This book has more twists than a roller coaster. At first, you may assume that Marc's mission is just finding Tara. That is not true. Later on, it is found out that there are more people at stake than Tara. Characters that are seemingly innocent end up being convicted, including Marc's best friend Lenny. Never assume anything when reading this book. 	Harlan Coben does a good job of clearing up confusing parts of the book. After Tara's kidnapping, many new characters, including the kidnappers, are introduced, and a lot of background on these people is dumped on the reader. However, Coben systematically explains each character's motive, past, and even leaves space for their personality to shine. Take Rachel, Marc's girlfriend from college. She is an ex-FBI agent and needs a lot of explaining, especially about her connection to Marc. By the end of the chapter, it's like she was there all along. 	"The author doesn't build suspense. HE OPENS FIRE." This is what the New York Daily News had to say, and I agree. Many books attempt to build suspense, and use the same formula, to the point where it gets predictable.  In No Second Chance, you can't read a chapter without reading the next one. It has to do with the way that Coben ends his chapters. For example, he ends a chapter like this: "It didn't matter. I had only gotten a glimpse, but I was sure. The child in the car was not my daughter." This gives a sense of desperation, for that was Marc's last hope of finding his daughter. 	Overall, No Second Chance is a chilling tale of murder and desperation. Find a way to read it. You won't regret it.  J. Bowma 
 I saw this a few days ago it The Source by Circuit City... definitley worth the money! It repairs scratches and saved all of the DVDs that I used it on. So there's no other repair kit... buy it today, If you see it 
 As one other reviewer stated, this is the best book in a pretty sad category... he's right. There aren't many books that cover a LOT about learning the piano. This is by far the best of the bunch.  All books, I've noticed, by Backbeat, seem to be of the absolute highest quality with the most concise and complete information. Most Backbeat books also include a CD of examples, which is fantastic. This book's CD is no exception to excellence.  I am an ok piano player. Taught myself over the years and want to get better, much better, in the next few years.  I have been doing all the exercises in the book and can play the beginning part of Bach's "Prelude in C Major" which is one of the most beautiful solo piano pieces ever. I was proud of myself for learning it so quickly. The book helps, a lot.  It helps to know some theory, and be able to read the notes and rhythms on the staff. Most people picking up the piano probably already know that.  For $20, this book is more than worth its weight in gold. Seriously. Classical is definitely the focus, but it also covers a good deal of jazz piano technique. Easy to understand. The spiral binding is excellent, too as it perfectly lays flat on my music stand in front of my digital piano.  Pick this up and the Burgmuller 25 Easy and Progressive Pieces and you're well on your way to getting a solid foundation in classical piano technique. Also, for the brave ones, pick up Hanon: The Virtuoso Pianist. I have exercise 1 down solidly, but only at 65bpm. I'm supposed to have it smooth at 108bpm. Haha. That will take some time. Those legendary books are a nice companion to this amazing, modern piano technique book.    
 I purchased this case along with the Coby DVD 8500 portable player...the player fits nicely...but after filling the accessory holder with the AC adapter, earphones and remote there is scant room for DVD's...better get a separate holder for your discs! 
 So Far From the Bamboo Grove tells the story of a young Japanese girl that survives the horror of WWII. Although very well written, a lot of the material is not suitable for children under the age of 14.  Graphic murder and deaths, along with brief descriptions of rape are layered throughout more than half of the book.  Excellent story - just not kid friendly.  Don't let the recommended age bracket fool you.  Read the book before your child does and be prepared for lots of questions, tears and maybe a few nightmares. This book would have been much better suited for highschool and above.   
 This book was great!  I was not aware that it was a book filled with short stories, so I found myself a little disipointed at the end of the first story....for I would have loved to have read a whole book of it!  Again a great read! Just beware it is a book full of short tales of fantasy...... 
 This book is a gem. I got 2 copies and gave 1 to my surgeon whom has been working closely with me for the past 10 months as a gift to say thank you and the other copy I gave to a cousin for her 30th Birthday. They seemed like exquisite gifts....something that each of them could enjoy forever. The illustrations and the text speak for themselves; high quality. 
 Three dramatic vertices converge in this smart script: The painful stunt's death and the sad memories left behind in a famous director characterized precisely by his dangerous EFX; a murder who has been hired to kill him; and the last act of love redemption when the things are out of control and you have no time to put the things in its real context. Interesting thriller that shines by the presence of James Caan as the fallen in disgrace director and Mathew Broderick as the mercenary. Some problems with the poor photography diminish the sum of the final result. 
 I didn't expect to laugh during Tape- a drama about hostility, rape, and fractured memories.  But the dialogue and the delivery of Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard as two rival friends frequently had me laughing out loud.  Hawke's character, Vince is such a wonderfully insufferable jerk: coked-out, hostile, santimonious, but oddly articulate and resourceful when he needs to be.  When he verbally batters John (Leonard), his old friend, rival, and whom he accuses of raping his childhood sweetheart Amy (Uma Thurman) you can't help but laugh at his verbal astuteness.  Hawke's performance is awesome- spasmodic and winning and funny.  Robert Sean Leonard has less to do because his character is a more obvious jerk, but he captures his snobby elitism well.  The climax in which Amy enters the claustrophobic motel room that serves as the film's setting, kind of deconstructs, twisting over itself so many times that we stop caring.  But for Hawke's performance and the way he and Leonard interact, Tape is well worth-seeing.  
 I offer a few quotes, but there are no spoilers here. Not a review so much as an honest attempt to anyone reading this series to be ultimately happier at it's conclusion.  ... as you near the end of this book, this series of books, this epic tale that took 22 years (published) from Book I to Book VII, you will come to a few pages that beg you to be content with the journey.  You will read phrases like "I hope you came to hear the tale, and not just munch your way through the pages to the ending."  and "Should you go on, you will surely be disappointed..."  and "There is no such thing as a happy ending"  and "And so, my dear Constant Reader, I tell you this: You can stop here..."  When you finish these paragraphs, do what I did... listen to what he is telling you. Follow his advice. Follow my advice.  Get yourself a paperclip and close off the rest of the book. Better yet, if you are weak and tempted... tear them out, burn them, shred them, drop them in the cat box.  SK is right... if you have waited for 22 years (as I have) to finish this tale, there is no ending that can possibly satisfy.  An epic tale is about the JOURNEY, not the destination. I have no idea what happens at the end... and yet I am satisfied 
 I would agree with several other reviewers that this is a moving and captivating thriller!  In the rare case that home invasions occur, they are absolutely frightening.  Rourke is one of the best actors playing a slimy thug.  He is very believable and Anthony Hopkins is as usual, brilliant.   Michael Bosworth is a seasoned sociopath (Mickey Rourke), and Hopkins provides a great good vs. evil contrast in this one.  Probably not for children under 16.  
 Ryan Allis' Zero To One Million is a great read for beginning entrepreneurs who want a comprehensive overview of starting and running a successful business.  For experienced business owners, the book is a helpful refresher course and serves as a useful reference tool that you can obtain actionable strategies to grow your business. 
 If you work in the mobile communications space and you aren't Japanese, you probably ought to have a copy of this book.  It provides a wealth of data and references on Japanese mobile phone use that have been hidden behind the language barrier for too long. (NB: This is sociology and anthropology data we're talking about, not marketing data.  It's data about how people do things and think about things, not how many widgets they bought last year.)  Mimi Ito has done the community (particularly the research community) a huge service by getting this collection published 
 I interpret this film as portraying the Buddhist insight of impermanence. All things change and clinging to anything brings inevitable grief. This lesson is played out in the evolution of a family from a cohesive three generation family all living in one household to the scattering of the family as the younger generation moves away to establish their own households, leaving the parents alone.  There is a minor repetition of this theme with the portrayal of of an elderly uncle in declining health with failing hearing and mental acuity. 
 I have no intention of ever living in the country, or following in Ms. Emery's footsteps. I write historical fiction. Anytime that I need to know ANYTHING about the crafts and ways of rural life, I turn to "Encyclopedia of Country Living." The explanations are clear and to the point and the book and index are well organized, so that it is simple to find the information you need. This is an invaluable aid to anyone undertaking a rural life style and is equally useful to researchers like me 
 I took one of the Active Isolated Stretching classes here in NYC and I can tell you the book is better than the class itself. Buy the book, follow the instructions and you will be ripping off the benefits of this stretching technique 
 If you, like me, find that when you are creating pieces of jewelry you are released from everyday cares and nourished by what you are doing, then you will understand instantly what makes this book special.  I have been making jewelry for some time now, but I have never consciously tried to figure out what it is about the process of creating the things that I make that I find so replenishing.   Beading for the Soul explains in separate sections (for example: "Beading for Protection", "Beading for Good", Beading for Prayer") what it is that we are doing when we pick up a bead and SAY something with it. I was wowed by this book. I finally understood why someone like me, who has a love of beauty but also has a need for quiet, introspective time (as a parent of children with disabilities) would want to really come forward and express myself. Put me under the heading of "Beading for Healing".  The author, Deborah Cannarella, has a chapter titled that. Yes, put me there, and put this book in your cart if you wish to understand why you are doing what you do when you bead. It is a beautiful book in every sense of the word, anyway. Lovely photos, moving stories from the artists, and inspiring projects. I am grateful I chose this book as one of my New Year's gifts to myself 
 The sheep are back in their second full-length book!  This time they're in a ship. A bad storm catches them by surprise, "Decks tip. Sheep Slide. Sheep collide. Winds whip. Sails rip." That is just a taste of the book. If you like Sheep in a jeep, you're going to love, Sheep in a Ship 
 This Amazon unbox is not fully developed or has a lot of bugs in it. They should pull it until they get the bugs ironed out. Could not download all of the movie i ordered and now it is gone from my computer and I don't see how to download it again. Update: Most of the problems I experienced were with my Sattelite connection. After 175 MB they start to throttle the speed way down. I upgraded and this helped. I can now download large movies but only in 350mb bites each 4 hours. If you are having trouble read your sattelite "fair access" policy 
 'A Lion in Winter' has an irresistible match up between Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn.  Coming off like a comedic version of 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woofe?' in royal proportions, 'A Lion...' has Henry II and Eleanor of Aquataine squaring off about which of their sons will succeed him when he dies.  Living with a mistress, Alais (Jane Merrow) most of the time anyway, Henry's tempestuous relationship with Eleanor is a thorn in each others' sides.  And, while it may be a matter of taste how much their disputes reach decibel levels, it is only proportionate to the wit and laughter it provides the audience.    Henry wants John (Nigel Terry) to succeed him (someone only a dim person couldn't perceive is immature.   His voice seems so common and whiney, I couldn't help but think of Eric Idle of Monty Python fame being equally suited for the role.)  Then, Eleanor prefers Richard (Anthony Hopkins!) her favorite.  He's more well-groomed, but doesn't have the manhood.   Geoffrey is the linch-pin, however; for like many families, the one who's scorned lives by his wits.  Indeed he does.  With Philip II of France (Timothy Dalton!) having a prolonged visit, the stakes of war over succession and negotiation up the ante quite a bit.  With a script that is often hysterical (in both senses of the word) and an able cast, 'A Lion in Winter' is hardly what I expected.  Instead of some sweeping epic with pomp and circumstance, we get an engaging ensemble that delivers great gifts, even from a royal family who seems needy and out of sorts during the holidays.    
 One of my two favorite gear books (the other being Drago's Fubdamentals of Gear Design). The 1983 edition is thorough, comprehensive and very readable for a reference book. Surprisingly for an American book of that time, it covers the metric system and standards (ISO, etc.) used in Europe and elsewhere. While the technical standards used in the book have been updated/replaced, it is still current in many areas and lays a solid conceptual basis for gear design.  I was tempted to buy the 1994 edition, but I browsed through it and did not find significant additions--and the printing quality was poor (as other reviewers pointed out). Still buying either edition is a first basic step for those interested in gear design.  Dudley has also written other widely read books in the field like the 1954 edition of this book and the 1962 Gear Handbook (as editor). 
 I first tried to read this book in college -- found it boring and quit after five pages. I only picked it up again fifteen years later because I found myself out of reading material on a long, cold weekend.  This is one of the best books I have ever read. There are so many layers, so many turns and connections and things to think about. I felt high and satisfied after finishing "Foucault's Pendulum."  Give this book a chance, a second chance or even a third chance. At some point in your life, it will be the right time. Truly a remarkable piece of art 
 This is quite an interesting book. Looks pretty much like journalism in a time the concept was not yet developed. It is very realistic and it looks like the author was actually present went the story happened, when in fact he wrote the whole thing many years after. Another interesting aspect regarding this book is that it "constructed" in a sense, our imaginary regarding middle ages epidemics. The descriptions are so vivid that they were used many, many times in the movies, paintings and other fictional pieces to characterise this kind of situations. Just for the sake of curiosity, one can read Noah Gordons "The Physiscian" or watch the movie "Interview with the Vampire" (pay attention to the episode of the epidemics in New Orleans), to see that Defoes influence came a long way through. Good read 
 Philip Fisher's thoughts and experience are invaluable and timeless. Not as boring (to read) as the intelligent investors (though both are equally important reading). I particularly like the chapters about "Fifteen points to look in a common stocks","when to buy", "when to sell", "Five don't", and "Developing your investment philosophies". One particular topic that I like best is about "Don't follow the crowd". Also on "How I go about finding a growth stock"  This book also covers what a good business should have (it recaps of what they teach you in business school). I have 10 years of investing experience before I read this book (I know I should have read this book earlier), and in my opinion this book should work as a guideline to develop our own investing philosophies (and not our philosophy itself).  There are no one size fits all strategy in the investing world.  This book will also help to open your eyes (especially for beginner) that investing (the right way) is not easy and is a complex process, however the result from a patient and diligent investor could be great.  There are 3 important aspects of a business (apart from the stock price) which this book will cover most of them: 1. The Business (and the Industry) 2. The Financials 3. The People (Management, Personnel)  I also recommend you all to read Ben Graham's "The Intelligent Investors" (with commentary by Jason Zweig who will give more recent and relevant example), and Peter Lynch's "One up on Wall Street".  Once you read them all (coupled with some real experience), then you are ready to be an investing pro...  Happy Investing 
 My Neighbor Totoro is a wonderful story about what happens 2 young girls and their father move into a country house to be closer to their mother, who is in a nearby hospital.  The animation is stunningly done, with both people and fantasic creatures coming alive to make the story hum.  Voice acting in the original Japanese is great and the english dub is not far behind.  This is one of the best dubs I have heard, with the English voice actors obviously 'getting' their characters and the writers did a good job of not changing the lines except where required.    My wife and I both enjoyed this a great deal and was well recieved when given to a family with two daughters, age 6 and 2. (Causing them to buy a number of other Ghibli films)  Highly recommended 
 Although this book gets off to a weak start, after that it quickly picks up. I picked this book off of the dollar stack at a local book store and was pleasantly surprised. I learned quite a bit about Korean history and enjoyed Lee's interpretation of her grandmother's life story. Also, I see potential. I would like to reed another book by Lee 
 Moe. Dither, in my opinion, is moe.'s best release to date.  It is an album that can appeal to everyone, from moe. fans to people who just enjoy rock music.  It is an album that captures well in a studio this band's vocal, instrumental, and harmonic abilities.  Although the album is rock solid front to back, the tracks that stand out to me are Faker, So Long, and New York City.  It is an album that will definitely grow on you with time.  You'll probably find a few songs you like at first, and then you'll fall in love with the whole album.  I've recommended Dither to a bunch of friends who aren't really into the jam band scene and they all love it.  I own well over 500 albums and I easily rank this in my top ten.  Enjoy 
 I can not say anything bad about this series, it was masterfully written and directed 
 'Rewire' lays out a very helpful and thought-provoking step by step approach.  It is rife w useful 'real-life' examples, altho they are predominately taken from the executive ranks.  This is not a quick read -- you need to have your journal at hand and do some thinking and writing to get the maximum benefit 
 I don't know, maybe it's the fact that I love swirling circles of plotting, their undercurrents, and the ultimate culmination or failure of those plans.  In these recent chapters of "The Wheel of Time", paying close attention to who is where, saying what to who, can REALLY get you closer to an understanding of what the Forsaken/Chosen are up to as well as other characters/orginizations.  I don't see how some of these others giving reviews can call it boring with some of the ever-present threat of dangers coming in between Rand, Perrin, Mat, Egwene, other Aes Sedai from Salidar, Elayne, Aviendha, Tar Valon Aes Sedai, and not to mention the Seanchan.  Robert Jordan has created an incredibly complex flow of conflict between several different sides and still has been able to move the plot toward the inevitable Tarmon Gai'don.  Underneath it all, he constantly shifts the point of view of the reader around between the characters giving different views on the same issue.  Not the least of which is the seemingly constant battle of male vs. female view of dominance and understanding of issues in whole.  I for one commend the author on his ability to "weave flows" this complex and still keep a hold on the basic plot 
 I have now given this cd as gifts to 24-year-old, 25-year-old, and 3 50-year-olds. I  have received these incredible phone calls from them ALL, calling from their cars telling me this is the most AWESOME cd. The joy in their voices tells it all and of course, I am also listening to the same cd. It is one of the finest discoveries I have made in years - I want to share it with all my friends so they too can be moved by the music. 
 If you only buy one Donald Judd book in your lifetime, this may be the one to have. Beautifully designed and produced, with gorgeous full-bleed color reproductions, it is comprehensive in covering all the major aspects of his production (prints possibly excepted), including early paintings, the transition to sculpture, the late work, and the work on major art environments, i.e. Marfa and Spring Street. Most effectively, it groups major aspects of Judd's work into categories (stacks, linear wall pieces, series of boxes, etc.) clearly laying out his initial concepts, their evolution over time, and their relationships to other categories of work. In my brief time with this book, I have already come away with a much greater understanding of Judd's oeuvre and ways of thinking, thanks largely to the wonderfully didactic quality of the entire enterprise. I am assuming Nicolas Serota, the director of the Tate Modern and the book's editor, is largely responsible for this. Of the several intriguing essays, I have only thoroughly read the one by David Batchelor, a British Judd-ologist who addresses the issue of color. It alone is worth the price of the book, tracing aspects of the work back to initially wan late-nineteenth century attempts at the artistic representation of machinery, and then bringing us forward to Judd's thorough (albeit fascinatingly undocumented) familiarity with the technology and varieties of contemporary car paints (apparently his selection of [always impure] colors referenced specific automobiles, i.e. 1958 Ford Galaxy Celeste Green). The essay is full of wonderful observations such as Batchelor's equation of traditional brushes with organic nature, actual embodiments of their classical subject matter, that had to ultimately be abandoned by Judd (and of course others) in his search for artistic tools reflective of mechanization and urban modernity. Furthermore, Batchelor illustrates how the tools may have changed but Judd's concern with color, texture, and composition remained rooted in art-historical and even painterly considerations. Judd vehemently rejected the minimalist label, such label in Batchelor's view having contributed to critics' failure to recognize the sophisticated color and sensuality of the works. And finally, we are led to consider how the works may be as much about problems of painting and even (gasp) allusion and representation as about problems of sculpture. Great stuff 
 As my title indicates, I'm not the biggest football fan; however, I found Oliver Stone's film to be totally engrossing, due mostly to the outstanding performances from all involved. That, along with the movie's entertaining musical soundtrack, makes this film a must-see for all.  In regards to the acting, "Any Given Sunday" shows a variety of talent, experience, along with stars-in-the-making. Jamie Foxx is an example of the latter. His performance as brash, young, third-string-quarterback "Willie Beaman", brought into the limelight after injuries sustained by veteran Dennis Quaid, is the perfect showcase for the actor's emerging skills. It is no wonder that Foxx won an Oscar this year and he deserved a nomination for AGS.  Cameron Diaz, as the general manager of the fictional Miami Sharks, is quite good as a woman in charge of a male-dominated position. She holds her own with the more seasoned performers that populate this dynamic film.  Quaid gives another underrated performance as the washed-up quarterback with one more good game to play. James Woods, one of the best character actors today, delivers another flawless job as the seedy team doctor. Matthew Modine, L.L. Cool J, and Aaron Eckhart match him in other supporting roles.  Though her role is small, Lauren Holly gets some points for her performance as Quaid's supportive and determined wife.  Actor/songwriter Clifton Davis (one of the stars of the 80's sitcom "Amen" and composer of The Jackson Five's "Never Can Say Goodbye") has a moment in the sun as the mayor of Miami.  Football legends Jim Brown and Lawrence Taylor are effective in their roles of assistant coach and veteran linesman, respectively.  Smaller roles are assayed by legends Ann-Margret (cast as Diaz's mother and widow of the team's former owner) and Charlton Heston as the football commissioner. As a tribute to the actor, as well as providing a fitting comparison between football's modern-day gladiators to those of ancient times, a montage of scenes from "Ben-Hur" are intertwined between events unfolding in the film's story.  But the movie belongs to Al Pacino, an actor of unparalleled talent that immerses himself in the role of the "old school" coach that must make deal with a changing sports world and the traditions that he holds so dearly. When his "Tony D'Amato" cries, so does the audience. When he is frustrated at the team's loss, the audience feels that frustration. When he experiences joy, that feeling is shared by all.  If Stone hadn't had such a mixed track record of hits and misses, an Oscar might be on Pacino's shelf, for he surely deserved one for this film 
 "Charles Ives was born with his ears wide open.  The very first sound he heard might have been his father's trumpet announcing his birth to the town of Danbury, Connecticut."  During his life, no matter where he was or what he was doing, Charlie heard the wonder of music in the everyday sounds around him.  It could be the rustle of his mother's dress, the tick of a clock, the hooves of horses clip-clopping down the street, or the ice cream man's bell.  Charlie heard music in a bat hitting a baseball, the rumble of thunder, the applause and cheers of a crowd, and a train's bell and whistle.  As he got older, Charlie wrote "music about things he'd heard or seen, or feelings he had.  But sometimes it was just to hear how different notes would sound together."  Charlie grew up, graduated from college, got married, and started a successful insurance company.  But he never stopped writing his music.  "It was a new kind of music.  It didn't have to be pretty, it had to be true to his feelings...  But most people didn't know how to listen to it.  Some thought it was a joke.  Others just heard noise and got angry."  Finally, when Charles Ives was very old, musicians began to play and perform his music, and people began to hear what Charlie heard.  "Maybe, if you open your ears like Charlie, you can hear the beautiful, funny, sad, joyous, amazing music he heard..."  Mordecai Gerstein has written a spectacular introductory biography that really captures the essence of Charles Ives and his music.  His simple, straightforward text is both engaging and informative.  But it's Mr Gerstein's creative and inventive artwork that really makes this book stand out and sparkle.  His busy and detailed illustrations are packed with sound effects, swirling around the pages, in all shapes, sizes, and colors.  The visual becomes the audible, and readers will begin to "hear" the magic of music in the world around them, just like Charlie.  Perfect for youngsters 8-12, What Charlie Heard is a marvelous, evocative story about an extraordinary composer, the entire family can savor, share, and enjoy together.  And once you've finished reading, it's time to listen to some of Charles Ives' music, so that you can hear what Charlie heard 
 Set in ancient Minoa, Voice Of The Goddess is an epic novel of two lovers who must struggle to protect their island home from invasion from Mainland Greece, and survive the catastrophic 1628 BC explosion of the nearby island of Santorini. Judith Hand has combined painstaking historical research with a flair for dramatic story telling that truly emerses the reader into a time of Bronze Age high culture and a sophisticated society of Mediterranean goddess-worship of Crete as it existed 1600 years before the birth of Christ. Voice Of The Goddess is Hand's debut as a novelist and we can only look urgently for her next venture into historic fiction 
 A refreshing change from tips and tricks to fix up poor images or special effects wizardry. A comprehensive, methodical approach to getting the very best out of a photograph. Valuable insights rather than a respin of Help. A focus on the tools you need not every possible tool and technique. Superb photographs ilustrate how small changes can make a big impact. Highly recommended even if you're not primarily a landscape and nature photographe 
 Not only will the beautiful cover of this collection edited by Maggie Oman inspire you but the contents, a selection for each day of the year, will offer comfort, peace, and hope no matter what might be taking place in your life.  There are entries written by an African-Ameican Abolitionists in 1863, one by Mary Baker Eddy in that same century, another by the Dalai Lama in our own day and yet another  by Marianne Williamson.  The entries are so good I find myself using the book each morning and then turning back to it throughout the day.  I highly recommend it 
 I thought this was put together so well.  It was fascinating to see the history of Broadway from virtually the beginning of 1900.  Fabulous to see old footage of New York and Time Square.  I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in Theatre.  It is fabulous 
 More of these, Hollywood!  Quaid is superb.  Plot is fresh and true.  Realistic and down to earth, yet holds the interest and makes one proud to watch and share in excitement of pride of this guy's humility and achievements, as well as his The Owls who motivate him after his motivation of them.  Wife and parents do an excellent support job.  One to watch with baseball fans of all ages and watch again 
 Consider that there are three categories of poker books; technical books such as those that Sklansky, Harrington, and Malmuth write, "tells" books such as Caros Book of Tells, and "head game" books.This is the best I've read in the "head games" category.   The author does a very good job of categorizing different styles of play into four "corners" similar to a Gartner box; Tight Passive, Tight Agressive, Loose Passive, Loose Agressive. He then discusses and describes these and includes a short "preview" section you can use as a review before you go play.  The author does a very good job of framing this psychological information strictly in the context of a poker game. It is a very readable and very interesting book. Unless you really believe you know everything there is to know (and there are a lot of those types of people out there) you will learn something new from this book.  I am developing a few books that I will reread and use as references; Sklansky and Malmuths new No Limit Holdem, Caros Book of Tells, and The Psychology of Poker 
 I use this in my car while driving.  It takes pressure of your tailbone, which can reduce back pain (if you have lower back issues).  I really recommend this prodcut, both for its function and its price 
 While I am a big Sharpe fan, and an even bigger Sean Bean fan, I was initally against buying this set, as it is quite pricey. My husband convinced me that it would be a worthy indulgence for my birthday present. As usual, he was right. I was thrilled when I opened it. It is a really beautiful set. I respectfully disagree with the "featured reviewer" that the crate is junk (maybe we got different products?). The crate is a fine display piece, and looks quite nice on our book shelf. The enclosed map is very nice, I plan to frame it and add it to our maps wall. And I got a big kick out of the Sharpe letter opener. Get it? Sharpe-sharp. Man, I'm a sucker for bad puns. But it made me laugh.  As for the series itself, there is no doubting the quality, and do not underestimate the volume of enjoyment you will get from it (if indeed such a thing can be measured in liters, or kiloliters:). Sean Bean is a hottie and delivers a perfect performance over and over. "Chosen men? Well, I didn't choose ye!" I'd choose them any day 
 What shocked me was when the book started by talking about chaos and  buddhist philosophy. This is not a book that will teach you the basics on  fractals, nor is it an advanced book that will teach you how to run an  experiment on chaos. I don't really know what this book is but whatever it  is, it is INTERESTING. I was not expecting such a different topic base.  Apparently, this book is a collection of essays, all based on chaose but  from non-mathematical perspectives 
 In THE NAKED FACE, Sheldon gave Stephen King a run for his money, competing with King's ability to unearth the gritty emotional core of homo sapiens.  This was one of my favorite of Sheldon's mainstream novels; I've read most of those works, some more than once.  The psychological depth of Sidney's characters, exposing inner visions of various disturbances, came out with amazing clarity and complexity in this novel.  It appeared to me that Sidney understood the inside, underside, and upside of the human psyche, possibly in a more intuitive way than a practicing psychiatrist.  I read this novel in the late 80's, and I'm not good at recalling details, so I won't strain my brain to give a plot summary from a bad memory, which might mistakenly mix a few other novels into this one.  What I do recall clearly, though, is that I was deeply impressed with this novel, so much so that I continued chewing on exactly what it was which awed me about this particular story.  It had something to do with Sidney's grasp of psychosis and his ability to redeem it or to know when to render it to the fires of cremation.  I knew I would come to a time to read the book again later, and come to a catharsis with that nagging feeling of more value to be had through a repeat read of THE NAKED FACE.   Maybe after that reread I could write a decent plot summary.  In any case, I've rarely written any type of synopsis in my reviews, mostly because that's done perfectly by other reviewers.  Instead, I do my thing, which is to try to help potential readers decide if a book is easy to get into, by detailing what captured and kept my interest, by determining what glued a book into my mind so I could live vicariously in it.  Some of the reviews mentioned this being Sheldon's first novel, and therefore less than his others.  I can see how they came to that conclusion.  I can also understand how others described it as better than, and noted psychological complexity.  Most said it was engrossing.  I wonder...  If Sheldon had written THE NAKED FACE (or published it) at the end of his career as a novelist instead of at the beginning, might that work be seen in a different light?  Might it be viewed as a crowning achievement, shedding light (yeah, I'm going overboard, or maybe I have my head in the clouds) on every angle of his long and varied, creative career?  By the way, Sidney's long and varied career, is highlighted beautifully in THE OTHER SIDE OF ME, Sidney's memoirs released November 8, 2005.  That's another must get; must read, for those of us who love to labyrinth into worlds of fiction.  Yet, this isn't fiction; it's Sidney's life, which appears to read better than some of the best novels.  In fact it appears to be better than even Sidney's novels.  And, that's saying something.    I read the first few chapters of these memoirs while browsing in a couple bookstores in Grand Junction, CO, HASTINGS and BARNES & NOBLE, on 12/12/05.  Feeling similarly to a reviewer of that book, after reading a few chapters of Sidney's memoirs, I was tempted to temporarily halt a book I had been enjoying immensely, to continue reading THE OTHER SIDE OF ME.  It wasn't easy to temporarily put aside Sidney's memoirs, and decide to wait and order it from Amazon (which I did on 12/17/05).  THE OTHER SIDE OF ME, as noted above, appears to be more riveting than any of Sidney's novels; it exposes beautifully the richness of Sheldon's personal history, and how he became the phenomenon he is.  Having read only the first 4 chapters, I received an "ah ha!" for the source of his kaleidoscope writing style.  I began to see why many of his novels have the first 5 chapters begin from different parts of the world or from different life pursuits, each chapter initiating sets of characters who seem to have nothing to do with those in the other opening chapters.  In understanding how his life set up his style as a novelist, I also understand how THE OTHER SIDE OF ME explained its first chapter's event to Otto, Sidney's father, who ingeniously convinced 18 year old Sidney not to add the sleeping pills to the whiskey he had consumed in preparation for them.  I believe that Sidney will gently and subtly weave the answer to the first riveting chapter into the remainder of the book, tying the themes of his childhood into the directions of his ultimate success, and the devastations of riding the psyche designed from those early chaotic years, boomeranging repeatedly from poverty to riches and back.  A review noted that these memoirs delve more into Sidney's show biz career than into his life as a novelist.  It was helpful to know that, even though I was also hoping to learn more about Sheldon's background around his novels.  Even so, I'll read between the delicious lines if possible, seeking silver threads exposing his reasons for featuring the vignettes he did.  Those features will likely answer the main questions I would have about how Sidney's life drove his multi-fronted successes.  I was invited into Sidney's world of the novel by my nephew, Lonnie Joe Hudnall, an ex marine who was based in Seoul Korea, as a military policeman, later adding translator to his list of duties performed to precision without pomp.  When Lonnie lived somewhere he lived there, with those people, melding himself into their ways of doing, thinking, and speaking, as much as he could do that and honor his military commitments.  When he recommended WINDMILLS OF THE GODS to me, which was my first dip into Sidney's mainstream novels, I was indeed curious, and not disappointed.  Read that book twice, and then progressed to read all the other early books, though I'm happy to say I still have a couple of his most recent novels on my To Read list.  I knew that Sheldon was one of Lonnie's favorite authors, but I also knew that Lonnie's reasons for recommending Windmills to me went beyond sharing that appreciation.  Of course, as I read, I was looking for why Lonnie felt I would enjoy this particular book.  Did he see me as being similar to the woman who became an ambassador?  If so, I was highly complimented.  The only compliment I've received from Lonnie which was higher, was his conclusion after reading several chapters of my nonfiction manuscript, MOLASSES MOON.  "I was reading and reading and reading, and all of a sudden I realized it felt like I hadn't been reading, but that I had been thinking my own thoughts."  If that isn't a compliment on syntax being smooth and natural, I don't know what is.  Thanks, Lonnie, for many things, especially our fascinating discussions on, and mutual love of books and words.  Lonnie is also a writer, with at least one novel written into several chapters of a first draft, and a few tentative beginnings of a project of rewriting history in a uniquely intriguing slant and style.  Maybe I'll be reviewing one of his books here one day.  Maybe he'll be reviewing one of mine.  Writers.  Gotta love em.  I wonder if Sidney's memoirs will go the way of his Midnight novels, and split into at least a duo if not a trilogy.  I hate to be left in the position of, if I want more of a book I have to reread it.  But, of course that's a better position than dropping a novel into the fire of the coal stove after having read it, to be sure no one else ever picks it up.  I did that once; I won't tell what book it was.  It wasn't a novel I'll ever review here, since I've made a pact with myself to review only books good enough to rave with 5 stars, as I wish upon them for more.   I feel somewhat guilty "coping out" like that, since that leaves the task to other reviewers to expose those books which might not be worth reading, or to expose the dull or drag parts in otherwise good reads.  My problem isn't a matter only of being too sensitive to criticize publically; it's that every book has great value to certain readers at certain times.  I don't feel qualified to know what's truly bad, or why.  I'm still learning what's good and why.  Speaking of rereading to get more.  A few years ago, my Mom and a friend and I were on the way to Santa Fe.  I was driving my Mom's 67 Ford Galaxy; the friend was reading my sci fi ms, MORNING COMES.  Reaching the -30- at the end of the last page, I believe it was page 400-something, the friend screeched, "Oh No!!"  My stomach gathered into granite, "Did she just read something she hated?  Did she hate the ending?"  I didn't have to ask.  "It CAN'T be over!  I don't want this book to end!"  She immediately flipped to the first page and began again, her scowl smoothing into a smile as she continued rereading and I continued driving southwest to visit Sunstone Press.  Returning to a True Master of That Game, I should note that I see differences between Sidney's early novels and his later ones, all great, just subtly different in feel.  I won't get into detail on that; I merely wanted to state the opinion and run.  In closing, I'll mention that Sidney's Midnight novels stay in my mind as being the most engrossing and complexly satisfying reads in his collection.  Can't wait to get my hands on my personal copy of THE OTHER SIDE OF ME,  Linda Shelnutt  P.S. Also ordered the hardback of Nicholas Spark's TRUE BELIEVER.  Looking forward to rereading in easy chair plush the installments I read riveted to the book shelves in my local Wal Mart during a series of grocery hops (see my review on TRUE BELIEVER and its companion review on Stephen King's MISERY) 
 This series just gets better and better, i can't elude too much into it because i would want to beat the ... out of me if i posted spoilers so i'll leave that to the others, but anyway, in recap neotokyo has just been obliterated and now akira that lovable little imperialistic munchkin is preparing to rule over the now crumbled city, but what next you ask well you will just have to read it for yourself 
 I, like many people, started praying when I was old enough to talk.  I vividly remember my favorite Aunt teaching me the "now I lay me down to sleep" prayer when I was about 3 or 4 - and I said this prayer every night before bed until I was old enough to come up with my own.  Although I prayed every night, I never really thought about whether or not my prayers would be answered - I guess I just assumed they would be.  That was until I became an adult, and began to realize that some were not being answered at all.  Of course, I realized afterwords that the "unanswered prayer" is sometimes a blessing in and of itself!  This book helps explain why some prayers are answered and others are not, and shows through scientific evidence that there is in fact power in prayer.  This is an amazing breakthrough, as we are now facing a time when prayer is being banned in all of our schools - and yet it's being shown that prayer can be an amazingly wonderful & powerful force.  This book also raises some of the issues that may await our physicians now that it has been shown that prayer can in fact help to heal the sick.  Will there be malpractice law suites if a dr. chooses not to pray for his/her patients?  Will people who don't want to be prayed for sue their doctors who have prayed for their health?  These are quite scarey questions!  Also, what about the people who choose prayer INSTEAD of western medicine?  Are they really making the right choice?  According to Dr. Dossey, the best route to take when faced with medical crises is to use all that is available to us - western medicine, alternative medicine, AND prayer - no one of these is mutually exclusive.  The most important finding though, in my opinion, is that prayer has been found to be equally effective regardless of one's religious beliefs.  Although this finding has upset fundamentalists, I think it's a step in the direction of tolerance towards those who espouse beliefs that are different than our own.  In this respect, as well as other's, this book has the potential to "change the world"...   I would recommend this book to everyone in the health profession, those suffering ill health, and anyone who is just plain interested in the power of prayer.  The scientific evidence is out, and it appears that prayer has an amazing power - why not utilize this power to help yourself and your fellow man?  
 This book is an interesting read, even for someone with no aspirations to write a novel.  The deconstruction of the mysterious writing process is fascinating.  Elizabeth George takes the process apart and explains step-by-step just how she creates characters and settings and how her novels grow from there.  The examples from her own novels and others help to illustrate her points and make this a completely engrossing book 
 This was a fantastic book. Richard Preston did an even better jobe than in the Hot Zone, and wrote a wonderful suspense novel. The graphic scenes that he adds in the book make it very intesting and easy, though not always pleasant, to imagine. The book starts out so well, and doesn't let down, staying interesting and exciting the whole book, as you don't ever know what is going on or who will die next. By using a lot of facts, and doing lots of research on biological weapons, and the such, he was successful in creating a very real life fiction story of some unsuspecting, seemingly unrelated vicims of a horrific crime. It was so real, it makes you really think that it is possible, and could really happen, and with biological warfare on the rise in today's world, seems like a very relevent topic. He even adds a little humor, and emotion to the drama and suspense that makes for an overall good book 
 Pobre Ricardito: Este "pichiruchi" (un mal pagado traductor) ama a una chica cuyo nombre verdadero ni siquiera se enterará hasta muy tarde en su vida.   Pero despacio: La historia de amor ya comienza en el verano de 1950 en el distrito limonense de Miraflores dónde el niño bueno (Ricardo) se enamora de la niña mala quién por aquel entonces aún se llamaba Lily. Pero no dura mucho tiempo el romance. Ricardo se va a Paris para trabajar como traductor y interprete. Pero - ¡que sorpresa! - la niña mala, ahora convertida en la camarada Marxista Arlette, también se encuentra allá. Comienza otra breve romance hasta que la niña mala se fue a Cuba.   Después de su regreso a Francia a la niña mala le gusta mudarse de nuevo  y se encontrará en Londres durante la era de los hippies. ¿Y quién crees le seguirá a la niña mala hasta allá? Sí, claro: Ricardo. No voy a continuar aquí para no revelar demasiado, pero claro, hay algún punto en que cambiará drásticamente toda la historia...   Es una historia sobre traición, obsesión, decepción, una ambición desmesurada y sobre todo sobre las muchas facetas de amor. Ricardo es una persona típicamente pequeñoburguesa y la niña mala es una persona que aspira mucho a la felicidad económica. Qué va a ganar: ¿el dinero o el amor? ¿Qué crees?  Creo que hay gente - como yo - a quién le gusta muchísimo leer este libro; pero posiblemente haya otro tipo de gente a quién no le va a placer mucho ésta ultima novela del hombre más famoso de Arequipa (la ciudad blanca de Perú). El razón es que Travesuras de la niña mala es un libro bastante diferente a los demás de Vargas Llosa.   Escrito en el estilo clásico de las love-stories del siglo XX, MVLL me sorprendió grandemente con esa novela. Como ya mencioné antes, yo amo este libro. Muchas gracias Mario por ésta excelente novela 
 Josh Kelley's cd Almost Honest is one of the best I've heard in awhile. He has a little bit of something for everyone to enjoy. I know its on heavy repeat in my apartment 
 Mr. Rogers addresses this milestone so well because he sees things from a child's perspective. He then discusses the topic in a way in which the child can understand and relate.  He does not oversimplify and gloss over  the child's experience.  He addresses the sensations that a child may  experience, for example, noting that the potty seat may feel cold and hard  at first, but it soon feels better.  Or that sometimes the water is noisy  when the toilet is flushed.  He also addresses what the child may feel  emotionally.  He alludes to the sense of pride at accomplishing a new skill  on the way to growing up.  But he also acknowledges that sometimes there  are setbacks.  This prepares a child not to feel defeated or like a failure  if (when) he or she has an accident.  I think Fred Rogers must have been  practicing emotional intelligence techniques before it became a well known  approach.  Again, Mr. Rogers was ahead of his time, and is the most  relevant source for exploring new experiences on the way to growing up 
 I encountered this work by Wally Lamb through an English Literature course in college. And I was shocked, after reading an excerpt that my professor had posted for us, that the writer was indeed a man. I was impressed by his sensitivity to the story of a young woman coming of age, despite her size and her completely mental mother. Granted there are bits and pieces that are seemingly fanatical (we're dealing with a piece of fiction here), the overall concept of the story is incredibly touching as a call for women all over to learn to love and accept themselves despite the odds. It is a refreshing narrative in a sometimes bleak world of feminist works. And can I add once again, it's a female perspective SUCCESSFULLY written by a man!! Love it. 
 "Honest John Turley" (rhymes with Burly), mayor of Slackjaw Kansas, opens Double Wonderful with a "Modest Proposal" to some of the worst villains the Wild West has to offer, including Cole Younger, John Wesely Hardin, the Dalton Boys, Black Bart (a name the criminal Charles E. Boles took from a dime novel), and several others:  "I realize you've got a lot of robbing to do... so I won't bother you.  I just wanted to let you know that the town is completely at your mercy.  The bank is right there.  Or you can rob the jewelry store first.  If you're worried about the law, don't be.  We buried our sheriff last week up there on Sheriff Hill." (pp2-3)  Slackjaw is located near the surrealistically perfect Double Wonderful ranch.  The locals can't stand the owners, Buck and Betty, because they have everything the townsfolk crave: fame and fortune.  Unfortunately, the locals have absolutely no talent, and as Gore Vidal once observed: "Having no talent is no longer enough."  Enter Ned Buntline (the real nom de plume of Edward Zone Carroll Judson, the originator of the dime novel [and the survivor of a lynching]):  "I'm not going to make one of your famous: I'm going to make all of you famous. I'm going to tell the world that Slackjaw Kansas is the home of the drunkest town drunk, the most law enforcing sheriff, the most accommodating prostitute, and the most... uh... prescriptive druggist in the whole United States. You're all champions, the best at what you do." (pg. 40)  After a misguided governmental "might makes right" takeover, Buck and Betty invoke an even mightier might to give Slackjaw a complete "do-over," bringing this swift little satire to a Double Wonderful conclusion 
 My son is a train fanatic. We bought this book for him when he was a year old. He wanted it read to him constantly and before too long, we all knew it by heart! The book has fallen apart after 4 years of constant reading, carrying and as a bedtime companion. We would recommend Trains to anyone who has a child interested in these huge machines! We are going to get another copy of the book for our youngest son 
 This is a luminously compassionate and brilliant novel/poem that on some intuitive level rings "true." It's NOT about madness. It's about love, wholeness, and the *collective amnesia* in our times. It's about  transitioning from one Age to the next. In this novel, Lessing's images  sing. One needs sunglasses and sunscreen just to read her 
 This book described my work environment to a "T". You can drive yourself dizzy motivating your employees with certificates, gifts, or money and they still don't perform to your expectations. 365 Ways To Motivate And Reward discusses the motivators, which drive a person to work. The book advises managers to fit recognition to their staff's motivators. Helpful surveys, provided in the book, can reveal employees' motivators and guide you to the appropriate form of recognition. It further stresses that recognition begins with daily interaction. The tips for recognition that the book provides are mind-boggling. Tips range from one-year of dog food to senior management washing employees' cars. It seemed silly to me at first, but these suggestions beat a boring certificate and they probably make a bigger impact. It is a chore getting educated on the book's theories and putting its practices into action, but it's worth the effort if it results in better productivity and smiling employees 
 I found this book truly lovable.  The message is clear.  My child (4 years) loves it.  He says he's lovable too :)  I found it quite simple to read and very clear.  I enjoy reading this to my child just as much as he enjoys listening and taking part 
 What more can you expect from book that covers it all? Don't waste time in seminars - read this book and get started. This book covers it all. A must read a anyone who is seriously interested in CRM. I really liked the  real-world examples, since they give you an idea what it takes to implement  a CRM program 
 This is a real page turner for those military brats trying to come to terms with who they are and why.  There are so many answers to your nagging quesions (and questions you didn't even know you had).  Like others who have reviewed this book I laughed (at both myself and my family) and cried.   My conclusion at the end of the book is that, yes, military brats have obstacles to overcome that most civilian kids don't.  How many kids besides military brats are told and know that their dad's job is more important than they are??  I also was able to see the obstacles my parents overcame having kids in a military setting.  I realized they did a much better job raising us than I gave them credit for.  Must read as far as I'm concerned.  Signed,  A Proud Air Force Brat! 
 This book is an excellent source for defending the Pretribulation Rapture.  My only problem is that I purchased a used copy of the book and it was an older edition so it didn't have the expanded details like the latest edition.  If you purchase this book, buy it new so you have the latest and greatest.  I may well do that since I find the edition I have to be a good source.  I can only imagine the latest edition is even better 
 The Mayor of Casterbridge is a superbly crafted tale of youthful folly and the futility of repentance.  Set in the early Victorian Wessex beloved of Hardy, the time and place still speak to audiences more than a century after the novel was written.  The title character commits one huge act of drunken folly in his youth, to his eternal regret.  He seeks to put it behind him and become a pillar of his community.  But the consequences of his deed come back to haunt him and one by one he is stripped of all that he holds sacred and dear.  The prose is so vivid and the tragedy of the ending so great that it is like being pierced with hot and cold daggers again and again as one reads the last fifty pages or so.  Vivid characterization, realistic deeds, thought, and dialogue, and graphically depicted settings all combine to make this one of the finest novels in the English language.  Even if you are not a Hardy fan, this novel is a must-read!  The many TV movies and mini-series do not do it justice! 
 This book introduced me to Logsdon work.  I've since read it over several times.  He speaks what he thinks with no varnish of correctness.  Incredibly refreshing these days.  Covers apsects of rural society in the  modern world.  For an outsider that wishes to gain some perspective on the  "problem" and the promise of rural America this is a great place  to start and finish up 
 In "America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960's," Maurice Isserman and Michael Kazin effectively summarize a painfully divisive yet enlightening decade in our nation's history. By focusing on political,  cultural, and economic changes wrought by both the liberal and conservative  camps, Isserman and Kazin give a comprehensive and objective account of the  1960's.      The authors begin by making an interesting point by comparing  the sweeping changes wrought by the Civil War with that of the 1960's and  make the assertion that both periods had much in common with how they both  changed and divided America.  In the 1950's, America enjoyed both an  economic and diplomatic prosperity in the wake of World War II. The average  family income increased and the "affluent society" which arose  out of it ironically became an identifying factor in causing much of the  political and social divisiveness prevalent in the 1960's. The authors'  examination of the civil rights movement and the beginnings of the Vietnam  War can be seen as by products of the liberal tendency to view the  prosperity of the 1950's as unequal and leaving out the margins of both the  poor and non-white population. The Vietnam War was a casualty of American  overconfidence in its role in world affairs in the wake of the  anti-communism of the 1950's.  Isserman and Kazin effectively balance the  issues of womens' rights, civil rights, the student movement, and the  counterculture and examine their role in both liberal and conservative  politics. The authors assert that the Right gained more popularity among  voters after the tumultuous years from 1965-1968. Religious life was also  transformed in that many liberals questioned established religion and  conservatives sought to reassert the morals and values of religion into the  national culture.      As a result of the 1960's, American political and  social life was divided but,at the same time, more positively varied. Newly  recognized social groups (gays, minorities, and women) gained more  political and social clout and the conservative Right benefitted in the  sense the New Left further proved to divide Democratic politics.    This  book is a must read for anyone to have a good comprehensive overview of the  1960's. My only problem with the book was its length (a little too short)  but perhaps the short bibliographic essay at the book will inspire the  reader to learn more than what the authors covered in the book. Overall, a  must for a 60's historian's bookshelf 
 STREET CORNER TALKING is Savoy Brown's best album ever. The earlier albums featured extraneous elements, such as horns, but this album is pure, unadulterated Savoy Brown guitar boogie. Dave Walker was a great replacement for Dave Peverett, and Kim Simmonds's guitar playing here is great. Any serious fan of rock & roll should own this one 
 I saw this movie on Tivo the other day and I thought it was funny and granted it is kinda stupid in some parts but when you watch these kind of movies no matter how good or bad they are you expect to see this kind of thing. My favorite part was the 3 fake tenors singing "In The Navy" by the Village People.  I actually liked it better than Naked Gun 2 1/2. I'm also getting the Police Squad series when it comes out 
 This was my first Daisy Dalrymple Mystery.  I picked it up at the library...would you believe...because I liked the cover!  It was an enjoyable read, free from all the nasty, gory details that so many mystery novels offer today.  Daisy books are dripping in history, lightheartedness, and intrigue.  What an amazing combination!  I have bought three of my own in this series and will definitely get more!  By the way, I have discovered that the cover art is great on ALL the Daisy novels.

 Milan3 introduced a very excellent further reading in the review. Morre Barrington's work, of course is more original for political sociology as he is Skocpol's teacher. However, at least to me, Skocpol's comparative study is more interesting and more easy to read for new comers. Surely, no single book can cover all elements in such a wide field. "people" seems essential and important in studying political sociology, but not just a minor detail. I agree to Michael Springfield, Skocpol already expresses her views convincingly and with conviction, especially on "people"'s role in revolution. anyway, I enjoy discussing with Milan3 and Michael Springfield here and thank you 
      Wide Sargasso Sea is an excellent novel. The author, Jean Rhys, tells the story of Antoinette "Bertha" Cosway Mason, the insane wife of Rochester in Jane Eyre. You will learn of Bertha's childhood, honeymoon with Mr. Rochester, and read a short section about her days in Thornfield Hall. The story drags a little in the second part, but overall the story flows very well. If you read and enjoyed Jane Eyre, I believe you will find Wide Sargasso Sea very interesting. 
 I think it's very sexy and quite well done.  Very enjoyable 
 Really just a wonderful introspective into the realm of the biotechnology sector. The writing style is excellent, entertaining, and very analytical. He does a fantastic job of illustrating the scientific challenges that make biotech unique. My favorite chapter in the first section (Section I) entitled, "The Science of the Business" was chapter 4, "Drug R&D and the Organizational Challenges". Here, he explains quite remarkably the differences between Drug R&D and other high tech industries, which he breaks down into the terms of "modularity" and "integrality"; just fantastic!  The second section (Section II) discusses, "The Business of the Science" which is equally interesting. In this section my favorite chapter was chapter 6, "The Performance of the Biotech Industry: Promise Versus Reality". Here he explores the financial and operational issues pertaining to the sector.  I think manager/mba-types will like this second section. What I can say is that I learned quite a bit from this second section including info on raising capital (e.g. IPO, Partnering, licensing, etc.), and much about "the monetization of Intellectual Property".  Overall, I must say this is - IMHO - an unbiased expose on the biotech sector. In order to truly understand its history, its unique challenges, one should strongly consider this book b/c it hinges upon a number of terrific concepts that need to be discussed and illustrated for the unaware. The author assumes the reader knows nothing, so pretty much anyone with a penchant for biotech will enjoy. I learned a lot from this book and it was fun too. Five star rating all the way 
 This book is full of beautiful patterns with the great detailing that make lace knitting so enjoyable.  Some of the book is not written out line by line, the patterns are adaptable and flexible.  If you are looking for a great resource book with patterns that will get your mind working, this is the book for you.  If you're wanting straight patterns to follow then you might want to pass this one up for now.  Definitely a great addition to any lace knitters library 
 When I first listened to this CD, I have to admit I turned it right off. I was brand new to Modest Mouse; I had only heard their 'Good News' cd and this older, rougher, less popish Modest Mouse did not appeal to me. It sounded too 'screechy', too noisy, just not something I could deal with. This is because sometimes Isaac's voice just needs some getting used to. He can sing low, but he seems to enjoy singing very high, and some people just can't get used to that.  Thankfully I have adapted, and all of his words are sweet music to me.  This CD isn't for anyone who, like myself at once, have only heard the 'Good News' CD. Please go try 'Moon & Antarctica' first. In fact, it's really best to do all the CDs backwards. Doing this allows you to 'ease' into Modest Mouse's older music. And my god is it worth it.  Their lyrics are beautiful, the songs are great, and to be honest almost everything of their old songs are so much greater than their newest CD. This CD has some highly addictive songs with catchy lyrics and funky beats that just make you want to sing along, provided you can catch all the words your first listen-through.  So while this CD is not for everyone, it is definitely something you should look into if you think you have gotten comfortable with Modest Mouse's older sound. If you can get past that, then this CD is a gem 
 Kathy's books are my favorites, and I will always rush out to buy anything she writes. This was a fast read, and it kept you guessing thru the entire book. She brings her ex-husband into this one. She is the real deal! 
 I ordered the product not knowing anything about this website or how secure it was.  I was amazed!  The turnaround was much more than I expected and the product was not at all damaged.  Since then I have ordered about 5 or 6 more CD's and am also amazed at how fast the turnaround is.  I would recommend this website to anyone!  
 I bought this book just over one year ago and I refer to it occasionally for the thrill of understanding quantum physics from a laymans nonmathematical viewpoint.  There is no better book on the history of this branch of physics -- multiple sidebar illustrations and photos add to the "people" dimension of physics.  The reader rides this thrill too and gets insight into Nobel winners and the contraptions used in experimental physics.  The "New" in the title refers to an updated version of the book, providing confidence to the reader that the quality of the first book warranted an update by the publisher.  This book should supplement any math based quantum physics course simply because the latter don't profile scientists as real people or have enough historical context.  For nonphysicists, this is a great read, worthy of a long lasting presence on the family bookshelf 
 The sexual revolution is over, wrote an old revolutionist named P.J. O'Rourke, and the microbes won.  This book, by an SF journalist now dead from AIDS, tells how the microbes won the war. Author Randy Shilts tells the story of all-night all-day playgrounds on America's left coast and of the way those bath houses and bent brothels became incubators for retroviruses.  AIDS wasn't the gay plague, Shilts reports.  It was the 4th or 5th gay plague, nurtured by a radicalized and sexualized subculture that had blown out of Stonewall's closet.  Gay sexual activists took it for granted, writes Shilts, that an indulgent and helpful society would always find a magic bullet for their promiscuously transmitted diseases.  When the magic bullet for a strange plague of the early 1980s didn't magically appear, sexual athletes did what any normal hot-blooded Americans would do:  they blamed Reagan. Mr. Shilts in his book was judicious about the blame game.  His scorn for bath house behaviors & for blood banks is loud & clear; cheap-shotting of Reagan is muted.  Reagan, after all, had other wars and a rocky post-Carter economy on his hands.  By the time Mr. Shilts' book became a tv mini-movie, however, Reagan moved to the front and center as its designated villain.  If only he had uttered the name of the sickness that dared not speak its name, thousands and millions and billions of us would have been saved ... after all, we are now told, we all have AIDS.  (Ponder what Reagan might have said if he'd been convinced by Koop or somebody to speak the name of AIDS in 1982 or 1983:  Well, as your mothers probably should have told you ... Reagan, being a realist, understood that AIDS in America was/is overwhelmingly a behavioral disease.) Read And the Band Played On in tandem with Dragon Within the Gates by Stephen Joseph, former health commissioner of New York City and former Clintonista.  These books, together, are the best war reporting of the recent past.  They show how microbes won the war, and how microbes then won civil rights.     
  Source Direct were key in defining the technical, breaks driven sound of the mid-90's. Possibly th most sorely missed producers of that era who hung it up a year or so after the release of Exorcise the Demons.  Jim returned in 1999 and even resurrected the SD imprint for  a run that included the stomper "Yo Bitch" as well as   a few others.  It was really the labels original series of tunes (Snake style, etc)that pushed the SD sound at its peak. THe platinum breaks selection and subsequently Controlled Developments showed a maturing process which extended to 'Exorcise'.  Most fans agree that though SD pushed forward, the prime of their sound is stil the tunes they made from 94-96, Controlled being the only easily obtainable record 
 9.3 STARS OUT OF 10!!!  Stephen King released The Dead Zone directly after his greatest book, the epic, magnificent, The Stand.  It would have been easy to come back down to earth after the last work of art, but not in this case.  While 800 pages shorter then the Stand, the Dead Zone packs quite a punch.  Forget about the plot twists and different themes.  The best part of this story is the hero Johnny Smith and his endeavors.  First year teacher Johnny Smith has everything going for him.  Loving parents, an awesome girlfriend, and a pretty good job he excels at.  Suddenly, a vicious car accident puts him in a four year coma, and when he wakes up things have changed.  Nixon is no longer President, his girlfriend has moved on, his father is broke due to Johnny's hospital bills, and his mother has become a religious freak who is pretty close to the loony bin.  Oh yeah, Johnny also has phychic flashes sometimes when he touches people where he can see the future.  I feel like I may have already spoiled too much so I will leave it at that, but Johnny's story at times is bittersweet, happy, sad, tragic, and grueling.  One of King's better books 
 The field of cultural criticism can be difficult to approach.  Madan Sarup's book provides exactly what the title states, an excellent introduction to Post-Structuralism and Postmodernism.  His coverage of the critics and philosophers who espouse these schools of thought serve as a solid foundation for further studies.  His comparisons of the theories of different authors was especially helpful, as was his treatment of the feminist critics, who seem to be often overlooked 
 I am a big fan of Mr. Philbrick, having thoroughly enjoyed his unforgettable story of the Essex, "In the Heart of the Sea."  That book still occasionally keeps me up at night, as I try to imagine what it was like on that whaleboat when Capt. Pollard watched his own nephew draw the short straw as the Captain and crew resorted to the "custom of the sea."  So I eagerly looked forward to his "Sea of Glory", and to learning about an expedition that is largelly ignored in most history texts.  I found this book to be a very informative and engaging read, and would probably give it 4 1/2 stars if I could, but I must say I was a little underwhelmed with the passages of the book detailing the post-expedition proceedings, including the court martials.  The U.S. Exploring Expedition, or "Ex. Ex." as it was known, was truly a mammoth undertaking.  Lieutenant Charles Wilkes, a surveyor with little command experience and even less true sailing ability, was put in charge of an ambitious 3-4 year project in which he was to chart the dangerous islands and coral reefs of the South Pacific, explore the antarctic (and determine whether a continent truly existed at the south pole)and then chart the pacific northwest including the treachorous waters of the Columbia River.  The glimpses provided by Mr. Philbrick of the Samoan and Fiji Islands, the excursion to the top of Hawaii's great active volcano, and the incredibly dangerous exploration of Antarctica were very readable and engaging.  Philbrick does a very good job of putting the expedition in context, pointing out the fact that San Francisco was largely uninhabited around 1841-2, and despite Lewis and Clark's voyages 40 years earlier the Pacific Northwest was largely inhabited only by Native Americans and the Hudson Bay Company of Great Britain, after the War of 1812 caused John Jacob Astor to give up his trading empire in the region.  My only gripe about the book involved the tremendous build-up to the court martials, and then their relative lack of a knock-out blow to conclude the book.  Philbrick mentions Wilkes' court-martial in the introduction, and throughout the narrative he ends chapters with ominous sentences like "He would later come to regret that decision", indicating that some huge "come-uppance" was in the works. After all this anticipation, the ultimate court-martials proved as unsatisfying to the reader as they must have been to contemporaries like Lt. Reynolds.   Overall, however, I recommend the book.  The various regions visited by the Ex. Ex. make for welcome changes of pace. Within a handful of pages you travel from the massive floating icebergs of the uninhabited sub-arctic, to tropical islands in Fiji, (where the sailors  worried about cannibalism and native unrest), to the largely wild coasts of present-day Washington and Oregon.  Those who live near Washington D.C. or who have visited the Smithsonian will learn all about the origins of the museum, and its original collection of artifacts.  I will gladly read anything Mr. Philbrick writes, and look forward to his history of the Mayflower 
 This Tracy guy really knows how to lay it out in plain english, so even a gorilla like me can absorb and benefit from these simple strategies.  Way to go, Brian 
 Billy Wilder is a man who loved making pictures (his term), and a man who takes responsibility for what he put on the screen. In this book-long interview by fellow filmmaker/writer Cameron Crowe, Billy Wilder's humanity shows through - most definitely in his association with Marilyn Monroe, with whom he made The Seven-Year Itch and Some Like It Hot. Here was an actress who gave him plenty of headaches on the set, but reading between the lines one can see his appreciation for what she brought to the screen. He is frank when discussing his regrets, the greatest of which was never making a picture with Cary Grant, and shows a great ability to recognize his failures as well as his successes. Crowe, an obvious Wilder fan, deserves much credit for drawing so many insightful observations from this man who devoted his life to the motion picture industry - first, in his mind, as a writer and then as a director - and, while asking nothing in return, he shows great delight that his best work is appreciated. This book is better than Truffaut's interviews with Hitchcock and is a must-read for any true fan of the movies. After reading it, one will surely appreciate Wilder and his contibutions to the movie industry 
 It's amazing how fast King drew me into this story. Then he broke my heart a few times before the end of chapter two, and after that I just read on like a man possessed. A few bits feel plotted, but I don't care. King's novels have never been about their plots. That's news to Hollywood, I think, but not to you and me.   King doesn't write short books you can devour in a single sitting or two. Nah, you spend a week with one of these babies, savoring every moment. He's fully capable of being a sick bastard, don't you doubt that, but he's equally capable of messing with you on far more disturbing levels.   I bought a big pile of King novels at the Xinhua Bookstore on Yan An Lu, which probably means the author got his royalties. (Yes, I do live in China.) I assumed I'd quit reading at least some of them after the first 10%. But, pleasant surprise here, I've read every single one from cover to cover and enjoyed them all. I'm so happy about that. I've dwelled upon them after my reading and reviewing was done. And, while I can't be certain because my Kings are in a box instead of on a bookshelf right now -- I have no bookshelf -- I think this is the last one. Egad!   Just so my subscribers know -- all three of you, haha! -- the protagonist is an author named Michael, and his wife dies suddenly in first paragraph. Does that give King special access to what I fear the most? Nah, it actually makes me giggle at the coincidence.   No matter. King writes so well that I forget to giggle. So well that can only say "wow" and forget my jealousy. It's enough that I can read his books. I don't have to write them. Hey, writing is hard. Reading, if the author does his job, is easy. King does his job. Oh yes he does.  
  As I have noted in my review of Leon Trotsky's memoir My Life (click see all my reviews) today's public tastes dictate that political memoir writers expose the most intimate details of their private personal lives in the so-called public square. Here, as in Trotsky's memoir, Serge will offer up no such tantalizing details. These old time revolutionaries seem organically averse to including personal material that would distract from their political legacies. That is fine by me.  After all that is why political people, the natural audience for this form of history narrative, appreciate such works.  Contemporary political memoir writers take note.      Serge was a militant from his youth. However the October 1917 Russian Revolution is the real start of his political maturation and wider political influence. I believe the reader will find the most useful information and Serge's most insightful political analysis dates from this period.  Serge became  a secondary Communist leader after the Bolshevik seizure of power and in various capacities, most notably as a journalist for the Communist international, witnessed many of the important events  in and out of Russia in the 1920's and 1930's.  Moreover, for a long period of time he was a key member of the Trotsky-led Left Opposition to the rise of Stalinism which formed in the Russian Communist Party and later in the Communist International in the 1920's. Serge eventually broke politically with Trotsky in the late 1930's over the class nature of the Soviet state and organizational differences on the role of the revolutionary party in the struggle and in power. Serge's  later politics and activities  are murky, somewhat disoriented and the subject of controversy (see the Appendix in Memoirs and my review of Serge's book Kronstadt). However, Serge's analysis and insights as a witness to this period of history retain their value, especially his analysis of the, for leftists, very troublesome Stalinist purges and terror campaigns of the 1930's.     Thus, as with Trotsky's memoir, you will find a thoughtful political self-examination by a man trying to draw the lessons of the degeneration of the Russian Revolution, the subsequent defeats of the international working class movement, the devastating destruction of the fellow revolutionary cadre who made and administered the early Soviet state while still defending the gains of that revolution.  Overshadowing these concerns is a constant personal struggle to maintain one's revolutionary integrity at all costs. That is, not to wind up like Bukharin or Zinoviev and the like, compromised and lost to the struggle for socialism.  All this, moreover, and perhaps hardest of all still maintain a sense of revolutionary optimism for the future organization of human society.   Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin once commented that in the run-up to the October Revolution the political whirlwind stirred up by that revolution inevitably brought those individuals and organizations looking for the resolution of the revolutionary dilemma into the Bolshevik orbit. This was most famously the case with Trotsky's Petersburg Inter-District organization that fused with the Bolsheviks in the fateful summer of 1917. That same whirlwind later drew in the best elements of the Western labor movement as word of the revolution reached the outside world. Previously, Serge had been close to the French anarchist and anarcho-syndicalist movement but as happens in great revolutions he, like other militant anarchists, was drawn to the reality of the Soviet experiment despite political differences over the question of the state. Despite this he, generally, like the non-Bolshevik militants served the revolution with distinction. Thus, this fateful political decision to cast his personal fate with the Russian Revolution led him to the series of political adventures and misadventures that enliven his memoir.   At the beginning of the 21st century when socialist political programs are in decline it is hard to imagine the spirit that drove Serge to dedicate the better part of his life to the fight for a socialist society. However, at the beginning of the 20th century he represented only a slightly younger version of that revolutionary generation of Eastern Europeans and Russians  exemplified by Lenin, Trotsky, Martov  and Luxemburg who set out to change the history of the 20th century. It was as if the best and brightest of that generation were afraid, for better or worse, not to take part in the political struggles that would shape the modern world. Those same questions posed at the beginning of that century are still on the agenda for today's generation of militants to help resolve. This is one of your political textbooks. Read it.  
 "American Sphinx" is not the place to begin a study of the life of Thomas Jefferson. In the introduction, Joseph Ellis comments that before joining the plethora of published analyses and biographies of Jefferson, the historian had better be prepared to bring some new insights to the life of this most revered of the Founders. Ellis chose for his subtitle, "The Character of Thomas Jefferson", and it is Jefferson's character that Ellis explores, in snippets that leap forward from scene to scene in Jefferson's life, as if Ellis were a time-traveler checking in periodically on his subject while Jefferson the man moves through a life that is now considered hallowed history. Ellis assumes that his reader is already familiar with the larger moments of Jefferson's life, as well as the surrounding history, and so skips over these. The reader who is new to Jefferson, therefore, should start elsewhere.  "American Sphinx" was published a few years before the DNA tests in 1998 which proved that some of Sally Hemings' children did indeed carry the Y chromosome of the Jefferson family, probably from Thomas himself or his brother Randolph. Because the DNA evidence cannot narrow the paternity of Sally Hemings' children any further, Ellis' arguments against Thomas Jefferson as their father still hold up, and remain as reasonable as they could also be inaccurate. Despite a wealth of circumstantial evidence that can swing either way, any final judgment must be taken simply on faith.  And "taken on faith" seems to be how Jefferson's life must be viewed. He represents so much to so many about the founding spirit of the United States that he is often worshipped along the lines of a Joshua or other prophet. Ellis seems to hold Jefferson up to this same hero-worship status, but through lines of often dry prose and some confusing sentence structure (Ellis does not set off his prepositional phrases with commas), the reader begins to get the queasy feeling that Jefferson may not have been the man that we have all wanted him to be. He begins to come across as petty and insecure, with a naï¿½ve outlook on humanity that carried on even into his waning years. It was always easy to write off Jefferson' sharper declarations (The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants) as youthful enthusiasm, but his convictions against a governing structure for the United States apparently never changed, leaving John Adams to question Jefferson's sanity while even James Madison had to shake his head from time to time. Ellis almost appears to have been startled by these revelations, and struggles to keep Jefferson atop a pedestal even as the evidence tries to topple the whole thing.  All in all, "American Sphinx" is a sobering exercise in the realities of greatness; that in the end the Founding Fathers--and Jefferson in particular--were all very human and just as capable of error as anyone; that the founding of the United States was neither a clear-cut goal of rationality nor even a consensus, but was rather a struggle of ideology pulled toward the center by camps who were alarmingly polarized even in the eighteenth century. But even as the dichotomies of Jefferson's life descend into disingenuousness, we can still ask with some reverence: Where would we have been without him?  
 There is no doubt that John Maynard Keynes's "The General Theory..." was the most important book about economics of the 20th Century.  Hayek and Friedman (and maybe Ludwig von Mises) may be thought of as the great minds among academics and professional economists, but when the economy heads southward and these academics and professionals have to advise politicians, they all mysteriously become Keynesians - Reagan and George W. being the two greatest examples of this hypocrisy, as both presidents and their economic advisors were Keynes-bashers, yet both have been the most Keynesian presidents in American history.  Indeed, nothing makes a person's point better than watching his or her detractors quietly subscribe to the new principles.  The book is almost unbearable to read.  There is not a lot of mathematics - a basic algebra course and the ability to think deeply and critically will suffice.  But, as some other reviewers have pointed out, the sentence structures are quite frightening, and the ability to follow along with what Lord Keynes explains can seem almost impossible at times.  You will end up reading the book several times, as some pages, paragraphs, and even chapters require rereading to understand - Keynes, shockingly, is no Paul Krugman in terms of being able to write for the masses.  But, if you can work beyond all of that, it is a worthwhile read.  (If you want a Keynes book that is easy to read and structured more to the casual reader, I recommend "The Economics Consequences of the Peace" - and don't let the title scare you.)  Conservatives call him a Marxist; Marxists call him a Conservative; Liberals can't decide if he's the Second Coming of Christ or a Plague to be avoided; and Libertarians think he's Satan.  And anyone who can stir up such an ideological mess deserves his place in history 
 After cutting back on dessert for health reasons, this book has inspired me to make dessert more often. The desserts I've made from this book turned out great. Of course, you can get classic American recipes from many sources, but after presenting the simple versions, the author often includes a few versions with more "razzle-dazzle." There is a wide variety of desserts represented, so anyone should be able to find something to suit their palate, from light to rich, gelatin to pastry, and anything in between. The historical and descriptive anecdotes about ingredients and desserts are interesting and inspiring. You can tell that the author really enjoys dessert. The reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is that the organization could be better 
 This book is far more than just about forgiveness.Having tried to deal with forgiving for years this book has given me more insight into my behavior than help from a great therapist! I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to live better and be a peace with themselves.I have underlined my copy and plan to return to it periodically 
 This highly-readable book discusses the merits of raw milk, along with such related topics as mothers' milk, the eating of meat, and the effect (or, rather, lack thereof) of dietary cholesterol on the human heart.  I found Dr. Douglass to be witty, well-informed, and respectful of readers with a wide variety of worldviews (although there is some mild coarse language throughout).  This is not an overly scientific book, which may be seen as either a benefit or a downfall, depending on your reason for reading.  I only gave it four stars because it is in dire need of proofreading/editing 
 I myself, suffer SI. I wanted to know why I did what I do, and so on. This book what brought up to me by a ex-coworker. I finally got some understanding. It's great for those who know someone who does SI, it will make them understand that we are not doing this for attention, not doing it just because it's "in", or even because we are "goth and dark". It's a cry of pain and unfornatly, is on the outside of our skin.  It's a little graphic at times and the first time I read it, I was badly triggered by it. But a second reading gave me more insights. I wish I could get what few friend I have left to read this, including my BF and maybe my parents too.  I've also read the "Body Under Seige" book about the SAFE program, and compaired to that book, this should be the Holy Grail for people wanting to learn about SI (not how to - but why it's done and the reasoning behind it). 
 Great soundtrack and overall Alan Silvestri's best. Power of love and back in time some of Huey's best. It really reminds you of how great the film is. Forgot the soundtracks for 2 and 3 stick with this one 
  An easy to read and understand explanation of why some things appeal to us and others don't. This is a must read for anyone that supervises or leads people.  Robert Ruiz  
 I liked "The Eye 2" a lot although it's a bit different in many ways. First it's not a direct sequel of "The Eye", but rather variations on the same theme. And though it's also made by Pang brothers it still differs. They are two absolutely distinct films and probably it would have been better to give the second part a new title. It's also different because the film seemed pretty Americanized to me. I'm not saying it's a bad thing, but "The Eye 2" is done very professionally, very Hollywood-like hence losing much of the charm asian horror movies possess - viscosity, slow-pacing, hypnotizing atmosphere and thoughtfulness. No, don't think it totally reminds American remakes of Asian horrors, "The Eye 2" still has this Oriental style and a bunch of thrills everyone is expecting. It's just a little bit different, a little more polished and lustrous.   Joey's (brilliant acting from a Taiwanese actress Qi Shu whom you could notice in "The Transporter") suicide attempt fails then she gets pregnant and starts seeing dead people. Yes, I know, that's an old story, but what matters are the details. Obviously there's some reason ghosts try to communicate with her and for hour and a half she's going to try to find out why. Surely the truth will be surprising and unsuspected.  Actually the first part was scarier to my opinion (just recall the elevator scene or the calligraphy scene), but "The Eye 2" also manages to scare and what's important - when least expected. There were specifically two scenes that made me jump on my chair - very gruesome and extremely unexpected. There were a lot more as frightening but generally in the tradition of Asian horror films - long black hair, strange moving etc. And I have to say some of the special effects will stay with you for a long time. "The Eye 2" certainly deserves wide audiences - it's pretty comprehensible for people who are not very familiar with Hong Kong horror movies (I say Hong Kong for Pang brothers are Chinese albeit the movie was also shot in Thailand and Singapore) and those who are will find a lot of chills they intend to find. Only I wouldn't recommend this movie for pregnant ladies - you need to keep yourself and your baby in a good mood! And since "The Eye 2" deals with pregnancy - it would be better to keep away from it for a while.   And speaking of Americanizing - Pang brothers have moved to Hollywood already where next year they ought to release a horror movie "The Messengers" and also a remake of their own "Bangkok Dangerous" that will be called "Time to Kill". Speaking frankly Hollywood killed many good directors from Europe, Asia and, say, New Zealand. I hope Pang brothers will stand and keep their style not falling into mediocrity. 
 Steve Schirripa's  "The Goomba Diet" does for Italian cuisine what "The Da Vinci Code" does for Catholicism -- the only difference is that once the Pope reads Schirripa's book, he's going to make Steve an official Saint.  Following in the tradition of his previous literary masterpieces,  ("The Goomba's Guide to Life" and "The Goomba's Guide to Love")   Schirripa has accomplished the impossible by  writing a book that's even funnier than his first two.  Whether you're Italian or Jewish, fat or thin, heterosexual or a fanook, "The Goomba Diet"  delivers a powerful message from which the world can benefit. And by "the world",  I mean overweight Italian criminals  indicted under the RICO Statute who enjoy Penne Arrabiata.   Not only is "The Goomba Diet"  superior to any book currrently on the New York Times bestseller list, but it proves why  Steve Schirripa  deserves to host his own late night  network television talk show -- he's far more talented than Jimmy Kimmel, Carson Daly, and or that annoying Scottish guy on CBS.  And if boring idiots  like "Jerry R. from Montreal" like this book, then it can be enjoyed by EVERYONE. 
 I loved the writing style in this book, and the characters were well-defined and well-written, but the story line was forseeable.  We all knew it was coming.  Alas 
 Having been educated as a physicist, I glanced at the books on the new-book table and immediately asked myself, 'what's calamity physics.'   It wasn't, I thought, a bad question. There are so many new variations on the traditional physics I learned that I guessed it was something new.   It was, but it was a new novel by a new author.   As a first novel it is pretty amazing. It has the general feel that it is a book that was poured over and poured over for a lifetime. Kind of like the first novels you see from people who are elderly. I was surprised to find that it was by someone quite young.   The book is carefully constructed with with the table of contents page entitleds 'Core Curriculum (Required Reading) and chapter headings like Wuthering Heights, and Pygmalion. The last chapter is 'Final Exam,' and it is a final exam.   At the heart of the book, it's a murder mystery. It almost calls out to be a movie, preferably with someone like Alred Hitchcock directing.   In a few places I found it to be a bit too wordy, but amusing and interesting enough to keep me reading until the very end. An excellent start to what should be a long and hopefully prolific career 
 I remember this book as a kid. When I first tried reading it, "On Beyond Zebra" provided a serious challenge as a beginning reader. Only Dr. Seuss could have come up with the idea of this book and the characters  and names which populate it. His "outside the box" imagination  was a major influence in my creative development, and "On Beyond  Zebra" is my personal favorite Dr. Seuss book. I haven't seen a copy  of this book in years, but I'll never forget it 
 These collected essays, first published in such periodicals as The New York Times, The New York Herald Tribune, or Atlantic Monthly, trace the origins of modern drama in Greek tragedy and comedy. At least four of them should be required reading in any introductory course in British and American literature: The Salesman Has A Birthday; Tragedy And The Common Man; The Nature Of Tragedy; and The Family In Modern Drama. The last of these contains a memorable phrase that furnished the title of the selection of the late U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl's essays, At Home In The World. One brief quotation from Tragedy And The Common Man that seems especially relevant to the present era will suffice: "The Greeks could probe the very heavenly origin of their ways and return to confirm the rightness of laws.&quot 
 I really enjoyed this book. I liked how the stories entertwined, and a character from one would pop up in another, and I would get a completely different take on the character's behavior or motives. Sometimes it was just a glimpse, but it would explain something said by another character in another story.  The stories were well written, and I liked how they weren't all contemporary. I don't think her writing style was as effective for the stories in Italy and China, but still quite enjoyable.  The stories aren't "fluff," but they read quickly because they flow so well.  I recommend this novel for those who enjoy short stories, but also for people who like really well written fiction 
 Oh my God!  My 19 month old loves this movie!  Dora and Boots are having so much fun while helping fairytale characters along the way.  One thing though, the Giant who "lost the puppy" scene should not have been included. I am glad that my daughter is till too young to know what it means to "help" a stranger look for a puppy or anything else for that matter.  When the time is come, we will explain to her that it is NOT okay to help strangers look for anything they've lost.  Otherwise, great movie 
 This book is easily one of the 10 best books I've ever read. It turned me on to the works of writer Tim Powers, and I have now read every one of his novels (and most of his short stories, as well). "The Anubis Gates" is easily one of his masterpieces. It is usually lumped under SF or Fantasy in bookstores, because they honestly don't know what to make of it - it IS both SF and Fantasy, but so much more. For lovers of dark, modern fantasy - or anyone who loves a great time-travel tale unlike any other - this book is highly recommended. I also recommend Powers' "Last Call" - but it is not for the faint of heart 
 Not as good as Point of Impact, but still a very good read and gets better as it motors along. Would make a good movie 
 I had been enameling for several months when I came upon this book. It provided answers to my many questions. I enjoy the historical highlights and the fast facts helpful hints. I also love the projects provided which teach beginners and those more advanced the various techniques.  This book has been a definite plus to my library 
 Lauren Tratar's book "Life", A Complete Operating Manual is absolutely terrific!!! It is inspirational and  motivating it has helped me to access my best life.I have been to many different types of motivational seminars including Tony Robbins and I have found this book to be the key that unlocked the blocks that were preventing me from living my best life. Lauren has gathered the best from every well known self-help, motivational, and inspirational book there is, together with her own insights makes this the only book you will ever need for personal empowerment 
 From the beginning of the film Italian director Robert Benigni's `Life is Beautiful' is easily identified as a masterpiece. A tale of fantasy and humor in the heart of Nazi occupied Italy, this film is centered around the fanciful story of Guido, the films central character. Guido, (Roberto Benigni) is a young Jewish librarian who lives in a world of his own fantasy. He is witty, imaginative, hilarious, a little crazy, and in a state of constant bliss. From his riddles to his endearments to his stories, Guido displays a childlike innocence that captures the heart of any person- and in the movie, captures the heart of Dora (Nicoletta Braschi) his "principessa" (princess) and wife.   	The movie changes from a romantic comedy to a sarcastic tragedy as Guido and his son Giosué are taken to a concentration camp by the Nazi officials that occupy Italy at the time. However, despite this depressing turn of events, it is there in the horror of the camps that the magic of Benigni's story takes flight. In order to save his son's sanity, Guido invents a game for Giosué to believe/play while they are in the camp. From a complex point system, to mean candy-hogging guards, to a grand prize of a real tank, Guido lets his imagination soar as he fills Giosué's mind with stories and promises. This absurd paradigm shift is not only hilarious, but also provides a window into the depths of the human heart, which can endure all things when the light of hope is present. This part of the movie was also the most engaging, viewers will find themselves at the edge of their seats feeling as if they were also part of the game, and when Guido fumbles in his explanations you might unexpectedly hear a random helpful suggestion coming from your movie-buddy's lips.  Benigni's amazing ability to involve the audience in the plot of the movie was one of main reasons why La Vita é Bella won four academy awards in 1998. Moreover, Benigni also ties one more element into the story and the characters of Guido and Giosué- the music. Throughout their entire time in the concentration camp, the music of the movie remains happy and uplifting. Despite the hardships and cruel reality of life, the optimistic music represents the story Giosué believes. This is another great example of Benigni's gift to blend all aspects of cinematography- the characters, plot, scenery, music, and the reactions of the audience- in order to make the movie a complete and unique experience for the audience.  Because of its light representation, `Life is Beautiful' is a movie that can be seen by all audiences and I strongly recommend watching this film in its native Italian language with English subtitles. The experience, emotions, and representations do not carry the same meaning in American versions, and yes much does get lost in the translation. I also recommend watching this movie with a friend, it's a very moving film and it helps to have somebody's shoulder near you to cry on. I hope you enjoy this masterpiece just as much as I did and are able to pick out the many double-meanings in the dialogue to get the most out of your experience.   Laugh, cry, love, watch, enjoy, and help Guido help you find the beauty of life... 
 The reviewers who hate this are scrooges. One negative reviewer even claims Chuck Berry was a "doo flop" performer! Some people just don't get it. I had a great time watching this movie and I grew up in the 90's. It's a good cheesy time with some great songs. The cheesy moments are fun, Alan Freed is awesome, the music rocks! 
 I bought this for two reasons 1) I didn't have a large budget 2) I wanted a camcorder that was palm-sized and ultra-portable.  I was surpised at how tiny it is (VERY ultra-portable) and the controls are simple and easy to learn--perfect for beginners like me!  I took it on a trip to Miami and it worked great, though as others have found, it doesn't record very well in low light situations, and the digital zoom is grainy, but hey--you get what you pay for! I first used AA batteries while waiting for my Ni-MH's to power up, and they actualy lasted a long time before I switched to rechargables.  I was very happy with my purchase, and would have given this 5 stars, had it survived the trip back to Maui; I had this in my purse stashed under the seat on the plane and I may have kicked my bag around a bit.  My Pentax digital camera that was next to it in the bag came through without a problem, while the Aiptek was DOA.  So, if you're rough with your stuff, it would be a better idea to spend the bucks for a better, more durable camera.  If you're gentle with it and don't have a big budget, this is a great little camera for it's little price 
 Interesting & provacative look inside our relationship to food.  More than anything this book helped me see where we have lost our way in relation to food and the spiritual significance it's long had in our society.  What's truly wonderful is that Altman has inspired me to recreate a ritual around my meals.  To be more thoughtful in what & how I am eating with others.  Thank you 
 This is a very comprehensive book on what Jesus said to the world.  The chapters are easy to understand and there is a lot of information in each chapter.  The book explains the scriptures and understanding them is brought out nicely. 
 The Digital Photo Frame was easy to use and the software was excellent. I gave the item as a 50th birthday gift and set it up at a very large party. The frame showed a slide show of about 65 pictures and became a focal point for the guests. Everyone spent time looking at the pictures of the family from throughout the 50 years. Many asked where to get the frame. It was a hit and it worked as described 
 Videos, Live Gigantour performances, rare 80's live stuff, clips, interviews and everything Megadeth!! An awesome buy get this one now 
 Inspiration abounds in this book~I love how it features the same rooms, accessorized differently for the seasons. That is my favorite way to decorate~ Also, if you love old homes and restoration, this book provides inspiration for that as well. Wonderful! And the chandeliers, oohlala! 
 I bought this dictionary for all my nieces and nephews this year. It's soooooooooo much better than any junky Webster's Collegiate dictionary.  You can actually find the words you don't recognize 
 Yet another version of this story is "The Seven Magic Brothers" available in English/Chinese and Spanish. (Amazon does not show this as a "Similar Item" which is why I mention it here.)  Since in that book, the brothers all have monkey tails and bat ears, the question of racism can be put aside. The first brother saves the emperor from a rolling boulder. the emperor is scared of the his power so he vows to chop his head off... and his brother with the iron neck switches places with him, and this repeats with all the brothers till... the last brother swallows the sea, then lets it out, and the emperor's ship is carried out on a tidal wave. The illustrations are gorgeous detailed watercolors and the characters are all semi human/animal hybrids.  However, in this and other attempts there is a charm missing that came from the iconic simplicity and smiling faces of the brothers in Claire Bishop's version. I would eagerly welcome a non-stereotypical version that kept the brother's saucy bravado and magnetic delight 
 I have set my alarm to KIFM Smooth Jazz San Diego forever. A few weeks ago I woke up to a beautiful tune, didn't catch the name, I knew it was Richard Elliot!  What a Wake up this morning! The same beautiful tune woke me up. I Call the Radio Station, they advised  me it is Your Secret Love and the Forever for Always for Luther complilation of artists.  I got the name! Whallah! I am now in the process of purchasing it right now!!! The artists are awesome in their own way, So there is no way i can go wrong  Marsha, San Diego, CA   
 During the summer of 2006 I purchased "Trowel and Error" since I am an avid gardener and was looking to add another good reference book about gardening to my library. Once I got it home I realized that this book is a quick guide to gardening and would be very useful to beginning gardeners. I recently moved into a brand new neighborhood in Wetumpka Alabama and discovered that most of my new neighbors are novices to gardening and are always asking me gardening questions, so I decided this book is perfect for them as beginners. I purchased a book for all my beginning gardner friends and each of my four daughters. They all love it 
 Since I work in medicine Gen LaGreca's novel was especially pleasurable. The novel starts off the exceptionally talented Nicole Hudson performing at a ballet titled Triumph. It is a rewriting of the myths of Prometheus and Pandora. Prometheus brings fire to man and Zeus to punish him chains him to a rock. In an effort to punish Man, Zeus gives Pandora a golden box which as you know she opens. However, the ballet is rewritten where Pandora frees Prometheus and together they banish the evil released by the box and weather the wrath of Zeus. In a not so subtle effort at foreshadowing, the novel follows this basic plot. Dr. David Lang is a brilliant neurosurgeon who pioneers a technique to regenerate severed nerve tissues such as spinal cords and optic nerves. He lives in a New York State where there is socialized medicine but more advanced than that in current day Massachusetts. He and his fellow doctors are bound by rolls and rolls of red tape. The program called Carefree has seized complete control of medicine and punishes doctors with heavy fines and even jail for disobedience. To obtain treatments for patients doctors must plead with bureaucrats for approval. The fees are set by the state so even if a doctor performs 12 hours of surgery, the state will only pay for 6. Dr. Lang is unhappily married to Marie who is a general practitioner who each step of her life chose to appease the majority. He does enjoy the company of his brother Randy Lang who is the president of the hospital and seems more pragmatic. Dr. Lang finds relief and joy in stealing away to watch Nicole Hudson dance in Triumph. Then one day she is blinded in an accident while on the stage. Her career is at an end and her one means of happiness is cut off from her unless Dr. Lang steps in and risks his career, jail and the wrath of the state to see to it that Nicole will see again. There are a number of subplots and surprising twists that kept me reading even though I knew what was going to happen. The style, the plot, the characters and the philosophical basis for the book are heavily influenced by Ayn Rand and by a clear concern for the current direction of medicine. The first portion of the book, LaGreca's writing is clearly in the long shadow of Rand. Thankfully she breaks free in the second half of the book. As far as first novels go, the rough edges in this one are minimized by a driven plot, characters who I found myself caring about and making an important philosophical and political statement. Don't think it will actually happen? I wouldn't be so sure. Getting approval for procedures and radiology scans are already well established and insurance companies already set fees regardless of the actual work done. At least in our world if you are unhappy with one insurance company you can switch to another or if you are a doctor you can choose not to accept a certain type of insurance if you believe they are being unfair or are difficult to deal with. Despite very clear problems in current state programs, prominent physicians, professional societies and prestigious medical journals are all clamoring for more state intervention. This enjoyable novel will should make you question these recommendations and even offers solutions of its own in a way that you won't notice any soapboxes around. This novel isn't without its own flaws nonetheless I recommend it highly. 
 I can't tell you how much I love this product!!!  I live in Colorado and we've had tons of snow/cold weather this winter and now I can't even imagine zipping my 4-month-old into a snowsuit.  It's so easy to slip her right it, zip it up and go!  I have appreciated the flap that can fold up or down--this covers her head as we walk from our car to the door when it is snowing or windy.   I chose this urban style over the original because I liked the way it looked, but after having used it a few months there are a few more reasons I like it better. First, it washes beautifully!  The liner stays soft and looks the same as the day I bought it--unlike sherpa fleece.  Second, the outside fabric is waterproof.  Once I spilled a small soda on the Bundleme and the soda literally beaded up and poured right off!  It never soaked into the fabric and left a stain 
 Dr. Andrew Weil introduces Dr. Gary Small's course in mental aerobics. He discusses the importance of an anti-inflammatory diet, why it might not be a good idea to sleep next to an alarm radio and why lifestyle strategies may have a great influence on brain health as we age.   Should you take up learning a new language or learn to play a musical instrument? What will a daily walk five times a week do for your brain? Dr. Andrew Weil explains the problems of oxidative stress, trauma, toxic chemicals and stress hormones and how they affect long-term aging.   Dr. Gary Small presents ideas for developing memory skills. His fun brainteasers will help you remember "to do" lists and names as well as giving you the empowering feeling when you remember things you used to forget. Through visualizations he guides you through a number of lessons to enhance memory and it makes remembering things a breeze.   Since the brain does have some regenerative capacity and we are capable of learning throughout the entire span of our lifetime, all it takes is some effort in the area of learning, reading or doing something challenging like learning dance steps.   2 CDs, a 52-page study guide booklet and a set of 35 brain-tuning cards to remind you to do the exercises presented. The cards include information on learning to relax, learning basic memory tricks to train the brain to remember facts and a few cards for advanced memory training.   ~The Rebecca Review  
 ...when I reviewed the film, I said I'd never go to sea in anything smaller than a "Nimitz"-class carrier, or alternatively a submarine. Now I've read the book, forget the carrier, submarine only, I want something that goes under all THAT weather.   To me, book and film complement each other very nicely. The book lacks the excitement of the film, but explains much that the film cannot (the backgrounds of the characters, the nature of storms, some varied history of fishing, previous storms, etc., and even the physiology of drowning). The film, on the other hand, puts a face (imaginary) on the crew of the "Andrea Gail" and what happened to them in a way that the book can't. Some aspects of the various attempted rescues depicted in the book are changed in the film, but not in a way that in any way diminishes the skill and heroism of the Coastguard and Air National Guard personnel who put their necks on the line in unbelievable conditions to save mariners in distress. If anything, they are the co-stars of both book and film, along with the storm itself.   The book is slow to get going and is written in the present tense, which I find irritating, but once it gets rolling, it gets you in. If you've seen the film and enjoyed it, your experience is not complete until you've read the book. 
 This isn't one of Mel Brooks best movies but it is a classic. There are many hilarious songs and cheesy jokes.  I would recommend this movie to any die hard Mel Brooks fan 
 A friend of mine got me Stu's book because he had seen him speak at an event.  He passed it along to me with a grunt and said something like, "you like running, right?"  In this book, Mittleman outlines an approach to running that is actually... gulp... fun.    As I read through the chapters, I realized that Stu was talking very explicitly about what I had been doing as a runner but was never able to put it into words.  My approach, just like Stu's is the long, slow, distance approach.  Run because you feel like it, not because you have to--for any reason.  Stu works extensively with heart rate monitors, but that doesn't mean this book isn't accessible to runners who abhor them.  I'm not a big fan of strapping myself up to a monitor at all, but still found extreme value in the book.  The main portion of the book covers how to run for fitness and training.  The general idea is to train at a comfortable heart rate and if you're interested in gaining speed, you should push your heart rate up in intervals. The training techniques are effective and again the good news for non-runner-techno-geeks is that Stu explains how to read your heart rate without even taking your pulse.  He talks about how to sense where you are and where you should be for the specific type of training you need.  Mittleman also covers nutrition (a low carb approach) and kinesiology for addressing certain issues physical and mental.  Funny enough as extra testimony to the book, I gave the book to an obese client of mine and she absolutely loved the philosophy of it--regardless of whether or not she's ever planning to run.  Kevin Gianni, NCSF-CPT Author of "The Busy Person's Fitness Solution 
 Thomas Mann has taken an ages old theme, the attraction of an older, worn out man for a youthful boy, dressed it up in a series of classical allusions, and details how this attraction merely accelerates the decay of the man whose decline began long before he first saw the boy.  In DEATH IN VENICE, Gustave von Aschenbach is a German writer living in pre-World War I Europe, who has been trying to balance the struggles involved in maintaining his hard-worn writing laurels with the demands those struggles have placed on his life, his health, and his emotional keel.  He has become an ascetic, denying himself the pleasures of the flesh.  His muse is a jealous one and demands his attention full time.  Over the years, he has willingly paid the price, but the true cost becomes apparent to him only as he turns fifty years of age.  He senses a void in his life.  He does not know what it is or how to compensate, so he decides that travel in the answer.  One of the ironies of Mann's novella is that Aschenbach's readers undoubtedly give him credit for the worldly-wise sophisticate that his many literary works of art suggest he must be.  But the truth is that because of his rigorous denial of himself, in terms of maturity and emotional serenity, he is a greenhorn.  He tends to view the world as he does through his books, which are laden with an abundance of classical erudition. But the real world is not Plato's Republic reborn.  It is a testing ground which favors those whose feet are firmly grounded in the world of the body.  Early on, as Mann subtly alludes to Aschenbach's mental and physical infirmities, his fate is a doom foretold.  Aschenbach is puzzled by the continual appearance of a weird looking old man who pops up at convenient moments to glare at him in a puzzling manner.  The first time that Aschenbach sees him, he pays him scant attention, but as the visits increase in his trips around Europe, both Aschenbach's and the reader's wonderment grow.  After a while, the old man begins to assume allegorical--or at least mystical--proportions.  One can almost see a misty haze envelop both during their encounters. It is tempting to treat these visitations as unreal hallucinations of a mind slowly unhinging with Aschenbach seeing a version of himself, following him around Europe, as if to remind him of his looming mortality.  While in Europe, he notices a good looking Polish boy of about fourteen. Aschenbach begins to fantasize about him but dares not do more than just gaze at him from a distance.  As if in a rush, the years of ascetic self-denial rupture, opening the door to his latent homosexual tendencies.  Mann cleverly avoids calling a spade a spade. Instead he dresses up this fantasy in terms of Aschenbach's limited social background that had been fueled by a lifetime of classical learning.  The boy, whose name is Tadziu, is described as a young Adonis, an Apollo, and other such. The only words that pass between then occur at the very end, when Aschenbach sees the boy tormented by bullies and almost, but not quite, intervenes.  Aschenbach locks eyes with the boy and in that moment he knows the forbidden joy that, in a different universe might have been his.  He dies, possibly of the plague, happy and decidedly ignorant of who he himself really was.  Mann passes no moral judgments against Aschenbach. This is no gay bashing novel nor does he hold it up as a trumpeting to engage in illicit activities, but in the ending of what-might-have-been, Mann suggests that life's choices and future happiness might better be served with a clearer moral vision of who we are, what we want, and where we are going.     
 I bought this book pretty much randomly just looking for something to read and I was greatly pleased at my luck.  I work in radio and understand Cash Peters' budget problems and I also love to travel, but have never really heard of travel like this.  Cash Peters opens up a hilarious world of bizarre and sometimes just downright frightening obsessions, tourist "attractions", collections and museums.  He brilliantly describes these interesting and somewhat atrocious attractions with a quick wit and sarcastic note that had me laughing out loud (and even in public!).  I think what Peters has is some sort of museum masochism, but it sure is fun!  This book is a must read 
 The book deserves 5 stars for the photographs of the stunning Africa-inspired quilts, but 3 for the lousy directions. The first half of the book is a photgraphic display of artistic quilts, sure to inspire anyone.  Many different styles of quilting, lots of applique, all featuring gorgeous African fabrics and motifs.  The second half has directions for 12 different quilts. The photographs are excellent and most of the projects include a photographic close-up of part of the quilt.  Some of the projects would be suitable for beginners, but the directions assume that you either have another source of information on how to quilt, are incomplete, or are incorrect.  A number of quilts require applique, and the brief directions in the book are not sufficient.  Some of the directions are totally incorrect--so read carefully and think through the project.  Use the photographs as inspiration for your own design.  The applique templates are great, so between the templates and the photographs, there is plenty to inspire you 
 I have never read a novel by Jon Kellerman before this one but I must say that I like his style.  The Murder Book is an intriguing tale that kept me interested the whole way through.  Flashbacks are done with skill, careful not to lose the reader in the transition.  The ending, unlike so many other novels, was one I was satisfied with... it lived up to the hype of the story.  Try "The Digital Umbrella" too 
 What a fantastic set. I'm really only 6 hours into the 12 hours of film material but this some wonderful set! I've been collecting Edison films on video for about 20 years. To not only have them in one place with great prints, but to have the interesting interviews (2 hours worth) is fabulous. If I have one gripe it's the menu. If you are watching a DVd all the way through including the commentary and stop in less than the 3 hours the disc runs, you have to fast forward the next time to the place you were at. There is a film index but if you chose a film from that list it only plays that film and goes back to the index. Well, after watching it through once, I'll be using the index in the future.   Great packaging as well. Bravo to Kino and MOMA!  Steve Ram 
 The "Sales Bible" is a masterpiece.  This is one of the most complete books on sales that I have ever read.  When I became a sales leader four years ago this was the first sales book our team read together.  The practical sales tips and techniques Jeffrey Gitomer discloses in this book are priceless.  I have a sales rep that tells everyone that will listen that "The Sales Bible" is the reason he tripled his income in less than three years!  David Otis Author of "Walk Fast, Talk Loud and Smile 
 This book was so beautiful.  I love unicorns and dragons, so it was great seeing the two together.  i liked this book because of the story it depicted, and that is that we can all be at peace with the world, and those around us. I recommend this book for people of all ages.  it is beautifully illustrated and is full of love 
 You will have fun reading this tongue twister with your child. With funny made up animals (things) and verse that can twist the tongue of the most experienced reader. What is the story about? Nothing really, just a bunch of nonsense that makes Dr. Seuss as fun as eve 
 I highly recommend this book for anyone who practices psychotherapy and  who truly wants to be 'engaged' in a genuine process  with their clients.   Zen and the Heart of Psychotherapy uncovers a process of mutual growth and  transformation that can occur for both the client AND the therapist using  basic Zen  principles and ideas. This book does not get encumbered in  Eastern ambiguity or unnecessary and technical Buddhist semantics.   Regardless of your or your client's spiritual belief system, the ideas  presented can be considered universally and are useful in not only forging  a strong therapeutic alliance in the here and now, but also for faciliating  growth, transformation and healing of mind, body and spirit 
 I've had a subscription to PC World over the past few years (as a gift) and I love it.  The articles are very insightful and relevant.  I can always find at least one article in each magazine that helps me with a computer issue I'm having at the time or provides me with reviews on electronic devices that I'm looking to buy 
 Thank you so much for creating the Adaptalap! I have a 3-year old daughter who is visually impaired. With the Adaptalap she can look at books, draw, use a magnet board and a felt board, look in a mirror, and I'm sure do many things we haven't discovered yet, all without the terrible neck and back strain she used to experience when bending low over a table or her lap. It's simple to use and efficient, and it works from the floor, at a chair and table, in bed, and in the car. I am so thankful that Julie Smith. our vision therapist, told us about your product. Thank you again 
 The book "Chato's Kitchen" is designed for the age group 4-8. It's the story of a cat, Chato, who has some culinary plans involving the harmless mouse family next door. There are quite a number of Spanish words--and this, I think, adds a rather exotic touch to the book. However, some of the English words are beyond the vocabulary of an average 8 year-old, and this may inhibit readability. The characters and the plot allow for a great deal of acting out if one reads the book aloud 
 The Sweet And Sour Animal book is a good colletion of animal poems.  It's illisterated with paper mache art 
 The Secret Seder is the story of a young Jewish boy's experience during the time of Nazi Germany.  It vividly portrays the fears that were prevalent among Jews at that time.  Even the Passover Seder had to be observed in secret.  The book is very well written and the portrayal of events is very accurate.  The somber watercolor illustrations add to the darkness of the story.  Although I feel that this is a well-done book, I do not believe that the subject matter is appropriate for a five-year-old as the age recommendation indicates.  Some of the text may be too harsh for such a young reader:  "Papa yanks me into an alley.  The clicking is closer and louder.  Papa pulls out the knife.  I hold my breath..."  This may be a more appropriate book for a child who is eight or nine years old.    
 This book is helpful for people new to their jobs. If you don't have anyone who can give you good advice, try this book and you will gain understanding and wisdom about how you should act in your workfield 
 This show has some of the best writing, directing and acting ever produced on TV, and its two-part finale, "Grave Danger," reached levels of greatness unprecedented on TV. Quentin Tarantino unflinchingly explores the darkest taboo themes in human nature, exploiting the worst fears. In this case, being buried alive. It was a masterstroke having Nick Stokes, the carefree resident he-guy playboy of the show, to be the victim. And for once, making a male the victim. In most of their cases, the CSI team commences with cool calm in assembling their evidence and in solving their murder cases; the repetitiveness of their jobs give them a certain immunity to the constant brutality of their work. But here we have Nick Stokes, drugged and placed into a plastic box underground. He has lost all control, and has no way out. Certain to face a slow, agonizing death. We see Nick flailing helplessly and screaming in sheer terror and panic. Watching this is like a real-life nightmare; if this does not leave you shivering, you're made of strong stuff. The implied claustrophobia is staggeringly suffocating: you are placed in the ground with Nick, and you feel his anticipation of the worst of what he knows is certain. Tarantino is a master at manipulative fear-tapping, and nowhere else will you experience such a terrifying identification as here. The director has the entire cast effectively on edge, some of them numbed into shocked silence, others totally freaked out. Highest honors, though, goes to George Eads for his completely unexpected virtuoso performance. He should have won an Emmy. Who would have expected Eads to go from an efficiently competent actor to one of dazzling range of depth? When was the last time any male character was made to seem so vulnerable, so helpless, so completely downright scared crapless?  Eads screams and cries like a boy; his character's adult male control has been taken away from him, and the actor assails the viewer with an unspeakable sense of cold, clammy dread. A woman would react to this as a girlfriend and mother would, but speaking as a male, I cannot imagine a more sinister scenario (short of being castrated) than this. Most movie/tv situations has the male hero nearly always in control, or at least, having a means, a plan, a way out. Not here. It violates the standard dictum of the hero ingeniously conquering all, and therefore, it is a stunning innovation. The one small cavil I have is that the end of the episode did not provide us to see a great emotional catharsis of Nick and the other characters in the final resolution. But that is a minor point. All told, this slow, clautrophobic agony of terror is one of TV's greatest moments.   
 What astonished me the most about this true story was not that the men pushed farther and farther into the unknown oceans, and not that they resorted to cannibalism under the most desperate circumstances... it was their discipline throughout their three month ordeal that fascinated me the most.  The ability to regulate and control your most piercing need for food and water in the face of imminent death is beyond anything I can comprehend.   It's stimulating when you are forced to question your own character while engrossed in a story (let alone a true story)... Would I have behaved the same as the other men had I been adrift for all that time?  My answers fell a little short of what would have kept me alive back then; and the failure of my character test made the story even more amazing.    I recommend this to all readers as a great history lesson and as one of the most amazing survival stories, ever.  Philbrick lays it all out - with intense description - from beginning to end... he did his homework on this one and you'll enjoy it.  Have fun,  David Tobias Redondo Beach, C

 I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend, who kept complaining that he couldn't get to sleep sometimes because the house was too quiet. I looked at a much more expensive sound therapy machine at the mall, but it didn't have white noise, which is what he said he wanted. I thought this one was awfully cheap, but figured I'd try it before investing in a more expensive one.  We tried it the first night, and we weren't happy with the white noise sound, but love the falling rain and the running stream. A few days later, I ended up stealing it from his side of the bed and putting it on mine, and I love the thing! Within 5 minutes, I am sound asleep. I love the volume control too, which some machines don't have. I'm probably going to buy one for everyone I know for Xmas next year - I'm that happy with it! Great value for the price too. Goes to show you don't always have to spend more to get a great product 
 Joseph Gallagher, a retired Catholic priest and professor, who has taught at such venerable institutions as John Hopkins, Notre Dame, Loyola, and Oxford presents on an easy-to-understand guide through the intricacies of  Dante's imaginative work. Written in a conversational style that anyone can  understand, this expert tutor of many students for over 50 years explains  each of the characters canto by canto. The outline at the beginning is a  great help. While it is not as analytical as that of Erich Auerbach's  "Mimesis", this book is a valuable addition. It should prove  indispensable for those who need a companion guide; the homeschooler's  library should contain this erudite explanation 
 John 'Duke' Wayne (real name: Marion Morrison) may have done his best work ever here. He plays P.I. in Hawai'i (or is he 'just' Gov. Anti-Com- munist agent? See it; I don't want to give it  away) trailing commies giving away US military secrets, et, al, a-la the Rosenberg shysters that a courageous jewish-american judge had fried. Great film of the genre! Out long be fore either Hawai'ian Eye or the even better Hawai'i Five-0! Wayne was also offered the 'Dirty Harry' role by Director Don Siegel, before Clint Eastwood

 I have been using James Banks' Teaching Strategies for Ethnic Studies for teaching intercultural education at the college level for almost a dozen years and have yet to find one better. The first semester when I was preparing to teach the class, I had not yet chosen a book when, leaving our college library one day, I noticed an old edition of Banks' book on the give-away shelf. His name jumped out at me since he was noted in my doctoral studies as the foremost authority in the field at that time.   I read the book over Christmas break just before my course began and was ecstatic to find that such a learned author had compiled  chapter histories of ten major ethnic groups in the United States. These are histories that until recent times were never taught in schools. They are eye-openers in ethnic history from the eyes of those who experienced not only the Civil Rights era, but one to two centuries of the history of our country's ethnic groups before that. As a Caucasian, I was extremely impressed with Banks' extensive work, something no one else until his time had attempted to do, especially in one volume. Even after changing texts for two semesters, thinking students might appreciate something different, they begged me to return to an approach that would tell 'the stories' of suppressed peoples in the United States. I returned to Banks and plan to stay with him for the rest of my carrer.  In recent semesters, my students have been creating power points highlighting chapter histories in Banks (He's an excellent resource for that), resulting in some rich discussions that might not have happened otherwise. I have come to the conclusion that most of us don't live long enough to recall or appreciate the struggles of peoples who came before our time, especially those that were, up until now, seldom taught in our institutions. Banks book, especially the chapter histories, helps to fill that gap in our knowledge and lives. 
 I first heard about this band when the drummer John "Beatz" Holohan died on Halloween. I decided to grab the CD because i noticed that Devotion and Desire was a VERY good song. I only wished i had known about them sooner. This CD has many highpoints and is not repetitive(which seems to be a problem in some CDs). When you first listen to the Cd, you start thinking that its o.k. but then it grows on you. And suddenly, your hooked. The CD starts with a nice short starter that actually is very good. High Points: -Devotion and Desire  -Tortures of the Damned -Montauk -Blame it on Bad Luck -We'll be O.K. -Excisting in a crisis (Evelyn) -Dear Tragedy  Low Point -Don't Call Me Peanut  Overall, this CD is definitely deserves a listening 
 After having read a few reviews on 'Song of Susannah', it seems that this is a text that is either loved or loathed.  While I do agree that the most controversial decision Stephen King makes in the new DT books does detract from them (I will not say what that writing choice is as I do not want to spoil this for readers), I found this book to easily be the most enjoyable of the 3 'new' Dark Tower books.  Without the bloat of the final DT book (I like writing that is tight and to the point), or the overkill (and oddly placed story) of the 5th book, this novel weighs in at around 400 pages and it is tight and exciting throughout.  The book felt closer to the writing style of the first 3 fantastic DT books, and I even enjoyed this more than 'Wizard and Glass'.  If you are a DT fan you will most likely read all the books in the series, but you would be much happier if you stopped reading after this book.  I have no doubts that if you pick up DT7 and start reading it (and I know that you will), you will NOT be happy with how things turn out.  It's unfortunate that King couldn't have gone out on a high note with his final book, instead doing so here.  King does jump the shark with these final 3 novella, but I generally found book 6 to be an enjoyable read that I had hoped all of the final 3 books would be.  **** RECOMMENDE 
 Most folks have summarized the 8 points covered in the book,so I'll skip that. Overall, I think it's excellent, everyday advice. Being very familiar with Ric's DC area radio show, it pretty much matches what he says there. His advice is not for folks who read balance sheets, day trade, or speculate...on the contrary, it's for folks who have other things going on in their lives. True to Edelman's form, he presents this not as a "how to get rich" handbook, but more of a "here are some ideas to put you on the right path" guidebook, and that's the way personal finance should be. It's an interesting combination of being somewhat "hands off" with your situation, yet still pretty well in control.  Ric Edelman is pretty much the guy who introduced me to personal finance, and I credit his work with my enthusiasm for the subject. This is an excellent book, and I highly recommend it 
 the title describes the style.  brautigan would cast his line in and pull out an interesting specimen;each time holding it in the sunlight for us to see it's glistening body.  each short chapter in this cunningly crafted book is like that.  brautigan's use of the english language was imaginative and pure.  his observations are refreshing,sometimes madcap,sometimes surprisingly poignant but always originating in left field. there is nobody quite like brautigan;an original in every way.  don't be fooled by those who would consign him to a specific era;for his work, especially this book,is timeless.  
 A profoundly effective horror tale. Hodgson writes with a command of the language and has a seemingly thorough understanding of what it takes to raise the reader's gooseflesh. It surpassed my expectations, in terms of the thematic implications of the story that there are dark forces lurking below our perceptions of reality, forces that can and will strike without notice. Well-written and very effective in terms of the scares it provides, it will resonate with you long after you've read it, despite the fact it's an old fashioned ghost story. Those of us who are familiar with Lovecraft will readily detect the influence that Hodgson had on Lovecraft. Highly-recommended 
 The main building of the Fagus shoe factory in Germany provides a focus  for Annemarie Jaeggi's Fagus, a discussion of the history of modern  architecture, which reveals the factory's innovations and buildings. This  follows its construction from 1911 when it was designed and built through  the 1920s. While the focus is narrow, the book succeeds in documenting a  particular style and architectural legacy, and will be of interest to any  art library with a specific architectural focus 
 In this short biography of Mary Walker, Dale Walker gives glimpses into the history of medicine, the world of women's fashions, prisons of the Civil War, and the beginning of the campaign for women's vote. Mary Walker was born in 1832 in upstate New York to freethinking parents who insisted that the four girls work on the farm and wear clothing that allowed amble circulation of blood. Not only did she follow her father's suggestions for attire, she also followed him into the medical profession and became one of the first female doctors in the Unites States. Her father was self-taught; Mary graduated from Syracuse Medical College in 1849 and began the difficult task of finding patients who would pay to see a woman doctor. What the Civil War began, she volunteered as a physician and fought hard to be paid as a physician, not a nurse. She worked to stop battlefield amputations and to incorporate sanitary practices. Known as much for her brash, unrelenting behavior as her trousers, she became fodder for Civil War tabloids. Captured as a spy, Mary spent four months in Confederate prison where she schemed for prison reforms including better food and medical care. She was awarded the Medal of Honor in 1865, had it rescinded 1917 when Congress decided that too many medals had been awarded without merit, and reinstated in 1977. Her life spanned the Civil War and beyond. She saw women's roles changed from domestic work to physician. Just before she died in 1919, women were granted the right to vote.   Mary Walker is a terrific role model for today's girls- feisty, responsible, hard-working and not at all concerned about the fashion police. Well worth reading.

 I've been wanting this album for a few years now, and I finally got it as a birthday gift. Actually it ws the last one available (new) on this site for a looong while. The tracks on this CD  are not only filled with lots of energy, but they have awesome beats, and explosive lyrics. Baby D is a very skilled rapper, and he demonstrates his skills featuring other rappers, such as Lil Jon and the Eastside Boys, Pastor Troy, Lil' Flip and Ying Yang Twins (Songs made with the last two are not featured on this CD)Baby D showcases orignality and a high level of enjoyability. The Best tracks are Jumpin Down On Em, Don't Fall and Bow His Azz Up. This is a must have for any hip-hop fan 
 although it would be hard to classify this book exactly. The crisp, stark and sometimes impressionistic images are well suited to the tone of Chandler's prose. At first glance, it seems to be just a photo book of office buildings and tract homes from the Chandler era. But shots like the eucalyptus leaves melting over a street lamp or the pouty young woman in the swimming pool are striking visual parallels to Chandler writing about "crawling lava" or the "ashes of love." Plus the authors write perceptively about Chandler's relationship to the City of Angels 
 Author Eric Prentis, Ph.D. has written a great, easy-to-read book for anyone interested in stock and/or bond investing. "The Astute Investor" is a book that novices can grow into as Prentis covers the basics of investing, all underlying theories on investing, and the interplay of markets. It will also serve as a great reference book for those who have investing experience but need theory validation or information from time to time (we all do!). Prentis also includes extensive information on how to use the Internet to find current, valuable investing data.   In the author's own words:  	"The Astute Investor presents the collected wisdom from thirty-seven classic books on investing making it the essential investing classic and the one book to read to learn how to invest in the stock market."  Prentis has organized the "The Astute Investor" around the fundamental investing questions:  *	Investing Principles and Strategies o	What investing principles and strategies are important? *	Theory and Practice o	What investing theory and practice are fundamental for investors? *	Equity and Bond Fundamentals o	Is the stock market currently overvalued or undervalued? *	Stock Market Technical Analysis o	Is the stock market in a long-term uptrend or long-term downtrend? *	Trading Psychology o	Why do human emotions get in the way of intelligent investing? *	Intrinsic, Market, and Bargain Values o	How are intrinsic, true, or fair value, market value capitalization, bargain value, and margin-of-safety multiples calculated and what do they mean? *	Interest Rate Principles o	What interest rates should be monitored that typically indicate a long-term stock market top? *	Interpreting the News o	Why do stock market prices often respond "illogically" to the news? *	Being Contrarian o	Being contrarian sounds simple, why is it so difficult to implement? *	The Ten Step Method for Investing Success o	What is a practical and simple method for success? *	Retirement Planning o	How can retirement income be safely doubled? *	Discounted Capital Market Theory o	What new investing theories are the bases for investing success?  The book exceeds expectations and will serve as the only book a purchaser needs to invest with knowledge and confidence. This book could easily become the "gold standard" for explaining stock market investing to all investors - new and old.    
 I haven't listened to this album in awhile, until recently. I forgot how obsessed with Suede I really was! I like the first 2 albums more on a critical level(Suede, Dogmanstar)..but this album is just fun!! It plays like a Best Of album where every song is a single! Very glam influenced. I was listening to  CD2 of the "Filmstar" single the other day and it has Brett Anderson doing a duet with Neil Tennant from the Pet Shop Boys on "Saturday Night"..and Neil singing the PSB song "Rent" with Suede backing him up. Both versions are live!! Really Good stuff! This album reminds me of the summer of 97...listening to this CD over and over while driving in a car with no air conditioning in extremely hot weather...my girlfriend at the time nagging at me..."you need a job"...maybe the memories weren't as good as I remember!! 
 This is the most comprehensive, Bible-based prayer book I know of.  I recommend it for daily, personal devotional and for weekly, corporate worship 
 Sweet's book is great!  It's truly refreshing as it takes a non-typical look at leadership.  Sweet makes his view (or tune) understandable and applicable.  Learn how you can become a more effective leader by realizing the power of the small vibrations which can create such magnificent melodies.

 Perhaps one of the best book adaptations ever done.  Mr. Maxwell's work to keep the complexity of the issues in tact in order to tell the whole story is commendable.   Mr. Shaara's novel provided a great resource and Mr. Maxwell gave the visual display its magic.   The depth of the characters could be equallied only by the real characters themselves.   Mr. Duvall gave a performance expected of his talents.  Mr. Lang provided the quintessential "Stonewall" in all his intense humanity and passion in faith.   For the lover of history, the detail is exceptional.   It may drag too long for those wanting pure entertainment but for those wishing to immerse themselves in the time, this is the film where you can.   Admirers of "Stonewall" will especially appreciate this film.  Those unfamiliar with "Stonewall" will see why his character looms so large in our history as the ideal example of a man.   His intensity still shines forth more than a century later.   It is a melancholy movie that helps us live the horror of those days and recognize the complexity of war where there is no one who is clearly right or wrong in the end.    In addition, the special features including the interviews and the haunting music videos are superb.   I had the opportunity to preview this movie before its initial release in theatres and I am very pleased with the result that has survived in this DVD edition.   It was best on the big screen for the sense of scale and epic feel but let your imagination go back and come ride with Stonewall.  
 This is a very welcome issue, the three LPs and a raft of rare singles. Liza Minnelli was a teenager and given her vocal style the raw quality just pays off, there is an almost rock energy fed into standards and new material by the likes of Kander and Ebb. This is also the period when she most sounded like her mother, the power. Her instrument only wore down over her career even five years later. (Though the A&M material, due for this kind of issue, has a lot of interest too, particularly her early recordings of Randy Newman). Though "Cabaret" is her height, Fosse was her undoing as a singer and actress, those mannerisms took over. Here she is fresh and surprising; the same kind of difference between the early Streisand and later, though in Streisand's case she got too refeened, her voice airbrushed of feeling. Like early Frank Sinatra, Liza's just a different performer young. Success didn't enhance her abilities. I wouldn't trade this for all her later recordings. Hopefully the "Dangerous Christmas of Red Riding Hood" will be issued, which in spite of some odd Bob Merrill lyrics has a good Styne score and more Liza of this era.

 Peter Hopkirk's third installment of the Great game is as masterful as the first two.  Lenin's drive to take over the central Asian territories and hold the oil there inspires a true terror of what the great game had evolved into. From continuing intrigued in Afghanistan to the development of Iran as a major actor in the region come directly from this time period. The great game is one of the most interesting events in history and no one tells it better than Hopkirk. You will not believe that this book is true by the time you are done. It is utterly amazing what people will do for their countries when they are called upon to serve. The adventures of the great game should be read by everyone.  
      The European emigre writer Adorno is a major mid 20th century author identified with the Frankfurt School of social criticism. Although this School is usually described as having a Marxist perspective, the social criticism of Adorno is not doctrinaire or propagandistic. Adorno's writings--as this current publication testifies again--have stood the test of time for their acuteness, rigor, and application of first-rate intellectual powers to subjects of the contemporary society. These qualities of Adorno's critical thinking are evident as well in his work "In Search of Wagner." In a 20-page introductory foreword, the philosopher/social critic Slavoj Zizek takes up the question "Why Is Wagner Worth Saving?" Wagner's music, ideas, and biography continue to draw the attention of thinkers in various fields because exploration of these and positions reached regarding them yield insights and assessments on power, anti-Semitism, art, psychology, and politics in the modern world. Written in the late 1930s, "In Search of Wagner" demonstrates Adorno's innovative, timely, and valuable methodology as it grapples with central questions of modern culture 
 I read this book over the course of 2 days where it completly sucked me in.  The story was very complex. The main character, Jacob, discovers that his grandfather had cheated on his pregnant wife (Jacob's grandmother)during WW2 and had a child with her. The grandfather, also named jacob, comes across as a decent person though. No one ever knew this untill Gertruii, the women who had his illegimate child, tells relatives the truth after her husband dies and she is termianlly ill. Both Jacob's grandmother and Gertruii still after all these years mourn the death of his grandfather.   It is a very emotionally complex story. Jacob discovers things about himself and family that to him are surprising and life changing.  I was able to appreciate the story but I didn't overly enjoy it 
 When I decided to start exercising seriously I was 43.  I reviewed countless books to see which might help me and more or less serve as a "fitness trainer".  Pearl's book was unique.  I largely followed his regimen and advice and now I am 57 and still working out four times a week with weights.  His advice is right on target, intelligent, rational, honest, effective.  While I do not go for "records" any longer and am more or less on a "maintenance" program, at the age of 49 I bench pressed 405 pounds and undoubtedly could have gone higher in competition at body weight of 190 (and for a time considered competing in "Master`s" competitions).  I eventually went lower in body weight, to around 179-180 and didn't worry about pushing myself harder on lifts.  (I might add that when I first started lifting I weighed around 250 pounds.)  Today, just a couple of months from 58, I still follow Pearl`s guidelines.  They work, simply that.  And if one wants to be healthy and is not aiming at heavy lifting, great, his advice applies.  In fact, Pearl is first and foremost an intelligent guy whose first objective is health.  
 I read this book for the first time in late 2003 and finished the paperback version last week to prepare for the next in the series to be released in 2005.  I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel to Safe Harbor.  Radclyffe takes the inexperienced, but faithful, Reese and the jilted Tory down the road of starting their own family.  She also explores the relationship of the young lovers Brianna and Carre as they begin to cross over into adulthood.  Radclyffe delivers turmoil, mystery, problems with pregnancy, relationship fears, and so much more.  This book takes the reader on many emotional highs and lows, and is highly recommended by this reviewer 
 Aristotle's Proportional Equality           Aristotle does not believe in equality, but proportional equality. He believes that people are naturally different in their intelligence and moral qualities, that these qualities naturally give them differing arete (this word has been translated into:goodness, excellence, merit and virtue), and that they should naturally be given different political rights based on these arete. However, Aristotle does not have any viable methods for detecting the nature of people. Instead, he artificially locks rulers, citizens and slaves into three unequal classes based on wealth and birth, and he tries to appease the lower classes with deceptive schemes. From its very core, Aristotle's proportional equality is unfair and does not allow freedom.         In Book Three, Aristotle establishes the theory that political equality does not mean everyone getting the same as everyone else. He believes that different groups of people in the city have equally valid claims to political rights based on differing criteria. To him, the different interest groups are, "The people at large, the wealthy, the better sort, the one who is best of all, the tyrant" (1281a11)         In fact, Aristotle states that political equality for one of these groups will always be inequality for the other groups. He claims,         "For example, justice is considered to mean equality. It does mean equality-but equality for those who are equal, and not for all. Again inequality is considered to be just; and indeed it is-but only for those who are unequal, and not for all." (1280a7)         After rejecting the distribution of political rights according to the interests of various groups, Aristotle states that the right basis by which political rights should be conferred is the degree of arete one contributes to the city. Through this, proportional equality could be achieved. He writes,         "Those who contribute most to this association have a greater share in the city than those who are equal to them (or even greater) in free birth and descent, but unequal in civic excellence (arete), or than those who surpass them in wealth but are surpassed by them in excellence (arete)." (1281a2)          The rationale for this proportional equality based on arete is simple: the city "exists for the sake of a good life*" (1252b27), and the good life is only achieved with arete. Therefore, naturally those who have more arete should be given more political rights because they can best utilize the resources of the city to make life good for all. Aristotle establishes the full connection between good life of the city and arete in Book Seven.          This connection can be summarized as the following: the city is for the best life possible, the best life is the life of happiness, happiness requires action, and action is the exercise of "arete".  Aristotle first defines the good life as the life that aims at happiness. He says that the object of the city "is the best and highest life possible. The highest good is happiness..." (1328a26). Aristotle also proposes that "happiness is a state of activity; and the actions of just and temperate men bring many fine things to fulfillment." (1325a16) The purpose of activity or action, "praxis", however, is exactly to do or achieve "arete". Aristotle writes, happiness is realized by "the actualization and perfect practice (praxis) of goodness (arete)" (1328a26).           The structure of the differing arete is as follows: Aristotle states that the rulers/statesmen have the arete of good man which allows them to rule, the citizens have the arete of good citizen that allows them to rule and be ruled, and the non-citizens/slaves have only enough arete that they are condemned to obedience.           To Aristotle, the reason that people have different arete is that they naturally have different levels of intelligences and moral qualities. And since these qualities are what make a person and a city good, people are allotted proportionally equal but unequal political rights. On intelligence, he believes that some are just intrinsically better. For example, regarding slaves, he says,            "...(and this is the case with all whose function is bodily service, and who produce their best when they supply such service)-all such are by nature slaves...... if he participates in reason to the extent of apprehending it in another, though destitute of it himself." (1254b16)           On moral qualities, in Chapter One of Book Seven, Aristotle says that external goods are not as important as moral goods are for achieving happiness, however, only some are capable of achieving high morality. He says,         "you can see for yourselves that the happy life-no matter whether it consists in pleasure, or goodness, or both-belongs more to those who have cultivated their character and mind to the uttermost..." (1323a21)          In Chapter Two, he makes it clear that the statesmen and philosophers, in another word, the rulers are most fit for the cultivation of morality and intelligence, which combines to be their arete. And since the goodness of the state needs morality, those statesmen and philosophers should rule. He writes,         "Here, we may say, are the two ways of life-the political and the philosophic-that are evidently chosen by those who have been most eager to win a reputation for goodness (arete), in our own and in previous ages...for whether individuals or cities are in question, wisdom must aim at the higher mark." (1324a19)          Certainly, Aristotle is right in pointing out that there exist differences between people. For a state to operate well, the people who are more equipped for intellectual and moral tasks should have more political rights. And if there really are those who have no "deliberative elements" in their soul, then certainly those people should be under the command of a master if not a doctor. There is an identical interest between the good rulers and the ruled, which Aristotle rightly points out in Book One,         "The part and the whole, like the body and the soul, have an identical interest; and the slave is a part of the master, in the sense of being a living but separate part of his body. There is thus a community of interest, and a relation of friendship, between master and slave, when both of them naturally merit the position in which they stand." (1255b4)         From the above summarizations of Aristotle's positions, it is clear that Aristotle's whole theory of proportional equality is based his belief that some have better moral and intellectual capabilities. However, although these qualities are important, the test that Aristotle uses for determining them is not an equal educational system in which all could compete equally or some ingenious device for detecting people's IQ, rather, the test is about people's wealth and birth. These are not the right standards by which one's abilities could be judged upon, and thus Aristotle's theory fails.            The importance of money and wealth is explicit in Aristotle's differentiation of the citizens from the non-citizens/slaves (the mechanics and laborers' works have a "servile character" [1277a29] ), and less explicit in his differentiation between the citizens and the rulers/statesmen. The first differentiation is as follows,         "There are thus good grounds for the claims to honor which are made by people of good descent, free birth, or wealth, since those who hold office must necessarily be free men and pay the property assessment. (A city could not be composed entirely of those without means, ay more than it could be composed entirely of slaves.) But we must add that if wealth and free birth are necessary elements, the qualities of being just and being a good soldier are also necessary......The one difference is that the first two elements are necessary for the simple existence of a city, and the last two for its good life." (1283a3)        It is easy to look at the second part of this passage and be left with the impression that Aristotle is saying that money does not matter and that been just is the most important quality according to which one should be judged by. But the first part of this passage is far more important; it shows that Aristotle is building a city for the better off. As shown later in the book, Aristotle does not even consider the majority of the city citizens of the city. He says, "the conclusion which clearly follows is that we cannot regard the elements which are necessary for the existence of the city......as being `parts' of the city..." (1328a21). While the wealthier people must strive for intelligence and morality, try to be just and exercise their sacred political rights, the poor people are forgotten and are not even given the chance in the good constitution that Aristotle talks about.         Although it is obvious that wealth and birth are not "natural" qualities that define people, Aristotle still insists throughout the book that the non-citizens/slaves are naturally inferior. Aristotle believes they have no arete other than those that allow them to be subservient to others. In Book One, he says about the slaves,          "...in treating of slaves, that they were useful for the necessary purposes of life. It is clear, on that basis, that they need but little goodness (arete); only so much, in fact, as will prevent them from falling short of their duties through intemperance or cowardice." (1260a24)         This idea of "naturalness" is easily disprove by the fact that Aristotle later says that what really makes the non-citizens/slaves, the mechanics and laborers, naturally bad is that they have no time for arete and the cultivation of their souls. He argues,         "The best form of city will not make the mechanic a citizen. Where mechanics are admitted to citizenship we shall have to say that the citizen excellence (arete) of which we have spoken cannot be attained by every citizen, by all who are simply free men, but can only be achieved by those who are free from the necessary tasks of life." (1278a8)       This argument is nonsensical. All along, Aristotle has been saying that those who should receive no political powers are borne lacking the qualities that contribute to their arete. But here, by saying that citizens who do no hard-labor are better than mechanics and laborers simply because they have more time, Aristotle is indicating that the lower class lacks arete because of their lack of education, which is a social, not natural result. This is a gross contradiction.         The second differentiation between that of citizens and ruler/statesmen is trickier. Aristotle superficially says that the two are equal, but subtly there is difference.        The arete of the good citizens is to both be ruled and to rule. Aristotle writes,         "...the fact remains that the good citizen must possess the knowledge and the capacity requisite for ruling as well as for being ruled, and the excellence (arete) of a citizen may be defined as consisting in `a knowledge of rule over free men from both points of view'"(1277b7)            Aristotle frequently mentions this view that the ruler/statesman and the citizens are political equals and should rotate positions. He says in Book One that "the rule of a statesman is rule over free and equal persons." (1255b20) He also says in Book Three when he tries to define citizenship that, "the citizen in this strict sense is best defined by the one criterion that he shares in the administration of justice and in the holding of office." (1275a19)                          However, hypocrisy emerges when he defines the arete of ruler/statesmen, who are the only good men. Contrary to before, he differentiates between rulers and the citizens, and makes one class higher than the other. Aristotle says "practical wisdom is the only form of excellence (arete) which is peculiar to the ruler... the virtue (arete) of a person being ruled is not practical wisdom but correct opinion." (1277b16)           This is strange. If "practical wisdom" is what distinguishes the ruler from the ruled, then, when the ruler becomes a citizen again, is he suppose to loss his "wisdom" and become someone who only has "opinion"? And if the citizens are suppose to have "a knowledge of rule from both points of view" as mentioned above, why is Aristotle saying here that they are only capable of "opinions", which is far inferior to knowledge.          Aristotle seems to be trying to fool most of the citizens into believing that they have equal rights as those who are ruling, while disenfranchising their rights at the same time. Aristotle does not explicitly say that wealth and birth would decide who should rule, but it follows from the arguments before regarding free time that they must. While many people could qualify as citizens if they are moderately well off (1279a25, in polity, the property requirement for citizenship is only arms), and could hence afford some leisure to cultivate their arete, but those most wealthy people who could spend all of their time for the cultivation of their soul must be the ones with the best qualities to rule.          To be sure, this hypocrisy in another form is apparent right from the First Book in Aristotle's discussion regarding woman. Although he calls the relationship between husband and wife the relationship of statesmen and citizens, he in fact subjugates women to man. He writes,          "In most cases where rule of the statesman's sort is exercised there is an interchange of ruling and being ruled: the members of a political association aim by their very nature at being equal and differing in nothing...the relation of the male to the female is permanently that in which the statesman stand to his fellow citizens." (1259a37)          Aristotle is offering a grand contradiction within the space of a paragraph. He defines the relationship between masters and citizens as equal just before he says that one is "permanently" subjugated to the other, and yet, he still maintains that this relationship is indeed equal.            To be certain, Aristotle is right in that even today, those who are of good birth and wealth are more likely to be suitable for higher social positions than those who are from lower social-economic backgrounds. And when one looks at the current President of the USA, one could trace his family's wealth and fame three generations back. However, these people who are borne in families of higher social status are only what they are because of the good family influence and the good education they had.         The President went to the best of boarding schools, of universities and of businesses schools and his father was everything from the head of the USA to the head of the CIA; how is it fair to compare him to the Hispanic dish-washer whose parents worked illegally in that restaurant off the high-way, and who despite all eagerness to learn had to stay home to take care of his five younger siblings when he should have gong to highschool?        Aristotle is right in saying that people should achieve what their nature allows them to achieve, but he does not allow people's true nature to come into being. If slaves are given as much opportunity to study and work, then some of them surely will become philosophers, poets and other politicians. A city that allows that would be the city that is capable of achieving the best life possible for everyone.        Aristotle was intelligent, but he lacked the humility to realize that he did not know everything about human nature. There is nothing wrong with proportional equality, because the better should have, and have always had more power in states, but the key is how to find those good people who could contribute more to the arete of the society. Aristotle pointed out some of the right qualities that they need, but he wrote the Politics from the vantage point of the higher class, and classified people not according to their true abilities, but according to their social and economic conditions. In order to appease the lower social classes, he deceived them by giving them the rights of citizenship or by simply telling them that they are intrinsically incapable. And even for those who were citizens, he still tricks them into believing that they have more political rights they than really do. In this world, there is certainly no equality, not even traces of proportional equality, but most importantly, there is no freedom. There simply can be no freedom when people are locked into castes and can not realize their full potentials. 
 This is a great book.  As someone who was recently diagnosed with IBS and whose doctor didn't tell me much, this helped answer all of my questions 
 The Mask of Zorro is a superb score that I highly reccomend.    1. The Plaza of Execution is a very exciting track. It blends some great spanish music, with some great Horner action cues, and even a grand rendition of the Zorro theme.  2. Elana and Esperanza is a heart wrenching track. It begins as Don Diego comes home to his wife and baby daughter. By the end of the track, his wife is dead, and his daughter is stolen from him. A very emotional and intense track.  3. The Ride, is a major let up from track 2, it is fun, exciting, loud, and fast! A great action track by Horner.  4. Elana's Truth, is a sweet, emotional track.  5. The Fencing Lesson, is full of awesome percussion, full force spanish guitars, and fun orchestrations.  6. Tornado in the Barracks is like the fencing lession, only a bit more intense.  7. The Confession, is a bit more toned down than you become used to, and it actually is a welcome break.  8. Zorro's Theme. An awesome, sweeping, emotional track in the tradition of Horner's drama scores.   9. The Mine is a short, dark, almost creepy track.  10. Stealing The Map is a suspensful, fun, action oriented track.  11. Leave No Witnesses, is an entertaining, fun, and exciting track.  12. Diego's Goodbye is another emotional track. Very impressive.  13. I Want To Spend My Lifetime Loving You, James Horner can write Pop ballads. Dud 
 This book was exactly what I needed! It is a simple story with a simple message. The main character, Sam Bennent is given the gift of "hearing what God hears", the innermost thoughts of a person's soul, thus he is able to approach strangers, and speak to them of their spiritual needs. Some get angry and turn away, but others recognize their own need and are open to Christ. In this way Sam, and the others that begin to witness with him, learn how to do the work of a true Christian.  The message of the story though, is that Sam, nor anyone else, does not have to know a persons specific need in order to witness, all that is needed is the knowledge that Christ is the answer. This is a story that all Christians should read, and then act upon 
 This book really does have a lot of ideas and techniques that have helped me improve my own efforts at watercolor 
 I came to beastie boys on the back of vague recommendations from a mate, not knowing what to expect. Initially, i got licensed to ill, which i enjoyed for what it is, but it was not the stuff i had been recommended. I moved to check your head, and was pleasantly surprised at songs like pass the mic, so what'cha want, live at pjs. Since then, I have been ABSOLUTELY blown away by this album. There is no other album i know of that combines punk-rock, metal, acid jazz, funk, world beats, and hip-hop, in the same album, sometimes even in the same song. And it makes for a great mix.  Not only is this album a great mix of styles, but it is produced crisply, with the vocals mixed down slightly to become an accompaniment to the rest of the instruments, synths blending seamlessly in and out of the music, and the tribal beats laying the foundation for some great songs. The beasties manage to record and mix accordingly for the style of each song style they attempt.  And they attempt a lot. Songs like 'The Update', 'Futterman's Rule' are a psychedelic funk-fest, with tribal world beats as a backbone,synths everywhere and funky guitar licks, i cant help but love them. Songs like 'Sabotage' and 'Heart Attack Man' make for a change of pace, with great punk metal riffs, and fast heavy drum beats. My personal favourite simply for its ingenuity and awesome sound is flute loop; who else but the Beasties could take a folk sounding flute riff, and bring it into the hip-hop world with funky beats, mad scratches and mad lyrics? No one, thats who.  Ultimately, there is something here for a fan of every type of music.I recommend this album to anyone who loves funk, punk, hip-hop, or jazz.  My recommendations are: The Update, Futterman's Rule, Flute Loop, Sure Shot, Heart Attack Man, B-Boys making with the Freak Freak.  Enjoy 
 This truly is a great guide for woman who want pointers on how to improve their look.  It takes you back to the basics: consider your shape first, then your measurements and lastly the latest trend.  Since I am not into the latest trend (I'm more classic), I desperately needed to know what shape category I fell.  I'm an obscure "C."  This tidbit of information is crucial for me when I step into the store.  It leads me in the right path. The reason I didn't rate this book 5 stars is that you get lost in some of the fashion lingo.  It would have been nice to have an illustrated glossary of some the key terms used.  I'm too lazy to look them up online.  
   I write a lot of reviews on books,but seldom write one on a product.However; I feel like breaking my trend by reviewing this lite.I,like I suppose,just about everyone else,keep looking for the lite that is right for all people,for all purposes.If It exists,I haven't seen it yet.The plain ordinary battery flashlight has remained essentially the same since I got my first as a kid,60 years ago. They often fail you when they are needed,batteries are expensive,but overall they serve a purpose. About 50 years ago ,a hand held magneto lite appeared.As long as you kept squeezing it,it gave a light comparable to a normal flashlght.It was similar to a lite sold for use on a bicycle,where it was powered by the turning of the wheel.However; as soon as the bicycle stopped ,the light went out. For some reason,they disappeared off the market.A few years ago,a new almost similar magneto lite appeared.The biggest difference is, it made a lot of noise when squeezed.They don't appear to have been very popular.  This Faraday principle Lite has been made very popular due to  TV ads, More because what they don't say than what they do say,many people are disappointed upon getting one.   The ad flouts the idea that it can be seen for up to a mile.So what!,we learned in the military, that a lit cigarette can be seen hundreds of yards away at night.So,if that's not you were looking for,it is meaningless to you.In fact,it is very poor at casting light on a suface more than a few feet away.For this purpose ,it can't begin to compete with a normal flashlight;and if that's what you want,forget it.As a matter of fact,those little LED keychain lites can do just as much;and can be picked up for a buck at the "Dollar Stores". They last for a couple of years,weigh next to nothing,and you'll always have one with you.I Leave them around the house  and they are handy to look for something in a dark spot,or for the occasional time you need to find a circuit breaker panel or find your way in a power failure.    These lites are so weak you can't assume they will meet your expectations in a store,or from watching a TV ad.My advice is try and compare with a Key Chain lite,one might serve you as well as the other,at a huge difference in cost.  
 In regard to the plot and story- The Time Machine is head and shoulders above other Wells stories. The story and plot are eerily believable (in regard to future society), and very interesting. Wells obviously wants to make a point about the dangers of having a society with large, clear class distinctions and tries to make the connection between class distinction and oppression. This is clearly a belief coming from socialism.   Although the philosophy and politics behind this science fiction story are lacking (for me personally)- I thoroughly enjoyed the story itself. The development of the story comes along nicely- enticing the reader to indulge his imagination just a little bit more. I enjoy stories that always keep you guessing, and The Time Machine is a story that keeps you on your feet. Who are the good guys? What happened to the machine? What are the fuzzy things? What are the dark-dwelling beings? These and other questions reflect the suspense aspect of this story. The book is very short and easy to read. I read it easily in one evening. I don't consider myself a fan of science fiction- but this book was enjoyable through and through. 
 Even that I am not a core fan of anime, I could appreciate the  beauty and history of this series. The end is coming near, don't miss this 4 chapters 
 I was a Bernhardt "virgin" before this book, and it's made me want to read all his others, in spite of the fact that they'd have different protagonists.  I understand most of his books feature Ben Kincaid,an attorney, and his office staff, but this one features a protagonist named Susan who is fighting many battles, most of them pretty intense.  For one, she is battling depression over the loss of her husband. This one battle is pretty significant, as it either leads to or exacerbates all her other challenges. The reader isn't clued in to how her husband died until really late in the book, and that's just as well because it would be a distracting revelation earlier.  When this revelation does take place, there's so much else going on that it loses some of its distracting potential and becomes instead what it really should be: simply an explanation so that we can gauge what Susan is dealing with in her mind and NOT spend a ton of time thinking about the husband himself.  Another battle she is fighting is against her alcoholism, and I must admit that several times I wanted to just toss the book against a wall because I really disliked Susan. I mean, REALLY disliked her. It's tough to like someone who is so firmly situated in a denial phase, someone who not only refuses to acknowledge how much trouble SHE is in, but also how much pain she is causing everyone around her. When she begins to work with Darcy, an autistic savant, I want to yell at him "run fast! run far! she can only bring you great pain and upheaval!" But of course, all of this is pretty much what the family and friends of alcoholics go through: pain and upheaval, to put it very mildly. Susan is at her most frustrating, and her most human, when she (time after time after time after. . .) says or thinks that one little drink will just take the edge off. One little drink won't hurt anything at all. And why shouldn't she drink? After all, she reasons, she's had a bad day. A very bad day.   Her battle to get that niece back after she is removed from Susan's home is one I found particularly heartbreaking, but not because I wanted Susan to get custody of her niece. I found myself cheering each time Susan's attempts to get her niece back failed. An excellent cop and a great  person most of the time with Darcy, Susan is a failure as a custodial "parent" to her niece. There are hints of what that niece might have been exposed to during the time she lived with Susan after the hubby's death. And Susan's inability to cope even to the minimal point of understanding the reality of her situation means that she is the worst person to be caring for a teenager who's already experienced loss and needs stability and compassion rather than upheaval and neglect.  You might think I hate this protagonist, but the opposite is true. I hated her blindness and her unwillingness to confront her reality, but that made her an excellent protagonist. I would imagine she is like many alcoholics: blind to the consequences of her actions, very much willing to play the victim, refusing to do what is right for others and focusing only on her own needs and desires. In other words, she's a "realistically-drawn" protagonist.  The story is excellent. It's beautifully constructed and suspenseful. There's enough humor in it to make the tough stuff (and there's lots of tough stuff, as you can imagine) bearable over long periods. I really liked the switching back and forth between Susan, Darcy, and the killer. That gives the reader a chance to understand each character in a way that makes Susan the primary protagonist, but not the only person of interest. I fell half in love with Darcy, and I even found a tiny bit of sympathy in my heart for the killer.  If this one  novel is any indication, Mr. Bernhardt has a knack for drawing realistic characters who engage the reader on a more than "Oooo, I love this person" level. I don't love Susan, but I wish her flawed self lots of good luck in the future. That's something, considering how difficult a character she is to like at all.  Kudos, Mr. Bernhardt 
 I adore this mini changer!  I don't have to lug baby, a diaper bag AND my purse.  Now I can focus more on my daughter!  I do wish it had a shoulder strap, but the wrist strap works fine 
 This book really helped coalesce in my mind that sometimes it's not the party, it's the man.  By serving Presidents from both parties, Gergen forces Republican and Democratic readers to set aside their party loyalty to confront the reality that both parties have had recent Presidential successes and failures.  For example, I was a proud Reagan youth who didn't vote for Clinton in 1992 However, by 1996 I had to admit that Clinton was doing an excellent job of leading the country in spite of my party's obstructionist activities that only hurt the country.  Gergen explains how Clinton was able to overcome and succeed in spite of opponents intent on political destruction rather than serving their country.  Gergen also provides excellent examples of what many of us realized by 1984 about Reagan, that while his rhetoric mainly appealed to the conservative right, Reagan was truly a President to all Americans and governed from the middle.  If are you interested in presidential politics and care more about the country than you do about your party, this is a great case study.  If you are a senior manager responsible for large numbers of people, this book is also an excellent manual on managerial success using your own style and approach.  If you are looking for ammunition to do battle against ideological opponents, this is not the book for you 
 About 20 years ago, I bemoaned the lack of heroes in our society. The "anti-heroes", the good-bad guys had taken over and there were only the ones you love to hate in the spotlight. Cormack McCarthy wrote the first volume of his trilogy around the same time and  I found some of the heroes I'd been looking for. McCarthy hasn't created his cowboy heroes, he communicated or maybe "channeled" them. It really seems to me that like some of the ancient storytellers, he  serves as a medium for the ancient voices. That is not meant to minimize Mr. McCarthy's talent. No-one has been more successful as he in capturing the language and personalities of real cowboys.  "Cowboy" is more than a little ambiguous in our language. Some use the word to describe those who would take advantage of opportunities to scratch advantage from others without regard to conventional ethics or morality but for me and others, it suggests the rugged individualist who follows his own path, his own code, in the pursuit of his goals. Maybe there's no place for cowboys in our current society and maybe that's too ba 
 It is hard to describe the music of Explosions in the Sky without waxing poetic.  No simple sentence can describe the music here - it shimmers and gleams and dances beautifully and it in and of itself is a kind of poetry borne of duel meloncholy guitars and steady, forceful drums.  For any guitar rock enthusiast - and I'm talking to you Mogwai, Godspeed You Black Emperor fans - this is a must.  Listening to Explosions in the Sky is a religious experience, invariably.  Just listen to Your Hand in Mine and try not to feel the glory 
 I'd really only rate this four stars, but I'm compensating for some of the ignorant people who gave this one star for their own non-musical reasons. Ice-T, while not to everyone's taste, is an intelligent, literate, and powerful writer/performer, and his messages have more to do with empowerment, responsibility, and self-respect than most other artists in any genre. At any rate, this CD, while good, is not his best work (go with "Power" or "O.G. - Original Gangster", or start with his "Greatest Hits - The Evidence"). Nevertheless, a fine CD, with strong beats, little production clutter, and well-articulated messages delivered in Ice-T's strong style 
 Fair Weather has the greatest characters. It's a great book for young readers. It's 1983 in this novel. The boy talking in the novel had very good explanation of his story or novel. Aunt Euterpe sent a letter about a fair in Chicago but Rosie, the boy, and Buster haven't been to Chicago. They are wondering how it will be in Chicago. If you want to know the rest read this book. You will be amazed of how this book, Fair Weather can change your mood, so buy it today 
 I absolutely loved this novel! The timeliness of the reality-based plot in the framework of an epic that spans the globe made for a lot of reading enjoyment. I usually don't get an opportunity to read until we put the kids to sleep and by then I'm usually too tired. I got a copy of this book just before a two week vacation and had a hard time putting it down long enough to enjoy my trip. I found myself eager with anticipation for the chance to crawl beneath the covers each night and return to the captivating Winter in Kandahar story.   The novel begins a short time prior to September 11, 2001 in the northeast corner of Afghanistan where the Northern Alliance remains precariously in control of territory that includes the Panjshir Valley where the Alliance Mujaheddin are making what appears to be their last stand against the combined forces of the Taliban and al-Qaeda. The main character of the novel, young ill-fated fighter Ahmed Jan, is on the front lines of the see-saw battles that have seen his entire family wiped out. As shaky as the Northern Alliance situation is, it's made all the worse by the assassination of revered Northern Alliance leader Commander Ahmed Massoud at the hands of al- Qaeda in chapter 2. Ironically, in this their darkest hour, the Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington D.C. turn out to be salvation for the Tajik, Uzbek and other groups of the Northern Alliance who are resisting the cruel Taliban domination. Within weeks, U.S. Special Forces, Air Force, Navy, and other military units sweep the Taliban out of Kabul, Taloqan, Kandahar, and other major cities of Afghanistan and put them on the run, along with their al-Qaeda guests, into the Pakistani tribal territories along the Afghan border. Ahmed Jan finds a mysterious communiquï¿½ in the coat of an al-Qaeda messenger and, along with ruthless Mujaheddin fighter Mustafa and old, rigid holy man Mohammajon, gets swept into an adventure that spans the globe from Islamabad to Amsterdam to Venice to Seattle to Vancouver to Karachi and back to Kandahar. This engrossing epic story includes CIA operatives and Special Forces soldiers interwoven with three love stories with very different endings. The adventure concludes with a movingly heartrending, surprise finale. I must be a romantic at heart too, because I enjoyed the romances. It's hard to believe the previous reviewer was writing about the romance between the Tajik fighter Mustafa and the nurse Fatima in the Pakistani Hospital because it's so central to the plot. I guess she was referring to the pubescent romance between the young American scientist and his student. I guess the author could have omitted it, but I enjoyed it, and it helped to break up what otherwise could have been too heavy.   I highly recommend this book for both women and men who are fans of international thrillers

 I enjoy Nancy Friday's perspective on things but it seems that this book is reflective of a yearning to be externally acknowledged. Better off reading Transcendent Beauty by Crystal Andrus 
 There's no doubt that Cracker is an outstanding series, whatever the medium.  However, this transfer to DVD is disappointing.  The packaging is nice, but a series like this deserves all the best, rather than mere eye-candy.  I can't recall if Cracker was originally televised in the States with something other than 4:3 aspct ratio, but at least one of these discs reveals that the original aspect ratio was something other than the 4:3 this package delivers.  In "One Day a Lemming Will Fly" the edges of the opening credits are actually clipped and, presumeably, so is the rest of the disc, and all the others:  none of the episodes in this set are anything other than 4:3.  It's a crying shame that one of the best mystery series in the history of the genre is given second rate treatment.  Thank the Good Lord for inspired comapnies, like Criterion, that give fine films all of the loving care they deserve

 I'd be stating the obvious and preaching to the choir if I said that care of lenses for SLR cameras required a decent lens cap.  This one snaps into 58mm threads on the end of many lenses (Canon and otherwise), so just be sure to confirm that that it's the proper size for your lens 
 When I first checked this book out from the library I did something that I've never done with a cookbook before--I sat down and just read it. The author is so entertaining, witty, and engaging that I just liked reading the recipe descriptions, punk points, tips from Fizzle the cat, and litte vignettes that are woven into the book.  Then I started cooking. Oh, the scones! Amazing! The TLTs (tempeh, lettuce, tomato)! Wonderful! So many recipes, so little time.  So of course I returned the book to the library and bought my very own copy to drool over and treasure and love and sleep with under my pillow. OK, so I exaggerate, but not much.  The only downside is that many of the entrees call for tempeh, seitan, or tofu, and I don't use those products very often. But when I do, I know that Isa will give me a good recipe. But there are enough other recipes that I think it's balanced overall. And Isa convinced me to try roasted brussels sprouts on pizza. Crazy, I know, but it was SO GOOD.  Yesterday I also got Isa's newest book, Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World. It's also wonderfully entertaining and I can't wait to start baking. I'm thinking of buying Vegan with a Vengeance and Vegan Cupcakes for all of my friends this Christmas--and none of them are vegan. No matter! Our vegan vengeance and cupcakey goodness will take over the world 
     Aerosmith is a real enigma in rock history;  a band that was nothing short of brilliant in its first era through "Night In The Ruts", and the original line-up reformation of "Done With Mirrors" that turned into a cliche of themselves.     Not that it mattered - new listeners dug "Permanent Vacation" and the new crop of albums, while the old school hated the new work.   Aerosmith is rich beyond their wildest dreams, and probably doesn't care about the opinions of the fans who brought them into prominence in the first place.     "Toys In The Attic" was the third release for this Boston band, and the Stones/Yardbirds hybrid sound coalesced into their own style that was only hinted at on the first two releases.   The title track rips, and the blues swing hard on "Uncle Salty" and "Adam's Apple", a funny story of the Garden of Eden.   The classic "Walk This Way" follows, with its funky rhythms and impossible to not love guitar riff.   Tyler's lyrics are smart, witty and urban.   It can be said that rappers and hip-hop musicians probably learned a lot from his lyric style, the re-making of the tune with Run-DMC providing proof of that argument, although the original is far better.      "Toys In The Attic" isn't the toughest Aerosmith - that would come next with the unbelievable "Rocks" album.   It is probably, however, the best songwriting the band did overall.         This, "Rocks" and the first two albums, "Aerosmith" and "Get Your Wings" are the best the band had to offer, and that was a lot.   Too bad they've resorted to cheap Rich Little impersonations of themselves and released way too many hits packages.   Time to call it a day, boys 
 This reviewer has recently been on a regional-retro film fest of my own, watching the Minnesota branch of the Graduate's off-spring: (the Heartbreak Kid; Foolin' Around,) and decided it was high time to revisit their roots.  I'm glad I did.  The Graduate is still prime Boomer comfort and soul food.   And I learned a lot from the extras on this "Special Edition:" For instance: Dustin Hoffman as Benjamin and Director Mike Nichols are  *not* attempting some grandiose JesusChrist Superstar (Oops! Wrong Movie ;-)  symbolism when Ben is pounding on the upstairs window in the church - it was a pragmatic solution to the real parish pastor's  concern that they were gonna break his beautiful bequested glass if Dustin/Benjamin continued pounding on it like he had at rehersals - better to disperse the pressure! All in all, still fantastic after all these years!  /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer 
 This is an extremely useful and easy to understand guide on how to connect with your Angels for higher guidance.  It's down to earth and so simple and effective that anyone can truly meeting their angels and receive divine guidance on important future issues to come. If anyone is currently feeling blocked and frustrated with their own spiritual development, this will enable them to remove the blocks and move forward. A great insightful book well worth every penny 
 This is a book that I have to force myself to read, despite the fact that I love it dearly. The first time that I ever read it I was reduced to tears several times and even now, almost twenty years later, I still have to steel myself before dipping into it again. This is a book about a lost world, the moments when the Roman Empire in the West flickered and died and the black cloak of the Dark Ages descended, almost swamping the light of civilisation. This is a book about the start of the fall of Roman Britain as it began to fall under the sway of the Saxon barbarians. This is a book about a small group of people who, as in the title, became lanternbearers, trying to keep alight the flame of civilisation as the darkness and chaos of the Dark Ages threatened to swamp Britain. It is not a cheerful book for obvious reasons, and as such is more for older children who are starting to look into darker literature. It is a book that deals in issues such as anger, despair, revenge, fortitude and resolution. It is also a book about loss, about what Britain lost when the English came, and speaking as a Welshman it has more than once reduced me to tears 
 I bought this TV because it has a narrow bezel- every other 32 inch LCD I saw  (with the exception of a Walmart Ilo) was wider, and I was limited by a built in cabinet the device had to fit in.  I had doubts about ordering something like this online, but have had no trouble at all, and counting tax, saved $300 over the Best Buy advertised sale price.  The box came in less than a week, intact, and the TV hooked up easily and works great. Very good picture and much better sound than my last TV- I haven't hooked any external speakers   
 I thank Lederman and Hill for making me aware of how nave was my simple notion of symmetry. Very likely, few scientists outside of physics had more than an inkling of what symmetry means before having read this book. The word" symmetry" connotes something to most of us, but few of us recognize symmetry to be the linchpin for what is (or might not be). "Exhilarating" best describes my new appreciation, as I re-read parts of Symmetry, my notes, the authors' notes, and my notes on their notes...and to feel the satisfaction that derives from dissolving each little bit of ignorance in physics. 
 This book gives a positive explanation of how and why this automotive "revolution" is happening.  It makes a positive case for PHEV's, but it does not get too technical. It has a good set of references in the notes, in case you want check anything for yourself. I enjoyed the book, but I`m a bit biased. I go to things like the Hybridfest and have a CalCars bumper sticker on my car.  I'm an electrical engineer and following Plug-in Hybrid vehicle progress is my current passion. 
 I find "Photoshop  for Nature Photographers : A Workshop in a Book" to be a great book to add to your PhotoShop library.  It adds some great insight by several of the world's best known nature photographers.  Any book that has instructional information from John Shaw, Arthur Morris, Charles Glatzer, and Joe McDonald is well worth the investment.  One of the most difficult aspects of PhotoShop for me has been the effective use of curves.  Tim and Ellen do a much better job at helping with this complex matter than any other book I have read.  The effective utilization of PhotoShop requires as much of an artistic approach as it does as workflow approach.  Tim and Ellen do a very good job of fully developing a great workflow while introducing their own artistic approach.  No one book can every include all the aspects of PhotoShop that you will every need.  However, "Photoshop for Nature Photographers : A Workshop in a Book" does a great job of specilizing for nature photographers.  As with any workshop, it does require the student to do some work to get the most out of the class.  I recommend this book to any nature photographer who would like to improve their utilization and knowledge of PhotoShop. 
 The Witch of Blackbird Pond is Elizabeth George Speare's (1908-1994) second novel. It won the Newbery Medal with full votes in 1959, five years after its publication. Similarly to her previous "Calico Captive", Elizabeth George Speare draws her inspiration for this historical novel for young adults from real events. In "Calico Captive" it was Susanna Johnson's captivity, while in "The Witch of Blackbird Pond" episodes of witch hunting, that had taken place in the Author's hometown of Wethersfiled, Connecticut in 1648 and 1650-51, are the basis for a breathtaking story .  It is 1687, year of fighting of the Connecticut colonies to preserve their Charter menaced by the English, when young Kit Tyler, after the death of her grandfather in Barbados, decides to go live with her only relatives in Wethersfiled Connecticut, one of the many settlements on the Connecticut River. At her arrival  in her new home she finds a colony of Pilgrims of strict confession which reluctantly accept her as long as she "behaves" according to their unwavering rules. Her adoptive family is sincere, but mentally and emotionally closed, except maybe for her cousin Mercy, physically handicapped. Slowly Kit adapts to her new environment, but she cannot renounce her true character, her curiosity, her need of culture and spontaneous affection. She befriends a forlorn and neglected child, Prudence and an old and estranged Quaker woman, Hannah Tupper, two outcasts of society, and because of  her sincere affection and care is accused of witchcraft. Through hardships and real dangers and the help of true friends she finally finds out who she is and what she wants.   Three intermingling love stories make the plot even more captivating and the book is hard to put down once started. All the characters are lifelike and perfectly described and unforgettable, from cousin Mercy (modelled on Elizabeth George Speare's real aunt who was physically disabled), to Nat Eaton, the nicest, most sarcastic and challenging young man encountered in young adult literature, to Prudence the unpromising child who turns out to be Kit's most successful pupil and ultimate saviour.   I learned many years after having read the novel in 1967 that this book is today used as a text in English classes in elementary and middle school. Surely it contains many elements to dwell upon and it is hard to forget that Elizabeth George Speare was a teacher particularly dedicated to the study of childhood in the early days of American history. The historical setting of the novel is absolutely perfect with real characters such as Sir Edmond Andros and the royalist Rev. Gersholm Bulkeley that play the role they had in history. The detailed historical research behind the book is also evident from many elements: the pointing out of religious differences, the anti-Quaker bigotry, the psychological explanation based on ignorance of the fear of witchcraft, the difficulty of living in a Pilgrim entourage for a person with sound Faith but educated according to different models.  Elizabeth George Spear's knowledge of adolescent problems is evident as well in the way she conveys the sense of feeling a stranger in a different world and in the attempt to fit in while maintaining independence. Another very New Englandish emotion one gets from the book is the beauty of the changing of seasons from the glory of autumn, to the first snow that can be understood only by people who have lived there.  After so many years, I ask myself how much influence can a writer have on children. Elizabeth George Speare had an enormous influence on me in particular, but I think she did on many through the development of an instinct of independence and especially of compassion and acceptance. I want to remember that in the acceptance speech for the Newbery Medal for "The Witch of Blackbird Pond" she said.. "I do not believe a historical novel should gloss over the pains and the ugliness. But I do believe that the hero .. should on the last page.. still be standing, with the strength to go to whatever the future may hold."  Another small notation, near the end of the book there is a recall to the poetry of  Anne Bradstreet (1612-1672), the first woman poet of American literature, for a long time ignored and forgotten by many and only recently rediscovered in her actuality. Mrs. Speare's citation of her shows us not only her culture and knowledge of early American history but also stimulates the reading of these beautiful poems that immerge us into the atmosphere of "The Witch of Blackbird Pond". 
 Forever Will You Suffer, a first novel by Gary Franks, plays out like a film, with strong and eerie visuals, some genuine shocks, and a lingering feeling of creepiness.  I strongly recommend it 
 A very intense book on print making. A must have book for serious artists, who want to expand in their field. Lots and lots of contacts in back of book maiking it easy to find anyone you need for print making! A 
 We bought Blue and her friends for my dauhgter's second birthday. She LOVES them. She has to carry them around with her. Definatley a good buy if your child loves Blue 
 In reading reviews of this book before I myself opened it, I was a bit 'intimidated' by the mentions of this story being an obvious commentary on Middle-eastern countries and their politics...knowing little about that myself.  I tried to enjoy the book as an autonomous work of fiction, not an allegory for anything, really....and finished it with the thought that perhaps I would have enjoyed it more if I DID indeed have that basis of understanding of what Rushdie was trying to accomplish with his words here.  Having read several other novels by the same author, The Satanic Verses, The Moors Last Sigh, and Fury included, I had hoped for the same 'easy to digest and interpret' tale....but unfortunately that isn't what I encountered.  The novel opens with three sisters giving birth to one child (yes, you read that right) and follows his rise to 'power' in life, though the narrative strays some ways from this central character, and from the sisters, along the way...growing into a character you might despise and revile for his corpulence and indulgence, possibly an amalgamation of the 'fat-cat' type of persons that Rushdie hoped to interpret with this one protagonist, Omar Khayyam Shakil, as a protagonist, leaves much to be desired.  Though Rushdie's trademark humor and scathing commentary on those he himself dislikes are abundant in this work, I recommend OTHER Rushdie novels over this one, and would only suggest Shame to the most die-hard fans of his writing 
 Finally!  A well researched, serious (but still fun), accurate and fascinating book on witchraft and Wicca.  This should be required reading by all involved in The Craft.  Nice writing style---I just flew through this book.  I'm glad to have found a book on these subjects that actually contains thought provoking ideas and actual facts 
 When the book starts you can smell the scuz on Smythe. When it ends, you'll want to give him a statue 
 Paul Helm is a Reformed theologian and philosopher.  I haven't read any of his works, but this collection of writings he edited on the question of faith and reason is certainly top-shelf.  Many collections in the philosophy of religion focus on strictly philosophical writings.  So while you might get an excerpt by Aquinas, you probably won't get any from Luther or Calvin.  Prof. Helm's reader includes these theologians as well as Benjamin Warfield, Karl Barth, and others.   He also includes social thinkers such as Freud, Marx and Durkheim.    This book also has the merit of anthologizing works not included in other collections.  The only draw back is that the excerpts are relatively short.  Given the selections are arranged chronologically (from the Bible to the present), it functions best as a historical introduction.  If you want to study the key ideas in the philosophy of religion in more detail, you will want to supplement this with other anthologies. 
 Hendrix, an overrated musician? I have heard it all now. You got to be kidding me.. 
 I found this book very useful while doing research for my online tea shop.  I found a great deal of useful information and it is presented clearly and elegantly. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to know more  about green tea 
 Forget the comparisons to art.  Art this is not.  Entertainment it is.  And Mr. Curry is worth the price of admission 
 Rene Descartes is often considered the founding father of modern philosophy. A true Renaissance man, he studied Scholastic philosophy and physics as a student, spent time as a volunteer soldier and traveler throughout Europe, studied mathematics, appreciated the arts, and became a noted correspondent with royals and intellectual figures throughout the continent. He died in Sweden while on assignment as tutor to the Queen, Christiana.   Descartes 'Discourse on Method' is a fascinating text, combining the newly-invented form of essay (Descartes was familiar with the Essays of Montaigne) with the same kind of autobiographical impulse that underpins Augustine's Confessions. Descartes writes about his own form of mystical experience, seeing this as almost a kind of revelation that all past knowledge would be superseded, and all problems would eventually be solved by human intellect.   In the Discourse, Descartes formulates logical principles based on reason (which makes it somewhat ironic that this came to him almost as a revelation). Descartes had some appreciation for thinkers such as Francis Bacon and Thomas Hobbes, but he thought that Bacon depended too much upon empirical data, and with Hobbes he disagreed on what would be the criteria for ascertaining certainty.   Descartes was a mathematician at heart, and perhaps had a carry-over of Pythagorean mystical attachment to mathematics, for his sense of reason led him to impute an absolute quality to mathematics; this has major implications for metaphysics and epistemology. Descartes method was a continuation in many ways of the ideas of Plato, Aristotle and the medieval thinkers, for they all tended toward thinking in absolute, universal terms in some degree.   Descartes in his first section discounts much of Scholasticism, stating that the only real absolutes are theology and mathematics; because theology is based upon revelation, it is therefore beyond reason, and thus, mathematics becomes the only rational truth. Descartes develops this idea further with rules of method, which include ideas of intuition, analysis and deduction. He uses some of his method to come up with his greatest proposition:   Cogito ergo sum - - I think, therefore I am   'The Cogito is a first principle from which Descartes will now deduce all that follows.' This permits Descartes to deal both with rational elements and empirical data.   This is an important text, one that I read the summer before I went to college, and makes a good study for those who wish to see the personal element in the development of philosophy.  
 I loved Bly's 'take no prisoners' style of dealing with writing teachers, and writing programs, their strengths and their shortcomings. Her insights about how some aspiring writers can be harmed or have their work stymied in its fragile state by workshops and comments by well-meaning students or teachers, is reassuring. However, I wish she had gone further, for instance, in her chapter addressing the process of first, second, etc. drafts of a manuscript. Her comments about the need to protect the work, and to give it time to develop through multiple drafts is valuable, but I believe it could have been fleshed out further 
 Katrina was the "medium one", not the "big one". For those who are not on the gulf coast, it wiped out an area about 5 miles deep by 100 miles wide. The damage was mostly to middle class suburbs, but also include alot of very wealthy beach front neighborhoods, working neighborhoods, and a poorer neighborhood (the Lower 9). I personally owned 2 houses whose slabs were 10 feet above sea level, and were 10 miles from the "normal" coast, that took 9 feet of water from the surge. There are "below sea level" areas, but Katrina's surge wiped out high ground too.  It also trashed huge sections of marsh and barrier islands.  Van Heerden has been in the forefront of hurricane science for years, and was cited in the 2002 New York Times article, and 2003 Times Picayunne series that presaged the debacle.   This book is a great read. It pulls no punches. Van Heerden kicks several bee hives in an attempt to get awareness to a level needed to attain funding of a straight forward recipe for marsh rebuilding, and protection of New Orleans.  In addition to the human costs, V.H. points out that the loss of the marsh would destroy major fisheries and birding grounds. Lose the marsh = no fish, crabs, shrimp or birds.  [...]  I would highly suggest reading The Storm along with Doug Brinkley's The Great Deluge, which covers the human interest/political side of the fiasco.  I would also suggest everyone wake up, and follow this recipe for healing  America's greatest estuary 
 This book is about a boy who saves a dragon. They go on an adventure to get home.  They meet interesting people along the way. I loved all the characters but my favorite was Boris the dragon. This book has a lot of adventures in it. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes dragons 
 Are you really getting all the help you need?  The GWB is just that extra bit of something that is missing for any health program.  Even if they don't exist, the fact that you spend about an hour in a session acknowledging all that ails you is enough to get you on your path to healing.  Well worth the money 
 This is a GREAT book.  Beautifully written, a story about love and ultimately loss.  There are several sub plots going on at the same time in this book but the author blends them so well, you never feel lost.  VERY original and insightful look at how people from two totally different cultures seem so different but really are not.  Things are not always as they seem .  By far the best of all of Oprah's picks in my opinion.  LOVED IT! 
 The best support EVAR!!!  You definetly get what you pay for with this product 
 Excellent for begginers, very good for experient people, makes you remember a lot of basic and expert solutions. 
 E-40, Forty Water, whatever you want to call him is a bit of an aquired taste, even though I heard his music years ago, it took me until this year to finally check out 1 of his albums.  I first heard him on Aint Hard To Find off 2Pac's All Eyez On Me, and I was thinking who the f*ck is this guy?  His goofy voice and rapid fire flow took me quite a while to get used to, but after bumping Dusted & Disgusted for a long time I decided to pick up In A Major Way.  I had to order this from Amazon as there are literally no copies of this album in England, you just can't get hold of stuff like this, and I was surprised by how great it was.  E-40 has long been known as an innovator (something hiphop is sorely lacking), both in terms of his unique flow, and his vast slang vocabulary which so many others have bitten over the years.  This album according to most people is when he was at his peak in both, though I can't comment as this is the only album of his I own (I do intend to buy more though).  My favourite track is still Dusted & Disgusted ft Spice 1, 2Pac & Mac Mall, which is a westcoast classic, but other classics include 1 Luv and the amazing Smoke N Drank.  Pretty much every other track is tight, the only reason i don't quite give it 5 stars is because of a couple of filler tracks (Dey Aint No & Bootsee, which is terrible).  Production is top notch throughout, some classic westcoast beats that really bump.  Recommended to any hiphop fans, especially westcoast, if you can get past his wierd voice & flow you will see that some of his lyrics are actually pretty clever.  He raps about the same things most westcoast rappers do, but he does it creatively, if you can't follow him just get a lyrics sheet and listen up, very good album 4.5 stars, another case for half stars at Amazon 
 This is a great book. In keeping with the high standard set by his book on the SR 71, author Crickmore offers many great photos and personal accounts of pilots and people involved. In both books he seems to have an extraordinary access and insight into the people and machines of the "black world". In addition to anecdotes, this book contains many technical insights and explanations, to really involve you in the plane and it's story. For any military or aviation nut like myself, this book is a particular treat. I was extremely happy with this book, and wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone. Also try his excellent book on the SR 71 
 Well written and illustrated reference on animal development. This book covers basic principles of developmental biology, and then considers transcriptional regulation, control of development by RNA processing and translational regulation. Cell specification and cellular interactions are then considered. The last chapter considers developmental mechanisms in evolution 
 This is filled with Good stuff, as is to be expected with any Bullwinkle set. The second season was filled with fun. Sherman and Peabody nearly got the axe in Mexico for the Pancho Villa parody that appears here (which seems mild in comparison to the Frito Bandito a few years later).  A note about the beginning credits. The originals in 1959-60 had Rocky asking Bullwinkle what was he writing and our man said "the name of our sponsor," and Rocky would reply "but that's not his name" and they would cut into a General Mills cereal commercial and back to the into where Boris msleads them into a tunnel. This explains the fade out and fade in in the beginning credits of these shows.  The episodes as a whole are great as usual, but the extra features are a tad weak. The Bullwinkle Cheerios commercials were not the best of this genre (the original Moose commercails for Trix and General Mills were far more entertaining), and somebody had the bright idea of showing these on screen in tandem with the original pencil tests. Who but the most ultra-hardcore need-to-get-a-life animation geeks want to see this? The finished product will do fine, thank you. Although the June Foray (voice of Rocky and Natasha) interview is interesting.  Looking forward for Vol. 3 with the all-time Moosical Classic KIRWARD DERBY which is coming next 
 The Inner Sky is the best book I have found on learning how to read and interpret birth charts on your own.  It doesn't contain already written interpretations, instead it teaches you step by step what each planet and sign represents and shows you how to put it together and form your own interpretation, and it is so basic and do-able!  I recommend this as the starter book for anyone wanting to learn to read birth charts - hands down 
 I have often felt my Ex  was being a jerk. But, I don't use that kind of language and work at not thinking in those terms. Because, the words you think affect the words you say and that influences how you act. I don't want my child to think that I would speak of someone he loves in that way.   I appreciated some of the suggestions but felt there was a lack of maturity in some of the tactics.  Worth the price of a used copy 
 I have been using this tape for about 6 weeks and am very pleased with the results already!  I have never been a regular exerciser and at 52 feel the consequences-- these simple stretches are easy to do, make me feel graceful and awake and have already made me more flexibile.  I highly recommend this tape for a little out of shape, maybe a little older people who don't have much time for exercise.  I use some of the stretches during the day after sitting at my computer for a long time -- it feels great 
 This book contains fascinating conceptual articles on the changing nature of leadership and inspiring stories illustrating how women have created successful careers for themselves. I was particularly impressed by chapters that showed how the masculine traits of domination and control need to be replaced by organizational models based on collaboration and facilitation. Convincing evidence is cited for the value of feminine traits and the need to promote more women to senior executive roles. One writer discusses how feminine traits foster collaboration within organizations and between them and their strategic partners. I think these domains are ideally suited to feminine traits. But, there was no mention of the traits required for successful competition in aggressive markets. Here, I think, we still need masculine traits, whether in men or women. More generally, I don't think promoting more women to senior executive positions goes far enough. Organizational cultures need to change to foster a better balance of masculine and feminine traits, one to facilitate internal collaboration and the other for aggressive competitiveness externally. Books like this are great for stimulating our thinking about these vital issues 
 Having read a biography of Douglass many years ago, I thought I knew his story. Hearing through his pen was an entirely different matter. What a master of the language and insighful set of observations on human nature.  I am a man of many words, but words fail me in my endorsement of this book. The letter to his former master in the appendix is worth the price of the book by itself 
 Well, if you have read any of the "Conversations With God" books then you can relate to my enthusiasm.  But what a great concept, to include 'Books 1, 2, and 3' in this volume.  Whether you utilize it as a reference to revisit the wisdom of the series, or give this collection as a gift to a loved one who is being introduced to the series for the first time, this is a priceless "must own" in my opinion for everyone's library.  This is far and above the absolute BEST book(s) I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing 
 Dianne Schuur has always been one of my favorites. There is no doubt the woman has a fabulous voice! I have been very fortunate to have seen her perform several times. However, I must say the combination of Schuur and Ferguson is just pure joy to listen to. There is an incredible version of Besame Mucho on this CD. If anyone out there is looking to buy a really great CD, this is the one 
 Byars makes a brilliant case that "Fully Christian Worship must bring the Sacrament alongside the Word" (2000:100).   Christian Worship is one volume of the Foundations of Christian Faith series published by the Presbyterian Church U.S.A.   Its appeal is, however, not limited to Presbyterians.   This relatively short book is helpful to Christians of all denominations.   Byars begins by asking, "What's the point?"   Why do people worship?     He next explores the shape of Christian worship.  He describes the distinction between tradition and traditionalism.   Byars embraces Christian worship traditions rooted as far back as the Jewish synagogue.   He suggests that Christians should utilize the traditions of word and sacrament, use their minds, but also respect the mysteries of faith.   These traditions must, of course, be adapted to contemporary circumstances. In a brief historical review, Byars demonstrates how Roman Catholicism, strong on sacraments, gradually drifted away from the ministry of the word.   He also shows that Protestantism, while strong on the ministry of the word, drifted away from sacraments.   He argues, both Catholics and Protestants are moving toward restoring both word and sacrament in their worship.  Byars is not stuck on a rigid of definition of sacrament.   He appreciates the Orthodox use of the word "mystery".  He writes: "Something is sacramental when it becomes a means by which Jesus Christ, in his life, death and resurrection, becomes manifest to his people" (2000:92).   He helpfully discusses Baptism and the Lord's Supper.   Byars closes by considering where the church is heading.  He asks critical questions about seeker worship.   Christian Worship is a timely, readable book that seeks to restore the importance of both word and sacrament to worship.  I recommend it 
 Dont know much about History does pretty much what it purports to do; fill in certain blanks in US history in a concise, almost too concise, manner. It is quite objective and makes no attempt to re-write history to promote a particular political leaning - until the final chapters. Then it is fairly clear that Dr. Davis leans a bit away from the status quo. This poses no real problem, as most of the Viet Nam generation are quite negative as to how that was handled. Now, the next edition of this book, which will of necessity deal with Irak, will be a very interesting read 
 This book is very emotional and is well worth it to buy. I highly recommend it 
 I have seen the film for the second time and was impressed even more by not only its informative content, but by its terrific dramatic impact.  Needless to mention the film's continued relevance during this highly sensitive pre-election time.  Even as just a film viewing experience is really packs a wallop 
 This was an awesome beach read! I started reading and couldn't put it down. I finished in a day 
 I was eagerly awaiting this arrival from the Super Shipping Saving ordeal (8 days), and the book did not disappoint! I like the sleaziness of the girls, and I believe art can also be designed to cause the onlooker to get aroused. I did go from 0-to-Hardwood in about 3 seconds, but as I leafed through, I realized the same guns were in rotation. I understand it was the author's collection and bound to be limited--but I expect if there is a sequel to up the notch this book has attained that the author will have more funds available to rent some firearms. Perfect-size for throwing in a backpack, and the pictures taken merit a third or fourth glance over. The mood set by the bondage totally augments the sex appeal idea being pitched to the readers/glancers. If there is a follow-up book, I'm definitely going through the Super Shipping Saver ordeal again 
 Even if you enjoy fantasy more than hard-core Sci-Fi you'll enjoy this one. Interweaving of different lives and times really bring this story a sense of reality that is lacking in many stories of this genre. The suit almost becomes an entity in and of itself, allowing part of the past to be re-lived. Humanity wouldn't be so drawn to history if we didn't want to experience it for ourselves 
 Well i would like to say sorry about the title but since i have no reason i won't . Professor Hardy is in a league of his own along with very few mathematicians and an attempt to judge his opinion should only be from people that belong to the same class. His opinions are correct and valid.In contradiction to what most people say I cannot understand the reason why most of the people describe it as a sad book.In fact the apology of a mathematician is a text dedicated to defend pure mathematics and their existence.All mathematicians that have been able to prove something that none else has understand the validity of his claims...the rest of the unimportant people can just say anything they want.They are incapable of understanding what pure mathematics are.  For me it is a great book that every person that understand mathematics will love not because they will find something useful inside it but because of the beauty of its ideas 
 It may be tempting, but my experience with reading this book and operating a motor vehicle came out badly.  There was a red light and obviously the book was good enough that putting it down to go twelve blocks was  unthinkable, but it ended up being decidedly unpleasant for myself and all  involved.  I would suggest carving out a couple of hours where you don't  need to leave the house for this hilarious mock epic about one man's quest  to regain his erection 
 The best thing about this book is Ann Rule's unique perspective in being the only true crime writer who actually knew the killer as a friend before he committed his crimes!  It's a fascinating read that is also heartbreaking for so many reasons.  Rule perfectly describes the man she thought of as a younger brother, her affection and love for him, and the horror and true emotional pain she suffered as she slowly realized that he was a serial killer.    Rule does a commendable and touching job of showing us that human relationships are extremely complex, and that emotions cannot be shut on and off like a faucet.  Intellectually, she accepts that Ted is guilty and admits that she would not have stopped his execution had she the power, but she also confesses that she cannot forget the true friendship and affection she felt for the charming, intelligent, and seemingly open 24-year-old she met at Seattle's Crisis Clinic in 1971.  Unlike many other books on Bundy (and there are plenty of them), this one allows a genuine first-person account of what he meant to people who knew him as something more than just a monster.  It also proves unequivocally that Bundy's list of victims included more than just the poor girls he killed.  
 Imation makes good stuff. Hope that the mail-in rebate info is all in the package. Can't beat the price 
 I found "Where God Lives" to be one of the best examinations of the NDE. Dr. Morse's section on children was compelling, but even more interesting was the section on past life remembrances. As Dr. Morse is a professional and researcher, the book is filled with case studies, scientific analysis and much insight. Although the premise of memory being stored in a place besides the brain may sound a little wacky and "occultish", the book is clearly not that at all. Definitely check this one out for an entertaining read 
 I have read several Judge Dee mysteries and this is one of my favorites.  There are a lot of interesting plot twists and some sad and cruel surprises.  Judge Dee has the help of Sargeant Hoong in this one, but Ma Joong and Chiao Tai are on leave so Dee must travel to some of the seedier places by himself.  I stayed up until late at night to finish this one...enough said 
 My daughter read this story in 2nd grade and now as a young working professional enjoyed it all over again.  There is a lesson to be learned by both young children and adult viewers alike.  I recommend this as a story to be shared with families at the time of year when our attention turns to how many and how much, but this story jolts us back to the real spirit of sharing and caring 
 Author and entertainment industry analyst Harold L. Vogel sheds valuable light on the growing importance of fun in the American economy. His book shows surprising versatility, sometimes reading like an economics textbook, and other times providing an engaging and easily readable overview of the entertainment business. Vogel provides exhaustive sources and an authoritative perspective, linking the entertainment industry's technology-driven increase in productivity to the public's increased expenditures on music, movies, sports, games, theme parks and other forms of entertainment. The relatively modest attention he pays to the performing arts reflects their unfortunate status as a poor stepchild we find this book's breadth and depth impressive, and strongly recommends it to analysts, scholars and students who seek a clear picture of the economic role of entertainment 
 With his sketches, stories, insight and inspirational essays, Danny Gregory gave me what I have been needing: an entertaining yet extraordinarily meaningful kick in the pants to begin leading a truly creative life. Sketching is but a metaphor for infusing your life with awareness and appreciation. It's easy to give yourself permission to do so after reading this book. I plan on giving The Creative License to everyone I know this year - yes, it's one of those rare kinds of books.  
 Through knowledge based on survival interest, but also on in-depth curiosity, Arseniev offers a narrative monument of love towards nature. His true friendship with Dersu Uzala, the native trapper, opens to us the misteries of the Taiga, and the harmonic rules of nature, on which the role of man has also a place. The style is narrative, straight forward, without artificiality, a little cold, but leaves a vivid impression on the reader through the amazing world that effectively describes. Highly recommended book for nature lovers 
 I'm a Mac person, love my iBook to death. Got an iMac with a big hard drive, got it stuffed full of Rock and Roll. I don't like Windows almost as much as I don't like disco. So it was a great groan I had, followed by a long sigh, when I realized that the Greatest Group on Earth again sold out. This time to Microsoft when they allowed them to use this song to advertise the Start button or whatever it is they call it in Windows. Anyway, that not withstanding, it's just a powerful rock song, as is "Hang Fire" and "Little T & A." "No Use in Crying" is a song I play often, but  the album's closer "Waiting on a Friend," is my favorite on this record. It's just a delicious song on a delicious record. This album opens with a bang and closes with a swoon, can't get better than that. Oh well, they made this record long before Windows was invented, so it really shouldn't bother me that they allowed "Start Me Up" to be used years later they way they did, but it kind of does 
       Comedy had henny Youngman flipping out one liners, poetry has Stephen Dobyns. The one liners are pithy  to the extreme but make you think---"Humane:Thinks Twice" or "He loved in order to be increased, not in order to love." They are perhaps bits and pieces of ideas he had for longer poems. But whatever they are, or from whatever source they sprung, thet are welcome from one of our great(but too often overlooked) artists. 
 A man is found on a small island called Ile de Port Noir in the Mediterranean, south of Marseilles. He is more corpse than man. A doctor, an Englishman named Washburn who came to Ile de Port Noir 8 years before because of his dismissal from Macleans Hospital in London, saves his life. But the man suffers a memory loss. He knows several languages. He is deadly in hand-to-hand combats. He can use several kinds of weapons. But he doesn't know who he is, where he comes from, whom he works for. He doesn't know his own identity. He is an amnesiac. Implanted beneath the skin on his hip is a frame of microfilm, which contains a bank account number. This account number leads to a bank in Zurich, the name Jason Bourne, supposed to be his, and four million dollars. Is Jason Bourne his real name? Or Cain? Or Delta? Or anything else? He becomes a wanted man of every side. The police want him. His description is on every immigration desk and border check in Europe. His old friends and colleagues want him dead. Carlos, who is the most dangerous assassin in the world, hunts him. He is struggling to kill his enemies, to protect the woman he loves, to find out his past and his identity, and to survive.  I watched the movie starring Matt Damon about a year ago. The movie is excellent. Matt Damon is also an excellent actor. But I am sorry to say that the book is much better. This is the first Robert Ludlum book I've read. And I am sure that this isn't the last one. Mr. Ludlum has done an excellent job in piling plot twist upon plot twist. The pace is fast. The book is full of actions and surprises. I would highly recommend this one to anyone who wants a 5-star action thriller book. 
 Bishop Spong's book is both stimulating and insightful, and although originally published in 2001, it is clearly not "out of date".  Its author identifies the many elements in the old traditional Christianity that, he asserts, the modern scientific mind must discard: the "Revealed Word of God" nature of the Bible with its myths and miracles, the God of theism, the notion that Jesus was a supernatural part of a triune God, the belief that Jesus was the human sacrifice required to placate a holy God and thus provide salvation, and so on.  Much of this, of course, has been around a long time, most obviously in the Deism of the 18th century Enlightenment but more recently, as Spong acknowledges, in the works of Paul Tillich and J.A.T. Robinson some 50 years ago.    What is disappointing is that so little progress has been made since then in developing Spong's "New Christianity."  God, he argues, is to be thought of as "the Ground of Being" (Tillich), "new" words including "meditation" and "contemplation" should be employed in considering the nature of non-theistic prayer, in Episcopal churches the altar has been moved from the back wall and the priest placed behind it facing the people during the Eucharist (various Protestants introduced this practice centuries ago), and so on.  It is his discussion of this sacrament that may cause substantial bewilderment in readers, for although the author has discarded the repulsive doctrine of Jesus as human sacrifice with its repelling imagery (e.g., eat the body, drink the blood) he continues to administer the Eucharist in the traditional way with the traditional words.  His claim of treating those words himself as poetry or symbols, may evoke in some readers the image of accused heretics harboring inward mental reservations while outwardly saying the orthodox words in hope of saving themselves from the Inquisitor's threat of torture and death.  Admittedly, the author has received harsh criticism from traditionalists but nothing of the severity afforded medieval heretics.  In this issue and others Spong is to be applauded for his openness in discussing his own ambivalent struggle and for his considerable courage in taking such subjects up in public.   However, many readers eager to find a modern "New Christianity" to embrace will be disappointed and some may turn next to works by Sam Harris and Richard Dawkins, also available from Amazon.  Nevertheless, this book continues to deserve a wide readership, for among its many insights into the complex human condition, it displays the irony of an author so nobly trying to free the prisoners of traditional Christianity while being himself still a prisoner of that tradition. 
 I was rating anther product and realized I had never rated this one.  Denise Austin does a great job here.  Yes, she is very enthusiastic and it can be a little much, but she gets me through the workout every time.  I absolutely LOVE the multiple options.  This DVD will grow with you as you get in shape.  She gives alternate moves within the workouts and that coupled with the ability to pick the intensity is just great.  I love that the workouts are short and when combined together you get to focus on the areas where you need the most work.  When I first started I just did one workout and as I felt better I added to it.  This is my absolute favorite workout vide 
 Like another reviewer, I've experienced great stuff with this product. Let me tackle the beverage from two angles: 1) Taste. The stuff looks like lightly-green tinted water, but the flavor is a mild diet sweetness. Not like the raw high fructose surge of soad, but kind of a tangy tastiness that I personally enjoy. It's nice cold out of the can, though people have asked me if I was downing a Coors due to the silver exterior. 2) Energy. No caffeine, no guarana, no chemicals. Yes, sugar, but for some reason, no crash and burn. I just had my second one of the day about two hours ago (9:30PM) and I'm still feeling pretty good, considering I've been awake and working for 14 hours straight on. No coffee or other stimulants, so I'm crediting the drink. Hooah 
 We recently lucked into a wonderful Grampian 26 in great shape, and were even luckier to have located this and the other Don Casey books! Even though it is still very much winter here, I'm chomping at the bit to start preparing the boat for the water.  Casey's books are a must for any yacht owner 
     It was very eye opening and enlightening to essentially read about myself in the context of Dr. Hallowell's personal and professional experience. Though I have never been diagnosed with ADD, nor pursued a diagnosis this late in life, it did bring my own experience into a place that I could easily understand and accept. It also gave me a basis for helping others in my family deal with ADD at a younger age, hopefully with less of the confusion and anxiety that I endured. The writing was very easy to follow, and indeed, done in a way that any ADD sufferer could readily use 
 Matthew Reilly was born in Sydney, Australia in 1974 and already has a string of books and loyal following of readers. I really enjoyed this book and am now looking for other offerings from this author.  This book is an adventure in the best sense of the word. It is about a race between rival groups to locate a legendary Incan idol. The idol is not made of gold or any other precious metal for that fact but simply of stone, so why the sudden race to find something that has been lost to the world for centuries. The fact is that the stone that the idol is made from could be used for a terrifying purpose in the present century.  The only clue to the whereabouts of the idol, can only be found in a 400-year-old document. A young linguist, Professor William Race is recruited, against his will to interpret the document. So begins the race that will lead the professor and his companions to the foothills of the Andes, where a mysterious temple lies hidden.  That is only the beginning of the adventure. They find that the place pervades evil like a noxious gas. It is seething with menace and unexpected pitfalls. It is only then that the professor and his team discover that certain things are best left hidden . .  
 I couldn't put this book down once I started reading it. Whether you are an expert horseperson or just a horse lover this book is for you! The chapters cover horses throughout history in war, sports, Hollywood, Greek mythology, and even where we get some of our common sayings (pass the buck, lucky horseshoe, getting on your high horse). I will definitely read this book more than once 
 Yes, this guy knows his stuff & he can write, but a prospective purchaser needs to know that this book is really a tactical analysis of the battle for Tarawa, & what a battle it was! It is a text book for military historians & whilst dealing with an enormously violent military episode, it comes over curiously passionless. Tactics & battlefield problems are disected & judged with knowledge & objectivity, although I thought the tiny explanatory maps were just dreadful. Main problem for me though, was that I enjoy reading about battles from the blood 'n guts, "grunt," or platoon, point of veiw. In this book, although some pen pictures of the principle participants & some rousing accounts of personal bravery were related, these were very much a side issue. If you are a serious student in this genre, this is probably for you. If, like me, you just like a rousing battleground story, this isn't 
 One of the most authentic recorded examples of the San Francisco Sound. Don't be put off by the raucous cynicism of the all-too-relevant title track ... the rest of the album is mellow, delicate and often very beautiful. No collection of vintage psychedelia is complete without this and ELECTRIC MUSIC 
 This book on the religion is extremely and very thoroughly written. The amount of detail that is in this book is a very good introduction for any neophyte who has recently been initiated into the religion and I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in learning about the Lukumi or who needs to be educated on certain topics. However, any book written on the religion always leaves out information that is supposed to be kept secret and I am glad not ALL of the information was revealed. Nevertheless, it is a great read and interesting information has been written. 
 My husband bought this ball for me as a mothers day present when I was 6 months pregnant.  It was the only thing I could sit on comfortably with my off balanced condition.  The oval shape is perfect for sitting on and bouncing.  After baby was born it was even better than a rocking chair for putting the little one to sleep he loves it and it was also a great workout tool for getting back that pre-pregnancy figure.  My only complaint is that the hand air pump is a little difficult to use and it takes a while to get it aired up your hand will get tired and you will need to take a break from pumping 
 I have never been exposed to Mark Twain, but I do enjoy reading biographies.  So when a friend gave me Mark Twain: A Life by Ron Powers, I couldn't resist.  Mark Twain is a mammoth work, and Powers goes to great lengths to explain this 19th Century icon to 21st Century readers (Powers calls Twain America's first rock star).  Twain had a circuitous route to fame, and the author starts with his childhood and the history of the Clemmens family.  Twain first became a printer's assistant, switched over to steamboat pilot and then had a very short career as a Confederate soldier in the Missouri State Guard.  But Twain's first love was writing, and he became a successful newspaper writer for two Western papers.  This gave him the platform which launched his career as a humorist, speaker and novelist.  Powers gives us lots of information about his relationships with his family and friends.  Clemmens was a prodigious writer, and is said to have written from 50,000 to 100,000 letters.  He also kept dozens of notebooks, which help give us a window on Twain's thought processes.  It is mind-boggling to think that Twain's social circle included Thoreau, Emerson, Longfellow, Henry James, Ulysses S. Grant, Henry Ward Beecher and William Dean Howells.  But while Powers gives us everything we ever wanted to know about Twain (and then some), he skimps on Twain's early years, as well as his old age.  Powers claims that the Hannibal years of Twain's youth were the "ten most imaginatively fertile years of his life."  Yet Powers only spends one chapter (13 pages of a 722 page book) discussing these formative years.  Powers dedicates only two chapters (29 pages) to the last ten years of his life.  Instead of facts, Powers has a tendency to over-analyze Twain's writing.  The chapter on Huckleberry Finn reads like a doctoral dissertation.  At the end, Powers leaves us hanging when Twain breathes his last, and there are many unanswered questions.  Where was Twain's funeral?  What was it like?  Who eulogized him?  Where is he buried? Does he have any descendants?  Who reaps the financial benefit of his writings today?  When and how was his Hartford house turned into a historic site? And what ever happened to his father's Tennessee land?  After finishing this book, I discovered that Twain had his wife's remains cremated.  Why didn't Powers include this fact in his book?  Such information is interesting--especially for the times.  Still, Powers is a wordsmith and he is obviously smitten with his subject.  His descriptions of Twain's talent are first rate.  "Mark Twain's baton began to mute the Anglican symphony and strike up the rhythms of American jazz....Any language to him was a form of music.  Even the slightest misuse of his native tongue grated on his ears like a false note--unless it was in dialect, which had its own laws."  Powers claims that Twain suffered from "typographical Tourette's Syndrome" when he worked as a Western news writer.  This is good stuff.  But unlike Twain (who valued brevity), Powers loves a dollar word when a nickel word will do.  I definitely enjoyed Mark Twain: A Life and it has piqued my interest to read more of and about Mark Twain.  I may even take a ride to see his home in Hartford CT.  But I feel that Powers fell short of having a truly magnificent biography. 
 I LOVE this book!  I stood in the bookstore and laughed out loud when I read it.  I have a huge cat and totally connected with the story.  I think it's creative, fun, and happy!  I love the illustrations; very visually pleasing.  I highly recommend this book to everyone; especially cat lovers 
 I usually enjoy Updike's novels, and I enjoyed this one too. I valued it mainly for its trenchant and often witty observations of the darker side of modern life. Urban decay,deteriorating schools, degenerate TV shows, even obesity are skewered. The would-be terrorist was portrayed in a way that I had difficulty identifying with: his monomania , his fundamentalism. The plot was weak, in that it had suspense that just  wimpered out at the end. There are numerous arabic quotations from the Koran in this book- someone more expert than I would need to interpret them. I don't know how much they added to the book, or to our understanding of the (anti)hero 
 We're using this book as part of a leadership development program. 30 copies were sent directly to me on time and in perfect conditio 
 I was browsing in the Virgin Megastore on Sunset one night when I heard this really great music playing on the store system, I asked the salesperson what it was and . . . you guessed it . . . it was "The Aqua Velvets" by the Aqua Velvets.  I bought a copy and I'm glad I did.  Don't take my word for it, just download the clips from Amazon and listen for yourself.  The CD is all instrumental "surf guitar" and it's really good, I particularly like "Blue Rhumba" and "Swampabilly Hop".  This is a great CD to listen to when you are driving, especially the Ventura between Thousand Oaks and Studio City around three in the morning (speedy). The only problem is that I occasionally have flashbacks that I'm on the set of "Beach Blanket Bingo" with Annette and Frankie while I'm listening to it. 
 Clear, well thought out presentation of some interesting projects. The diagrams are well drawn. The projects are challenging to beginners and not run-of-the-mill to experts. Highly recommend this book for anyone  interested in fine woodworking 
 This book tells why trust is important for effective management and leadership, and how to build trust, step-by-step.  Even if you consider yourself a great leader, you can always improve in this area.  Includes great tips about how to give and recieve feedback in ways that increase trust 
 The American Pageant is a very easy to read US History textbook. The chapters are all relatively short and average about 25 pages. The margins are about half an inch and the presentation is overall easy on the eyes.  The text is organized nicely. The only minor pitfall in this area (of organization) is that the authors sometimes skip around too often. They may refer to an election by name before formally discussing it.  This text has been around since the 1960s and is very common among AP high school classrooms. It still lives up to its reputation of providing the facts in an easy to understand and occassionally humorous manner 
 This is the third book in the Joe Pickett series, and unconventional is the rule in each of the books. The author manages to make a character with a wife and kids into something of an action hero, complete with gun, pickup truck, and dog, and a series of enemies that attempt everything from annoyance to murder to thwart him.  In the current book, Pickett has a murder on his hands. In this case the murder is complicated by the fact that the victim was a local Federal wildlife officer who just went nuts and killed a whole flock of elk. Pickett arrested him, but he escaped, only to be brutally and strangely killed.  Complicating things are two factors. First, the local authorities have been preempted by a Federal investigator who has taken charge of everything. She's convinced that there's a conspiracy of right-wing nutcases, survivalists who want to kill Federal agents, and of course she's going to hunt them down, damn the consequences. One of her principle suspects is a local mountain man type who has almost no interaction with the rest of society, and raises falcons at his house. That guy turns out to be more than everyone bargained for.  I enjoyed this book a great deal, and would recommend it to anyone who likes the wilderness or detective stories. One proviso: the author isn't a conservative politically (one of his previous books involves the Endangered Species list) but this book deals with the Federal government and bureaucrats rather harshly. Just a warning 
 This is Daz Dillinger's solo debut. Some people hate on this album and it didn't sell too well, but how can you hate? This album is very original, great production by Daz almost entirely, and great guest appearances by legends like 2Pac, Snoop Dogg, Too $hort, Kurupt, Tray Deee, Nate Dogg, WC, Bad Azz, MC Eiht, The Outlawz, B-Legit, and some additional production by Soopafly. This is very underrated, ANOTHER West Coast classic indeed, and probably Daz' 2nd best album. The beats are off the hook and Daz couldn't have brought a tighter debut release. You gotta have this if a fan of the Dogg Pound or West Coast rap. Just one classic of many to a legendary name 
 I found this book to be a classic. It really sifts through real life examples of how to really impact other people through a positive way. Its not a book that teaching manipulation, but rather how to bring out the best in others. I soo strongly recommend this book. It really is a classic. 
 It starts with a dream of a better tomorrow. One of the oldest pigs living in Manor Farm dreams of an animal revolution, where the animals will rebel against their human tormentors and take control for themselves, living in a peaceful, better world. This pig, Major, dies soon afterwards, but he has given them the idea, and within a short amount of time, the animals are in control. Victory has been declared.  As in all societies, the residents of the renamed Animal Farm draw up a set of rules to be followed. Their Seven Commandments are written up, and those are the rules that nobody can break. Then, with a need for some sort of leadership, Snowball, a pig (who are of higher intelligence than the other animals), steps in. They start to build, and to plan, and then trouble starts. Napoleon, another pig, also wants a sense of power, and drives Snowball out of the farm.  There begins a new stage of the farm animals. Meetings to discuss the good of the animals end, and Napoleon starts to twist facts around to convince the other animals of the "true" story, and many of them believe. Slowly, slowly, every original rule in the Seven Commandments gets changed, amended, or wiped, until they're are left with one final rule:  All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others.   This is the last thing remaining, years and years after the animal revolution. The ducks begin to sing a different song, the name is changed, again, and something happens to change everything once more.  The book is extremely symbolic. I doubt that Orwell actually meant animals once in this story. "Animal Farm" shows what happens in "equal" societies when there is one person who is slightly more in command, and what happens to revolutions of the underdogs. After reading this, I found myself thinking very hard about revolutions, communism, dictatorship, and the circle of bad they bring.   This book is a must read. It's not too long, but every word is meaningful and important. The book is easy to read (the way it's written is very simple, possibly so that it may seem like animals wrote it), and makes things much easier to understand. The ending is thoughtful, kind of hopeless, and almost sad. It's an incredible book. There is no argument whether or not you should read this, because one can learn so much. I know I did, and I'm confident others will too, even if they don't like the rather simplistic writing style used 
 This is a quality recording with great performances of both works.  These are two choral works which have stood the test of time by a great choral arranger and conductor who truly knows voices and choirs.  The recording is clean and authentic, not "studio contrived." 
 This is a man who many would call sad and wasted, but in the end, he is true to himself and the women who he has shared his time with over many years.  I would say that this is one of the finest and truest depictions of a "monger" that I have ever read and it read true for me as a man.  Well worth the read 
 "Little Chapel on the River" is the best book that I have read this year.  Wendy found a home at Guinan's, and you will too 
 "People who are low on communication skills usually have not thought out the response they want from the other person in the first place and therefore cannot aim for it" (21).  Boothman has been a photographer for some time, and as such he has much to say about how to achieve instant rapport with another person within a matter of minutes. This is all essential in his line of work, where he must instantly find something in common with whatever smiling or snarling model who graces a centerfold, bu it is even more essential to men and women in other lines of work since at some point dealing with others is a task that every worker faces. The book is divided into three sections, "first contact", "the 90-second land of rapport", and "the secrets of communication." Boothman's book should be required reading for all who not only work, but anyone who has ever considered going on a date or wanting to be married, since much of this material is focused on giving people respect in exchange for rapport.  First Contact  When Boothman wants to discuss a subject, he does so in two manners: (1) he decides to belabor the point for 30+ pages, or (2) he mentions it briefly and moves on. The first option describes how Boothman describes likability in this first section of the book.  The 90-Second Land Of Rapport  If a person wanted to be certain they were sending every non-verbal message with a purpose and a meaning, they would be a wonderful communicator and people would be naturally drawn to them. Anyone who tries to go for this goal automatically improves rapport with others. Acting like other people act makes them want to be around a perso more, also.  The Secrets Of Communication  For most men and women, communication is a cryptic word with little or no meaning. Boothman discusses how listening is more important than talking, how "parroting" another person is annoying, how vivid language is exciting, and how people are either visual, audible, or kinesthetic in the way they communicate. Understanding how a person sees the world, or hears the world, or feels the world, is essential into putting them first in conversation.  Conclusion  In summary, Boothman concludes his work by summarizing all of the sections of his book. This is nice work, so that summary may speak for itself, with what has been written here 
 This set completes the Pee Wee's Playhouse series. Some reviews say the first set is better.  Maybe a little, but this set is just as enjoyable.  I like how they put 4 epidsodes on each disc, makes it easy to view an entire disc in on sitting.  I also like the slim cases on both set 
 One Good Knight (2006) is the second Fantasy novel in the Tales of the Five Hundred Kingdoms series, following The Fairy Godmother.  In the previous volume, Alexander and Elena organized resistance to the invasion of Fleurberg by a Dark Magician.  After the death of the Katschei, Alexander and Elena were wedded, becoming Godmother and Consort.  Then an Order of Champions was established at Glass Mountain, with Alexander as their Master, and Elena was given charge of Fleurberg in addition to her other kingdoms.  In this novel, Princess Andromeda of Acadia is nineteen years old, but is still considered a child by her mother, Queen Cassiopeia, and Chief Advisor Solon Adacritus.  She writes a report on the merchants for a trade conference and impresses both the Queen and the Chief Advisor.  After that, her mother orders redecoration of the Princess wing, appoints two ladies to design her wardrobe and jewelry, and assigns a steward to handle her affairs.  Andromeda is quite overwhelmed by this attention and augments her studies to further impress her mother.  She notices that income from wrecked ships has grown due to an increase in the number and severity of storms.  Her studies and inquiries suggest that this increase is probably due to the manipulations of a great wizard.  She reports this matter to her mother.  Afterward, Andromeda is resting high up in a tree within the palace garden when she notices a strange flying creature.  As it comes toward her, she recognizes that it is a dragon.  Then it reaches the palace and she observes that it is a very large dragon.  It flames some high architectural features, grabs a couple of animals and flies away.  The panic within the palace is phenomenal and the subsequent meeting of the Queen's advisors is very lively.  Andromeda has quickly reviewed the literature on dragons -- consisting mainly of myths and legends -- and reports to the advisors that the only known method of managing a dragon is the sacrifice of virginal maidens.  The ensuing discussion is even livelier, mostly concerning the means of choosing such sacrifices.  Queen Cassiopeia states that the only fair way to select sacrifices is by a lottery.  After the spate of crazy volunteers dies down, a lottery is organized.  Some women find ways to disqualify themselves, but others are taken by the dragon.  Rumors begin spreading that anyone who speaks out against the Queen is more likely to have a family member selected for the sacrifice.  But then Andromeda is selected.  This novel is mostly about the influence of the Tradition within the Five Hundred Kingdoms.  Andromeda's knowledge of the Tradition comes in handy at various points in this quest.  The Queen has sent to Glass Mountain for a Champion to fight the dragon, but the good knight doesn't come forward as expected.  Someone has erected a magical barrier at the border to keep out such warriors.  However, Andromeda is sort of saved by a Champion at the sacrificial site.  Andromeda convinces the knight to take her along as a guide and finally proves to the Champion that she can be a help rather than a hindrance.  They travel cross-country in the same direction that the dragon had flown, stopping for supplies here and there, and finally enter the Wyrding Lands.  They encounter unicorns and a fox along the way before meeting the dragon and his brother.  Then Andromeda learns that all is not as it seems.  Andromeda is nineteen and naive.  Then she is faced with one of the most difficult of issues:  does her mother love her.  While many events occur in this plot, this one issue is the crux of the story.  Even her interspecies romance with the younger dragon is only a temporary relief from this main concern.  Highly recommended for Lackey fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of adventure, betrayal and romance.  -Arthur W. Jordi 
 I have trouble saying how much I enjoyed this movie.  The plot was well worn, but it didn't feel staid or plodding.  Visually, the movie is simply stunning.  Absolutely some of the best visuals I have seen in years.  The Jim Henson company outdid themselves this time 
 This is without a doubt the most complete, most accurate set of Zeppelin tab I have ever seen. Comes w/ bound books(not stapled), & a sturdy slip case, every bit worth the price. If you're a Zep fan & a guitarist, you're not yet a man (or woman) until you own this set 
 WOW I am suprised. VERY comfortable. Very stable shoe. I love them!!! They are very sexy. I live in clogs and this one is nice and tall and most important to me they are comfotable. I wear them a lot 
 I had forgotten how wonderful this album was until I picked it up again in CD format as a bookend to Ariel.  And was transported 
 My mother having read this book sometime before I was born in the 50's, was so moved that she named me after Rima. When I was 12 I read it for the first time, and after moving many times the book was lost.  I have always  wanted to re-read it as an adult feeling that there was quite a bit more I  would appreciate now.  I am delighted to have located this novel, and will  be thrilled not to have to explain to my friends once more where my name  originated.  I will just loan them the book 
 I had a chance to take a sneak peek at Planet India by Mira Kamdar and I can't wait to read the whole book when its published.  Like her first book, Motiba's Tattos, Kamdar applies a very personal approach to a massively global subject.  In Planet India, she broadens her view to this large nation's rapid rise to economic and cultural phemonenon.    From the bits I read, Planet India is destined to be required reading - not only for scholars but for all readers curious about how a thousands-year-old culture has become a modern nation.   
 This book was by far the best in the series!~ It left me wanting more!~ 
 The recent reviewers forgot to mention the steamy love scenes that will have you blushing if you read this on public transportation!  
 Whether expert or novice, this book belongs on your shelf if you want to improve yourself.  It shows how to safely improve your balance, flexibility and strength through various postures or stretches.  I wish I had a book like this when I was a teenager.  I have been practicing yoga for four years through Rodney Yee tapes and DVDs because there was nowhere close by to take classes.  I have gotten several books on yoga and thumbed through many more to try to improve my weak back, but they all came up short until the 'Yoga Bible'.  This book has answered many questions I have had that the video tapes didn't address.    Don't stop your curiosity.  Get this book if you are the least bit interested and you will be glad.  It doesn't matter how stiff you are in body or spirit.  The book will pleasantly surprise you with its no nonsense approach to practical well being and bettering each breath you take.  As Ms. Brown says "the essense of yoga lies in the breath", so if you are breathing you should consider yoga to enhance your life.  I may have to get another copy soon because my first is becoming dog-eared from constant use.  If I ever make it to Sydney I will sign up for classes at the Yoga Source 
 If you need to be spoon fed, this book is not for you.  If you want the  latest advanced theories with lots of proofs, this is not for you.  If you,  like me, are in between, and need a guide basic and intermediate  statistics, the gives it too you straight, this book *IS* for you.  If you  want to know all the commonly used statistics, with consise explanation of  why they work and how to use them, I doubt you could find a better source 
 Well I live here in Australia and I cant find this book any where here and being a student cant afford a lot so it would be great if it were avalible here or through an Australian Amazon. But I really could do with this book  if it does the things it says it can do. If I can get my hands on it I will  write again. Nic 
 Pearl Buck describes the simple life of a village family in China before and during World War II.   She follows the lives of each family member, the daughter & her husband who cooperate with the Japanese, the sons who  escape to the hills & join the Chinese resistance, the youngest teenage  daughter who is sent away to avoid rape, the simple aging farmer & his  wife who stay with their land at all costs.  While the village & nearby  city are never named, it is evocative in some respects of the new book,  "The Rape of Nanking."  I've read this book twice 
 I really loved this book, as well as the whole series.  I couldnt read it fast enough 
 I saw RVM at Summerfest this summer, never having heard of them until then, and I bought the cd on the spot... I started listening to it every day and haven't gotten sick of it yet.  It is one of my favorite cds in my collection of about 230 
 Who are the most relevant actors in international relations? The answer is states for both neorealists and neoliberals though the latter also consider some non-governmental organizations and multinational corporations (MNC) as remarkable units in international politics. Constructivists, on the other hand, pay considerable attention to non-state actors while they also keep states as central actors. Margaret E. Keck and, Kathryn Sikkink present us a well-designed discussion about the significance of non-state actors of world politics in Activist Beyond Borders. First of all, they classify transnational actors into three groups; MNC and international banks that have instrumental goals, epistemic communities that insist on causal ideas and transnational advocacy networks (TAN) that carry principal ideas.Then, they analyze the significance of TAN in international politics by searching for how do TAN work and how do they change conceptions of national interest and principles of policies organizations? Keck and Sikkink mention four fundamental strategies of TAN; information politics, symbolic politics, leverage politics, and accountability politics. They generate information, use symbolic elements, put pressure on states and international organizations, and follow their accountability to international norms. Their effectiveness, however, depend on the issue and actor characteristics that they are targeting. What they do? They cause to reformulation of national interests and they eventually change behavior of states. The principled ideas are the key for TAN and they also lead ideas to transformation of states interests and policies. Activist Beyond Borders has three case studies in the area of TAN; human rights, environment, and violence against women. In these cases, transnational human rights advocacy networks changed authoritarian Latin American governments' notions and policies of human rights. TAN in environment shifted the World Bank's funding policies in corresponding to the protection of environment. TAN in women's rights lead to change state policies in two areas. One of the most significant arguments for IR theory that Keck and Sikkink state is that TAN lead to changes in state understandings of sovereignty. Then states begin to accommodate to re-conceptualized sovereignty at the expense of realist notion of absolute sovereignty. In this sense, they question the realist premises of state interests. They also emphasizes that TAN are important source of new ideas, norms and identities that make repercussions over behavior of states and international organizations. They carry transformative and mobilizing ideas into international system and finally shape fundamentally policies of both state and non-sate actors in world politics. In addition, the authors stress upon the importance of domestic actors for TAN to be successful. Overall, Activists Beyond Borders asserts that TAN endeavor to transform the terms and nature of the debate on fundamentals of international politics 
 All Aboard! The Story Of Joshua Lionel Cowen & His Lionel Train Company is the fascinating story of the man who made the electric toy train one of the most popular toys for boys and hobbies for grown men in the last century. Published in part to celebrate the Lionel Train Company's 100th Anniversary, All Aboard! is also a testament to how this producer of toy trains dealt with the competition of electronic games at the end of the 20th century and is experiencing a surge of popularity at the beginning of  the 21st Century. Original published in 1981, this new, revised and updated celebratory edition of All Aboard! is welcome and highly recommended reading for toy train enthusiasts in general, and Lionel Train collectors in particular 
 Just a classical "MUST" for starters in chillout-music. There are some very good tunes for a almost twenty-year old CD. I'll ask everyone interested in chillout to buy it, it's really hearsome 
 The large impact forces will be felt from increased trends and interest for Biotech agricultural Jobs and automated manufacturing robotics.  Corporations will embrace strategic position seeking global market share and ravage for larger profits earnings.   The borderless nation will take jobs from local communities and local communities will have a difficult time accepting globalization logic but remain obsequiously quiet, as jobs are relocated to China, Mexico, or India.   Companies will act according rules of laissez-faire capitalism having insignificant torque apply by political policy restraining hopes and aspirations promised by protectionism. CAFA and NAFA further reinforcing the doctrine that national borders and the fact national governments can not limit commerce.  Global financial investment in emerging markets will remain popular, but the most significant upward trend will be the exponential interweaving of communications, computers, and media.  New media will enhance the power of the government.  Individual power to direct political change is threatened, weakened by indifference caused by media propaganda.  Topics such as illegal immigration, replacement fertility rates, and the direction of currency flows are communicated as both complex and non-understandable with the perception that the individual can not make a difference.  People are responding with resignation, as demonstrated by decreased voter participation.  However, there will be 1 to 5% of the companies positioned for advantage from the social-economic change in the 21st century.  Writers like Kenichi Ohmae, George Glider, and Ben Wattenberg are the evangelical preachers of global capitalist.  Higher quality productivity fundamentals shift rising confidence towards Japan, Korea, East Asia trade states (India, Singapore, Thailand), Germany, Switzerland, and EC as a whole, claim: high savings, impressive levels of investment in new plant and equipment, excellent education, skilled workforce, manufacturing culture with many more engineers than lawyers, trade surpluses, and high quality and high value added manufactured products.   Confidence does not necessarily need to be tangibly proven, but may exist in the perceived expectations of higher quality from investors.  As a result, financial funds will choose too move billions of dollars into these countries for growth funding.    Environmental reforms will not offer problem solving resolution; instead, they will only slow down the CO2 emissions. Deforestation, famine, and climate disruption will peak.  Policies will be moot against practices that deforestation.  For example, India's population has lead to 2/3 deforestation.  Political perspective will become shorter still rather than designed for long term beneficial prudence.  Reforms lack enforcement power as new forces for global change make national instruments irrelevant.  The state will remain the local nexus for authority and loyalty.  Humankind instinctively avoids the un-comfort of change.  Reforms cost money.  Debate will materialize as politicians and special interest groups contend between parties to prioritize spending allocations.  Environmental pressures are likely to continue transform factories.  Factories will be regulated to reduce emissions by installing more efficient use of energy, filter systems, and extract devices.   Public works projects will spend tax dollars at record level rates to build public transportation and subsidies alternative fuels designed to reduce dependency on foreign oil.  Government power will futilely believe it can create alternate employment and facilitate participation and cooperation by guaranteeing access to the markets in the hope of gain deeper control of capitalism oriented countries.  Competitiveness in the 21st century starts with incentives that increase national savings, slash budget deficits, enhance R&D levels and bring new products to market, avoid diverting to many resources to the military, focus on well designed and reliable products, gain employment through opportunities through retraining, and raising the educational standards.  Rich countries statistically have fewer children than poor countries per capita.  The number of children is not the problem.  The problem is marketing hype that convinces millions of workers to migrate to cosmopolitan areas seeking work, only to find no work.  The mass movement from agricultural supportive geography towards urban real estate scarcity disproportionately burdens the homeowner as wages large percentage of pay are diverted to a mortgage payment or rent.  High cost of living reduces family size and hammers at the family as the basic unit.  Conservation does not work.  France is a better economic model than Sweden and Israel.  Sweden enforces policies to reduced CO2, implements a higher fuel tax than most countries, abolished nuclear energy, launched massive large scale development projects, and forces people to shift transportation from automobiles to cycles.  Large scale public projects did not elevate Japan out of depression, nor did Japan's radical monetary supply injections neither stimulate the economy, nor did zero interest incentives making money cheap attract business ventures.    France is better positioned for the future. France is the largest producer of nuclear power in the Europe. France does not have a large standing army nor does it burden itself with heavy military expenditures.   Germany may be another hidden powerhouse.   Hedge funds are providing the financial availability giving Germany the financial opportunity to grow.  Israel of recent has gained in popularity touting world class science and technology prowess.  Women roles have changed.  Technology creates new jobs and destroys old ones.   The new jobs are being competed for by men and women.   When education is widely available to women, average family size drops sharply; women delay starting a family in lieu of getting a career by an average of four years; career women postpone children through heavy usage of contraceptives; and if Japan wants to return to higher fertility rates, more than technology and cash payments to have children will be required.  Economic growth is necessary for a decent standard of living, good health care, excellent education, and more leisure.   The benefits of technology and innovation do not flow evenly and the wealth is not distributed to all.   Falling behind means failure to rethink the future, retrain, and retool for the new jobs.     The speed of human assault on nature has increased: whole countries may deforest, topsoil deprived, and critical ozone depleted.   A threshold point exists where there can not be a response because there will not be sufficient capital, skilled labor, or scientific solutions capable of fixing the damage.  The critical issues of deforestation or ignored and animal and plant extinct species are emphasized further exasperating any political hope for prudence and long term management of the forests. 
 This truly is one of the most remarkable books I've ever read and I would encourage anyone with an interest in military science, government or leadership to take the time to read it.  This book requires commitment and a quiet place to read and savor its thought-provoking passages.  The investment of time and effort is dwarfed by the magnitude of the lessons this book has to offer.  Make the commitment and you'll see why this book was a favorite of men like Alexander the Great, Scipio Africanus, Caesar and Machiavelli 
 This CD is great ! . The band is as tight as one would expect . Songs are great . There are a few songs that might fit more on a RacerX , Jimi Kidd monicker but thats pretty minor . The happy go lucky theme is the only difference . Pauls a little more serious it seems . One could argue he's gone a little over the top with the nasa theme , playing in a space , but hey....he's Paul . Linus of hollywood and Marco Minneman are great!Since it's the "Burning Organ " line up , he seems more definitive and confident playing with these guys and rightfully so , there awesome . There is moment in songs 4-8 that could go to Racer x , Jimi Kidd but the rest is unmistakedly P.G . The tuners are still super hooky , beatle-esqe melodies with P.G solos which still sounds like someone playing with six fingers . P.G 4 G3   
 I had the chance to meet Madeleine Albright in person at a company function. She is not just another politician. She is an amazing woman and person, this lead me to buy and read this book. Her outlook on life is so realistic and simple. If we listened to half of her advice our world would be more peaceful. Great reading......... 
 I bought this as a gift for a friend. She loved it and I got to listen to it!!! Classic music from a golden era 
 I went to Ranger School in 1973. After that the SF Q course. This book, so everyone knows, is small because it was not meant to be read in an armchair and sit in a library.  It is the book that fits as the sole field reference book for a Ranger or Infantryman in general, in his BDU pocket.  It is pocket sized for that reason only.  Real Rangers and Infantrmen who would carry it to the field would put it inside a ziplock baggy to keep it dry and clean and stuff it in his rucksack or pocket and consider it a luxury item!  I have about 6 or 7 editions/versions of this over my 30 year career.  The book is printed by the print shop at Fort Benning, Georgia, and each Ranger school student gets a copy, and you can pick up a copy for free at the Fort Benning post publications center.  You can also buy copies off base for a premium.  The print of the Fort Benning issue copies is of course small, but very readable. And they are stapled together.  Anything else is probably some publisher taking a copy, photocoping or camera copying the handbook, putting the resolutions in a computer, and printing their own version.  The originals are printed under the USAIS (U.S. Army Infantry School) of which the U.S. Army Ranger School is a part of.  This is a book that every member of the 75th Ranger Regiment )(the unit involved when someone says Army Rangers did this or that...).  Going to Ranger school is not the same thing as being in the 75th Ranger Regiment, though nearly all members of the 75th RgrRegt have been to Ranger School, or will go as soon as they get a school slot.  In the 75th all leaders of any rank have been to Ranger School.  Only some of the newest privates who have volunteered to go, but not yet had a school slot have not been.  Ranger School is just he "basics" of Ranger training for those in the 75th Ranger Regiment.  Ranger school trained soldiers are common and in many units of the Army.  The 75th Regt has a very elite and challenging work and training ethic befitting who they are and the missions given to them.  This handbook is not their sole reference, not even close...FM 7-8, FM 7-10, FM 7-20, etc, etc are also their guiding books...but this is a handbook every Ranger has and often carries.  If for no other reason that it is a lot simplier to look up the calculations, placement, and detonation for a specific  demolitions charge for a specific target than try to memorize the tables.  LOL   The rest of the stuff in the book is trained on so throughly every Ranger pretty much could recite it, and more importantly, implement it when under fire in combat, automatically without hesitation and a second thought.  Interested civilians might find this interesting.  The handbook is a compilation of bits and pieces of information available in many other Army references (Field Manuals, Training Bulletins, etc) but is gathered together in the Ranger Handbook so it is in one small and useful resource 
 I have been reading the Inspector Banks series of books in sequence since In A Dry Season.  I suspect I will go back and pick up the stories prior to that one later.    In reading the books the way I have been reading them, I have come to know the mai character pretty well, as the author had intended it.    There had been substantial foreshadowing of one of the murders invrestigated in this book.  Alan Banks had always brought up the memory of his friend Graham Marshall and his unexpected disappearance in his previous books.  Robinson had brought the memory up as an example of Bank's guilt and messy history.  It punctuated his complexity as a person and how that complication marks his life so far and his work as a  detective.  As such, this book should have been the most emotional and cathartic.  Instead, it was pretty much business as usual, wich was disappointing but it also underscores the fact that there is really nothing cathartic in police work.  Peter Robinson is an extraordinary writer, or else I never would have read this many books in such a short time.  His device of interweaving two separate story lines together would be disastrous in the hands of an amateur, but in Robinson's hands it is as natural as can be.  He steers the narrative easily amongst the stories and builds the tempo of the story equally until the two lines comes to a parallel climax.  In this book, the climax wasn't a real climax, it was just an ending, an explanation for the crimes.  I didn't exactly feel cheated, since I got my enjoyment out of the process of building the case and edging further into the story.  The nice moments of charater building was appropriate and it served to pull the reader into the character, made us sit notice of Alan Banks and Annie Cabbot and Jenny Fuller.    One more note, Robinson could have used the same plotting device as In A Dry Season, soince both this story and that one involved going into the past to get at the truth, but he refrained.  I think it may have hurt his narative somewhatbut I also think it was pretty brave of him to lay off the same device and stay with this plotting device, just to stay fresh.  In the end, the confrontation with Bank's past was somewhat of a let down.  The other story was actually quite engrossing, it did not quite supercede the Graham Marshall story, but it came close.  This whole book had the feel of an intermediate step to somewhere else.  But coming on the end of Aftermath, it was good to get into a standard whodunnit 
 After the birth of our second baby, I was over the moon....I felt wonderful.  I was thrilled to have a second daughter - another little princess.  As it turned out, our little princess was colic and I suffered with sleep deprivation for one full year.  At about 6 months after the baby was born I started to experience physical things I had never felt before in my life. It started with severe anxiety attacks and then after a couple of months the depression set in.  Without question, the worst time in my life. My mother picked up this book for me suspecting that I was experiencing symptons of post pardom depression.  She was right - I was. This book became my therapy - I used myself first and foremost and my family & friends as the book encouraged me to do.  This book helped me understand every sympton I was experiencing and how to deal with them. I could not have managed without this book.  The knowledge gave me power to cope and I am forever grateful for it.  My recovery is in full swing - thanks to this book. "This isn't what I expected"  is invaluable to any mother who is dealing with symptons of post pardom depression. I thank the author for writing such a powerful book in helping women overcome PPD.  
 This game set it of amazing quality. Every piece has so much detail it just looks good without doing anything! The Dubloons are the best part, and like others have said, make the BEST clinking sound when you drop a pile into your hand.  This game is definately worth buying.... IF you come up with some new rules that make the game more interesting. The gameplay is very uninteresting, boring, and brainless. My wife never passes up an opportunity to tell me how boring it was, and even her younger (12 year old) sister thought it was boring and had more fun playing with the pieces. My wife says I should have bought us Settlers of Catan instead of spending my money on this (before we got our own set... now we have one), but when I bought it I knew it would be just for the game pieces. I am brewing up some good rules to change the gameplay dramatically and make it much more interesting. She likes Settlers so much.. maybe I will get some trade of spices into the game and whatnot.  Anyways, if you are creative and have a good idea for a ship game, then DEFINATELY get this game set. It is high quality and beautiful. But, if you don't have the interest to make your own game, then pass this one up because you would most likely love to play any other game you own before this 
 Great reference for the new property manager.  Good examples and provides great guidelines 
   The legendary Eleanor of Aquitaine cuts her teeth on the politics of expediency, cobbling together a marriage in 1137 with the son and heir of Louis the Fat, Louis VII, "pale, blonde, beardless, soft as a girl, with meek eyes cast down like a novice monk's." Thinking this a masterful bargain, Eleanor, at fifteen, controls Aquitaine and Poitou after he father's untimely death, seeking only to secure her lands and her person from plundering by a less noble union. It is an impulsive match she will learn to regret as the years pass, Louis a stern spiritual taskmaster with a cold and passionless heart. The saintly Louis is more brutal in his icy contempt for others than any soldier, bereft of compassion, as rigid in his beliefs as a saint and just as dangerous. Upon his arrival to claim his bride, his southern retainers trample Aquitaine and Poitou as though they are poor stepchildren, earning the enmity of Eleanor's subjects.  On the fateful day of her marriage, Eleanor's mistake is in assuming that her intended, the future King of France, is a potential political astute, rather than an unwitting and insecure pawn, who might better spend his days in self-flagellation and repentance in a dank monastery cell. Eleanor underestimates the nature of the man she marries and his commitment to his spiritual life. Louis the Pious will never appreciate his wife's talent for politics or her female charms, too enraptured by the nature of sin to live in the real world. On Crusade with Louis in 1147, Eleanor realizes the depth of her unhappiness and the futility of her struggle against men who will not countenance the intelligence of women. After humiliating defeat, Louis leaves the land of the infidels, revising his actions until he has become a hero, Eleanor the cause of the losses.   Ball's decidedly feminist-friendly Eleanor has reached womanhood despite a stifling environment, anxious to be free of Louis and once more in control of her own property. Perhaps this is her only real conceit, for Eleanor is pawn to any man who can claim her once she leaves Louis' protection. So she makes another educated gamble, allying herself with Henry Plantagenet, who will be King Henry II of England, eschewing the emotional vacuum of her marriage to Louis for a future with Henry. Eleanor is remembered as a pawn of history, a frivolous and unfaithful wife. Perhaps not. Surviving indifference, betrayal and a natural prejudice against the female sex, the extraordinary Eleanor of Aquitaine is born to rule, Queen of France, future Queen of England and mother of Richard the Lionheart; unfortunately Louis is too blinded by asceticism and his own virtue to appreciate the value of such a consort.

 This study guide has helped so much. I have raised my school grades and knowledge about chemistry. With dedication and desire, using this book will help anyone to achieve learning more about the Ap Chemistry exam. For those who are truely dedicated in passing the test, then I reccomend buying this book. It has great detail and inpires you to go beyond your expectations 
 This is a POWERFUL book.  A good, quick read from some of our premier modern-day American historians.  This collection of essays gives us an inside look at most of the presidencies of the second half of the 20th century.  A must read for any history buff 
 I think Auster, in this remarkable novel, is trying to suggest that, skeptics be damned, the Allen Iverson-Carmelo Anthony combo can work in Denver. Auster's writing, as usual, is hypnotically fluid. But it's the message that's most powerful and leaves you haunted in the end: Iverson and Anthony, in time, will make it 
 This one is a fun watch. It isn't Great Cinema, but who cares 
 My introduction to Spooky Tooth was through a local cover band in the early seventies that performed Waitin' For The Wind.  I was completely enthralled with it and picked up the album expecting more like it.  As it turned out, that particular song is somewhat of an anomaly compared to the rest of the album (Evil Woman being the only other heavy hitter).  I was pleased nonetheless as it introduced me to their unique brand of music, and it has maintained its place over the years as one of my favorite albums.  Its appeal has a lot to do with their ability to integrate obvious influences into a signature sound.  What made them special rather than derivative involves subtle qualities that are hard to articulate.  They had the advantage of distinctive vocals, which always helps, but their music also had a unique quality that separated them from similar bands.  I would attribute that to a functional collaboration, a willingness of the stronger talent to accommodate the weaker, which made their music very engaging and varied.  If that's the case, it was also a double edged sword.  Over time they became their own worst enemy with experimental ambitions that kept fans guessing and ultimately frustrated.  Regardless, Spooky Two represents the best of what they hoped to become, an inspired effort that belongs in any respectable rock music collection 
 Thought that YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE (1967) was Sean Connery's last "Bond" film?  Well after they tried George Lazenby in the "James Bond" role in ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE (1969), they brought Sean Connery back for DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER (1971).   However, 12 years later, Sean Connery returned to be "James Bond" one last time in NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN.  This film is a rarity to see and is not part of the "official" James Bond package.  It is declared "Unofficial" because it was made by a different production company, not EON Productions..  You will notice how different the film is by the style it is filmed in and the original MI6 cast members were not cast.   M (Edward Fox) believes that James Bond (Sean Connery) has slowed down with age and has been put on a strict diet.  Bond reminds M that he now teaches and hasn't been used as a double 00.  Don't worry.  Bond will be right back in action as soon as he finishes his "therapy" with Miss Fearing (Prunella Gee).   Blofeld (Max Von Sydow) is back in action and will use Largo (Klaus Marie Brandauer) and Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera) to avenge James Bond.   Bond's mission is to go to the Bahama's and get closer to Fatima Blush and in Nice he gets to massage Domino (Kim basinger).  All in a day's work for James Bond.   Sean Connery was 52 at the time of filming and proved he was still in vigorous form.   This film was the longest "James Bond" film ever made at 2 hours, 17 minutes. Rated PG.   DVD includes spoken languages of English, Spanish.  Subtitles: French, Spanish or choose none.   Movie Trailer for "Never Say Never Again". 
 This is a great book for anyone who likes sharks.  I did not know half the things in this book.  I would rate this book 9 out of 10. There is not only info on Megalodon but on all sharks. This book tells you how shark's digestive system works, and that sharks lived before the dinosaur 
 This one's been sitting on my shelf for two years. Who needs to read a book about no one? No one. So I forgot about it until today, while weeding my unruly book collection. What a delight! Avoiding most cliches about life-writing and full of hard-won honesty, this collection of thematic essays from one ordinary-but-not life abounds with truth and sensitivity. Better than most biographies and most memoirs, the unflinching revelations by this one-out-of-many individual won my respect and my heart. Spring the $.38 and try this one. You won't be disappointed 
 An excellent, and well-balanced, history on a subject that has (sadly) very current undertones.  I recommend this book to anyone who (as I) felt under-educated about this period in our past and its implications for our future. 
 The most cogent reasons for using this book are given in its first chapter. Namely why use a pivot table? And when to recognise when you might want to do so. While it is hard to strictly demarcate these questions, they are useful in focusing on the key issues.  For why to use, it is to reduce the chance of manual error, by letting you be able to automate several or even many steps. This also permits greater productivity. From having less occasion to redo erroneous steps, and from doing faster analysis. For when, it might be due to having a large data set, or to having to find certain relationships within this.   Given the above, the rest of the book proceeds to show how to make a pivot table. There is a clear description of the anatomy of the table, which helps greatly when going through the book. 
 While overall not as gut-wrenchingly funny as In a Sunburned Country or as informative as A Short History of Everything, this book is a witty and heartwarming recollection of a world no more. Highly recommended. 
 Ridley's purpose is not to be the ethicist, but to provide an interdisciplinary account of our constitutional foundations as homo sapiens, in order for a moral theory to reflect these innate foundations. He succeeds masterfully. Indeed, Ridley's "The Origin of Virtue" succeeds in a way that Robert Wright's "The Moral Animal" fails. Whereas Wright focuses only on the Modern Synthesis of evolutionary biology and molecular genetics, Ridley incorporates both and adds ethology, comparative psychology, sociology, politics, economics, game theory, and paleontology. Wright's scope is myopic, whereas Ridley's scope is expansive. The outcomes could not be more radically different.   I dismissed Wright's book - not because it failed to explain Darwinism (it does so very well)  - but because it failed to provide any moral insight from the Modern Synthesis. Ridley does not make this mistake: He takes homo sapiens as we are, both one with Nature, yet tellingly distinct and unique as a social and rational species. Ridley does this by using a broader armamentarium from which to analyze the origins of human virtue. Consequently, Ridley accomplishes far more than Wright in half the space and time..  Ridley's territory is too sophisticated and nuanced to be summarized into several single propositions. But he leaves no stone unturned, examining a plethora of human dynamics, i.e., the innate characteristics with which we are born, the usual pattern of development after our birth, and what is factual about the real, rather than the metaphysical, world. Suffice it to say that reciprocal altruism, kin selection, unit cohesion, symbiotic collaboration, ostracism, imitation, contextualism, emotion, trade, personal property, and mutual trust all dovetail along with reason to produce a distinctive human reality.   While homo sapiens may be grounded in nature and motivated by self-interest, accepting these facts does not condemn us to a Hobbesian state of affairs. As Ridley poignantly observes, individual and collective interests break apart only when we are coercively removed from our finer instincts. We are not a blank slate, after all, but born and nurtured to do remarkably virtuous things. Ridley advocates no particular ethical theory, but shows what a theory must provide in order for it to be commensurate with our being human and to be compatible with our original innate predispositions. Wright [supra.] advocates a utilitarian ethic, not because of some intrinsic feature of utilitarianism, but, well, just because. It's no surprise then that the ethical theory Ridley most respects is the theory of moral sentiments espoused by David Hume, Adam Smith, and Francis Hutcheson in the eighteenth century. The link could not be more obvious: The theory of moral sentiments reflects on our empirical selves and how we are disposed to act towards others based on our own self-interests with benevolence.  Just because humans are genetically, physically, and biologically predisposed to act one way rather than another doesn't make such a predisposition ethically normative. Ridley avoids the naturalistic fallacy. His interdisciplinary account is intellectually and emotionally satisfying, because it draws on a plurality of disciplines to sort out our ethical origins and intuitions. Even though one does not get a complete ethical, political, or economic theory from Ridley, the implications are clear. For a fuller explication of his ideas, the reader will need to consult David Hume's "Treatise on Human Nature," Part III, or his "Enquiry into the Principles of Morals;" or Adam Smith's "Theory of Moral Sentiments;" or else Francis Hutchinson's numerous ethical essays. The political and economic implications of Ridley's account favors the writings of F.A. Hayek's "Constitution of Liberty," and other classical liberals.  At least Ridley opens the door between the Modern Synthesis and ethical, political, and economic theories. He does not have an overriding agenda (as in the Sociobiology debates), but clearly and articulately examines human nature from manifold perspectives - all grounded in empirical evidence. The result if refreshingly honest and candid; now it's up to us to decide what to do with this evidence. Highly recommended 
 As a professional musician seeking to broaden the scope of what I play this book was just the ticket.  Very sensibly laid out, easy to follow and some great Montunos to get you underway.  A practical useable book and great with the CD to play along with 
 I found "Business Darwinism" to be a no-nonsense, intelligently written evolution of information. The reading experience is educating, and at the same time, entertaining.  It's a compendium of fascinating, and important events that shaped our current day information systems models.  The Darwin, and other evolution analogies that the author selected, as well as the attention-grabbing timelines and events makes for an interesting read.  He very nicely positions the IT importance intelligently at the center of the corporate model without overstated importance, and supports it with well-built logic as to why it works.  The appeal of the book is that anyone, hanging onto any position on the corporate flagpole will find it both interesting and educational, as it helps him or her understand the core value of information at the business level, without all the technogibberish 
 This book is to books, what Jackee is to TV comedy. And what's that, Navy Bean? It's unadulterated, take-no-prisoners humor! I love Al Franken and I love Jackee. I hope they'll someday find each other and produce offspring that I'll call, Al Jaqen. Which sounds sort of weird, but for all of us Franken/Jackee fans will have a special resonance as we go forward with our lives. Maybe we'll have a signal that will tacitly tell other members who we are. Like we'd always wear orange ascots  or maybe a certain style of beret ... heavy on sequins ... light on attitude.   Al Franken's whimsical and trite prose will have you on the verge of enjoying this book. You'll enthusiastically tell all your friends, "Given a choice, I'd rather have read Star Jones new book." 
 I bought this DVD because I remember liking this new version beter than any episode of the last 3 seasons, and they don't air reruns on Boomerang. Let me tell ya, it's worth the money. The costumes of both the villians and the heroes look way better than they did in those older episodes. The episodes are  way more actiony, and that's a good thing for an action lover, like myself. Plus, there's one crossover episode called "Girl's Night Out", where Super Girl and Batgirl team up to defeat Livewire, Poison Ivy & Harly Quin. Some of the best episodes are: -Sins of the Father -Double Talk -Never Fear -Joker's Millions -Old Wounds -Legends of the Dark Knight -Beware the Creeper -Judgement Day  Special features include:  -Commentary  -Interactive Arkham Asylum -Languages & subtitles  On the downside, there's too many episodes with Batgirl. That's the only downside I can think of. This product gets a 4/5. Kudos to WB.        
 I added up these movies and if these versions were bought seperatley they would cost over $400. It breaks down to less than eight bucks a movie. This is a great deal and should not be passed up by anyone who loves classic movies. My only problem is that when my order arrived, I recieved the wrong Casablanca and the wrong One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (the single disc versions rather than the double disc ones). Amazon fixed it though and soon I will be in movie heaven. BUY THIS!!! 
 This DVD was in excellent condition and arrived within one week of purchase.  
 This book present an excellent policy analysis of USA-led enforced democratization. Based on historic-comparative study of seven such cases (Germany, Japan, Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, Kosova and Afghanistan), striking policy recommendations are derived on military and police presence over time, humanitarian help, economic reconstruction, building of civil society, holding of elections and more, as as to maximize success in democratization. In all these respects the book is outstanding, in terms of method and substance alike, as is to be expected from a RAND Corporation study. However, the book also demonstrates a widespread cultural blinder of USA policy thinking, namely underrating of cultural factors and over-optimism in respect to making the world democratic. Paradigmatic is the following statement, put forth without any reservations (on page 204) "democracy is transferable to non-Western...societies", followed by a definite statement that "there is no reason why Iraq cannot be democratized and establish democratic institutions and a pluralist polity". Little wonder that this frame of thinking, as applied in the book to Iraq, failed to foresee, at least as a contingency, what is now happening there, the idea of persistent and increasingly effective armed resistance against USA and other Western "democratizisers" after "victory" not being taken serious enough. If what is probably the best strategic Think Tank in the USA suffers from such misunderstanding of realities that do not fit into Western perceptions of "the other", there is much that USA policy makers and policy planners have to learn so as to enable the leading country of the West to fulfill is increasingly crucial role as the leading guardian of Western civilization and security 
 I normally do not care all that much for "pop-up" type books, as they tend to sort of come apart at the seams with constant use.  This one is differnt though.  It is well made and is able to stand a lot of use and abuse.  The story is great, tellin the life cycle of a butterfly.  The illustrations are quite colorful and very easy to follow and understand.  The text goes perfectly with the pictures and it is amazing how how the little one cannot keep thier fingers out of the many holes the caterpillar chews through on his way to becoming a butterfly.  This explains the life cycle of the butterfly.  I found, with my grandchildren, that after reading the book (time and time again) that when we captured a live caterpillar, gave it plenty to eat, and let it go through the entire process as shown in the book, they, the grandchildern were absolutely fascinated.  Recommend this one highly. 
 well this is one of the best dj cds there is and thats great people still listing coments 5 years later but it well worth the buy if you have not already when the new cd coming taylor we waiting hope soon dont think you can beat this one though well see whats u 
 Dorothy Harbour has written a wonderful and easy to follow book that is great for beginners as well as more experienced people interested in protecting themselves from unseen influences.  She takes you step-by-step through her easy to understand methods on how to protect yourself from energy vampires at work, including mob attacks, personal relationship energy vampires, and also other energy draining people such as salesman, and many more. She explains the importance of the chakras, how to open, cleanse, and close them too.  This is a complete guide that anybody can use and see improvements in their life immediately 
 This album by far is my favorite. I think Chesney has come in to his own as a performer and this CD validates his efforts as a songwriter. I would not be the person I am today if not for a crazy synchronicity of events that started one day while listening to Old Blue Chair. Twelve months later, I had completed my book "Good Music is Better Than Sex: My Search for the Old Blue Chair".   This music can ease the stress of a bad day, take me back to the islands and remember to enjoy life. A little note to the men out there - you need an idea for romance....candlelight, the beach and play the song "Magic". I could fall in love to that song! 
 In C.S. Lewis' defense, I believe his chauvinistic comments are caused by his age and traditional views regarding the bible's interpretation, and not so much because he thought of women as worthless. Despite that little "rough spot" of his, I thoroughly enjoyed C.S. Lewis' writing style and ideas regarding the common grounds between the Christian denominations. If only more of us realized that we are to think for ourselves, and realized that religious divisions over what is, actually, very similar is hindering our understanding of God's love for us and our ability to love thy neighbor. Personally, C.S. Lewis REALLY hit me home when he talked about pride as a pretty significant sin. I'm guilty.  There are many, many good messages out there, but they are lost due to dry writing and heavy concepts. C.S. Lewis' "Mere Christianity" does a great job of sharing his insight and research to either draw people back to their faith or inform others that want to learn about some basic Christianity. His simplicity is simply the art of taking heavy concepts and relating them in digestible chunks. This is a GREAT read!!  
 This is an essential movie to own for any Superman fan. Christopher Reeves is the perfect Clark Kent/Superman. He really developes both characters. A special effects icon for its time 
 Like the other two volumes, this book is the definite bible if you are interested in HTTP, T/TCP and UDP. As time passes, these protocols will be used more widely and one will see more people interseted in the book.  Similar protocols just start to emerge in areas such as wireless... 
 I am not sure what the people who wrote negative reviews are listening to.  I, like another reviewer, have not removed this CD from my player since the release date.  I think these guys have made the same turn as Slipknot with this album. Yes, it is slightly less heavy, but I see a lot of old school influences in this album.  I think this CD is inspired and well produced.  I have seen these guys 3 times and they have rocked every time.  Also, the last time I seen them, I seen Brian and walked up to him and told him that they put on a great show.  He thanked me and shook my hand.  I think this CD is close to being a Grammy contender and it may be that they took some advice from Slipknot and Stone Sour, because evertime I seen them, it was with either one of these bands.  If you like Shadows and you are open to the new direction they seem to be taking, you will love this album.  They are a talented bunch of musicians 
 This is an awesome book that will teach you a way to live and not diet or be obsessed about your weight.This book will help you develop a healthy relationship to your own body, the food you eat and you will loose weight without dieting. Fed Up will help you develop a lifelong way of feeling and looking great without the crazy Yo Yo of diets. It is also a good read with lots of useful information that affects all of us that have had difficulties with food. I recommend this book strongly 
 This is the only place that I could find this pan, I looked everyplace locally that I could think of.  I couldn't find it anywhere else on the internet except Amazon.  I have one like this, and I absolutely love it...use it all of the time.  I wanted another for a gift.  Fantastic price, great quality. Shipping was very fast 
 I liked this movie because it was able to holds ones intrest. It brought two familys together and how important family is to one another. How love can bring straingers together. How important Christ is to Christmas. It also shows one that God has an altament plan for each one of us. No mater how much we try to avoid love. It was love that Made Christmas. Gods Love that created Christmas.For without Christ. There would be no Christmas. I think that the author is wonderful, all of his work is just fabulious. The Christmas Box was the most beautiful movie that I have ever seen. Richard Was able to find the true meaning of christmas and love was the reasion 
 My sister-in-law used this book and gave it to me when I got engaged.  It was a complete lifesaver for me.  I did not copy these notes verbatim, but even reading through the "old-fashioned" phrasing in the sample notes gave me inspiration for writing my own.  I find that the hardest part of thank-you notes is coming up with what to say after "Thank you for the ___."  This book is full of ideas.    I am actually buying a copy for my new sister-in-law to be, because I want to keep my own copy around for birthdays and Christmas.  
 I saw myself in this book, and it wasn't pretty. We try so hard as parents to do the right thing, to give sound advice, to hear our kids out and even go to their defense. The thing I learned most from this book is that I actually hindered my childrens' growth in becoming responsible teens and maybe missed out on some real opportunities for communication. This book should be required reading for parents of children entering the "tween" years and middle school 
 This book is one of the most comprehensive books about swords, their history, their use, and the concepts behind their effectiveness.  Burton's wording may be a little hefty, but his illustrations do an excellent job of conveying the point to the reader.  I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in swords and their history 
 I thought the movie was really good. there are a couple parts that could have been better, but for the most part it is a really good movie. if you like stephen king movies you will like this one.. 
 This book is wonderful.  The book highlights the key points of becoming successful in sales and any other facet of life.  The book is simple, easy to read, and information packed.  This book would benefit anyone of any age.  If you want to become successful, add this book to your own personal library today!  Charles Holmes Author, The Little Book About Big Succes 
 	When I was in fifth grade I found an excerpt from Flowers for Algernon in our textbook. I found the piece quite interesting but I knew that it was a more advanced book so I waited to read it. I finally bought and read it a few years later.  	Flowers for Algernon is about Charlie Gordon, a mentally challenged individual in his thirties. As a child his mother treated him harshly because he was not a normal kid. He wishes to be smart so he can impress his family that sent him away and understand the jokes his friends make. Charlie learns of an experiment that will make him smarter, he eagerly accepts. The experiment has never been done before on a human making Charlie the first. At the lab there is a mouse named Algernon, who can beat Charlie at solving puzzles. Charlie becomes angry that he can be beat by a mouse , but he later finds out that Algernon also has had his intelligence increased. Charlie's intelligence increases beyond the expectations of the scientists. He becomes a genius, smarter than the scientists that experimented on him. He experiences love, learning, and a life he could never imagine, until Algernon's intelligence and temper quickly disintegrate. Charlie wonders what will happen to him and if he will be able to hold on to his intelligence.  	Charlie, the main character, is faced with many difficulties in his life, being mentally retarded and then becoming too smart to have conversations with others. He experiences both sides of the intellectual field. When he is dumb he looks up to those smarter than him and idolizes them. He knows he is different and wants to become like those around him. The simple people around him make jokes about him, but he feels they are his friends because they laugh with him. When Charlie becomes smarter he realizes they were making fun of him. As he surpasses the scientists in intelligence he feels disappointed because he once believed them to be great minds, capable of doing anything.  Daniel Keyes illustrates that mentally challenged people know they are different and wish to be normal. They may not be able to become smarter but they can see their weaknesses.  	This book is an easy read because it is written in as a journal. In the beginning the entries are poorly spelled and have terrible grammar. As he progressively gets smarter the entries become more intelligent and better worded. I liked the style because it was realistically written. Daniel Keyes writes it so you can see the progression of Charlie's mind as he becomes smarter. The style is colloquial because it is as if Charlie is writing in his journal.  	I enjoyed this book because it was written from Charlie's standpoint. He did not beg for pity or lament over his condition. He simply wished to be smarter and took a chance at fulfilling his wish. I would recommend this book because it illustrates difficulties of the two extremes of human intelligence. 
 My boy brought this home the school library and the title of the book intrigued me. What is it like to swim by swishing your tail, round and round, in a small little bowl; or, eating fish flakes sprinkled from above when the person decides it's time to be fed; or to live in an environment that deteriorates day after day into murkiness until you are suddenly scooped up by a net and put into an even smaller container while your bowl is being cleaned? What IS it like to be a fish? Alas, there are no answers to that question found in this book -- pity.   But ontological musings aside, this book is a good little read for kids who, for the first time, are interested in having a fish as a pet. The book uses the common goldfish as its example. It shows the different environments in which a little child might encounter a fish: a bowl, an aquarium, a plastic bag being brought home from the pet store and swimming around in a backyard pond. It also tells what the different fins are called, how do fish sleep, are they warm or cold-blooded, how do they breath water when I can't, and similar questions a young child might ask when they have their first fish. It tells you how to set up a goldfish bowl and why you put the bag in the water for awhile without setting the fishies free. Basic stuff for the adult, good for the child who shows interest in having a fish pet.  Now if only that title-question was answered.. 
 I thought the sound quality was very good. I enjoyed the CD very much 
 I own a country store and am a serious book junkie.  I put all my stuff on the shelves, free for the taking, and encourage others to do the same.  I just happened upon this book in this fashion, a dog-eared paperback left by a stranger.  For reference I am a Michael Connoly, Robert Crais, James Lee Burke sort of a person.  Denise Mina is right up there with the best of them.  I always feel like apologizing for the time I give up to mysteries...but I have to say that I love the writing, the characters, the insights these authors bring to the table....it is not just plot and action.  Denise Mina writes about Glasgow.  Her heroine is an Irish Catholic girl from a working class family....not an upwardly mobile LA male.  Her heroine is quiet, self deprecating, subtle...and so is the writing.  This was something completely different.....but I loved the characters, the insights, the writing.....Enough to drop everything and go out to Borders and buy the hardback of her new book.  Highly recommended.    
 This classic can be a life changer for the person who thinks he can get to heaven by being good. When Jonathan Edwards preached this message he had "nominal" church going Christians falling on their knees in repentence and in fear of Hell. He tells of God's grace and the way to heaven through Jesus Christ.  
 I purchase this for myself for those Spring or Summer soaking rains drop 
 I'd never seen or heard As Cities Burn, but after numerous good reviews here, I decided to give their music a shot.  I love hard music, especially if it deals with faith in realistic terms.  I read through the lyrics before listening to the disk, and I was blown away by the poetic, yet gut-wrenching honesty, of these words.  Then, I listened through the songs.  I wasn't overwhelmed at first by the music, but it was decent.  Then, I listened again.  It started to grow on me.  By the third and fourth spins, I was hooked on this CD.  If you are like me, sick of "worship" music that doesn't address real issues and emotions, tired of run-of-the-mill radio rock, you simply must give As Cities Burn a try.  This is music that wades through life's questions and frustrations, while never letting go of the rope of faith 
 This Box set of Lord of the Rings is great I love this book and this set is great I have never been happier with a book set 
 If you read "The Four Agreements", you will enjoy this book.  It's a good one to sit down with at any time you need some quiet time for meditation.  
 This book, written shortly after Charlotte's death by request of her father, shows the passionate and creative side to Charlotte's nature that her contemporary society were not aware of. You feel like you are actually  watching her life pass by as Mrs. Gaskell describes every minute detail  concerning the Bronte parsonage and the nearby surroundings. It is a happy  story, particularly when the Haworth house learnt the news of their  publications, and in general it tells of a very contented household. Their  is a degree of poigency, however, as the reader follows Charlotte through  the loss of her beloved siblings one by one. When after their deathes she  eventually finds  happiness, it is very shortlived as her untimely demise  occurs shortly after her union with Athur Bell Nicholls. Mrs. Gaskell  portrays her friend Charlotte as a warm and generous person and this book  is a must for any Bronte lover 
 There are a number of truly excellent reviews of this book on Amazon praising it highly . I agree with the praise. I remember reading the book , and wondering how the writer and main character who had failed in everything had realized my dream of writing a great book which would somehow justify the life and cancel the failure.  I do not remember the book that well. I do remember that in reading I felt it was the remarkably honest account of a person whose experience and language were rich and wild in a way mine were not.  The sympathy for the character were however qualified by a sense that even one's own self- destructiveness should have a limit - and that when it comes to screwing up things for the people closest to you - the ones who do possibly care a little. 
 Jim Henson is more genius than we know.  Beyond Labyrinth, Big Bird and Miss Piggy comes a story far different and far more fantastical than anything ever exhibited on screen to date.  It was a movie created many, many years before its time that explored aspects and concepts that exist in the philosophies of some of our oldest religions today...along with a great adventure story.     While exhibited in the guise of a children's fantasy film, if you dig deeper in the symbology and metaphors of the film there are great truths that exist.  The oneness of life, humanity and spirit.  The duality of good and evil.  Mortality and immortality.  Images of light and darkness.  What a genious manner in which it was filmed, scored and portrayed.  This is indeed Jim henson's finest cinematic work.    Some beliefs do acknowledge that in ancient of ancient times there was life in all things:  rocks, plants, trees could talk and move, there existed a highly sophisticated and superior race of beings that suddenly vanished or became obliterated.    It is understandable that "The Dark Crystal" had failed at the box office when it first came out.  Such a small scale epic could not compete in the shadow of the success of the original Star Wars.  But this quieter film is still a spectacle of its own and, much like its Star Wars counterpart, has become a unique classic of richness and depth...one that can never be repeated again. I've enjoyed this movie since I was a kid, and it's never lost its appeal after 24 years. This is well worth the money spent to keep in your DVD library    
 This is another of them -- they keep you reading (I read this one in a couple of days) and you enjoy them while you're reading them.  And yet...  They are not all that memorable and sometimes I find her "detective" characters (Brady and Beaumont) indefinably irritating -- they're just too good to be true, just too competent, and not vulnerable enough. Quite frankly, them and their near-perfect lives are intimidating. I'll bet Joanna Brady's house is never a mess -- she's got the perfect husband staying home taking care of everything for her.  I guess that's every working woman's dream...  Aside from that...this is a well-constructed and well-written mystery.  Although one reviewer said he/she knew all along who did it, I didn't, although in retrospect it all made sense, which makes for a good mystery in my opinion.  The plot involves a woman murdered in her trailer -- for some reason she has 17 dogs in the trailer with her and they die of the heat before her body is discovered.  With all those dogs, there's a subplot about animal welfare issues (although personally I think the word "hoarder" gets thrown around too much and the issue ought to be not the number of animals but whether they're adequately cared for).  Another subplot involves polygamous communities in the Arizona area (where the Joanna Brady series is set).  Then there are two other bodies that may connect to the woman in the trailer, and a coyote driving an SUV full of undocumented aliens trying to slip across the border -- all in all, there are a lot of subplots being juggled in this story, and the plot moves back and forth among all of these subplots.  All in all, Jance is an excellent craftsman, and I like the Joanna Brady series, but there are days when I wish that Sheriff Brady was less intimidating.  I can recommend this book as being at least equal to others in the series (and maybe better) for those already familiar with the Joanna Brady series.  
 Everyone says the samething about this book: I've got no idea what's going on. The fact is, the beginning of this story is setting you up for the events to come, and that is exactly how you need to look at it. I personally think this is a masterpiece; truly a brilliant book. There are so many great references in this book, and so many ingenious twists and turns that it puts the reader right into the world that these two ingenious minds have created. So do yourself a favor: Read on! You won't regret it. 
 This book aims to yield maximum productivity by simplifying the workplace. It includes an analysis of the deeper psychological elements of clutter, including issues of reducing stress and achieving balance between work time and family time. A nice approach and a handy guide 
 Master reggae musician Fred Locks released a genuine masterpiece with "Black Star Liner," a powerful album performed with elegant, passionate simplicity. "Missing Link" is the long lost follow-up to "Liner," recorded in 1978 but unreleased until now. Digitally remixed in 1999, the sound is clear and pure, and definitely in the rootsy style of Fred Locks' first album. Locks is a true original and any new release is a treat, but this "new/old" album is especially welcome and well worth adding to your collection 
 Tsering Shakya's account of Tibet since (and shortly before) the Chinese invasion is a fair and open-minded, and well-researched history.  At times the writing does become sodden, but Shakya's presentation of the many forces at work in the sad history of the Chinese occupation of Tibet shows that while China has committed crime upom crime, elements of Tibetan society have aided, abetted and , in some cases, participated Chinese domination and terror.  While Tibetan monastic and aristocratic circles come under considerable criticism, one also understands that this was a titanic mismatch to begin with.  The international community gets considerable critical coverage, in particular Nehru's India and Great Britain.  The bottom line behind this history is how ill-equipped Tibet was for the cataclysms of the mid- to- late- 20th century, and how their reactions varied.  Exhaustive but very readable.  If you are interested in Tibet at all, this book is a mandatury palliative to a diet that leans too much on the spiritual side of Tibetan culture and thought.     
 This grill works great everytime! The only problem I have is with the lighter, but it is not a big deal. Easy to use, and always give a great grilling experiences 
 and Jim White helps make it that way.  An interesting mix of found sounds, country-folk and odd, confessional songwriting, WRONG-EYED JESUS is an interesting trip through the Southern Gothic mind of Jim White.  Though not essential, White's reports from the fringes and the far recesses of his psyche are never less than entertaining. I'd also recommend his other record, NO SUCH PLACE, which despite flawed production, has even better songs.  Of special note is the essay from which the album title derives.  If his musical career should dry up, he would be well advised to try his hand at the litarary life 
 After having this book for less than 24 hours I have already learned so much.  From something as simple as pureeing red beets with potatos.. why havnt I thought of doing that... to using plastic wrap as sausage casings..  I have attended culinary school, and am starting my first restaurant job on Monday... so while I am not a home cook per se... this book is very inspirational and very doable for the earnest and experienced home cook.    A word about the photograpy: Gorgeous.  Buy this cookbook, as it is definately one of the years, if not past five years best.  You will treasure it 
 A great book of portraits that reads like a museum show- very beautifully done.  Large, exquisite reproductions, zero text until the end with an essay and interview with Michael Almereyda. 
 A must read for anyone who wants to get somewhere in life. Are you someone who just goes with the flow and then wonders why you're not getting where you want to be, or not getting there quick enough? Are you unhappy with the deck you are being dealt at work, or the path your career is taking? Are you trying to lead a company and you have nothing but headaches during your working day? If you answer "yes" to any one of these questions, then read this book. It's a very well written book on time management.  The book addresses workload challenges, unproductivity, the importance of goals, and provides practical insights, good strategies, and helpful tips. It will inform you (or remind you) that good meetings are paramount at work. It points out that a well-kept desk as opposed to a sloppy one will make you a more productive person. And that phone calls and emails should not be an all-day thing; they should be compartmentalized and dealt with in time blocks.  Although multitasking is probably the norm in most people's lives today, this book will remind you that making action item lists each morning and strategically organizing the action items is a far superior way of getting things done than just doing tasks as they show up in your face.  The title of this book includes the word "success." And the author in his book talks about the importance of goals in order to have a chance at success. If one focuses on goals and maps out or plans a series of objectives necessary to reach those goals, then it's just a matter of performing the tasks necessary to meet the objectives to reach the goal. Spend your time doing the things that will move you toward your goals, and eliminate or minimize your participation in activities that don't help you reach your goals. That's the essence of time management, and the essence of the message of this book.  It's an easy read, and one that is well worth your time 
 One of the system architecture ideas that has waxed and waned over the years is the concept of an Information Dashboard...  a single screen of data that summarizes key data points for quick monitoring by executives.  But just throwing a few graphs on the web page isn't necessarily the right thing to do.  Stephen Few covers the subject of dashboard design in his book Information Dashboard Design : The Effective Visual Communication of Data.  Contents: Clarifying the Vision; Variations in Dashboard Uses and Data; Thirteen Common Mistakes in Dashboard Design; Tapping Into the Power of Visual Perception; Eloquence Through Simplicity; Effective Dashboard Display Media; Designing Dashboards for Usability; Putting it All Together; Appendix; Index  For someone like me (not a whiz when it comes to graphic design) to really like a book of this nature is saying something.  I actually understood everything he was writing, and I didn't think this was some self-serving "listen to me because I'm an expert" volume.  The book is printed on heavy paper stock and full color, so the examples don't lose any impact in the normal translation to black and white.  Lavishly illustrated with examples both good and bad, it's easy to see why some things work and some don't.  Even designs that I thought "looked" professional had significant drawbacks.  For instance, colors should represent the same thing throughout the page.  Don't make a pie chart with a red slice if you want red to represent a danger indicator somewhere else on the screen.  Minimize the non-data pixels so the eyes don't have to work at interpreting data from "fluff" (like graph lines).  And when you're choosing graphing formats, make sure you choose ones which are relevant to the data being displayed.  Don't choose a pie chart when a bar graph makes an easier comparison.  He even goes into color choices and how they cause the mind and eye to group things on the page.  Normally I'd be reading material like this with a "says you!" attitude, but there wasn't a single instance where I thought he was pushing his own preferences instead of something that actually made sense and had some research behind it.  I actually found myself thinking about some of my own application designs based on the material presented, as well as how I need to change a few things along the way.  If you're not a graphically oriented person (like I'm not), this book is a lifesaver for your design and development efforts.  It should remain close at hand as you do your web site design on a daily basis.  And even if you *do* know what you're doing, you will likely become a whole lot better at it after reading Information Dashboard Design 
 My 3 year old son is a big fan of Thomas and Friends.  This was one of the first books I bought for him.  Since this book, I bought another one ("Cow on a Line") and the second book does not even come close to this one.  "Down at the Docks" is illustrated not with photos but with drawings - and I think the drawings are far more effective in telling the story than the photos.  "Down at the Docks" has a story line that is more plausible, and complete, than other books I've seen so far.  It is my son's favorite book.  The books that have more than one story (this one does not) seem to sell short on plot, and explanation of the story 
 This well researched tale of exploration and discovery is one of the best biographies I've ever read. The achievements of Captain Cook and his crewmen are incredible. In the age of "survivor" TV this story resonates with true courage and ingenuity. The range of Cook's travels from the South Pacific to the coast of Alaska and the varying conditions that were encountered make for an emjoyable read. Highest recommendation. A book to be read and reread 
 The outstanding cast in this true story of China Gordon's demise in the Sudan at the hands of the presumed "Mahdi" in 1884, is only one of several factors that make this a great film.  The story line is excellent, as it not only presents the desert conflict battle scenes extremely well, but it also visually describes the political and social intrigue involved in the British efforts to establish and maintain its colonial empire in that era.  In a subtle and obviously unintentional manner, the film also presents some hints of contemporary conflicts and social issues.  A truly fine film 
 made me grateful about those long, boring afternoons spent in learning English!I just read all the reviews: Some were written by real experts. But some of them depict this novel as "too long" (I WISHED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LONGER!")"boring" (This lady is far of understanding any book:  This book is a living proof of the geniality of Styron : He is capable of describing the most shining and also the most heinous feelings of a character. Styron strips the characters and drive us to watch them as they really are. This is one of the most soul tearing book ever...and the argument is unique, BRUTAL, TERRIFYNG and BEATIFUL 
 This is a difficult book to review because it's truly head and shoulders above most books I've read in this genre and that sounds like a knock against the others and it's not ... this is just a well written book. The subject matter makes it difficult to distinguish fact from fiction and to substantiate identities, locations and time lines. So my hat's off to anyone who tries to make some sense of the sensational headlines, first person accounts and "alibis" of the time. Writing such a book, though exciting, must be a nightmare sifting through all this info. "Baby Face" does an admirable job in bringing all this into a coherent focus. In addition, this book chronicles and brings into focus someone who has been on the periphery in the other books I've read on this time period, (specifically Dillinger, Chicago crime and Depression bank robbers). The book also gives the reader insight into the early workings of J. Edgar Hoover's (F)BI and its personnel and contains the most detailed description of "The Little Bohemia" debacle I've read. Very entertaining and interesting book.  
 I thoroughly enjoyed reading "Women of the Vine" by Deborah Brenner. This book not only will appeal to those interested in the world of wine, it also provides thought-provoking stories about great women "at the helm" who will inspire all of us to follow our dreams! Owner, Dancing on Grapes, a wine tasting event company, specializing in events for women 
  turns in his life...because his happiness shines through in the warmth of this, his debut album.    You've got to wonder if SONY music is really serious about supporting the artists that the population enjoys discovering from the show, "Nashville Star".  There has been absolutely NO promotion of Brad Cotter's (the show's season 2 winner) first CD.  Country fans who loved Cotter on the show haven't purchased the CD because they just don't know it is out there.  And so, the title is apt, "Patient Man", which Cotter has been, through over a decade of kicking around Nashville, trying to find where he fits in.    Cotter was not even selected for the group of artists in the finals by the panel of judges.  Instead, he was a shoo-in vote from the television audience, sort of a "wild card".  Grudgingly, the judges on the show came to accept and even look forward to his performances.  Sans cowboy hat, and looking more at home behind a keyboard than a guitar, Cotter just didn't measure up to the male profile of the kind of singer that SONY had in mind to win the contest.    Last year's winner, Buddy Jewell, was more of the Merle Haggard type with a richer voice than Cotter, but even Buddy, who had a lot of success with his first CD, was buried by SONY in the back of the pack with his superlative second effort, "Tales of the New West".    There are some parallels between the audiences' passion for Cotter and the establishment scratching its head ..."how are we gonna sell this guy?"....with ubersinger Clay Aiken.  Again, here's an unlikely audience magnet with some real talent who just doesn't fit into the style that the puppeteer record company chooses.  No doubt, Cotter will not have as easy a path as Aiken did, and, he's already put in his time to get the respect he deserves.    It is true that there is something of a bad boy, ladies' man aura about Cotter, which makes his filmed performances much more compelling than his recorded CD.  Thus, videos from the CD would have gone a long way, with more promotion, to selling these cuts.  It'll remain to be seen what will happen to Brad after this initial effort.  One thing is for sure, he had much more songwriting talent than the others in the "Nashville Star" competition.  In fact, two songs from the CD that were featured on the show, "I Miss Me", a unique angle at a break up song, (where the singer focuses on all the things he misses about being the man HE was when the woman he loved was around) that will definitely give you the blues, and the stunning "I Meant To", are as good as any country songs written in the last decade.  In both, Cotter is wistful and real as a man who's known love and lost it.  Cotter was the driving creative force behind these two songs, and SONY gave him talent in the form of producer-writers Steve Bogard and Rick Giles (who've also worked with Travis Tritt) to enhance his original music.  The Cotter-Bogard-Giles songs number 5 on this CD, with only the storytelling cut "High On Love", that was a swing and a miss.    Besides "I Miss Me" and "I Meant To", Cotter expresses some of his strong faith-based self in "Hard to Be a Rock" and the understated "I've Got Time", which closes the album and pretty much sums up the place where Cotter finds himself.  Superlative numbers on the CD by JUST the Bogard-Giles duo include "Can't Tell Me Nothing" - the second single release, an understated rebel song.  It's perfect for Cotter, and he vastly improves on the original by Travis Tritt.  "Patient Man" also illustrates Cotter's life and career lyrically, and, although it seems ordinary at first, the song really grows on you.  The instrumentals on both are very well done, illustrating the fact that they weren't jammed onto the CD in the attempt to get it out to the masses with minimal $$ spent, so the label could capitalize on the show and the tour that followed it.    Cotter shows he can have fun on "Rock and Roll in the Hay", which is enjoyable, and trendy given the recent successes Chesney-Cracker and the Buffet Brigade have had with good ole boy songs.  It's a nice change-up for Cotter.  Not so for "Blue Collar Night", which is dull and ordinary.  Lastly, there's a song called "I Came Here To Live" that really grows on you - it's about throwing off the wildness of youth and coming to the realization of what is important in life as you gain in responsibility.    SONY didn't overproduce the CD; the musicianship is excellent, and the acoustic guitar, use of piano and pedal steel, and some fine percussion give Cotter a great neighborhood.   This is a superior CD by an artist that should be able to grow into bigger and better things; but make no mistake, the real draw behind Cotter is the connection he makes with a live audience; so touring and videos that show that appeal should be high on his list and the list of whatever label is lucky enough to work with him in the future.  A great choice for most country fans, and, let's face it, particularly women! 
 Shelly Burke has created a comprehensive, beautifully written guide for At-Home Moms.  As a Registered Nurse, she knows the importance of caring for yourself physically, emotionally and spiritually before you'll have the energy to care for others.  And, as a mom herself, Shelly understands the demands of a family and a part time career.  I wish I'd had her book to read when our children were still at home, but find that many of her helpful suggestions are still beneficial when our children and grandchildren visit.    She'll help you set your goals and priorities, and she offers a wealth of helpful suggestions for dealing with all that At-Home Mom's encounter - fussy or ill kids, tired and hungry husbands, extended family challenges, demands from friends, the difficulty of running a house-hold, and good advice for handling your finances.  Shelly covers it all and ends each chapter with an uplifting Bible verse to nourish your soul.    If you are an At-Home Mom, a Mom working out of the home, or a Grandma, you'll gain a wealth of information from reading Home is Where the Mom Is. 
 This album is unbelievably fantastic!!!! RISE is one of the most inspirational songs of all time - I LOVE IT!  U GONNA BE ALRIGHT  is so uplifting that you can't help but smile! This album is a must have in anyone's CD collection!  
 The Japanese Art of Reiki from a practioner/students perspective is a sequel to the authors first major publication, " The Reiki Sourcebook ". As with their first work of art, this book presents the reader with valid material that can be used as a foundation/building block for continued studies. As most Japanese culture is preserved in a cocoon of secrecy and perhaps intrigue, it is difficult for westerners to get to the essence of it all. Bronwen & Frans, through their committment to Usui, Reiki and the continuation of traditional Japanese Reiki styles, have once again excelled with this work. It is indeed, the Britannica of Reiki, a must for everyone to assist them on their journey. 
 Mandy Patinkin was shown only in one small part of "Evita." That was very disappointing and I thought by the title he would be one of the hosts or at least a larger segment of him in "Evita." So why was he advertised in the title? The show was put together very well and the quality of the color and the production is excelent. It had a 3D effect which is very prominent, especially, with the hosting of Jerry Orbach. The shows chosen were all of my favorites and so I was pleased with that part of the CD.  But not enough of Mandy Patinkin. I don't think that you should advertise this CD by using Mandy's name as a come on. It sure fooled me. 
 Every few years I re-read this book as my music career grows and I find new ways to use the expertise she has gathered here. The book is a pleasure to read, with clear writing, fine organization and listings of valuable resources and contacts. Highly recommended! 
 This is the first Oliver Sacks book I've read and I found it fascinating and informative.  Once I started a case history I was hard-put to stop reading until I found out the end result.  I particularly enjoyed the stories about the amnesiac Greg and the colorblind artist.  Sacks puts a human face on insights about how our brains work in an intellectually stimulating yet emotionally touching way.  I found the story about Virgil, the blind man who gets his sight back and must learn how to see in his 50s particularly heart-wrenching.  The only story I bailed out on was about an autistic woman who works in a cattle slaughterhouse.  (I could not handle the graphic nature of the story.)  I definitely recommend this book if you appreciate shows like Nova or if you watch Discovery television.  Anyone who wants to know more about the mysteries of our human brains will be enriched by this book 
 This author expresses eloquently and with rational clarity why we "leftward" leaning Christians are so uncomfortable with the unrighteous dealings from the religious right.  Well spoken, no minced words, forthright, and full of truth.  A worthwhile read for thinking Christians and those who are not Christians and have been hurt by the actions of the religious right.  
 One-hundred front pages cover what claim to be editions of The Onion from 1900 to 1999. The hilarious headlines parody great and small events of the century that was. From the moon walk and great depression to Archduke Ferdinand emerging alive and well from his vacation right after the end of WWI (a thinking person's macabre joke there) the writers who created these would-be newspapers have authored some brilliantly-conceived satire that's delightful to read. The language, tone and even the typefaces are perfect for the respective eras that are being teased. Pay attention to the fine print and advertisements in these papers, there's a lot off the beaten track, too. Oh, and this is most definitely NOT for the easily offended or the non-literate. 
 Emmylou has always had an edge to her. Hell, it's not like she had her career handed to her on a silver platter(though a certain friendship with Gram Parsons didn't hurt). And, in her older age, she shows off a contemplative, brooding and experimental side. On this album, she shows that she not only sings classic country. Modern folk is well within grasp. The fingerprints of Daniel Lanois are all over this album as well. It's got the 'atmosphere' sound and pulsing beat that distinguishes his sound. This may not be for the Emmylou purist, however, it stands as one of the best albums of all time.  
 As a child my favorite teachers in elementary school where the ones who read to us aloud.  I even had a 6th grade teacher who loved to read to us.  Ahh, I miss those days. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this to my children, yes even Dad and the older teen would wander into the room when I was reading this book.  A great Dragon-tale.  I do so enjoy going along for a new adventure without ever leaving the ground. Many praises for Cornelia's Fantastical Fun ride 
 When I read this book, the only other works of Elie Wiesel that I read were those from The Night Trilogy.  The Town Beyond the Wall is a bit of a departure from those three stories.  You see more optimism in this work, though this only becomes obvious towards the end.  The language is more poetic and really sucks you into the protagonist's world 
 I love this cd! It really has everything included of what makes up a great cd, catchy chorus, great riffs, awesome vocals. I greatly recommend all rockers out there getting this it is definetly worth it, my favorite song on this disc is 'Lady Of The Valley'. I like just about every song on here, I think there are 2 songs on the whole thing that I dont care for. But the buttom line is that this really is a great cd 
 I highly recommend this book, especially if you're buying it for someone who is into making music.  they seem to appreciate it much better 
 We are now in another one of those periods of revival of interest in, and appreciation of, Jane Austen. There have been at least two films, one cable one commercial, released over the past several years that are based on one of her better novels, The Pride and Prejudice. Ordinarily I have found that films made for cable are inferior to those produced for the commercial film market. Not here. The A&E production is far superior in presentation not the least of which is that it is truer to the Austen story line than the commercial film. Moreover, as an added treat, the film itself is over five hours long and therefore can get a leisurely treatment to Austen's themes of love and life, horse riding and letter writing among the early 18th century English `squirearcy'. Despite the length the film moves along with few dull spots.  And what of the story line? Well it seems that certain very rich young landowner, a Mr. Darcy, with just the right connections and, Miss Elizabeth Bennett, one of five daughters of a country squire who estate has been entailed away from any ability to provide for his wife and daughters are smitten with each other. However both parties must endure many trials and tribulations, to speak nothing of personal misunderstandings between them, before the romantic tensions can be resolved and they can snuggle down in Mr. Darcy's little mansion. On a personal level this is about overweening pride (naturally) -his- that stood for a long time in the way of unleashing his feelings is an adult way. The prejudice part comes from both parties as both are very class-conscious and committed to the, frankly, unseemly and irrationally snobbish nature of the English gentry. In the end, (since we know that the couple will ride happily into the sunset) Austen's looks at English morals, mores and manners just before the full effects of the Industrial Revolution hit that society is what drives one to watch the movie. Ms. Austen had a very good ear for picking up the language of these `gentle' people.  Damn it though, those times were tough for an independent-minded intelligent young woman with no means. Kudos to Miss Elizabeth Bennett.                   
 I miss The Far Side and wish Larson would put out something new in that vein, but that doesn't mean a book like this can't be enjoyed in the meantime. Larson is a man who has always been interested in the microcosmic civilizations under rocks and logs and piles of laundry in hall closets, and here he tells a story with no less than an earthworm as its main character. Larson focuses on the moving and shaking on the unseen level that goes on in nature, all around us, all the time. He hides a fable here in this humorous story and he's right in his message: nature isn't there for us to use and abuse, we're part of something larger than we are, and unless we want some seriously bad consequences, we'd better take stock of how we humans are using the resources of our planet. That's what I felt Larson was telling us here. If you missed that part but still got some good laughs, then, hey, this creepy-goofy-witty post-Far Side maiden effort on Larson's part still delivered for you, huh?  This book came out in 1995. I wonder why Larson's been so quiet for the last decade? Gary, I really miss you, dude 
 Mrs Brontë tells the tale of Agnes Grey, a young governess of a little over 20 and her experience working for two families, The Bloomfields and their 3 children Tom, Mary Ann and Fanny, and with the Murrays and their two daughters Mathilda and Rosalie. In writing her first novel, Mrs Brontë must have drawn from her own experiences in 1839 when she worked for the Ingham family at Blake Hall and from 1840 till 1845 with the Robinsons at Thorp Green Hall. As her sister Charlotte sated, this personal experience lies behind many of the characters and events as well as Agnes's feelings in the novel. As a first novel, it show an astonishing maturity and technical accomplishment since "Agnes Grey" is in many ways a very personal story. Mrs Brontë describes as vividly as possible the strong pressures that a governess' life involved at that time - the isolation, the frustrations, the insensitive treatment of employers and their families. Actually it transpires in this novel that middle-class households used to consider a governess as little more than a servant thus undervaluing her role as an educator. And the author's view of such households is sharply cynical: they are self-satisfied, vulgar, small-minded snobs who delight in social pretension. They are mercilessly depicted in their moral emptiness and Agnes actually suffers from moral isolation which becomes more and more oppressive and alienating, especially during her stay with the Murrays. In this family Agnes feel deprived from ordinary human kindness and warmth of affection so much so that she falls into depression because she feels that her moral identity is being destroyed, no longer confident in her "distinctions of right and wrong". A remarkable novel about a young woman and such issues as moral behaviour, moral responsibility and individual integrity 
 I followed the advice from this book, and sure enough got fairly quick results! It increased my Internet traffic, lead to more sales/profit, and my pre-existing customers love to leave comments on my new blog. Previously I had trouble getting ANY feedback from them.  Shel and Ted make it seem too simple, but it IS simple when you follow the advice in this book.  It also is a fun and easy read, even for a technophobe like me 
 I have purchaced this book just because i like french pastries and like to try myself to make those wonderful pastries that we see in the vitrine. And i did not regret that.Now I am going to purchace the full series.After  reading ,this book I can now prepare brioche,eclair,petit pain,cream cormet.Buy them I promise you will not regret at all.All my friend do not believe that i cook them myself 
 I have a B.A. in biology, and I can say now I have been duped by the evidence (or lack thereof) for Darwinian evolution. I knew all along that all the work with Drosophila was a lot of barking up the wrong tree, because all the variation that scientists have been able to create are all deleterious changes, creating individuals that would not survive in nature. But scientists talk about Darwinian evolution as if it was oviously correct and confirmed thousands of times through published research. Dr. Wells's book explains clearly and exhaustively, through the fossil record and through research on "molecular evolution," that neither Darwinism nor "neo-Darwinism" have anything approaching conclusive evidence. Meanwhile a new idea, "Intelligent Design," comes up to show statistical evidence that it's more rational that an intelligent designer came up with the complexity in nature, rather than natural selection acting on random mutations. The scientific community is so enraged that instead of exploring this new idea, they are reduced to ad-hominem attacks to make sure no one rocks the boat. It's as bad as the Inquisition's attacks on Galileo.  Biology teachers owe it to their students to read this book and qualify what they teach about evolution in our schools 
 "The trance state is actually the real perception of mankind. It is just that it has been consigned to oblivion by a grand-scale cover-up strategy."--Holger Kalweit, German psychologist and author of Shamans, Healers, and Medicine Men  A masterpiece of scholarship! Indeed I have found no other single text today that confirms my own musings on this point: The oldest and wisest are the shamans of every culture. Why? It is because as we healers of every tradition realize, "The psychotherapist listens, the shaman speaks!" In other words, the shaman has knowledge based upon the ability to see via the mind's eye in trance the aura and soul travel multi-dimensionally to correct the dysfunction at its source: the energy field. This skill separates the true medicine people from the charlatans in fact. So, when are schools, licensing agencies, and insurance companies going to start distinguishing between the two medics with a test focused on who can -- and cannot -- see into the invisible realms of spirit? I can't wait to watch the fireworks on that day that this legislation becomes a reality in our modern world ... can you?    Dr. Harper is author of Tranceformers: Shamans of the 21st Century.    
 This cd brought back the memories of the "real" Peter Pan and Capt Hook --Mary Martin & Cyril Ritchard.  The music is happy, makes you want to sing along and in general generates really good feeling 
 This encyclopedia is a leading resource written by leading philosophers and scholars.  It is indispensible for researchers and students who need to refer to a philosophical topic or a great thinker and their thought.  It is also good for the casual reader who may be interested in philosophy and wishes to learn more about the subject.  The encyclopedia is very comprehensive and covers all the main areas of philosophy as well as both Eastern and Western philosophy.  Jewish and Islamic and African Philosophies are also well represented.  There are many biographies of leading philosophers, as well as scientists, theologians, lawyers, writers and politicians who have covered philosophical questions.    The price puts this resource beyond the means of most individual buyers, but all good libraries should stock it.  
 The other reviews on here, at least most of them, are quite dumb. Firstly, if you can't remember names, what business have you reading Dostoevsky, seriously? Go read Dumas or something. Secondly, to the people who are complaining about it being too long, why? Dostoevsky was an excellent author, I enjoyed all parts of the book. The characters and their conversations take up most of the text of the book. If you don't like long, detailed books, I ask again, what business have you reading Dostoevsky 
 This is the perfect sequal to the first story. I loved it. It seemed to go pretty quickly. But I think that it will always be one of my favorites 
 This story of a football team illustrates a much more profound element of human psychology - how to handle success.  Whether success is a relationship, career, business, or any other endeavor, the lessons here are to be heeded or the result will invariably be the same.  To put this in context, the 1985 Chicago Bears football team is arguably the best ever assembled in the modern era.  While other teams may have had more success over time, or had 1 less loss, this team is widely regarded as the most dominating.  In addition to the on-the-field success, the team created media stars like Mike Ditka, Jim McMahan and "The Fridge", along with established all time greats like Walter Payton, Mike Singletary and Dan Hampton.  So what happened? How did it blow up so fast?  A classic tale of forgetting to continue what made you successful in the first place.    The players and the team became successful by playing harder, and using an almost desperate intensity to how they played the game from a play design perspective to personal and individual motivation.  At first this focus (the 46 defense, the frenetic play style) took the league by surprise and gave them a decided advantage, but like most of us with any kind of success, once it was achieved they forgot to keep changing to adapt to the world they created.  In addition, they succumbed to the temptation of starting to believe their own press, and became infatuated with their own greatness.  Once that happens, it slips away quickly.  The detail behind the strategy success and infighting that eroded the spirit of the team, are depicted clearly.  After reading this book, which is full of delicious insights and salacious comments amongst the team about each other, it is hard to find where to place the blame.  Everyone seemed so wrapped up in the media circus that they all seemed to drift away from the mission.  For the football fan, this is a great book, full of strategic detail and player reactions.  For the person who wants to better understand the dynamics of how to keep themselves or their organization from getting too full of themselves and their success, the lessons here are easy to see, though often difficult to avoid.  The book is written exceptionally well, in that it flows easily, is always interesting, follows a nice chronological progressions, and does what it intends - describe the amazing success and quick burn out of perhaps the greatest football team ever assembled. 
 This is Carl Rogers' classic and a must-read for everyone interested in getting real with themselves.  The critic who edited this version indicates very successfully that there are important parallels between Carl Rogers and Ralph Waldo Emerson. This makes Rogers' philosophy and psychotherapeutic approach a truly American one, one that places the individual in the supreme seat of ultimate authority over his/her own experience and existence. The main message that Rogers develops from many different angles is this one:  there is no beast in man, and therefore there is also no need to fear one's innermost thoughts, feelings, longings and desires.  "There is only man in man." This was surely a revolutionary message at the time, and  remains to be revolutionary to this day, as so many modern-day religionists cling to the idea of man's "innate badness."  Rogers most certainly debunks that destructive religious heritage in his work. This book is a pleasure to read.  It is written in very simple, yet precise language and goes down "like honey. 
 This book is an interesting analysis of the role of race and gender in mapping expeditions and the development of cartographic technologies. Highly recommended 
 For a book written by a Hollywood vet, this book barely touches Tinseltown.  Billy Crystal looks back at his youth through rose-colored glasses, and offers us a glimpse at his roots and how he grew to become a comedian.  The stories are like those your family tells at Thanksgiving, full of warmth and humor.  This isn't an in-depth biography, but it does provide an entertaining couple of hours of reading 
 Nuparu is SWEET! But, sadly, his skull does not glow in the dark. Nuparu has black/gray armor, a light up sword with a strobe effect, two claws, and a Zamor sphere launcher attached to his back. You must be careful with the zamor spheres, though, because they're easy to lose. Now I have Toa Matoro and Toa Nuparu! YOU HAVR TO BUY THIS TOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 The much discussed 'Art of the Trio' is very much in evidence in this superlative live recording, with the outstanding pianist Lynne Arriale demonstrating her considerable gifts in detaching and reassembling tunes in new, provocative and dynamic ways, ably assisted by longtime collaborator Steve Davis on drums (or 'sounds'), and Jay Anderson's looming and tuneful bass. The trio manage to outMonk even the great Monk on the sombre 'Evidence', and other standout tracks like 'Estate','An affair to Remember' and the clipping Arriale original 'Calypso' are perfectly full of wonder. This is a timely reminder of one of the best evolving jazz piano trios around. As the album opens, one is naturally reminded of another piano trio night at Montreux, in 1968, and the Arriale trio can justifiably live in that august company. Recorded on July 4th 1999, this was truly an Independent's Day 
 There is a song that is not included on the CD, which is first used in the Hells Angels War Scene.  It is also used at the beginning of the XF-11 Test Flight Scene before the plane crash. It is:  Composer: J.S. Bach Song: Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, BWV 565  The part in the movie is actually the Fugue portion of the piece.  There is good and accurate version of it on the album Bach Greatest Hits which is sold on amazon.com at:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000003F5A/qid=1141862907/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-9310035-0679004?s=music&v=glance&n=5174  Enjoy 
 A very enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours. This is not a back handed compliment in any way but my 5 year old was glued to the screen and at his age he's not supposed to understand all the nuances of a movie, but this movie is so simple and direct that he had no problem following it, way past his bedtime too.  It's a hark back to the times when good guys were good guys and bad guys were bad guys and you definitely tell who was who (no silly de rigeur twists). An over the top acting job for Wolfy but the character asks for no other. Nice to see Lee Majors, as a stuntman no less, no doubt many will miss the significance of that. And the wunderful(sic) Donald Faison before Scrubs.   Overall, very enjoyable for the younger and older viewers. (You see, I don't know who Amanda Byrnes and Frankie Munoz are. 
 Lovely photos of a very knowledgeable artist's embroidery techniques.  Inspiration galore.  Glad to add this book to my library 
 If you are interested in value investing.  This book is for you.  I can't help reading it over and over again in order to dig more information from the book.  Invaluable and easy to understand.  Read it and use it 
 If anyone is a fan of Collective Soul, this is a MUST HAVE!! 'Home' combines a blend of orchestral music with classic Collective Soul hits that creates a powerful sense of awe. The orchestra provides a natural flow throughout the concert that leaves the listener begging for more. Favorites include: December, Compliment, Run, Pretty Donna, and Crown. 
 Screenwriting for Dummies is a very helpfull book. It provides good details with available refrences for its examples. The literature is simple allowing for easy comprehenision. I would recomend this book for the simple fact that it is an easy read and one only has to read the sections that are of interest to him/her 
 Having worn out my original copy, purchased almost 40 year ago, the new edition includes much new material presented in a clear and understandable format as well as numerous well chosen problems and examples.  An essential reference to all those interested in transport phenomena 
 I ran into Secrets of Consulting, while looking for practical advise on getting my foot in the door to consulting world.  The book is truly wonderful.  It is not a step-by-step, "how-to", self-help type, although it offers plenty of practical advise on setting up and running your business.  It does more than that, offering advice we could all use in our daily lives.  It is a light and captivating read, written in a humorous, down-to-earth tone that will keep you turning the pages.  A must have 
 Always appreciate reading the other reviews from Mailer's right-wing detractors: great laugh, it really is, talking about ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WRITING (mentioning unsavoury details about his private life - how noble and intelligent, as befits this pondlife trash). Anyway, the concept of this novel is a wonderful one, turning the history as novel and novel as history themes on their head. There are some great anecdotes here, with Mailer (writing what he knows, as all good writers do) uncompromisingly and combatively taking on the might of authority and Pentagon power. Memorable incidents include his being semi-drunk on stage at Washington's Ambassador theatre comparing himself to Lyndon B. Johnson's "dwarf altar-ego." The march itself, the subsequent arrest and his riding with the 'Armies of the Night' along America's broad, epic roads - the mass of people opposed to the War. Mailer's polemic is similarly spot-on - his prediction that "the biggest danger to Communism was Communism itself" is borne out by historical fact. This was predicted in 1967 - the USSR was never defeated militarily. Its collapse was due to the financial flws inherent in the system's structure - it could not economically sustain itself. It was, contrary to certain people, of little threat and was never defeated militarily. Mailer's prediction is exact, unfortunately not heeded by the denizens of his country's own political landscape. Another thing is that Mailer makes constant references to his fondness for America and its history. Always accused - like all great American artists - of despising the US, you criticise aspects of the country in order to prevent its abuse and perversion. This is because he loves the country, not because he hates it 
 This moody drama piece is for the most part very good.  Mickey Rourke is excellent in the title role; a disfigured criminal who gets a shot at redemption but ultimately chooses revenge.  Well directed by Walter Hill with a good music score by Ry Cooder.  All the cast do a good job, the story is tight and fast paced and some good action sequences to boot.    Pity about the DVD, it's fullscreen and this deserves to be in glorious widescreen 
 If you like eccentric, crazy characters, and good mystery, this is a great book 
 This is an excellent Frisell disc, highly recommended. It is garnered from live performances both on the East coast and West coast. Some of the band members are the same but others are different. Overall there is great continuity in the music. Frisell plays it very cool and the music is relaxing and fun to listen to. The mix is great, and it stands repeated listenings well. I think this is one of Bill's best. It is more mainstream jazz, compared to some of Frisell's other more experimental outings. So buy with no worries if you're not into some of the strangeness 
 Bought it for my grandaughter (16 months) and she loves it.  Can't quite master the stuff it and close the lid technique or the crank, but then it is a great toy for both adult & child and the challenge keeps her entertained for hours. Carry's it around all the time.  Sits on it while closed so it is quite strong and it is exactly what your would hope to find in a "Jack-In-The Box" 
 Robert Thurman is passionate about tibet and buddhism and it shows.  He is easy to listen to, articulate and intelligent.  He has so much information in his head and I wish he had fleshed out his myriad of diatribes.  He often veers off telling a great side story and then stops himself to stay on point.  It's a big tease as I would like to hear the rest of the story! (most likely he was pressed for time as this was a live lecture) I hope he puts together a more in depth dvd series such as a set of 12 or 24 (hehe) but in the mean time this set is definitely worth owning 
 I first checked out this book when I was taking the plunge into vegetarianism. I found the recipes tasty and easy. The only problem I had was I do not own a microwave, so I had to adjust and do things on the stove. Now, nnearly four years into my meat-free diet, I find myself living in a cramped studio with the tinest kitchen I've ever seen (my fridge isn't even in the kitchen it is so small). So, I brought "The Starving Students' Vegetarian Cookbook" off of the bookshelf and back into my kitchen. The recipes are fast, easy, and tasty-and don't take up a lot of space to prepare. 
 I found this book extremely helpful and don't feel the criticisms of the review below warranted. Ed makes learning fun 
 As with all TFF products, this is exceptional. If you're a fan, you have most of the songs on other CDs, your MP3 and anywhere else you can get them. However, this is worth the price of admission just for "Floating Down the River," a boppy, Beatles-inspired song that will get you humming along from the first hearing. GREAT song that should have been released as a single. 
 What the Lady Wants was a great quick read with lots of mystery, romance and humor.  I couldn't put the book down.  The book had great characters and a plot, which these days is harder to find.  Read it and laugh out loud 
 Some great early hits and of course a fine cd, afterall it is the Beatle 
 Everything I could say about this edition has already been said. Well, almost everything. Personally, I don't consider it a must have. When I first heard that a 4 disc Special Edition was coming I had high hopes that maybe it would include "The Scarlett O'Hara War", which I'd love to have on DVD. However, since this is not the case I'll stick to what I already have 
 As a Wiccan mother, I think the chapter by Helen Berger could have gone into more depth and perhaps been somewhat more critical. There are questions that were raised and briefly touched upon that should have been given more thought and questions that could have been raised that were not.  Overall, however, I found the book interesting and useful 
 Four years on and already time for a greatest hits disc? If Britney Spears could pull it off after only 40 months, then Girls Aloud's thirteen top 10 singles certainly qualify them for such an offering. Yes, the hype every music magazine in Britain has been making is true- the tracks this group puts out are insane. Name one other pop act who had the audacity to mesh three songs into one and proclaim "you can't mistake my biology" as if we were stupid all along to disagree? Or, for that matter, name their comeback single "Something Kinda Oooh"? The risks taken by Girls Aloud and their production-team extraordinaire, Xenomania, are ones not common among the lazy bits of top 40. To see such livelihood and originality from a band created by reality television is an irony if we ever heard one. Simply put, they're the finest mainstream singles act of this decade and the soldiers of futuristic pop. Ballads withstanding, every one of these hits sparkles with a ferocity and sauciness that are impossible to not fall in love with. Anyone who doesn't snap their fingers to the billyrockin' "Love Machine" or strike a pose to the positively sexy electro romp "The Show" is more likely dead, and to not gawk at the genius of "Biology" is a perfect insult. Even the much-maligned "Long Hot Summer" is destined for the pop hall of fame. The music press has proclaimed for the past three to four years now that pop is dead, but with Girls Aloud leading the pack, not only would it be alive and kicking, it would be better than it ever was. And we can overlook the limp cover of "I Think We're Alone Now" (particularly unnecessary) if it meant skipping over to something like "Sound Of the Undeground". Ready for a crazy night out, stilletos and all? You've just got the perfect soundtrack. 
 Red Garters is a wonderfully imaginative and comic rethinking of the western with great songs. The costumes and sets are a surreal dream and the script still works. I loved it when I saw it first-run in 1954 and keep waiting for it to be rediscovered. RG should receive the recognition it deserves. I was delighted to find it available on VHS; it holds up under repeated viewings. For an extraordinary experience -- sandwich Red Garters between two episodes of HBO's Deadwood. Wowser! By the way, next time you see Hitchcock's Rear Window, pay special attention to the soundtrack; you will recognize a jazzed-up version of the Red Dog Saloon song playing in the background. This will be in one of the most suspenseful moments 
 My 8 month-old loves it. He lights up at the babies faces (even when they're not smiling in the photos). I would have thought it was a waste of money had I not read another woman's similar review and I now know what she was talking about 
 This CD is an excellent mix of her greatest song (17 in all!).  It combines her very best music on one CD 
 i watched one episode while my mom was in the room and it was kind of awkward. i was glad she fell asleep about ten minutes in. i watched 'em all with rapt attention, boy are they cool
